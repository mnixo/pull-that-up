four three two one and we're live hello Dennis hi Joe great to be here as always it's great to be here so tell me about this these these cards you gave me and with what this is all about okay well this is an interesting project this was about the RV Heraclitus which is a which was associated with the Institute for eco technics which is try to keep this yeah of course to your face okay further associated with you know how do I explain it it was actually a theater company called the theater of all possibilities but the Institute for eco technics was started in the early 70s and they built a ship this this Chinese junk essentially with a feral concrete hull and my connection was they have cruise cruise the world essentially since 1973 looking into different things relevant to global ecology they've done sampling in the Antarctic and in 1981 they decided to go to the Amazon and I was doing my graduate work in Iquitos at that time so that was my connection with the Institute of eco technics and you know at the time I thought these people are nuts I mean they were kind of nuts and they were very naive about what they were doing as far as doing ethnobotanical work not that I wasn't naive about it at the time but I had a better handle on it than they do anyway that was the original connection and the same group years after I had more or less you know kind of severed I didn't really sever my relationship but I kind of distanced myself from them but then that same group went on in the 80s to build biosphere 2 you've probably heard of they had financing for biosphere 2 so they've gone to a whole other level of ambition and and you know madness but and biosphere 2 went off to explain that to people who don't know what we're talking about here - was the idea of building a terrestrial environment that was completely shut off from everything and that was self-sustaining and it was a huge complex it was a big series of domes really each dome replicated some earthly biome like the desert the rainforest the ocean and so on and the idea was that it was a it was a dry run for building a Mars colony you know or some planetary colony and the idea was Mars and they put people into this environment for like two years at a time just see if they could make it work if they could really have a balanced ecosystem well as it turned out it didn't work so well but they learned a great deal from this and they also got a lot of adverse publicity because I think the I think the science establishment in a way became kind of jealous and you know like these people they don't know anything about what they're doing they got six hundred million dollars to build this what the hell so there I got a lot of criticism but the fact is a lot of good science came out of this and they're still going and the interesting thing is they've had their fingers in many pies you know they have a gallery in a hotel in London called the octo October gallery I only stay there if I'm in London they have a publishing company the synergetic press based in Santa Fe that's who published this book some way so it's kind of like 30 years later what goes around comes around in the book is ethno pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs and it's from it's labeled from 1967 to 2017 right and the and the story behind this is just to but just to complete the Heraclitus story okay a minute so the Heraclitus has been plying the ocean more or less continuously since 1973 and they are now renovating the ship because you know it needs it it needs a new hole and all that so they're trying to raise funds obviously for that but it's just a very interesting story about people that are passionate about the ecology about the earth and about science don't know a whole lot about any of it but their passion drove them forward and and their passion particularly the founder a guy named John Allen who's now I think he's in this ad is in his 80s but he was the visionary behind it and without knowing a whole lot they just went ahead and did it you know so in that spirit you have to hand it to them and they have they've done incredible things over that period of time and so it's a it's a great story and it's worth attention and you know it's up to you I mean it's cup to you if you want to bring her on or somebody but it's it's it sounds fascinating really romantic you know this is science in in the true spirit of discovery you know and what are they trying by amateurs right that isn't fascinating yeah were they trying to do we're kind of research they're trying to do in the ocean all kinds of things they've been sampling coral reefs they've been sampling looking at you know global warming and both the Arctic and the Antarctic they of course in 81 they wanted to do ethnobotany in the Amazon and and they had Scholl T's on their board of directors and the director of the expedition was Wade Davis and I was doing my graduate work at that time and we knew they were coming so as a result of that I was able to join the expedition and Weyden I at the time he was selected by them as the chief science officer and when he by the time I got there he was getting a little disillusioned with them you know and I guess you could say the personal dynamic was kind of strange and like if you read my book the Brotherhood of the screaming abyss there's a couple of chapter there's a chapter on this but over time even Wade changed his mind and and I I now get the larger picture of what they were trying to do and you know it's it's it's a real story I mean these people didn't recognize boundaries that's the thing and they because they were theater people they actually understood which I didn't at the time that what they were doing and their whole effort was really a performance you know on a global level they did all these things kind of realizing that this was the theater of all possibilities and they had a theater in Austin Texas by that name so I could it's a wild story sounds like a freaky crew it's a freaky crew and that was the point well some of the people that were on that 1981 expedition are now I mean they're still associated with it so it has some longevity others have passed on others have left in you know disgust or or they you know they had enough but I was able to reconnect with people that run you know they have this ranch in Santa Fe called the synergy ax ranch and one of the things that's based there is this press the synergetic press so when I was doing this project with the book I was casting around for who's going to publish this after we do it and they stepped up and they publish a lot of psychedelic stuff they have a book called the mystic chemist about Albert Hofmann they republished the ayahuasca reader which originally Eduardo Luna and Steven white had published well they expanded that and they published that as a very beautiful you know redo essentially a second edition very nice work then Don Lattin who's not that well-known but he's written several books about the history of psychedelics and the people involved and he wrote a book that they published called changing our minds ironically about the same time Michael Pollan brought his book out so Michael Pollan being who he is got all the attention Don's got very little still a good book you know so they're good people I've decided that some of my initial judgments not knowing the people and when I just sort of walked into their reality in Iquitos when I got there you know which they never bothered to to explain it's like you know they never said oh well you know we're acting funny because we do things differently than no you know and I was like what well I'm sure they evolved too they have they have evolved and they learn a lot through this biosphere to you know project which was a real lesson to everybody but anyway so because they still existed and really because of the of the resurrection of the ayahuasca reader that had been my recent contact with them so when I decided to do this book I thought they're a good candidate to publish this book and they they totally got it they took it on they've done an amazing job and this book or these this set as you know you know the genesis of it because you had a lot to do with that when we were when I was here last year you know in I mean the backstory is in 1967 the US government the National Institute of Mental Health of all people put together a conference in San Francisco in 67 called the Ã«the no pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs and nobody noticed it was a private conference it was not open to the public the only thing the public ever got out of it was the symposium proceedings which is the first book there and I was very heavily influenced by that book because somehow or other it came into my hands at age 17 you know bored teenager living in Paoli in Colorado wishing that I was with my brother in Berkeley where all the action was at the time and I'm like what is this book you know so I totally I devoured it and about the same time I discovered the teachings of Don Juan which my my brother gave to me for my 18th birthday and although much in there is probably fiction those two books gave me complementary perspective the teachings of Don Juan was the ethnographic lands through which you could use look at the use of psychedelics and and which I you know what kind of filled in those spaces then this book came out and it was like and I knew who shultiess was I knew who a few of these people were at the time shawl tease and shulgin and Andrew while were actually on the original faculty and so when the book fell into my hands at age 17 I was very excited and I read the whole thing and and this is what really helped me focus my career it made me aware that maybe I could make a career out of Vestal pharmacology you know and and in my very naive seventeen-year-old teenage brain I thought wow man I can get paid to get stoned it was in part that but you know there is more to it but that's what led me to to pursue that career and so this book has always loomed large in my sort of pantheon originally they were supposed to be follow-up conferences for this for the government to have every 10 years well the war on drugs Scotch Dahl that they became embarrassed that they had anything to do with a conference like this what was the goal of the conference is that clear of the original comments oh for people to kind of report on their work and sort of mark the state-of-the-art in psycho ethno pharmacology at the time so the first book was really where things like the snuffs and ayahuasca and you know and other things that we don't think of really as psychedelics like cava nominated muscaria when you're saying the schnapps do you mean like some of the more psychedelics not psychedelics what is it called a Kouhei that one that's an orally active form that but yeah Verona and then Emmett and I'm Sarah which is the what are they called yopo I think they're these are so easily they stuff them up their nose is that the deal or that's the deal yeah yeah and this is the first book the sixty-seven book was the first one where you know there was a collection of the leading experts at the time most of whom you've never heard of but there were there were iconic people like Scholl T's Andrew wild Shogun another interesting fellow many interesting people one of the most interesting in the first conference was a gentleman named Steven Zara a Hungarian chemist and psychiatrist and pharmacologist and he originally worked in Budapest and and eventually he moved to the States and became pretty high up in the National Institutes of Health he was the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the late 50s but the interesting thing is before that he was just a researcher and at a hospital in in Budapest he applied to Sandoz to get LSD he wanted to do research with LSD they refused to give it to him because he was behind the Iron Curtain so he so he synthesized DMT being a chemist and he had to determine if it was actually a psychedelic so in the grand tradition he did that by self injecting himself you know so he's a true pioneer and I invited him to the conference so he's the first person to definitively show that DMT was a psychedelic he's now 95 he's in great shape I invited him to the conference but he said well I'm 95 I don't go anywhere anymore but he submitted a very nice of video introduction to it and the other interesting thing that he did after the 67 conference he he he was thinking what's going on and what is it with the hippies of all the psychedelics and and so his supervisor said well Steve why don't you go over to Haight Ashbury and hang out for a while so he did and he submitted a paper called the scientist among the hippies and they wouldn't let him publish they said you can't publish this so it's sat in his drawer for 50 years when this book came along he said I have something I'll submit here I don't care if they you know it's it doesn't matter anymore so one of the papers in this second volume is his original 67 paper oh and then so the second volume is kind of you know because the government didn't step up to the plate like they said they would there was no follow-up conferences and and I for a long time I wanted to do a follow-up conference I wanted to do it on the 30th anniversary 97 never happened time passes so 2017 was the 50th anniversary it all fell together oh wow you know I found a venue in the UK a beautiful country house that was called tearing hem hall that was run by one of our friends who shares you know our perspective he made that available we put the word out we got support to produce the conference so we brought about 16 people you know - tearing ham and England spent three days presenting and those videos are all up on the web I'll send you the link that's open access the other thing that we couldn't do in 67 that we did in you know 2017 there was no Facebook live-streaming well all our videos were Facebook live streams we have 60,000 people watching these lectures at some points you know I mean so that's amazing that's and that created excitement and then we basically paid for the book by pre-selling reselling it and a lot of people stepped up and ordered a lot of people were very patient because I was you know I was I thought oh this will be out by Christmas right well no it's a big project so it took six months longer than I thought but now it's out there and hopefully it'll be a a landmark in the field like the first one was and and what we wanted to do to honor the first one was reprint the first one Aloha the second one so that's why it's two books we did a high resolution scam of the original book and reprinted that one doesn't make you think like imagine if Nixon wasn't president back then what could have been done like what if they didn't have that sweeping 1970 psychedelic act where they made everything illegal like what if they continued with this stuff I could who knows where we would be today we yeah we could ask that question about a lot of things what if that didn't happen like the the psychedelic research that's happening now that's it's taken 40 years TN back to it and basically the psychedelic research is is a lot of the same thing was going back going on back in the even late 50s and 60s what's going on now is they're repeating a lot of that mm-hmm but with more rigorous experimental design with with better controls and all that but it's the same stuff you know which is wonderful I mean I'm I'm all for it to see this work done I also have you know plenty to say about the limitations of that strictly clinical you know sort of medical approach I mean I think you know organizations like maps and hefter have to work within the constraints of what's possible but I think in some ways they you know they force themselves to they're forced to put on blinders in a certain way - what else is possible you know for example the way that ayahuasca has been sort of marginalized and there is research going on about it but there's nothing to prove in the States and I think it's important to pursue that work but because you can't synthesize ayahuasca like you can psilocybin or MDMA or these things that are there clinical trials it's much more difficult to study within the constraints of a phase one you know clinical trial but in fact ayahuasca is touching I think far more lives than say well I can't say about mushrooms because mushrooms are a lot out there but you know the potential the impact that it's having on society is much greater because people are rediscovering this and people are I think reaching out for they're reaching out for anything that that will work you know as a society we are spiritually bereft and I think there's a pervasive sense of despair and a feeling of what would you call it spiritual impoverishment or something then we see that all of our institutions are becoming you know we're seeing behind the curtain and realizing that they're they're empty you know they don't really have anything to offer on the spiritual level especially religions people are rejecting religions as the sort of you know shell game that it is empty promises that don't deliver and I think that's a lot of why people are reaching out for these plant medicines you know and going to South America or to have ayahuasca or finding them in their own community because people crave spiritually meaningful experiences and and our culture needs it more than ever well the thing about psychedelics that what you just said is so important that they deliver they deliver if you are skeptical about religion you know there's some people that get a lot out of religion that's fine but if you're skeptical about it it's not going to fulfill your promises it's not it's not going to it's not going to give you anything that you can say oh my god this is irrefutable psychedelic experiences are pretty irrefutable that something's happening that's Titanic it's just right it's so immense and bizarre and beyond the normal that it's hard to just dismiss it and the only people that really do dismiss it are the people that have an experience did exactly exactly you know I mean I sometimes say psychedelics are the antidote to faith you know you don't need faith mmm to take a psychedelic what you need is courage you know religions offer faith which is basically saying here's a list of things that you need to believe without question and if that's your inclination fine but most of us are more skeptical we need something you know tangible something more tangible so you know I think faith is you know I mean that's how religions entice you to believe but I think that in a way it's deceptive why do you have to believe when you can in that intensely personal encounter between you and a plant teacher or you in a plant Moloch and I am a molecule you can experience for yourself you don't need faith you can say I know that this mm exists and the the realms that it opens up for you are real because I've experienced it and you know I think faith I think that we in a way you know at least the Abrahamic religions Christianity and Judaism and Islam to a certain extent have poisoned the Western mind you know and and encouraged our separation from nature and basically propagated this idea that we're separated from nature and we own it and we we have every right to dominate it and we're seeing the consequences of that you know we have to rediscover this indigenous perspective that we are part of nature we're properly improperly frame we should be symbiotic with nature it's all about symbiosis it's all about collaborating with the global community of species to advance consciousness not just of our species but of the whole community of sentient species this is what the psychedelics can do and I think this is what the psychedelics are desperately reaching out to our species and anybody who watches my podcast or listens to me is this is my rap wake up you monkeys you're wrecking this place it's not simple you're wrecking this place and that's because you have to read the relationship to nature realize that number one you monkeys aren't running things the plants are running things basically because they're sustaining life on Earth other things are you know that's part of it and then once you wake up to the fact that you know we're we're in a participatory collaborative role with the community of species then we have to change a whole lot of things that we're are not doing right now because we're certainly not you know developing sustainable ways to live on a global scale and and we're seeing the consequences of this now what's dis mean besides the fact that it's happening is that there is so much denial so much refusal to recognize this on the part of the people that supposedly are are running the show you know and they're they're willfully ignorant and and this is a problem so you know I think a lot of people will agree with me a lot of people who listen to this show will agree with me when I say I've pretty much given up on politics politics seems to me irrevocably broken many other institutions are dysfunctional if not broken I mean science is corrupt in government is corrupt its corporate the in corporatism is you know these are all flawed systems because they're not they don't have a base of compassion and recognition of the interrelatedness of all things and psychedelics are a catalyst for waking up and so once people have that experience then their perspective has changed and if they're influential they can go out and make change on a global scale I think it's so important that Michael Pollan put out that book because the guy who's a mainstream straight-laced guy who's written about architecture and agriculture and all these different things or people like really respect his opinions in his world yeah this guy has not just written this book but has also gone out on a limb and had a bunch of different psychedelic experiences in controlled settings right and talks about them and the profound impact that it had on his at one point skeptical mind he was very skeptical about what what these things were yeah though I love Michael Pollan I have for a long time I'm sorry okay I don't want any angry yes no I I've I've loved his work for a long time and I'm really delighted that he's come out and written about this there are some things about his book I have to say that I'm a little disappointed but then I also have to say I'm only about a little over halfway through it well so far he hasn't really emphasized or said much about he sort of writes it from the perspective that all of this started with the discovery of LSD in 1943 and then that was the psychedelic arrow there their indigenous traditions thousands of years old yeah she hasn't really talked about those things well he knows they exist did he talk to you at all he did not that's ridiculous yeah I was also of course extremely jealous angry I'm upset that he didn't talk to me I mean what the hell you know but you've been banging at the bushes for 60 years now yeah well come on man seriously I'm not sure why he did that if that was a conscious decision but I'm kind of disappointed because I think I have a perspective that that you know I have some things to say yeah that so far haven't been said in this book and and things that Michael Pollan would would completely relate to you know he's the one that brought up the idea that you know with respect to like plant domestication and our relationship with our food plants you know we think we're growing we're cultivating plants actually plants are cultivating us you know this is plants program for world domination run the same is true of all these teacher plants this is why they're out there you know on the global stage now and he didn't maybe he will get to it I mean I'm only mildly jealous I wish he had talked to me on the other hand what he has written is going to be important it's going to be influential I mean this will be influential to a small number of people pollens book is going to bring it to the attention of millions it's going to open people's eyes you know and refresh the way people view this whole subject I think when you when you look at when you're talking about ancient cultures and the use of psychedelics going back thousands and thousands of years and then this dip somewhere around 1970 where it almost seems to have gotten down to a very low hum but now the drums are beating again know what's coming by now it's coming back you know I'm really fascinated and excited by that because I think this is me too I don't think it's the answer to everything but I think it's the glue I think it's the there's there's a thing about the psychedelic experience that forces you to recognize that you have these pre-established ideas of what things are and that you've kind of put them in these boxes and you've sort of pushed it away and like well I've defined what a city is and I'm just gonna put that over there now I know what that is I'm not gonna think that about that anymore I'm fine what a road is I've defined me I remember after one of my first DMT experiences just sitting around looking at roads differently yeah like I was I was on a road I was like this is the craziest shit ever week we've decided that it's normal to lay this hard surface down on the ground so we could roll these fire-breathing he's metal yeah it's crazy isn't it but it was before that it was just a rote it was always a road but after that it became this weird symptom of what we're doing by erecting these massive structures and cities and that you know we need this this this ground in order for us to use these vehicles on and but in the in the process of doing that we've sort of marred the landscape with it everywhere yeah well psychedelics do give us the the chance to rethink a lot of things you know I think we've talked before about Simon Powell's work he wrote about he writes about psilocybin wrote a psilocybin solution and that was this first book and I think his latest is the magic mushroom Explorer but something in his work really struck me which is he pointed out that you have to look that psychedelics in some sense are their scientific instruments they give you an opportunity to look at phenomena in a way that you've never looked at them before because they have this because they take you out of your reference frame you know or they bring the background forward or there's different ways to describe it and pollen actually describes it well when he talks about this disruption of the default mode network it enables you to see patterns in nature that you're programmed not to see you know a lot of what our brain does this whole reducing valve idea is it filters many things out it lets in just enough of the external world that you can relate it to prior experiences what you think you know and you construct this artificial model of reality and that's that that's what you inhabit and I've said this many times may be worse than maybe better but I talked about how you know we're living in a hallucination essentially that's constructed by our brains and in order to just deal with all the information that is available it has to really restrict it it has to put a choke on it so that what does get in can make sense that's fine for ordinary consciousness but you are prone to overlook things about reality that are important and psychedelics temporarily give you an opportunity to lower those lower those mechanisms that default network or sometimes called neural gating if you're in a safe place where you don't have to worry about your your safety you know there is no saber-toothed tiger we're going to come get you you know and so you don't have to worry about your safety then you can just relax into it and you can appreciate things that are always there it's not that they're not there these are not things you imagine they're just things that you never notice because you're programmed not to so tremendous learning tools and many many scientists have said you know their insights have come from their psychedelic experience from Steve Jobs to Crick to Kary Mullis some of these folks admitted of others deny it but it's true you know so there are many many things we can learn from psychedelics that's only one of them but from a scientist perspective that's an important one you know one of the things I want to do is create a system a situation where you can bring specialists together in different discs in in a discipline say mathematics or quantum physics or astronomy or you know even whatever art and have these collective sessions together and then let people share their insight essentially creative solvent problem-solving or creative sessions and you know and that's that that's the other thing I think we're looking for you know we need to develop a context in which these things can happen and that's one of the you know that's one of the restrictions of the strictly clinical approach that I chafe against you know because they have to be you know you have to have a problem it has to be to treat something depression or PTSD or whatever but we really need to use you know that's not the only thing psychedelics are good for sure they can help people with mental problems and in our society who doesn't have mental problems you know as a society were wounded but it goes beyond that they are learning tools and teaching tools and you know what you you you begin to see some of this in the in the work that Roland Griffith is doing you know he's been able to get approval for people to take psilocybin for spiritual development which is not exactly an illness for actual spiritual insight so that is approved to do this he's approved to do it and who who approved this and how is it the FDA he's he's got a clinical study going on right now where he's recruiting religious professionals people who are pastors priests rabbis Imams other types of religious professionals and putting them through his protocol yes that's having a tremendous impact on the way they view their profession and the way they be religion that's fantastic yeah it really is a shame that we we need an illness to treat ya before you allow someone to have this potentially mind expanding experience but it's it's almost like not allowing people to take vitamins unless they're really sick yeah exactly and like Bob Jesse says very eloquently we need to find contexts in which we can use psychedelics for the betterment of the well you know for the improvement um well yeah and you can't do it right now under the current regulatory restrictions now I think it's improved I think it gradually will improve but this sort of ties into you know what I'm trying to do now now that I've got this book off my plate I mean this is kind of a kind of a you know bucket list item something I've wanted to do for a long time and now it's done now I have to help help sell it but that won't be too much of a problem I think it's a beautiful book especially after your talk after our show it'll probably we only published a thousand copies of oh it's gone out it's a collector's edition and that was on purpose we can always print more but it really is beautifully done you know it is it is a beautiful book on every level and and the people that contributed to this to the second volume I didn't want all the same people that come to all always come to these conferences and always say the same things hmm so some of the people in there are not that well-known you know but they're known they were known to me and I felt that they had important things to say so you know some of them are known within the community and and others are pretty obscure but they you know there's always this you know this this like you know this passionate amateur type person who maybe they don't have credentials but they have incredible knowledge up in their head and they're they're completely obsessed with this stuff and there's a few of those people in there too so it's really really really it was really satisfying to be able to do it and make it worth people's peoples you know time I was able to pay for well me and my supporters a lot of it came through the Institute of eco techniques actually that turned out to be a good nonprofit channel through which we could get donations grants essentially we didn't want it to go through Hefner because it might look like a conflict of interest silly notion but but you know because of that we were able to pull this off we produced the book we've and gave everybody a modest honorarium so that's the way conferences are supposed to be but what's happening for me now and actually predates this and has been for a long time is you know I've been doing a lot of work in Peru for really I've been hosting retreats for ayahuasca since about 2012 and that's been very gratifying work I've seen transformations and people I see what a difference it makes to create the right environment and get people able to come and in a safe place and my whole approach and and the people I work with there are whole approaches we're not here to tell you what's supposed to happen we're here to create an optimum condition and you work it out this is a this is a dialogue between you and the plant teacher you know it's not the shaman the shaman if it's a good he was a good shaman facilitates that process but does not try to control it he's there for support he or she is there for support what really happens is the interaction between I mean the the the medicines are the real teachers and we're here to facilitate that and also to tell people if they need help integrating it or figuring it out that's fine but that's different than saying well this means that and you're supposed to think this about it you're supposed to think about whatever you want you know I mean you're supposed to learn to use your own mind to think for yourself so the extension of this is that I'm in the process of I guess manifesting this idea and what I'm what I'm working on now is I want to create an academy in the Sacred Valley which is academy of natural philosophy and and so i have a name for it because a lot of people have told me that you know your name has got to be in in this and i'm a kind of a self effacing guy but i recognize that I have a certain iconic recognition so okay if that's what it takes I'll do it so what we're gonna call it is the McKenna Academy for natural philosophy and by Academy you're saying you have a physical structure we will have a physical structure yeah and maybe more than one but we have identified an initial place that will be the physical location for it and it's a kind of school it's kind of it is in fact the first psychedelic University if you will sense a Lucius was sacked and burned by the Goths in 396 AD it's the first psychedelic University in the Western tradition since then so you're gonna have structured courses you're going to have degrees all of that we're gonna have courses we're gonna have it's going to be much more than a retreat center we're going to have retreats we're going to have therapeutic programs for people to get treatment and and programs for people to you know learn to use psychedelics for therapists to learn to use them but that is not the whole program the idea we're going to have conferences global impact conferences along the model of this this is this this conference was what made me realize this as possible we're going to have impactful conferences that will really have a global reach and through you know webinars went through the web we can search air this with thousands of people and it will be a place it it will be a place for you know the the second part of the of the title is so it's the mechanic Academy of Natural Philosophy what's natural philosophy natural philosophy is what science used to be called before it became corrupted before it became preoccupied with quantitation before it became reductionist all of the things that have constricted the scope of science this is going to be a more open thing that doesn't depend on corporate funding and that sort of thing where first of all we recognize that scientific knowledge is valuable and we embrace that but we also recognize that it has inherent limitations just by the nature of the beast it has an inherent human limitations and certain things are difficult to you know to investigate within that rigid framework and but there were that doesn't mean they're not worthy of investigation you know you know in psychedelic experiences as many other things I paranormal you know all of these things that people you know stigmatize as as woowoo and crazy you know and I am we're not gonna the idea is to bring rigor to these things to say yes there are a lot of phenomena that we don't understand it's what my are normal phenomena fascinates you well you name it I mean UFOs there's a good example you know nobody really knows what's going on with UFOs all we know is that the people have these experiences and what are they what are those experiences are they extraterrestrial encounters we don't know a lot of them don't really fit that mold are they hallucinations or altered states or is there really something you know in the continuum that we you know that only manifests under certain circumstances and and the idea is that you know science especially in this era tends to transform itself into dogma and then it becomes dismissive of aspects of the world that are worthy of studying but they don't fit into the scientific pattern and so we dismissed them I mean a good example of this is Graham Hancock's work for example that he talks about and many other people mainstream archeology is not open to this idea they're becoming more open to it by force they have to because more and more evidence is showing but look look at how long it's taken him to you know knocking on the doors beating these people over the head practically that look at this evidence it's very nice though to see him finally get it it is well it is far from over but he's definitely gaining grounds definitely gaining apparently tapi yeah and can you imagine how that would change our view of humanity or evolution this whole thing so archeology is a good good example psychedelics are another good example it's opening up but four years after the initial excitement about psychedelics and the 50s and 60s the whole thing was suppressed for forty years Michael Pollan talks about this what we're doing now is rediscovering you were a psychiatrist in training in the 80s or the 70s or the 80s you wanted to talk about psychedelics that was the end of your career you could not even bring this up you know and and who knows so it's one of these situations where it's kind of stunning when it is about the fact that in the 60s it probably was possible it was before it was made completely illegal it was something to discuss and then this conference was performed by the government in 1967 right right yeah and then the laws change and laws about these sorts of things should never be made by politicians because they always have you know a different agenda and they're not qualified to make these kinds of laws and they're largely you know idiots or the ones that really control you know power they're not informed about psychedelics psychedelics were blanket prohibited all at once pretty much and it was the focus was all on LSD all these other things got swept up into this hysteria essentially this hysteria that psychedelics were gonna change the youth and change society and you know what they were right they were absolutely right they were not stupid in that sense you know it did bring out these changes but now we're past that so science is again slowly opening up you know to two psychedelics and I think that's a good thing I think people were appreciative of it now that we know that we have gone through that dip where it was outlawed and stigmatized and people were never talking about like you know just a few years ago I mean I want to say early 2000s you talk about mushrooms or any sort of psychedelics and people would look at you like you were crazy well Joe I mean to Terrance's credit he was one who continued to talk about it all through the 70s the 80s and 90s I mean and I gave him tremendous credit for that because he was dismissed and he was out there he was a pioneer yeah and I think he really had a lot to do with keeping this conversation alive that along with the fact that you know largely through our efforts back in the 70s but other people contributed like statements and other people but we published this little pamphlet the psilocybin mushroom magic growers guide which put in the hands of you know every nerdy 10th grader essentially the tools to grow psilocybin mushrooms and that's how it got out to the world and our motivation when we did that it was partly mercenaries yeah we can grow mushrooms make a lot of money well we we grew mushrooms we made some money but the real motivation is we wanted people to be able to verify our own experiences the stuff that we experienced at la tierra was like so nuts that we thought either we're completely deluded or there's something going on here so we needed affirmation from a wider community that hey there is really weird shit going on here and we put it out and it's now you know mushrooms are probably for I'd say for most people they're the first psychedelic that they encounter yeah you know maybe LSD but chances are these days it's mushrooms well your brother was such a compelling speaker I mean tennis Terence was so interesting like his speech pattern was fascinating I mean it was part of the thing it was the theater of his his speeches and lectures they were so interesting you know and he also was he was so obviously engrossed in these subjects to the point where he's very very attached to them it was a deep connection and you know when you would hear him talking but like shit I gotta get some of this stuff yeah yeah no he was a compelling speaker I mean I I don't I don't rise to that level sorry I'm just not although occasionally you know I can kind of channel him but but I have stuff to say I don't say it as well as he does but we we were so much on the same wavelength about this so I he was the bard of psychedelics throughout the 70s 80s and 90s and refused to you know when no one else was talking about it he was talking about it so I I gave him a lot of credit for him kept the embers you know yeah to do that when you were talking about luxury era your experiences didn't you guys have some sort of a UFO experience when you were there yes we did or he did he did anyway yeah yeah interestingly I recently you know I've talked about litter era probably far too much and I don't really like to talk about it too much because it's so hard to explain and with you know I'm to discuss it you get off into these for the uninitiated for these a shame what we're talking about and got into these rabbit holes of of explaining but I gave a a lecture at breaking convention last year in the UK in in at the end of June and they have breaking convention another big psychedelic conference and I my title of my talk was the experiment at lecture era psychotic break shamanic initiation or alien encounter question mark where all the above or all of the above well that's the thing but my sort of the theme of this talk was if you look at the what you might call it the the the the the topology the typology of alien encounters there are certain patterns that come up again and again and if you tick those off if you say you know for the experiment at lecture era they're all present in a certain way there has to be you know the typical of alien encounter it's kind of an oxymoron what's typical about an alien encounter but there are certain characteristics and one of the characteristics is there has to be a calling there has to be a siren call write something compels you like in in Spielberg movie Close Encounters was a third kind it was you know the the table mountain you know and somehow this guy was compelled to go there well there was a siren call in in our experience it was DMT you know and we were just students you know hey Terence was at Berkeley I was in University of Colorado but we were both fascinated by DMT and we were compelled to go look for this orally active of DMT Oh Kouhei which when we finally got it turned out to be not very exciting but we it took us to larger era that's why we went to latter era was in quest of this thing which we called the secret when we got to lot sure era what was really there were mushrooms everywhere in the pasture that quickly reorganized our priorities right and and it was though we were in the presence of this intelligence and it presented itself very much we called it the teacher and it was downloading all of this information to us and that was another characteristic of alien encounters generic alien encounters usually involved the transfer of special information people are shown a book or they're shown you know something that is transmitted from the teacher to the recipient and we we got that in spades we got this encounter and it had those characteristics and then another characteristic is there there is so information is given and gifts are given you know and the information that was transmitted resulted in a couple of things well the primary thing that that came out of that was Terrance's idea about the time about time wave and the eaching the genesis of that idea came out of the experiment at lecture era and then over decades became refined and developed now whether there's any validity to it I'm not sure and I've always been very skeptical about it and you know it failed its major test which is yeah the space-time continuum did not collapse on December 21st 2012 as was predicted but there are interesting things about that about the time wave if it's just an interesting thing considered you know in its own context as a strange mathematical construction that in many ways as a reflection of Terrence's psyche he was the only one that could really understand it and interpret it there's a bunch of people listen you probably don't know what we're talking about we're talking about time wave zero time wave zero right and we wrote the invisible landscape in our first book it's four people have no idea what we're talking about explain what time wave zero okay well essentially that he essentially it was an algorithm yeah based on the structure of the eaching this Oracle of 64 hexagrams and he treated it in such a way that he claimed it it described that time had a structure and that this thing was that this this time wave described the structure of time essentially and thus was a predictive tool among other things and that it you know was a way to look at the ingress of novelty into the continuum the idea that there really are new things under the Sun new things happen that have never happened before ever in the history of the universe and this map was a way to predict the eruption of those things or the ingression of those things I think which is a better term and Terence and I used to have you know I wouldn't call them arguments I call them heated discussions or enthusiastic discussions about how this happened I do not disagree with the principle that that there is novelty I'm not sure the time wave really describes it adequately but it was it was an attempt to and and whatever it was it was something that was a gift from this teacher at least the the Nugget of the the idea that right the other thing that came back the other gift that came back from watcher era was nothing supernatural or anything like that the gift was the spores of the mushroom we took the spores of the mushroom and we took them back with us and then over two or three years we figured out how to grow them and we shared that with the rest of the world and that was really the thing that and look at the impact that that's had on society you know and Terrance was fond of saying Terrance did say you know we are in a symbiotic relationship with something that has disguised itself as an alien invasion in order not to alarm us right so and that's what it was and before you know it every nerdy tenth here a ten-year-old in basements across the the country you know we're growing mushrooms and able to do it because the sim the technique was very simple so it's all about what's Johnny doing down in the basement honey oh I don't know some science project something about growing mushrooms you know so effectively the alien invasion was a complete success and not a shot was fired you know and now here we are and no one's even realized that it's of alien invasion idea that mushrooms came here perhaps on asteroids that it was a panspermia sort of situation oh I don't know I don't subscribe to that idea whose idea was that well Terrence's idea you know and the idea of panspermia I don't necessarily disagree with that I think that may well have happened you know that that life came from on an asteroid or is the building blocks the building blocks of it but mushrooms as such we know too much about the phylogeny of mushrooms we know where they fit into the phylogeny of life on Earth and you can't really make the case that they were extraterrestrial because there were mushrooms you know they're mushrooms and they're part of you know they have a position and the well-defined phylogeny of fungi which are some of the most ancient organisms I mean some of the most earliest mackerel terrestrial organisms that were of a macroscale were fungi I mean there were big fungi on on in terrestrial environments before there was much of anything else but they weren't psilocybin mushrooms pretty soon won't we have you pay attention this mostly recent theory that perhaps the ancestors of octopus might have somehow another gotten here from an asteroid that there there's something about their unique ability to alter their RNA which is unique in the animal kingdom mm-hmm I have heard about that and I have from legit sources apparently right it's not yeah yeah yeah religious sources honestly I haven't read far enough into that to just decide but anything is like an alien yeah well they certainly look yeah they look like our idea of an alien yeah really we probably look like aliens to octopus so yeah but you know another and another interesting maybe interesting angle on this was I yeah I think it was 2015 I was invited to another private conference actually a tearing ham and the subject of the conference was DMT entities and you know arm the entities you see on DMT are they real or not tall order very difficult to really unpack that for one thing what do you mean by real let's start there anything experiences real right you know so start there but the talk that I presented was called is DMT messenger molecule from an extraterrestrial civilization that was the title of my talk and I actually in the course of preparing the talk I had to conclude that probably not you know because if you're going to postulate that what you really have to talk about is the origin of tryptophan because tryptophan the amino acid which is found in everything it's one of the 20 that goes into protein tryptophan is the precursor to all these psychedelic tryptamines and and also including serotonin you know DMT is kind of the archetypal psychedelic but you got psilocybin so listen five methoxy bufotenin and even the beta-carboline so so if you look back in phylogeny you know a billion years a couple of billion years eventually you're talking about what they call the trip operon which is the cluster of genes that give rise to tryptophan so we appreciate you're not talking about is DMT extraterrestrial in origin you have to say well obviously it's it came from tryptophan so how the trip operon arise in phylogeny it was that extraterrestrial even though it's one of the most ancient gene clusters in in the evolution of life you can't really make the case that it's extraterrestrial because you could say well it came from rhodopsin actually the genes that the trip opt operon originated from originally where the genes that the same genes that code for rhodopsin which is the pigment in the eye that responds to light so I ended up I could make the case that the MT is extraterrestrial and but is that it's even an interesting case like whether or not it's from another planet whatever it is it's it doesn't seem like it's here the experience doesn't it doesn't seem like it's here right right but but then again where is here right you know eventually ID faulted to say it may not be an extraterrestrial messenger molecule but it is a messenger molecule and it is a distinctly terrestrial messenger molecule it is the messenger molecule that has been adopted by the community of species to talk to the monkeys you know and try to you know talk to our consciousness and maybe even to trigger consciousness so you know DMT is only two steps from tryptophan enzymatically and cellular metabolism the tryptophan is universal not a living thing that we know of that does not contain tryptophan because it's one of the twenty that go into amino acids two steps from tryptophan decarboxylation and end methylation is all it takes to get DMT and that's like the prototype old tryptamine psychedelic and the enzymes that catalyze those steps they may not be Universal in organisms but they're pretty darn near universal because they have all sorts of other cellular housekeeping functions you know decarboxylated amino acids is something that goes on in every cell sticking methyl groups on nitrogens this may be less less common but still very common you know enzymes that will move you know methyl groups around in cells so you can make the case that and we know this DMT is extremely common in nature DMT is I said nature is drenched in DMT you know from the animal level to the plant level to the fungal level you find these things everywhere you know and people say well there's about a hundred and fifty species of plants that contain DMT that's only because we've only looked at a hundred and fifty species of plants you know if you look at these large jennarose that are that are you know famous known for having tryptamines like a Katia's and mimosas and these things we know of a few species that have DMT but there's hundreds of species thousands of species it's just that nobody's look nobody's gonna fund this work I think you can reasonably say that you know there are about fourteen hundred species of acacia in the world probably 75% of them have DMT and actually I would go to the next I would I would even claim without evidence that's never stopped me before but I think it's reasonable to suppose that because DMT is so close to mainstream metabolism probably all plants have DMT to some extent most don't have large large levels of that they don't have useful amounts of DMT but if you took with sufficient instruments if you just started random randomly sampling plants and analyzing for DMT with a mass spec I'll bet it would turn up and almost everything what is uh which is it phalaris grass that's toxic to sheep because I'm DMT yep that's the one so the DMT in it for whatever reason way it interacts with the sheep's digestive system it becomes poison well no not entirely I mean it's got phalaris grass has DMT it has five methoxy DMT other tryptamines it also has something called grameen which is it's like DMT with only one carbon on the sidechain gramming is more or less toxic gramming shows up in a lot of grass species that's probably the thing that causes what's called phalaris staggers so if you just fed DMT synthesized to sheep it wouldn't be toxic hard to say did they produce monoamine oxidase over these seven diff sheep yeah of course so do leopards or Jaguars all mammals so when you see those Jaguars eating the leaves and then tripping their balls off rolling around on their back what do you think is happening there have you seen those videos yeah I've seen I've seen those videos well for one thing they are eating banisteriopsis right which is the source of the mao inhibitors okay right and I don't know what to make of that it certainly does seem like some kind of a catnip for them you know and causes an altered state for mao inhibitors in in and of themselves they produce some sort of a psychedelic experience they can not just from the mao inhibition but they often have other effects that psychoactive like harm I mean harming is a good example you know we used to think that harming was basically it's the MAO inhibitor in ayahuasca and doesn't do a whole lot beyond that well it turns out now harmine is getting a second look it's interesting that the tar mean you know was discovered in pagana Harlow about be ten years before ayahuasca was ever reported to science so harming is one of these hoary old alkaloids I like to call it you know it's been known forever and now we're just finding out it has all sorts of interesting pharmacology zits it's an MAO inhibitor for sure more importantly it appears that it stimulates neurogenesis and that's relevant to Alzheimer's and brain development and even Down syndrome it is an inhibitor of this kinase this regulatory protein called dyr k1 which has got its fingers in lots of different cellular PI's you could pilot many different regulatory functions and harming is a very potent very selector inhibitor of this kinase so that's relates to this it actually stimulates nerve growth in the hippocampus so you know we're and we're finding out that it there are a number of other receptors that it interacts with including serotonin dopamine transporters even one called the image alene receptors that are you know of undefined functions so like most natural molecules it's not a one-trick pony you know harmine has a number of effects you know and that's why taking ayahuasca is a different you know it that's why it's not a pure DMT experience because you've got a whole mixture of alkaloids that are contributing to that effect who were the researchers that when they discovered harmine they didn't know what it was and they'd try to label it telepathy so they realized that it was harming right right well yeah this is part of the what you may call the the the the sad and sordid history of ayahuasca in a certain way because in the early days in there in the 20s when people are looking at it a number of independent groups were working on it and they were identified they were isolated molecules they weren't aware of other people's work and so they miss named these things you know I mean I can't tell you exactly I think initially it was Lewis Lewin who discovered harmine and he called it beneath Doreen and then it turned out well another group years before had isolated the same molecule from began I'm harmless and telepathy n-- was one of these misnomers you know that came out the problem with with this was that back in the day people didn't collect voucher specimens so a lot of this chemical work was done without the benefit of herbarium specimens which now every everybody that wants to do photochemical work hopefully has the the good sense to collect specimens of the original plant so that people can go back and look at that and a lot of this early work was reported and there was no voucher specimens to document the collection so a lot of it had to be dismissed you know the beta-carboline chemistry of banisteriopsis caapi tetrahydroharmine and harmaline as the main alkaloids they could reference that to botanical voucher specimens so they really should get the credit for discovering it and then once that was done and it was known and you know other scientists had to acknowledge that why did they describe it as telepathy there was supposedly some sort of a story about some group telepathic experience yeah this was just romantic this was just some story you know out of the literature yeah I mean I mean it was rumored to be able to cause telepathy but this was in ayahuasca they were only taking harm Allah it's not clear it's not clear it's not clear yeah I mean they may have been taken but they may have been taking it but whether they were getting telepathy I kind of doubt it when we know we can get telepathy on ayahuasca it's not so uncommon it happens all the time people have group hallucinations group visions has anybody ever bothered to independently like sequester people put them into like different rooms have them do ayahuasca and then have them describe a very similar experience or almost identical experience to prove that these telepathic experiences exist or at least as far as I know that hasn't been done see yeah because everybody wants to talk afterwards right see the dragon right I don't think that's been done that seems like a worthy study because if if I've heard from more than one person in fact my friend Kyle Kingsbury and his wife had an ayahuasca experience with a both had a visualization of their child and then when they got back she was pregnant they wound up having this child from their visualization round from from this experience obviously they're very close and they were together and they probably communicated quite a bit and you know I would just think would be a really interesting experiment it would be very interesting I mean and that sort of points out there is you know a realm of experience a realm of knowing that these things give access to that's normally close to us I mean that's kind of a trivial statement of course but then you get down to questions of how verifiable is that how real is that how you know and and people get I don't know if the term is hung up but they can get baffled when you start talking about you know the reality of say the entities you encounter on DMT I mean this is this is some people I know are obsessed with trying to verify the reality of the entities that you find on DMT and again it comes down to if you experience them they're real yeah if anything you experience is real because you've experienced it does it have a corresponding existence in the external world well you know what's external what's internal you know we we throw around these terms these these epistemological metaphysical terms quite carelessly you know without really thinking about it what does it mean when you say I'm in here and you're out there you know and then you take a psychedelic and you realize that's the artificial boundary you know we're all one there is no separation it's separate in normal consciousness though it's separated in normal consciousness but then what is normal conscious right if not a reflection of your neural chemical brain state I mean everything you experience is an altered state because it's filtered into this brain processed by the brain and you know the brain is a biochemical engine that you know as I say often we're made out of drugs but it seems that our normal consciousness is the best state to propagate biological life and to keep our Tsar whatever we've created in terms of our community structures and relationships and friendships and the ability to build structures and houses and things like that these all these things are done best when you're here and present whereas on a psychedelic state I agree with you well the way I've always described it is if you had a meeting with God and you went and God gave you all the answers to the world and you you experienced undeniable beauty in the most extreme form possible where you couldn't have imagined it and then you came back whether you hallucinate at it or not it's the exact same experience exactly I can't put it on a scale run it weigh it right and like we've stretched the tape measure around and God is 47 inches across like just because you know saying just because you can't measure it with what we term our our metrics for reality right and that is exactly the the thing don't worry about whether it's real in the way we would define real is it good information or is it bad air is it not that's the thing it doesn't matter where it comes right it's such a if it's good information then it has its own internal validity and whether it came from some part of yourself that is normally obscure to you or it came from the plant teacher or the aliens transmitting it through it doesn't really matter but we we are obsessed with that we're obsessed with reality yeah I think we're being fooled a lot right like and this goes back to Terrence's Lotterer era psychedelic experience where he had a UFO encounter you know the the easily dismissing amongst us would go well he's tripping balls off on mushrooms of course I saw UFOs was there a leprechaun driving the UFO like oh that's nonsense right right easy to dismiss yes and in fact that is the nature of these phenomena that's ones really interesting easy to dismiss you know and that that was another aspect of the experiment of law era I left out when I was talking about my lecture but there's almost always an element of absurdity yeah in these experiences and in paranormal experiences and UFO encounters it's like little green man come on are you kidding but right but there are little gray man you know and little blue man you know a guy you should have on the show maybe you have already is wit least Reaper no I haven't had him on but he's so out to lunch I have massive reservations there's a video of him looking at a fly in that fly clearly a fly the eyes in front of a camera and he's describing it is this a man and a suit and he's like like there's something wrong with him well I missed that I missed that part I think what's interesting about Whitley and I agree I I totally dismissed him you know for a long time I thought you know he is really a nutcase he's from the communion books or people don't know exactly what a series of books about being abducted and yeah but I sort of had to change my opinion somewhat because he and and Jeffrey cripple who I dunno is Jeffrey cripple is a professor of comparative religion and mythology at Rice University and his focus initially is sort of on the the superhero as as in contemporary you know mythology as a mythical figure and that sort of thing he and I was invited to simple you know a workshop that Whitley was going to be at this was a couple years ago in Hawaii well I'm always interested in a free trip to Hawaii right so I said I you know I like to come to this thing but this guy is a nutcase I'm not sure I want to appear on the same stage with this guy yeah well if it's me saying that you know and you know and the guy who was hosting it said well you know did you know that he and Jeffrey cripple wrote a book together and I said oh I don't I said I know Jeffrey kryb all I know that he's not on that case and that's interesting and then I found out about the book and I said I I told the guy if you invite Jeffery and Whitley then all come and will participate the name of the book is supernatural two words supernatural a new vision of the unexplained and it's really very interesting the book is basically you know alternating chapters Whitley tells us stories about what happened to and what has happened to and what continues to happen to him he lives in some kind of alternate reality I Itay I get that I mean I don't know if I accept it but I get it and then in alternating chapters Jeffery comes along and kind of um this and explains where does this fit in to sort of the the you know phenomenology of mythology and you know reasonable explanations and and it's a fascinating book if you just suspend disbelief for a minute and think about assume that Whitley is sincere I don't think he's lying I think that these things really happen to him or he thinks they do and some of the most craziest things these are not you know the media has made like everything they dumb it down you know and they they put it into the box of alien encounters guys and nut ball you know and they dismiss it but if you take a closer look one thing to Whitley's credit is he doesn't claim to understand what's happening he doesn't call it an alien encounter he doesn't claim anything he just says this is happening I have no friggin idea what is what this is so that's honest you know that's an honest scientific stance I do not understand this phenomenon so I gave him credit for that and then he and and Jeffrey wrote this book there was a very interesting you know later on so I read all this later on in the book there's a chapter where they get to what is the possible physical explanation of what's going on here if there is a physical explanation and one of the headings I think the chapter one of the headings in the chapter was labeled the soul as a UFO and that kind of blew my mind that got my attention because you know when I did this this workshop with them I was kind of bringing the flag of psychedelics right I was saying if you don't aggress psychedelics you've only got part of the picture here and and they and they were talking about how the soul how this could be some sort of a physical plasmoid type of thing they were invoking you know scientific terminology I don't know if it it was legitimate or not but just the idea the soul of a UFO and I was able to respond to that and say well you know the experiment in Lohr era was essentially the blueprints of how to build one of these things that you're talking about you know which it was really this this transformation and so that was that impressed me I don't know what to make of it but I think I think there is and they don't really know nobody knows what to make of it but I think there are just odd things going on but that some people experience yes and and whether they are actual encounters or dreams or somewhere in between I'm not sure then it would be cure it would be good I mean you know I don't know I mean when you when you when you meet Whitley have you ever met him no he is like the most drab person you could imagine I mean he's like an accountant or some probably worn out from could be could be but he was but he was a fiction writer he was a fiction writer yes and then he comes out with this incredible real world story right reads like fiction right and there's obviously something off when you talk to him or you hear him and I've never talked to him personally when you see them in interviews and conversations there's something off you know what is that something off is it a psychotic break is it something that drifts in and out is he is he having problems with normal consciousness I mean I don't I don't know what it is but I thought I really find that video of him talking about the fly did you find it wise a man in the fucking spacesuit it's like it's not a man in a suit what is that I'm like oh Jesus to lunch called the Ben with Nancy there's quite a few of those there's quite a few really bizarre videos of him you like he's having a hard time with normal reality so which would make sense during the dream state because all these things are happening at night right right right this was the this is the big thing that I've always a big problem I've always had about these UFO abduction experiences first of all they all take place when someone is either at night it's either there on a dark road where there's no one around mm-hm and they're sleepy or they're at home and their bed like the vast majority of them take place at night or while someone's lying in bed which is exactly when you're dreaming yeah now we don't totally understand the dream state but we there's there's a connection at least an implied connection between psychedelic chemicals that your brain produces endogenously that could be released during the dream state and in different levels with different humans I mean obviously some people have problems with producing serotonin and dopamine and then other people have no problems with it and this the biology of the human brain varies right right so it's not without consider eight or it's not without possibility that there's someone who has a real issue with these chemicals just busting through right flooding we know there are yeah we know there are people then yes but then does this contradict what we've already said about psychedelic experiences like why would we diminish his endogenous psychedelic experience if that's what he's having I mean it is entirely possible that you're dealing with someone who maybe perhaps does have some sort of psychotic breaks but also is experiencing psychedelic experiences due to some endogenous DMT dump or dump of whatever and all these things are taking place at the same time in the dream state during heavy REM sleep and he's coming back with these uniform stories of alien abduction yeah no I agree it's it's so I mean it's hard to parse it out and I'm not saying I accept it all but I it's easy to dismiss you shouldn't write well there maybe is something there we should approach it in the spirit of here's a phenomenon right we don't understand that we shouldn't dismiss it there's something to be understood here not necessarily his understanding of it but something to be looked at there and I thought this book was interesting for its balance you know I would not have Whitley Strieber on your show without Jeffrey cry pause so that was the fun because he it would be fun and maybe it's you know maybe it's a bridge too far I'm not maybe not yeah maybe maybe we get to the bottom of this thing yeah well is there something to be got to the bottom right that's that's the very bottom it's just one man's delusion or is there really something at the base of it and and this is the this is kind of the point that we were talking about a while back in this conversation about natural philosophy natural philosophy you know it has a wider scope for understanding and you can say well you meaning natural philosophy will accept every cockamamie woowoo idea that ever came along not properly I mean it's natural philosophy properly approached should be a way to evaluate these things rigorously not abandoned rigorous thought but not be so dismissive of it is to say it doesn't fit into our paradigm it doesn't fit into what we think we know so we're not going to talk about right that's dishonest that's intellectual dishonesty and we have too much of that you know science is a very timid kind of activity sometimes because in its current in its current incarnation it's so dependent it's it's corrupted in a certain way you can't just be the curious monkey who's trying to apply you know clear-thinking rigorous thought to understanding nature we don't have that luxury scientists don't have that luxury if they're practicing scientists you have to be getting grants you have to play the science game and that's when you keep saying science is corrupted that's what you mean by it that they have to get grants not that they have to get that's part of it they they have to get grants and they have to be dishonest right I mean with themselves with what they know like the example of the archaeologists or the psychedelic researchers back in the 80 you know if you wanted to kill your career tell your supervisor you wanted to work on psychedelics you were pretty much done or if you were an archaeologist and you said but but but you know look there's all this evidence for you know ancient civilizations it's like you want to be in this department kid you're out of here if you start talking about that so science is Dogma in a lot of ways not always but it's unfortunate that you know in order to say people's careers in order to have a career in science you have to make these sacrifice you have to you have to keep to yourself things you know to be true you know that you can't really talk about because your colleagues will look askance at you and science is a very medieval institution in that respect it's a lot like religion yeah you know when you look at the DMT experience and you look at its effect on the human mind how much of you subscribes to the idea that we're looking at uh some sort of a chemical gateway chemical gateway to what whatever it is - whatever that DMT experience is that this is something that your brain has the ability to travel to but I mean since we know that the body does produce this and when we know that it's possible for people to I mean I've never done it but I know that people who do Kundalini Yoga have apparently reported trip like experiences that are very similar to a real DMT flash so the mind has this ability to do this on its own what do you think that that is that something worth considering that this is that this is some sort of a pathway to a nearby dimension or to something that's around us all the time but we just don't have access to with normal neural chemistry you know there are too many whatever no I mean there's you know there's so much in what you said where you have to go back and and unpacked all of these things and when we got excited about DMT Terence and me in the early in the late 60s what led is to go to larger era was that it seemed like a completely different order of magnitude than any of the other psychedelics and we came to it really from a childhood that was steeped in science fiction so we carried with it the with us the idea this really is another dimension and it may be a portal to another dimension and as science fiction nuts that we were totally okay with that yeah and we thought maybe DMT was and maybe it is but or it's it somehow pulls the curtain back on something that's around us all the time that we don't see but again in thinking about these things is it something that is entirely within the brain that it originates or is it something that is it like a lens that you know or our eyes are covered with with with filters and DMT temporarily removes those filters I think it's hard to know I mean I think maybe experimentally we could we could begin to approach this have you you know and I I think we really know I think that's another thing about natural philosophy that's important that science is overlooking and natural philosophy always remembers the limits of what is known you know and science is a bit arrogant about what they think is known you know they only am science only understands a small fraction of all there is to know and ayahuasca another psychedelic always remind me of this you know when I take it remember the limitations of your knowledge or sometimes it more or less kindly says it you don't know shit and it's true we don't know yeah you know and scientists can forget that you know but as far as this DMT 'the thing you know this is actually a there's controversy about this because you know a lot of a lot of people who have worked in this area say it's it's pretty well established that endogenous DMT can produce these states that the pineal can secrete DMT under certain circumstances or under stress the lungs can produce large amounts of DMT that are translocated to the brain but it's it's not so clear that that goes on I mean it's clear that it can be produced but David Nicholls you know who knows a thing or two about pharmacology founder of the Hefner Institute world's you know most authoritative the highest authority when it comes to the chemistry and pharmacology of psychedelics he's the retirees taking a reductionist argument on this that's kind of hard to to knock down which is that DMT is produced endogenously but it's chopped up so quickly that it never reaches the site of action and it never reaches the levels at the neuron that it would take to activate the neuron you know so doing consumed or are you saying endogenously produce the MDA endogenously so that it does when you consume it obviously you flood the system and you get much higher levels than has ever produced endogenously and i but we all really measured the levels produced endogenously during especially these extreme states and that's part of the problem you have to part of the problem how do you do that how do you don't do you do that well have you done Kundalini and tried to recreate no I haven't me neither Arvind it you know Terence had that fantastic joke I was a talk about that this mom could practice the city of levitation do you member this one and that the Buddha came to town and he said for the last 20 years I practiced the city of levitation and I can now walk on water and the Buddha said yeah but the ferry is only a nickel it's like if you want to practice Kundalini for 10 years and and bang your head towards the east or just smoked the Incipio 30 seconds later run a center of the universe but I think the last time I was on your show we talked about this this other thing this Arjuna light we discussed yes and I don't know if you've interviewed yeah we have to buy you one I said we've totally dropped the ball on that you don't have to buy no we do have to buy you one by yourself well I'm gonna buy myself one and you and this time we're gonna do it we said we're gonna guide you to many podcasts I forget everything I know I've never but the ads online is interesting we you know I mean he claims and that was the conversation we had he claims yes this stimulates endogenous synthesis of my name is Jung right now it's pretty special for me AJ and the a Arjuna light and its website is just a gentle light calm and there's some good PDFs on there that'll explain what this is about get on that Jamie yeah Mosby big-time because I just mentioned but anyway so this life can produce some sort of psychedelic experience he claims it stimulates DMT synthesis in the pineal when you lie underneath it it's just a bunch of it's it looks like a floor lamp you know with a rectangular mount bunch of LEDs underneath it which he programs with an iPad and different patterns you lie under it and you it stimulates hypnagogic hallucination look in another a lot like that guy looks like an old school freak look at him he says said monk I bet he is yeah amongst other thing he used to be an Apple engineer he was really jobs right-hand man when Wow he went the right way he went the right way so he's got this thing is that cord going down to her head huh a hard time see what's happening - something's wrapped around her head that better not be a crystal I think that no I think it's a deceptive thing he didn't attach anything - no I said so you lie under this thing and first time I lied under it I thought I got all these colors I got all these hypnagogic effects you know and nice patterns and all that like a sub-threshold DMT experience and I said well you know the the LEDs are all changing color right and that's how I see it he says no they're white the colors are coming from you you're supplying the colors so okay so it was interesting and then we got into the conversation how do you know this is stimulating DMT how do you know that's the effect turns out it's not so easy to nail that down you know because the MT is so ephemeral in the system you can't take urine samples or cerebral spinal fluid or anything it would be gone by the time you you did it so the only way well maybe not the only way but one way you could do it is you could do something called it's essentially you couldn't do this to a human because you couldn't you couldn't get a FDA approval for it but you could put a micro capillary tube right next to the pineal that will absorb things as they are released and then you could recover that and say you know levels of diems here why didn't you do that to a voluntary participant voluntary or not you'd be screwing their brain out well no not necessarily but you'd have a hard time getting permission there might be you could do it to a rat though you could do it to her well that's what Cottonwood research foundations done right they've done that that's how they discovered DMT in the pineal yeah to a live rat yeah yeah that's how they discovered it that was the first proof right that was the first proof Nick Cosi who's a pharmacologists at the University of Wisconsin at Madison he was really the first one to show that DMT is you know endogenously produced no it's a sigma 1 agonist as well as a serotonin agonist which is another another receptor you know that that's definitely that but it's not clear what the function is it's it's a complicated issue you know to figure this out I'll send you a paper that Nichols wrote orally I'll link you to a video where he discusses this and it's like you know he gave that at the breakin convention conference last summer that I was at it was like you know he was like the big downer of the conference right because everybody has this romantic idea and he comes along and just squash you know it's like man here you know you've disappointed a lot of people but on the other hand reality is good you know facts are good what guy did do that that sort of made me think maiming think maybe there is something to it he's tried pre dosing with an MAO inhibitor just just take banisteriopsis t with them the admixture about 30 minutes before going under the light and then it's much more intense and it's much more prolonged leonis I have another um that he claims that of other people say that it definitely enhances this so that would indicate that the breakdown of DMT is being inhibited is he claiming that you could reach actual DMT states with this device upon practice yeah what about in the tank the thing it seems designed for the tank but how do you how do you put the light in the tank you just suspend it so suspended from the ceiling and put a switch on the wall yeah you climb in hit the switch and lay down you could try it I'm gonna try it you could try it that seems like the way to I'm gonna get a hold of crash from the float lab because crash was trying to put he's the the mad scientist behind the float lab which is the most advanced cerium II saw that contraption that we have back there that is as state-of-the-art as it gets in the world of tanks and he had a concept for developing learning films films where you would lie down and in the absence of any physical input right or very minimal meaning that you're floating in that environment he was gonna suspend an LCD screen at the lowest possible light emission so you would not be able to see the edges of the screen you would just be able to see the images on the screen and they would play instructional videos and things and you would learn them with the minimal amount of distractions and he think you could achieve his thought was you could achieve accelerated learning okay yeah like perhaps like you could work on your golf swing or something like that or some some thing you could get in there or maybe musical instruments that you'll be able to pick up concepts and things with minimal distraction hmm oh that's very interest you have a lot of experience of the tank almost nothing oh it's so great you you would love it and it's really great for working out ideas it's like for one of the best environments in the world for working on a thought because there's no input you're not thinking about anything else you're just in total silence total darkness very relaxing you're floating and you you know in the absence of this input you your brain has more resources right is it similar to psychedelic experience yes yes you could try it because here I mean you got some time is it is actually not today yeah I have to go to another interview but but I don't know is it kosher to ask you have you taken psychedelics and gone into the tank or of course you never exist this stuff the best for it this one's legal okay depends on who you're asking right but what the the key is I think to get a good baseline of sobriety doing it doing it sober but my favorite is actually edible marijuana I think edible marijuana especially high doses especially in that complete darkness environment profound visuals like really bizarre strange strange visuals and they they kind of dance for you in there it's really really wild I think it's the best environment ever for edible marijuana well Dennis it's a opening invocation by me and the merchant Eck forget the ajna light ship the immersion tank would you do it got you one would you have room for it I don't have four where are you living these days I am living in st. Paul Minnesota still Minnesota right but I am moving to Canada I'm immigrating to Canada dami Donald Trump stuff got you down huh got I'm not participating anymore now that my wife has got her little five year pension she's able to retire so she's Canadian so she's my ticket out of here nice so that's why you're moving up there I am moving to British Columbia yeah you were teaching it in Minnesota a part of the time I was teaching at the University of Minnesota and then I stepped back from that for a couple of years ago cuz I just didn't have time and he was an adjunct professor position so the equation between the amount of work and the amount of compensation just didn't make sense in a while I mean I enjoyed it a lot but I I've lived in BC a lot I'm almost three-quarters I mean you know I got my PhD at UBC my daughter's got dual citizenship and she's up there now and I love it up there we're gonna move that's fantastic yeah I'm excited I'm applied for my permanent residence and there's no no reason why I wouldn't get it you know pretty simple thing so that will happen next spring as soon as we can we got to wait for our house we've got to wait for the prime time to sell our house which would be like next February and and also Minnesota State I'm is the winter end of the winter I would think no one's going anywhere in a Minnesota because people start looking at the end of February so it's a hot time too because it's a buyer it's a seller's market right now oh that's great we're gonna go up there what part of BC well around Vancouver mmm we probably won't be able to afford to live in Vancouver the housing market is utterly nuts but somewhere close by White Rock Abbotsford have you looked at Vancouver Island yeah we've looked at Vancouver Island it's not that much less expensive there but it's nice but it's logistically it's a problem yeah if you want to go anywhere you have to take a ferry that's what I'm looking forward to all the all the work all the travel I do yeah need to be close to the airport but I am excited I mean for one thing you know my colleague Wade Davis is up there you know him he's the person that wrote one river he was a protege of shulte he was a graduate student of Scholl T's he's one of the Offutt one of the editors on this and very well known as a methanol botanist and for years he was the explorer-in-residence for the National Geographic he's the guy that worked out the zombie poison mystery back in the day you know in Haiti ah he's that guy but he's written a lot of excellent books and now he's Colombian Devil's dust or whatever the hell that is no no that's that's Brook van Zia that's towei no this is the zombie medicine is tetrodotoxin which is a toxin from puffer fish as well as other other marine sources it's a tetrodotoxin it's a paralytic neurotoxin that utterly paralyzes you for about 48 hours Wow and but you're completely conscious you can hear everything you can't move a muscle and so in the in the zombie context they would contrive to you know give this to people if they want to put the Whammy on them then they would bury them oh Jesus and if they were lucky they would and then they would Exuma them like 48 hours later and of course a lot of them did die but if they were alive then they would be zombies they don't so give him a mixture of datura and other bad things that would destroy their memory and completely discombobulated them and then they would send them off and they would spend their life as you know sort of wandering around completely you know shells of their former self Wow datura has permanent effects like that it can ya can and after this traumatic experience you could imagine yeah what so Wayde worked all that out his first book was called the serpent of the rainbow all right that was made into a film yeah terrible film yeah but good book but later he wrote he wrote many books his most memorable one is as basically a biography of Schulte is called one river one River Adventures of the Amazon or something like that he'd be a great guy to bring on your show that sounds awesome very articulate man and you know we worked actually this Heraclitus expedition I was telling you on Wade was on that expedition and I've gotten to know him I consider him a good friend but he's now he's an endowed professor of anthropology at the University of British Columbia which sounds real stuffy and it is but he's not a stuffy guy he's got wonderful tales to tell well I can guarantee you that there's float tank centers in Vancouver there are float exams and we'll we'll get you connected and hook you up you need you need this in your life yeah I'd love to get into it it's great physically to just you feel very relaxed yet out of there my issue always Jo is I just never feel like I have time but that's my choice well change my attitude about that and realize that I need to take time out to care for my mind and body I don't do enough of that you know yeah but I'm hoping that when I move up to a BC weight and I can do some work together and maybe even teach you know work on this thing in South America get some courses going down there because with him you know as one of the faculty that will bring a lot of people I mean he's he's high-profile and really a good guy that's fantastic you know so do you have a timeline for this thing in Peru yeah well it's happening faster than I had dare to hope actually I think I mean you know I hate I hate to predict and then not be able to you know but my guess is that a year from now will be on the way you know I mean it is all happening this is the formative year we know where we want to go we're talking to investors who are seriously interested they want to get involved and they have money and it's not just about money they also have you know they've listened to the medicine and it's all about the medicine as we know changes people's hearts and minds so these folks they have the resources but they realize there is a larger vision and so you know and for me personally what I want to do part of my problem is I'm running around the world all the time and I'm going to these conferences I'm propagating the message and I can't stop myself i have i have yes a hall ism and it takes it takes a lot out of me yeah and it keeps me distracted so what i want to do if possible is pull my elbows in a little bit and say rather than go to your conference and prague or your conference and you know wherever create this place and make that a place where people can come and have really rich experiences whether or not they involve psychedelics they can have rich learning experiences i mean it's a perfect location want to learn about the Incas machu picchu is right there it's all there and there's just Italy I've always liked the idea of platforms you know and I want to create a platform well a catalytic Nexus for global consciousness transformation that's the idea and do therapeutic programs retreats impactful conferences like Michael Pollan levels Graham Hancock level Joe Rogan's level conferences if I could ever convince you to come down which maybe will happen maybe well someday and and just use it as a as a platform I kind of you know I like the academic idea use it as a place where we can try to understand ourselves in our place in nature better you know and through plant medicines and clear thinking and creative people and and just make it that and then I can be like you know the I can be more in residence there and I don't have to keep running around the world I don't want to say I'm the girl in residence because my first thing is I'm no guru I'm just I'm just a learner like everybody else right you know that's we're all we're all just curious monkeys right yeah what seems to me that with psychedelics the interest and the desire far exceeds the access yeah especially in this country there's so many people that really have no idea where to start I can't tell you how many people have asked me hey how do I get mushrooms right it's just even amongst people that you would think would know someone who would have something but it's one of those it's one of those things where we're gonna have to wait until things get more legal until their environment changes and it seems to be moving in that way I think it is you know John Hopkins doing research and there's all these different studies that are being made through maps in particular and and various other organizations are trying to push this idea of especially in the beginning working with soldiers people with PTSD and showing these massive results mm-hmm and that to open up people's minds that there's a bunch of different things MDMA being one of them so Simon being another and then hopefully eventually we'll work our way to DMT well this is one of the attractions of creativeness platform in the sacred valley because the whole or in Peru because the whole regulatory framework is different you know Peru is declared ayahuasca national patrimony and I mean there's no restriction on the use of ayahuasca and all these other plant medicines are part of the tradition you know San Pedro called watch Yuma you know the snuffs Vilkas nuff all these things can be used without restriction now I don't know about the status of mushrooms but I think with a little bit of transparency we could also get permission I mean you could probably use them at this place and nobody would say a word but if we wanted to we could get permission to use them and that's the idea is to not restrict it to ayahuasca be able to look at all of these plant medicines in a very intelligent way and also bring science and shamanism together you know work with smart shamans who also want to work with Charlotte with with clinicians to develop a really new paradigm that combines the best of both and Michael Pollan refers to this a little bit but he kind of glosses over it but I think that's where the the therapeutic revolution is going to come when you fuse shamanism and and the clinical approach and you can do all that there and develop models that can be used other places and you don't have to be secretive about it you know you don't have to be ashamed or we're not doing anything illegal or covert and so again we can you know rather than being sort of you know well we can shout it from the rooftops if we want to not that we necessarily would do that but and be open about what we're doing yeah there are also a lot of good there are a lot of smart people in Peru you know and smart doctors and so on smart clinicians so we want to involve local communities local people as much as possible and and then expand that to all the other things that this relates to like like sustainable agriculture and it's a perfect place to look at you know new paradigms for food production and so on the sacred valley is one of the five areas in the world where agriculture originated you know most of our important food plants came from there originally they have six thousand varieties of potatoes four thousand varieties of tomatoes I mean incredible food biodiversity and the foods that have gone global how many varieties of potatoes do you see in the in the grocery store maybe four or five at most so there is an incredible genetic repository of these things that have never really been developed on a global scale and a lot of them that's our part of the solution to the food crisis that we face and also what the Incas knew about agriculture is it was pretty revolutionary so there's the you know the spectrum is broad are you going to have a standardized ingredients list when it comes to like ayahuasca like in terms of like the dosage that's work that we want to do yeah well not necessarily to impose it on other people but I think I think it could benefit from a bit of analytical work I'd like I'd like to do that I'm also interested in the the sort of the pharmacopoeia of other plants that that are associated with ayahuasca they're not put into ayahuasca all the time but they're there often sometimes I use for the deities there's a whole pharmacopoeia plants not very well investigated that I'd like to look more deeply into and maybe even develop formulations of ayahuasca with some of these other plants that could be used for more specific therapeutic purposes hmm so you might have one that's good for say PTSD and one that's better for depression and you know you could actually tailor these things bring a little science into it because you know and and you don't have to have a lot you know you don't have to have gleaming laboratories for this you can do it with a very simple set up a simple Natural Products laboratory most importantly is the people that you have in there not the equipment that you have and you could do a lot of stuff and partly this is what this book is about - the ethanol pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs you know I mean you know a lot of what's in this book is is talking about the ayahuasca and peyote and things that we know about but talking about it in ways that we've never looked at it before and then there is a whole bunch of things out there that really I mean there's a great future for discovery of things we've never heard of you know and that's what ethno pharmacology is about and specifically it's the ethanol pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs so there's a lot still to be discovered now Canada has just recently legalized marijuana as of today yeah yes yeah do they have any plans or do you know of considering the legality of other substances as a matter of fact they do there is there I can't really talk about it I'm actually I shouldn't talk about it because I don't have that much information but there is a gentleman who came to one of my retreats I meet the most interesting people of these retreats you wouldn't believe this guy is an aspiring young politician Canadian politician from Ottawa he's talking to Justin about legalizing psychedelics for therapeutic uses and he's you know working with some some lawyers and so on and putting together a proposal to do this mdma-assisted psychotherapy trials to begin final phase in Vancouver well there you go but that's Maps right that's the catalyst behind that he wants to change policy and the thing is the Canadians are reasonable people that's the big difference from Americans you know you can propose this kind of thing and they'll they won't dismiss this out of hand well you know what's your evidence why should we do this so Justin's a very young guy he's you're to imagine he's been beyond the chrysanthemum a time or two I do really sure I think so Wow what makes you say that is he's spoken about it mmm I'm sure he wouldn't speak about I I guess this is the gasps he's the right age he well I can't say it's just pure speculation let's put it this way I I wouldn't be surprised for people who don't know what we're talking about beyond the co Santa mum means there's this thing that you see when you break through when you do DMT that's very bizarre geometric pattern that resembles a Santa mum right right you know the the Canadians I mean for instance to get approval for these MDMA trials was a lot more straightforward in Canada you know and now and and they've done some clinical studies with ayahuasca and they're they're on board with that they've done some some studies with indigenous people in Canada they called First Nations but they have they have done that and it's been pretty it's been straightforward to get that work done that would be they don't have that's drug hysteria that we have yeah you know so I think it's a it's a good place to produce pursue this research well in many ways they were victims of our drug hysteria I mean they sort of adopted our raw ideas right I'll be interested to see our response to the legalization of cannabis that's gonna piss them off well it'll piss off that little elf sessions right no but I quit just great he needs to be pissed off yeah he's such a fool that guy yeah this statement good people don't smoke marijuana that is one of the dumbest fucking things anyone has ever said ever it's such a crazy thing to say like that is one of the dumbest generalizations you know that's like saying all white people are evil it's like it's just so stupid it's such a stupid thing to say just a stupid thing to say this idea that we could go right across the border to Vancouver and experience you know the host of the psychedelic experiences would be I mean that would be fantastic and I do I tected yo you'll see that very soon diamond would be amazing and I just hope it would have a positive effect on you know our country it doesn't make any sense when you think about how many troops come back over from overseas with these traumatic experiences and PTSD and real issues psychologically in that the number one tool for handling this it's not it's not psychotherapy the number one tool is psychedelics it's really the best in terms of efficacy in terms of proven results there's nothing that's even remotely close MDMA or psilocybin or any of these psychedelic therapies they have profound effects when it comes to the ability to disconnect from addictive behaviors particularly drugs opiates there's nothing better than these psychedelic experiences particularly ibogaine and you know you got to go to Mexico to go to a tea to use ibogaine yeah and I think within five years you're gonna see clinics and maybe even centers you know along the lines of what we're talking about you know doing in the sacred valley I mean once you've done something like this then you can replicate it in different countries where where the regulatory environment is friendly so you could have you know we have the McKenna Academy and in Peru but then we have Brandt you know if they meet the standards then we can essentially license out that brand or whatever and you could potentially do one in Vancouver of course yeah wow that would be sensational yeah dude I'll help I swear to god I'll go over there I love Vancouver I go there every chance I can well that's good so maybe I'll see you more often when yes yes yeah for sure I still have to drag you to South America oh I know I'll get you I'll get you I have young kids and I'm always busy and I travel too much as it is it's a it's a grind to get me out I have the answer to that what does it bring your wife and kids to Peru to Peru cocoa yeah yeah all's Brown a bunch of hippies now we have a perfect place you know we can take care of the kids there's a catch of a family that runs one of the centers and they would love to take care of your kids your wife can do yoga or whatever she wants to do I like how you say the wife could do yoga she's not going to trip too of course she get mad now she wants the trap of course you can do somebody's got to watch the kids oh yeah well that's what I say there are people who love kids and they'll yeah happy to babysit only but it'll happen when I think so right well the the positive benefits are so overwhelming and the evidence is so clear and so many people have these incredibly powerful experiences that they're relaying to other people and oftentimes it's people that are there like the people with the closed minds maybe their loved ones have had these experiences and maybe their loved ones were really far gone and have come back and they can see these results and recognize that especially when it comes to in my opinion veterans we have an overwhelming responsibility to take care of those people that we don't meet we don't meet it medically we don't meet it psychologically we don't mean it with therapy we just don't give them enough they don't really we don't mean it financially and this could be a way to heal them to help help them reconcile their experience and help them you know achieve balance back here you know stateside and it's not just it's not just veterans that are traumatize your all kinds of people are traumatized yes in fact everybody is traumatized by to a certain extent yeah just by living in this society I mean we are a wounded Society yes that's the thing I think you know I think these psychedelics are medicines for for the soul yeah in a sense and medicines for our species in a certain sense I mean that's why they're global you know we're a wounded society and we're and it's dysfunctionality is now becoming apparent you know yeah through the political situations I mean I am just baffled by you know a government a president who basically likes to hurt people I mean that that seems to be it it's this culture of cruel cruel - yeah that has been that has been created and well particularly if he feels slighted you know he wants to come back at you extra hard yeah yeah and it's a reflection probably of his childhood trauma I mean I think his father was very abusive now he's it's his chance to get revenge you know and I mean he's the guy who take him what's that when you love to take him for a trip you know I don't think it would do any good really I don't think it would do any good why not because I don't think there's a moral I don't think there was a core there you know my I mean I would certainly I don't think it would help him the curandero I've worse the work most with said told me you know there are two kinds of people I will not give ayahuasca to one is sociopaths and the other is schizophrenic Trump is a sociopath you know he has no interior he's never had a reflective moment in his life that's that's what concerns me it's all external you know he's like pure it'd you know he is a six year old an angry six year old if we met him at sixteen would you have hope for his future or do you mean when as a person beyond reproach or beyond help like what what is the year see we have this idea in our minds that when a certain age is reached that a person is just firmly established there's no more growth no you know you see someone who's a 60 year old fool that's a dying fool he's gonna be a fool till his last day on this planet yeah why is that though why do we just assume that someone lives a certain life has a certain amount of time here that they they're not gonna learn is it just because of our own past experiences with these types of people or are we imposing a limitation on their growth like I'm very curious about that because we we do do that we assume that if someone fucks up and they're 20 although they'll get better they're gonna move on yeah if they fuck up when they're 70 we're like that guy's a goner well we make that assumption yeah you know and it may not be true I mean not fair I don't think in the way it's not fair I mean especially now what we're learning um the other thing that psychedelics do that is a kind of a new thing that we're learning is neuroplasticity yes it actually reorganizes connections in the brain you know psilocybin does this and presumably the others the others do to some of the Fenella means do it so that's a new thing you know you can actually change the the connectivity of these systems it's probably not fair to say I mean I mean my friend who came with me he he made a point when we were discussing this he says you know you shouldn't hate Trump you know he's used to that you should love Trump yeah I said it's real hard for me to love try but but I think the point that he's making is that he is Trump is not the cause of it in some way he's the he's the symptom of what's happening and he's he's the disrupter but the disruption is happening anyway and and so in some ways maybe we should be grateful to Trump because he's he's making you know he's making it so in everybody's face that the people are questioning everything and that's that's a good thing because this system it can't last you know so there's gonna be a transition that's gonna be pretty rough and Trump is just part of that not in any conscious way he's as much the victim of of the times as anybody else right and of expectation has the president has his finger on the nuclear button and a few other inconvenient things otherwise he would just be dismissed you know as an old cranky old guy right he was a television he was fun before this I guess yeah I mean before this he was you're fired you know he was the the rich guy with his name on the big buildings right he was a caricature you know he wasn't it wasn't what he is now what he is now is he's show he's exploited this vulnerability in the political system that we essentially a popularity contest to choose our rulers mm-hm and the idea of that at first was to pick the best one based on public perception but that's not what it is anymore now it's like we are so old jaded as to how well this system works and as to what's significant and important about it and we just want our guy to win now it's our guy and Hillary Hillary represented the bureaucrats she represented the red tape and the career politicians the one the proven Liars the ones who are starting these Clinton Foundation's and making hundreds of millions of dollars and giving these speeches and making hundreds of thousands of dollars talking to bankers but won't release any of the transcripts and hey now if we gotta drain the swamp and this guy was our guy to drain the swamp probably voted for him you know and this is and then he came on and it turns out he is the swamp is yeah in this case the system is completely broken I don't think I mean I certainly don't think if we elected Hillary it would all be good it would still be a mess but but the problem with Trump is you know he's immune to facts for one thing and the I mean the man is obviously deluded possibly demented certainly a sociopath I mean and and very impulsive and this is not you need you know this is not the person you need to be leading the Western world because because he's not reflective he's not it's it's all response you know this is this is the petulant six-year-old aspect of it he sees something and he reacts immediately there's no thought hmmm that intervenes he's often said that about his business deals he doesn't plan things he just goes on is not a great a businessman if you look back on if you look at his business deals that's the same with this Korea thing I mean if he can pull that off more power to him but I'll bet you it's not going to go anywhere because you know Kim jong-un and the Chinese who are behind it they are very smart and they they basically realized this guy is a buffoon and they will be able to make a show on the world stage but they won't give up anything and people are already saying this would it he actually come away with nothing some vague mumblings about denuclearization we've had that before but was unprecedented to see the leader of North Korea and South Korea meet at the DMZ and shake hands and trap waves travel that lisanna crusted that was pretty fascinating that was pretty fast I think that's progress in some way and maybe his lunacy needs leads to inadvertent progress or I mean maybe it's it's some sort of I mean he's people are many things you know he can't be entirely foolish there's probably a method to his madness tall of his money you know I'm saying I mean he really has been at least marginally success except he has gone bankrupt a few times but the point is that this is a guy that he's probably pretty complex as much as he is crazy he's probably also pretty complex and you know some of that might benefit us because we have this fucked up system that's undeniably fucked up it's right it's just a terrible idea though the end it was a idea that was constructed you know in 1776 when it made sense back then it was the Oh a great solution to the problems of the times but we don't live in those times no we don't really complicated times yeah and also we didn't have the media situation that we have now I mean this this is also part of the problem you know with the social media and everything it's true there's tons of fake news out there yeah produced on both you cannot tell so you've got the Trump you know reality distortion field right which is reinforced by his really no pretense about ignoring what's real you know like this whole controversy about about the immigration and splitting up families and say well we're just enforcing the law but in fact you know at the stroke of a pen he could change that and we didn't enforce that way before but so he's changed that you know it's just just changed just caved in and now he's yeah he's families too right yeah supposedly but it's nice at least that he's doing that like yeah listening the public opinion and the outcry has reached him and he's reacted yell but this is my er it's not that he cares about these children or you know how many people has he already traumatized as a result of this but yeah I'm glad he changed it but I'm sure that was a cynical decision his advisor said look look Donald you know you're about to go to a you're about to go to a rally in Toulouse I honestly think it's coming Phil's wife sir not kind of like this I think it's coming from his wife is this going around - this is a jacket she wore - uh-oh what she's saying it says I really don't care do you yeah this was - a meeting of day like immigration yeah kids kids yeah what is that is that but is that some fashion jacket that she wore to that event yeah what a stupid fucking thing to wear I really don't care do you yeah I care yeah I do care but we're talking about what a bizarre open-ended question I don't care this is what the tone deafness of these people they have no sensitivity she's a little critic though of separating children from their families and she actually made a surprise visit to the Mexican border today to check in on it yeah see what's going on good for her yeah good for she's an immigrant I mean this is the irony of the whole thing she barely speaks English the whole thing is so bizarre is that his own wife is a fucking immigrant young clearly the whole thing's crazy it's it's really strange but that jacket this what this is the sign of the simulation have you considered the simulation theory yes it might be real I'm well sometimes I do wonder I mean it's like it's like reality whatever we choose to call it is becoming so weird that I often ask myself who is writing this shit and can't they get a better writer you know I mean the plot is so absurd and yet yeah I began actively considering it when congressman Weiner kept pulling his dick out this is just crazy right that guy like this is just too much and then when Trump won I just was sitting down going imagine if we one day someone shuts it off and the lights dim and then they turned back on and you realize well the game's over how did you like it you're like what that was fake yeah you you just went it would only took an hour how long did it seem like fifty years you know and yeah you you've you're in a simulation with artificial memories implanted into your mind well that one day that there's the ideas that there's going to be an artificial reality or a virtual reality that's so good that it's indistinguishable I mean this is almost inevitable if technology increases the same rate that it's increasing now whether it's 50 years from now or a hundred years from now we're going to reach some point in time so the real question is when we do reach that how will we know well what if we're already there yes what if it is a simulation yes how would we know and how can we test it yeah how do we test it do you but another aspect of this is do we really want this you know do I mean do we want to be immersed in a virtual reality even if we could produce one so sophisticated we couldn't tell it from from whatever this is let's assume for the moment that this is reality it's that's it do we want to migrate into a virtual reality my concern my real concern is that we are the last wave of the biological human I'm really I really do believe this I'm concerned about that too and I'm not sure I think that that's a good thing I don't necessarily think it's a good thing for the biological human but I feel like if you separate yourself from the idea of good and bad and the inevitability of innovation and progress its if human beings continue to make more and more complex electronics with higher and higher capabilities it's inevitable that we become symbiotic with these things that we ingrain them into our they're gonna become a part of your body we're gonna replace body parts with more efficient body parts right and we're one day going to create some sort of artificial life now whether we become a part of that artificial life we we you know merge with it or it just assumes the role of the leader of the earth one of those things is likely to happen within the next 500 years it's just and that's that's a really generous time frame no I think that's a generous time frame yeah well you know this this I mean in some ways this is sort of you know this this raises the issue about you know one of the things that psychedelics put in front of us front and center is the fact that we are getting estranged from nature yeah you know that's the main lesson we're getting estranged from nature we have to relay ssin ship and you know become a partner it's in the symbiosis with nature and this projection is the exact opposite of that yeah so is that you know so maybe you know and this this race is also an one issue that we haven't really touched on but here but you know technology which is what this virtual reality stuff is and what any artifact is psychedelics are technology molecular biology as technology cybernetics as technology technology inherently has no moral dimension you know these are not good or bad things you know the way that they are used by humans the decisions that humans make in the way that they're going to exploit or deploy these technologies that's where the moral dimension comes in morality comes out of the human heart you know and we are one of our problems I feel as a species we're extremely clever but we're not wise that's what it is we're not wise about what we do we're not able to step back and say well yeah we can produce we can you know download the brain into cybernetics or we can produce an artificial body or we can do all this genetic stuff do we ever stop to think about just because we can do something should we do something you know we and the arrogance of science this is also a problem the scientists will say well they are scientists right we can do it so let's do it you know Brian we can do the Hadron experiment and oh maybe it'll collapse the space-time continuum but the very small probability so let's do it right yeah and this is something we have to learn I think also the psychedelics are important in that regard too they are ways that we can bring our cleverness and our wisdom into sync so that we have the wisdom not to do something even though we might be able to we shouldn't do it just because we can do it you know we really have to as a species ask ourselves is this a good idea and I think again these the psychedelics are teaching tools for learning this and and really propagating the message from the community of species that's for sure going to be a meme with the photo of your face that we are very clever but we're not wise that's for sure going to be a meme some some dudes right or gal it's working on that right now well I've been talking about this so so striking you're not my real concern with this stuff is that this is inevitable and this is just like the single-celled organism became the multi-celled organism and that the the thinking curious monkey who strives for material possessions is designed to create artificial life and this is just what we've we've we're set here I've described it as that we are the technological butterfly that will emerge from the cocoon and right now we're creating this cocoon that we are this caterpillar yeah its technological caterpillar and we don't know why we're making this cocoon and that we are going to give birth to this artificial life this next stage and that made complexity that may be true too I mean I mean what you say is true you know on some level anything that can be done is going to be done somebody's gonna do it right but so you know is it good is it is it good is it good for the collective I mean you know there are always megalomaniacs who will say well like I can do it I can start nuclear warrant so why don't we do this you know and that's that's the tricky part again I think you know psychedelics are important in giving us a moral compass I mean a wisdom not not a set of you know rules about that come out of the religious perception a set of rules that come out of the biological perception what is most compatible what is most nourishing nourishing for living things presumably we don't want to trash this planet you know we now have the ability to do that you know the forces that we can manipulate for the first time in history pose a real possibility that we could and life on Earth III think it's hard but I think we may be able to do it ma for one don't want to see that happen I had a bit a few years back in my comedy act about the origins of the universe and that what happens is people get so smart that they develop a Big Bang machine and that someone sitting around and some guy who's on the autism spectrum was filled up with SSRIs and antidepressants and drinking Red Bull all day it just goes fuck it I'll press it and he hits the button and boom we start from scratch and then every you know 14 plus billion years someone develops the Big Bang machine and hits it and that's the the restart of the universe you're really obsessed with this idea the universal simulation yeah I am in some ways it's possible I mean it's possible it is well it's inevitable that there will be simulated worlds right I'm not necessarily completely obsessed with the idea that we're living in a simulation but I am completely obsessed that we are a relic and that we are on our way out I really am I really do think that maybe that's one of the reasons why we're so crazy and so haywire it's just shows there's no logical progression for our culture that it's as advanced as we are as much access to information as we have we're also as crazy as we have ever been if not crazier yeah yeah yeah so the age of the curious monkey is coming to a close I wonder how much of the limitation our biology - I mean you think about what it took to get to here and all the battles we had to fight and the animals we had a run from and all these human reward systems that are ingrained into our DNA and that now here we are in a place where we hardly need them and yet we still have them just blowing up and exploding and vomiting all over the place in these weird ways and you know you have them sort of manifesting themselves with very strange behaviors that aren't aren't good for anybody and this constant need to acquire material possessions and conquer and and and you know obtain things that this is this is not tenable this is not something that makes sense in the long haul but yet we still go down the theological road and that this is really just because this is the best way to fuel innovation our extreme desire for material possessions is the best way to ensure that they're going to keep coming up with new or better things every year which will eventually give birth to the electronic butterfly well I don't know what to say about that I mean it may be that maybe we're we're where we're headed and it and you know it may be that this is a necessary step I mean if if our destiny is to actually leave the earth at some point if if the earth is an incubator for life and we're just a destined to leave it and spread out into the galaxy and beyond who knows I mean then maybe this is inevitable that we have to that we have to do that if that's what's happening but the question is what kind of being will we be when we do that you know we won't be human right we'll be something different than human that's what I've always wondered about the alien archetype that big-headed thing with the no genitals and no mouth that may be what we think of as being the ultimate form that the the human animal takes right if when we do if we do symbiotically merge with technology and electronics that that might be the form that we take it's just so strange that that one accepted for and I've heard I've heard the idea that this this image is something when young eyes from a newborn baby sees a doctor and see the doctor with a mask and the the you know face and this is what they see and that this is imprinted in our mind this traumatic experience of the birth and the bright lights and the operating table this is why so many of these alien abduction experiences do take place in these very clinic clinical sterile environments and it seems like a medical procedure as if this is a remnant of the birth process I've heard that experience I've heard that explanation but it also just it strikes me that these things are there if you go you go from ancient hominids you go from Australia Pittacus and then you go to modern computer programmer who doesn't exercise and you look at their body this sort of like doughy thin body it doesn't move very well right it's and then you go back to this muscular ape-like creature that's covered in hair they've lost all the hair they've lost all the muscle they've become thin and then where is that going well it's obviously going in that same direction it's not going to people are not going to get more muscular and harder and hairier as time goes on unless something radical changes and we need to perhaps right so that would be the normal I mean the path would that would be the natural progression that we would eventually have bigger heads because we have bigger heads in Australia Pittacus and certainly bigger heads and chimps or bonobos and that it just keeps going in that same direction mm-hmm well possibly yeah or maybe we just leave the biological shell behind you know but then where's really awesome I mean what we are trans human them yeah and we you know I'm I'm not sure I want to go there I don't think I want to go there but I'm what I'm thinking is like what is what is it that's making me cling to these ideas is it that I love emotions I love illogical behavior do I love art yeah I love all those things I love music and food and all the things that cooking and all the things that make a person a person camaraderie but what are those things aren't those chemical reactions we have with other beings and natural reward systems that are built-in to sort of enhance community and camaraderie so that we say together so that the species survives like what if there's something that supplants that what if there's something that far surpasses that in terms of pleasure and connectivity and we realized that emotions are just these these ancient systems that were put into place when there wasn't wasn't a better option with these better options it's it's much better to get your food from a supermarket than it is to chase down a gazelle for two days until it dies you know of heatstroke you know I mean these these systems improve over time you know this this animal that we are now is very different than we at the animal we used to be why do we want to stay in this imperfect state that seems even more ridiculous that we'd like to stay humans forever and humans are so flawed we mean there's a reason why we we have all this nonsense in the world and our society is sick and we are twisted and confused but a part of it at least has to be that the human animal itself is very flawed because there's no perfect culture you can't just no chalk it up to culture because if you did chalk it up to culture you would say well this culture sucks but if you go to this culture it's amazing there's no crime everyone loves everyone it's completely open there's no need to worry about money because everybody's generous and and everything gets and they're they're very brilliant and they get along and they create new architecture and everything's fantastic it's the perfect society that doesn't exist but isn't that the culture that we can create with the help of psychedelic ah now isn't that what we're shooting for now we're talking human a truly humanistic culture where people were loved is what's happening where it's driven by love and not by hatred and rivalry and scarcity and fear you know and that's the whole thing the psychedelics can be the catalyst that teaches us how to love ourselves how to love each other how to love the earth I mean I know that sounds cliche and and trivial but that is easy act that is in fact what the promise that they hold for us that's why their teacher they're teaching learning tools they can teach us to be the human beings that we would like to be you know right and I and that's the thing that's that's the alternative to this hyper technological future you know and I mean I'm I'm all for technology I'm not against technology but again I think we have to you know we have to we have to bring wisdom to it we have to make a situation where you know it is not controlling us we are controlling it and we're thinking clearly about we have you know this enormous panoply of technologies that can do so many things we have to think about how do we deploy those in such a way to maximize human potential or you know our humanity so that's really I think what the promise that psychedelics hold out and that's you know that's what we're hoping to create you know as it kernel and we're not the only ones obviously a lot of people have this idea and it's happening but that's the idea is to create a place where people can learn this and you know and that's my hope for the future of humanity well it's it's great hope for the future that people that are alive today and I think that's the most important we don't know what's coming but we do know it's here right and I think that's a great hope for what's here and if we don't do it pretty soon there won't be anybody alive to worry about yeah the best way to end this I think possible okay so great great talk thank you I always appreciate you coming here man ethnic illogic search for psychoactive drugs two volumes 1967 and vol 2 2017 50 years of elbow where can people get it can get on Amazon and synergetic press synergetic press synergetic probably them and anything else to tell people about that you got going on I think we've pretty well covered it you know I will send you the links to the videos which are open access to all these lectures so folks can watch them fantastic if they want beautiful you can yeah all right all right always a pleasure always a pleasure - thank you so much thank thank you thank Danis McKenna
