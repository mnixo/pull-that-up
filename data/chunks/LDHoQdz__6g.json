he spends a lot of time in those gyms with a lot of those Mexican boxers that stand in the hole and just bang which isn't color it's not that I but I I wonder how Connors gonna actually have to change a little bit of his boxing and I'm curious to see how well he's only um what about this idea what if what if miesha tate crawled on about a three-point stance literally crawled toward Holly Holm because she couldn't get kicked John Jones style right and just grabbed her ankle picked she punches in my face she's in a punch in the face arms but that's oh my god that's not let's just let me try some today the view on all forms off all fours and someone kicks your arms is horrific great then your dumb SS they get up listening Misha don't do that climbed on top of the octagon and leaped to the center of the wood finish it has the knife guys your thought about that well they can't do that if nature knows ninjutsu right she's gone sleeping dust you can I need that Stanhope's Colin poem on speaker Stanhope you're on Rogen's podcast I just got it what's going on I can't hear us do you hear us Doug on speakerphone he should be able to hear us using speakerphone he's watching oh yeah talk to Joe did you just do it well I'm just saying you're the only one who could talk to Douglas we have we have a shitty way of communicating here we got to figure out a better way to do this because you can only hear us when we're like really close to this phone you're not wired into anything so we have to pass the phone around for you to hear us unless you're like the speaker phone makes me like just trying to fuck with Christchurch thinking he probably forgot to turn his phone off for the puck done Doug no nobody ever turns it off they turn it over we're too addicted to turn it off nobody's nobody trying to shit off it's to never know someone might get in contact with you what the fuck's going on in the Desert Sun whoa whoa no gunfight don't do that so you and the guy are cool so so you're hopeful that it's all gonna work out well we agree we're gonna go back to the podcast all right brother have fun I love you too buddy see ya hey everyone check it don't be scared to tell your friends you love everybody when I say goodbye I like our Doug sword his podcast like and coming up at the very end we find out what bingo did and where she [Music]
