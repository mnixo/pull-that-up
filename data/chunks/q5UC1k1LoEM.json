hello freak bitches so it's a great it's the idea of infinite universes saddens people you know what it just when something looks that big it makes people depressed now when you tell people like maybe there are infinite lives that we are all living you know all consecutively all right next to each other and they're all completely different the idea that is like oh it's like I am just barely getting through the pack the fact that I'm you know living here in America on earth in 2010 I'm barely barely wrapping my head around that the idea that there's billions and billions and then that we're gonna redo this every 15 billion years is gonna be a new Big Bang and people are gonna eventually evolved out of amoebas and fish and fucking lizards and rabbits and monkeys and and then humans with it really it just keeps going over and over and over and over and over and over again can I tell you my new theory of reincarnation yes and it's really intense because I thought it wasn't it freaked me out it's pretty horrible so it's like the common idea of reincarnation if you subscribe to the theory is that you die and you're born again you go through your childhood you grow up and then you die maybe you get born as a cat maybe a butterfly right maybe an amoeba this is what I was thinking because I had a dream once and in this dream I was a kid a little girl and my mom was rubbing my head and I knew I was dying but I didn't know what that meant except I knew it was bad and I could kind of feel myself fading out there was this like white sort of thing happening and then I woke up out of the dream like fuck what a shitty dream so I was thinking like oh fuck what if that's what reincarnation is what if when you die you know when you're driving home one night you've had too many pot lollipops you're listening to coast to coast someone says something shocking that makes you look away from the road you swerve off you slam into a tree you wake up you're here back in your house I got fuck what a shitty dream but you've really died you just reincarnated again into an alternate route in an alternate reality so you literally can't die there's no break this just goes on forever and ever ever and ever no break no stopping no new age going into the light and seeing your parents and your family and taking a going to some new age cosmic spa where you get to shake off all your shitty karma it never stops it just keeps happening again again maybe like right now there's an earthquake and the ceiling collapses and all of a sudden you're just some daydreaming cabbie in Boston like well I was fucking weird I was just imagining I was a comedian in LA but you know what I mean well that's bizarre you're gonna change lives no become the guy rides this body out yeah you snap into an alternate life with all your memories embedded everything already embedded in there because it's an infinite it's an infinite this the the Joe Jon forever what if your consciousness is living a bunch of different life simultaneously and you just can't you can't see them yes like an office filled with cubicles and no one's poking their head over the top of the cubicle yeah right all rolling at the same time yeah or like the way I thought about it is like if you're if there was like something this it sounds really crazy but imagine that each of your fingers this sounds insane but imagine like each of your fingers had their own personality in their own like consciousness or something it's like and you could stick them through some kind of hole where they would forget they were attached to your hand and they would just think that they were their own individual self you know what I mean like maybe that's what we are we're just like little fingers protruding into this dimension from some infinite thing but the product of protruding into this dimension is we get instantaneous amnesia and part of like dealing with a shock of coming into this dimension is we forget our true identity and replace it with our ego structure Wow well one of the things that yes
