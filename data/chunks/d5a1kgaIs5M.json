the girag an experience there's Amish port yeah I don't think they're really Amish I don't think you're allowed to fuck in front of a camera if you're Amish I think it steals your soul far as that Indians how's that work Asian I thought no no no no Asian you're not allowed to see the vagina you know let's see pubic hair or the genitals they blur all that out you gotta would you why would you want to see Jane here it doesn't look weird or does look weird are you being racist you talking about positive energy I go to Panda Express I uh what I God he's had some pics pixelation in his mouth from a man I have not and that's that's right why would you say that right if you don't take that back that's gonna get out that I have that as never to ever happen and I never ever want to do that it's out there thank you it's on percent you just put it out there what is this ten percent you keep saying why do you keep saying ten percent well why is Brian keep saying ten percent it's a running joke based in truth I had some issues I had some situations in my life and I I like to put numbers on things and based on these factors and experiences and thought processes we came to the number of uh ten percent gay I'm open with it you know in it it's not would you say it's not I understand what you just said what you just said was a statement that would really work if everybody knew what you were saying but I don't know we're saying so what you're saying is a ten percent gay I'm open with it what does that mean does that mean you're ten percent gay yes I came out on my podcast probably like six months ago you came out ten percent yes what's so funny I didn't hear any beers in there Jamie go get me a beer you need a beer on this one this is gonna get rid there you know I we don't have to talk can that hand that ashtray over this way that's an ashtray Joe needs a beer and an ashtray a new cigar cigar and it's also based on when you were in the fill of Philippines or Taiwan wasn't it that you yeah that that factored into did you know uh Joe did you know any of this part at this story I heard rumors online but since I love Brody like a brother since we were brothers in the art of stand-up comic comedy since we are old school comedy store brethren it's having fun having fun matters it does and that's why you should tell us about what happened in Thailand what wasn't fun it was you enjoyed it no to completion everybody people hung out you know it's that's the cops come plugging buildings on fire bodies everywhere what happened people hung out look without g'day without without giving too much away we do explain it in my show um when you go to pay you guys leave us hanging you know I'll tell you but I don't wanna give it away because if people see on the show you got a big audience they'll see it on the show again well I'll join even oi okay trust me this is a puzzling case the people going to want to examine this from every angle they're going to want to find out I guarantee the the amount of people that download that Ice House chronicles we brought this up they're going to go through the roof what number Brian 42 what it isn't know figure it out Google okay all I'm saying is I went to Bangkok we had fun you go to an area where they all these different bars and they have it the other they have to get togethers the ping pong balls the the the young Vietnamese girls who will sit next to you for coca-cola that kind of thing may you watch them dance I'll dance for you they'll sit by your side they smell good sometimes they're topless if you really want to be with them you can spend the money and it's actually not that much okay I want to say that so they have a few areas like that a lot of the Westerners hang out and go there it's fun it's different simple simple it's simple and then you go upstairs and then it's a little different you're getting a little like whoa that looks a little different in there that the bone structure is interesting but I see some other people dancing and then there's one club that you go in it's like I guess the best one up there and it's just they're having a party it's fun the girls look like girls but you can tell like maybe some are guys I guess but it was one of these ladyboy bars and we're hanging out there having fun and they'll you know they they will touch you they're very forward they will touch your leg but they look like girls they smell like girls they look like girls they've had the treatments and you're sitting there and you're alone by yourself you're in you're in Bangkok you're working on hangover 2 they um touch and it's normal to get aroused and it was interesting and I knew I was sixteen hours away timezone from America and I know comedians have gone down to Brazil or Thailand there's old history of it so I didn't really pursue it there but I thought about it and then maybe I came back on another night I go you know people thought I was with you you said maybe no you came back right well I was there for like two weeks and rylann twice in maybe I came back well now you're making the story confusing okay well what one wall or I came back another night I said maybe I will come back that's all what you said that's the reason why I stopped you so I want this to be for me at that point I'm probably 3% gay and that's based off getting picked on as a kid like Brody you walk like a girl do you understand Jimin they growing up in Tarzana I got picked on a lot are you saying that someone can make you homosexual by if they picked on you enough 3% would be a hundred no 3% wouldn't make it a hundred but if somebody as a child you're in third grade and there's a group of girls or even guys you go oh look at Brody oh he walks he looks like he's gay you walk like a gay gay kid you're always smiling and it was like it was a nice kid and then I guess because of a tilted pelvis I walked weird when I got picked on for that so I always felt like wow I guess I think I'm gay maybe guess I'm gay I don't know Wow wait a minute so is this like the secret is this the power of suggestion is that one of those things is a power being Boyd so being bullied can turn you homosexual it didn't 3% 3% yes if they're saying it enough people are saying Brody you what if I saw myself walk if I sat and I saw myself walk I would think sky walks a little gay well if you if you think that why wouldn't you change your walk I tried why not I try to get like go have lists in my shoe election which side is tilted which ones down which ones I think my right shoulder you think I'll show it to you do you know for sure is this just gonna go to a voodoo doctor it's not a food it was like an area chiropractor a chiropractor get physical thing chiropractors are a lot like voodoo doctors there's a lot of chiropractors that just fucking move your neck around take your money it's like not a lot going on I've been to good chiropractors and I've been in chiropractors when you're like what what just happened just give that guy $60 to rub my neck for 15 seconds that's what it feels like I'm going to adjust your degree your anterior posture your c7 you see sit like throw some terms at you that are like completely unnecessary and very verbose and long and then the cracking neck real quick correct and it kind of feels good I love them they crack the neck yeah it kind of feels good when they crack your neck but uh I'm not sure if it works I'm not relieves like it's like a relief does it I do that sometimes it does some guys are doing good at it but sometimes like what it would just happen there I'd like to get a chiropractic massage I'd be good from a dude take care of myself I don't care if it's a guy miss massage I don't get like take them I don't care if it's a guy chiropractor okay but right I'll take a female masseuse you don't like our massages I would take it like a sports massage hmm but not like it for a baseball team like hey bro you were hanging out with the baseball players uh your massage a masseuse oh yeah if you get a massage from a dude you want the lights to be on you want like fucking Motley Crue playing the bachelor to be in the mall you don't want any scented candle those are fucking you know gets right music thanks so anyway you go back to this place yeah and you're pretty much aware that you're hanging out with lady boys but this let me tell you that 5% gay and that's due to do two things in college due to two comments we don't lead Akash you go from three to five like immediately the smell you want to give me a real number so we could fucking move on with confidence Joe I feel like Factory I'm factoring in the boolean s I'm factoring some bass lesson you because I don't want to be a part of your you sure you're not polite all right you know I love you right okay I went there let's say six percent gay six Jesus Christ by the end of this story we're gonna be at 86 percent I went to Bangkok six percent gay and I'll go you know what I'm in Bangkok let me push it to the limit and see what happens and if I like it I'm into it or if it humiliates me no one's around this is my big opportunity and I really didn't do that much and I had the chance so they didn't do that much but you said you got to Bangkok you were 66 percent six percent six percent when you got to Bangkok but then when you went to the place you knew they were lady boys and you went back when you say you would have to say you went a little gayer than you were when you got there we'll go what it was more out of experience I like to check this experience out but check me out take the temperature but it was a gay experience it was I mean what do you define as a gay experience there's a guy in you what happened all right hold on it's a transsexual a guy um it's way closer to a guy than me okay have guys been cool make any sense you guys please you listen to be Bo you don't even listen people I said it I made I'd made an error I said is it a transsexual guy no it's not as close to a guys make correct it's more woman than it is a man it looked and felt like a woman here's a reality of transsexuals this is the hot cold hard reality is chromosomal that's it and as far as like behavior and appearance and maybe even like like sex like you might enjoy certain aspects of sex more the transsexual than you would an angry overweight cigarette smoking woman who's got a head like a frying pan you know if you found what is that transgender woman this is the picture that she's pleased with what's flying come on man well the internet you can't do that you're gonna ruin everything for everybody keep going my point is I would rather have a sexual experience with a transgender that was really sexy and sweet rather than a big angry woman that's bit like a football player okay I'm with you if you want to have a sexual experience if you're a man most likely you won't have a sexual experience with something feminine yes and the reality of femininity versus masculinity there's a line where shit gets blurry yeah and that that rhyme that line is big angry Fred Flintstone looking women yes versus like Thai ladyboy that's actually very cute yes where do you go what are your top you're in fuckin off the script urine you're in Thailand yeah Berlet you're alone you're not in Thailand in if you're not in Thailand if you're anywhere if it's the only three people on the planet it's you the the Thai ladyboy and the big Fred Flintstone looking angry ok she's away now maybe with a Fred Flintstone or boogers in her nose I won't be well I won't be breath I'll let her give me a massage sure feet smell ah why is it's get a transducer a regular girl there was those two you could probably got a nice young because he think I think that would be you know a different thing I think also there's the feeling of exploitation that comes with having a having a sexual experience with a prostitute that's a female that you don't get if it's a prostitute that's a male you know if you go to a female prostitute like there's this thing where you know if you think about the concept of prostitution you think that women are being exploited that's like one of the main negative aspects of prostitution and then also as a father you start thinking why are there prostitutes most likely because they didn't have a good family structure they didn't have a good father figure they'd have a good mother whatever it was it's not good most likely there could be some weird people to just enjoy sex and don't mind getting paid for because it's better than being a waitress that's possible too but when you think about a woman most likely you're thinking about someone being sexually manipulated and someone being taken advantage of and objectified and you think of a bad situation but you don't think about that with a guy you don't especially a guy that used to be a guy who used to be a guy and then became a girl like and decided to do it because he wanted to do it like he made the choice wanted to do it felt like that's who he is he's better suited me than I wanted to be or did he like made his choice that you definitely make the choice to have surgery but you feel it no it's what you have to get it done I can't tell I mean there's no way I could tell you what they feel but I would assume that they're telling the truth and when I've talked to I mean we had buck angel on the podcast who's a transgender woman to man and you know he says that he's always known inside that he should be a man yeah I mean his personality was oweth and that's the only time he was ever happy was it when he was allowed to be a man did this person feel real Brody when I was like 1/8 from the path here this lucky let's not do you open the path here because I think what we're talking about is actually a very important subjects where you'll have to define it very clearly no no hold on sorry you have to define this is a P go P P okay Kelly I'm right back yeah yeah no we're gonna let you back in there's a door out there you're punching a coat I I don't think that anyone of us can tell someone what they feel inside their body and I've talked to way too many people that say that they they know that they should have been a man or they know that they should have been a woman if that's the case if they're saying that yeah you you you can't argue with that the host if you look at the spectrum of human fuck-ups you know the genetic animality the variations in color of skin and color of hair and the size of teeth and all the different variations of human beings of course some people were supposed to be boys and didn't come out boys no doubt about it and I think one day they're going to be able to do something where they give these people some sort of a genetic manipulation and they're going to literally turn them into DoubleX chromosome women and I think I think that's not that thing that's the beginning of like the ability to manipulate the human genome the ability to change a person's DNA but until then what do they have they have they you know they have surgery and they have hormonal you know hormonal treatments but if you had to choose between a guy who did that a male born male who did that and became like a really sexy transgender or a disgusting angry woman who hates men disgusting disgusting angry a woman that hates men you would go with that fucking hilarious you're hilarious there's only three people on the planet wait so your friend leap on the planet Isis for you the angry fucking project you're gonna try to turn into a lady with a big giant stinky feet you're a really beautiful ladyboy uh definitely number one I would definitely be with a woman show why you wouldn't be with a ladyboy I don't even like if I saw one of the post like penises you know like post-surgery prick penises I wouldn't even look at it you don't have to look at it how about you have to look at it how about you comes with special cockles show show Brian like those 3d glasses yes you look at it you're getting through that what she looks perfect a question Brian look at the three people on the whole planet most likely I kill myself let me tell you something three people on the planet I'm going to go to the highest fucking mountain I'm gonna stand there look at it and I'm gonna say fuck it and take a swan dive and then we're gonna have to start fresh because I'll be the last Bale on the planet there'll be no impregnated people those two people are going to die that's going to be a rap unless they milk my balls for sperm when they find my dead body within 24 hour period my sperms staying alive most likely the human species ends there Brian yeah so yeah go with the tranny is that okay you know that's gender Pro you flow as Brian one quick question I'd be sitting there eating that big fat real pussy getting bitched at I don't Oh like what everything's newsreels please actually one push sir please so however if and when obviously I'm talking about on the podcast and let's say this topic does appear on my show this ladyboy ten percent issue am I going to receive a lot of heat on it not only because from who I don't know from omkaram fuck'em man you're gonna receive heat from people no matter what no matter what you do there's gonna be people that don't like this they're gonna be people adult like that dude you can't avoid heat if you're public you get heat yeah but this is this is personal pub I've seen neil degrasse tyson take heat who's that how dare you you know anything i don't know what don't say i don't know anything i follow sports joe that's his ball nothing about science nothing about space hmm I've heard of stuff or - Bill Nye I've heard of I love weather I love geography I like geography I'm into the moon I'm okay so your entire lat oh there you go you're with the ladyboy you go back you go to the club sit down how the mean do you know right away that this used to be a guy oh definitely well you know no no no let me tell you someone man he used to be is whatever I didn't see an Adam's apple do you remember the episode the man show that we did with that transgender woman who was beautiful her name was like vanity or something like that okay vaguely remember that dude she was like really pretty I'm like like whoa like stunningly beautiful and was born a man and we we did a segment where the guy got strapped to a table was called make me hard and we put a guy was strapped to table put a light box over his dick like never go off when he got an erection so of course we controlled the button so it would be like whenever like midgets were eating bananas or we had this transgender get out and the transgender does a dance for this guy and then she puts a whipped cream on her nipples the guy sucks the whipped cream off her tits shit big fake tits and then she pulls out a pie remember that she pulls out a penis at the end of this and fuck the light starts flashing beaming me he was saying I remember that her penis looked like like a like a primate penis that had been poisoned like if he took a chimp and you poisoned the chimp and he saw his dick after he was dying of poison let me ask a question what happens to the penis was just a regular looking penis on a beautiful woman with breasts good skin to be an issue hair the penis would be an issue for sure if you had to do something with it like if the deal was like yeah like she she's beautiful but she's got a dick and she's gonna blow you but you gotta blow her no okay okay okay okay I'm out you said that's where you're out you're out on that okay if you're out on that I'm out with you okay we're both out we're out so I guess I'm temper said yeah yeah there you go I guess I'm temper said thank you um so you know it's a little if yes so you sitting there yes I loved it and what what uh did you were the any of them in there actually born women or was it all lady boys you know I probably mean most likely the lady running the place was a was a woman but I think most of the the dancers were worm a leper and um but it's part of that culture just to let you know it's very accepted yes to see lady boys all around working at Starbucks walking down the street why do you think that is I don't know it's just I don't know it's a different culture over there but is it a cultural choice or is it a genetic thing where there's a great percentage of people that feel like they should have been a woman I think there's something about genetics I don't know about the the I don't know if like Asians or the Thai people or more you know app to having that gene I would wonder if there's some stats for that as far as like women to men transgenders like buck buck angel I want to some stats that show like what countries have more transgender women to men good question I went if talent does Thailand actually have more transgender makes an accepted part of the culture I mean by bet you down in Brazil there's a lot it is except it may be accepted down there right so um you can tell us as much as you want about this experience so you could end right yeah I'm willing to talk the only thing I'm thinking about is I don't want to give too much away on the show okay and I gonna keep going people gonna see the show anyway awesome you've actually already said it on a podcast before and we got you up to 12% gay always forget later than a way to win you brought him up to 12 yeah we got him up to 12 because there was something else that he does like pregnant I got confused he'll stop here pressure I feel like you guys use me a couple more questions and bullied him into an extra percentage of being gay that's how here he said he got bullied into being 3 he might have but I how I was walking I think it was because you still like pop click on like guy porn at home or something I forget by the time I have to write here what you can click on what that that's a percentage that's residue percentage what are you working at your noble yeah you're not describing fucking nuclear power pal all right I can't about being gay residual I came back quantum energy and came on his back I had a quantum gayness is what we're I had access to you porn and I did wander and click in something I would never ever do and it's something that add its you know it's like did people see Brokeback Mountain did any straight guy see Brokeback Mountain I'm sure there were I'm sure they saw two guys making love in the movie or whatever and they actually felt good about knowing these guys loved each other and it may even aroused a straight guy knowing that two guys are passionately in love with each other okay let me show you do what they would let me tell you from here first of all if you you felt that from watching that movie it means you don't have a sense of humor and you probably weren't there with another man who also has a sense of humor because if you did as soon as a Jake Ellenberger know what's his name Jake Gyllenhaal sorry Jake Ellenberger who's never made for a killer Ellenberger he's a professional mixed martial arts fight all right Gyllenhaal spits on his hand and then shoves his dick oh right into the into that yeah right into Heath's but I don't think you would you'd have to laugh a little I mean I didn't see the movie we're only you I'm saying somebody got aroused by that juice not gay hmm sue boy I'm not sure I agree with you there I think give that that scene aroused you I think you're probably gay I'm not saying the scene arouse you maybe that too humans aren't so loved together and it's it's passionate and it's almost wrong it's taboo taboo there you go it's almost taboo to say that you know what that scene from Brokeback Mountain it did start something I bet it didn't I never saw the movie broke never saw the massage I saw it in Brussels married third the relationship between Heath Herring and Jake Gyllenhaal was very similar to one of my jokes is that I think I don't believe in bisexual men I think there's gay men and then there's really gullible straight dudes who get talked into blowin crafty gay guy that's me I'm 10% gay and that's what that movie was what that movie was was Jake Gyllenhaal was the really crafty gay dude and Heath Richard what is his name my pleasure ledger keep Reggie I call me tearing Heath Herring Heath Ledger sorry Heath Heath Herring his another MMA fighter Heath Ledger was just like sort of a 9-volt battery brain dude just kind of a dude wasn't that smart and he was out there alone and hanging out with this guy and bunch of fucking sheep around and just got into it fuck it got talked into it but it ruined his life wrecked his life he really wasn't even gay he was talked into Joey watch yeah who's skiing a family they just well you got with into it okay I want to get talked into it you want to I would not oh I thought you said I want I'm hearing things oh hi woods take it back to Thailand you went away ladyboy and how does it escalate went to the second floor what do you think when you're walking up those stairs biggest mistake of my life ya know I you know what I'll tell you what I wanted to see see if I can not get it up see if I had the temptation I could do whatever I want this is my big chance everyone says Brodie you're gay you're gay I know it's eight now I'm in a room and tile and cards and you like I'll show you or Oh taking fun a Brody oh and you know what I don't need to go into detail but I pushed it to the limit my one as far as I could go okay did I perform I will go on record saying no I did not never have don't want to perform oral on a man can I go on record saying that I got you but what would happen well that didn't happen okay okay what didn't happen also is kissing kissing didn't I don't want to kiss a man to be clear there was no kissing no kissing no race car driving no meteorite impact many other things didn't tell you make an unromantic I'm sorry I apologize I'm a very romantic guy go on and you know some stuff I tried you know mmm touch this I did not I'll be honest I look I looked at it how close no no your scope no no probably what is that three feet two and a half feet from the ass or the dick this is it look at the penis there's a difference because if you're three feet from the dick that's a safe judgment time you can get left you can move right correct three feet from the ass no I wasn't you know there you're basically there okay no no no time out time out are you saying three feet I'm talking on my face right your face three feet from his dick or his ass can I say one things can I'd say another thing yes you can see whatever you want never did nor do I want to take my face and put it in the the man's ass okay can I go on record saying that now we know if there was any debate before it's been squashed okay now you turn it around okay and I'm in Bangkok and I go well people say I'm gay turn around let me look at it oh how far away how far were three feet from the dick yeah what's it look like is it hard at least I don't know I'll tell you what no it was uh it was what she described it wasn't normal something happened to it it's been poisoned whatever there's some cat can you start injecting your body with estrogen I would assume you dick shrivels up it's not necessary any more than it knows it just like when you inject your body with testosterone if you're a woman that's to have men's levels of testosterone plus those women bodybuilders they grow dicks take their clit extends it's like when you find like a dead body hanging for like that's been there for a week it's stretch different done different thing different thing bro okay so the dick was soft when I didn't touch it okay but when when you say have tapped it just to see what it's like is it sure they really touched it will never touch the man's penis how do you how do you even know that you're in a dream unless you touch it right I guess yeah I just touched with no stimulation at all it's like that thing that you do when you're lucid dreaming the way you like practice lucid dreaming is by walking around your house and every time you get to a doorknob or doorway you knock in the doorway am I dreaming and if you're not dreaming you you feel it you knock on the door but if you're dreaming your hand just goes right through and you go oh my goodness I'm dreaming and that's how you lucid dream it so it's like a massive device so whatever you see a dick you should thump it and go am I dreaming no that should be a jade oh I got set up y'all just gonna set up we all dream about dead Joe's are do God knows dig I don't want it I don't it y'all have to ye I know you wanna touch it but you did what you did okay I can't use a doctor touch as a doctor what did I just did it to officially say I have done it do what you do t residency she's right Miami state Arizona stay enjoy it okay doctor please keep so there was a kiss scene I don't wanna quit nice guys smell like she smelled good she smelled it was a girl well okay what point in time here's the question when you become a transgender when do we decide to call you a girl is it when you make the choice because if you still have a penis its becomes very I don't know if you have to hire she was cut off I don't know if you have to be on certain hem certain uh you know medication hormones I guess it it's just at for courtesy it's just the person's choice like if you decided tomorrow that you wanted to be a Eustace that's other girl's name what's the girl's name Doug Becky Beth Moore no just evens no you me you decide to be a woman oh yeah okay okay okay Becky Stevens I would start calling you a woman I would start calling you her USA she respect and respect and I'm taking hormones at respect but did you know that there's queer do you know queers those are like gay guys like you've taken the word over no you know that all LBT cutie well as forgiving as lesbians bisexuals gay transgender queer the queer ones a strange one and the queer one is they they want to be whatever they want to be they want to be a man they want to be a woman they want to be oh really you want to be yeah they like want to be they or they want to be it they heavily er they have different designations 15% queer if they choose 10% gay but 15% queer I like it yeah I like it we're moving closer to our goal I feel like a homing network and I'm selling queer we're moving closer to the goal of 86% gay by the end of the podcast we can do it ladies and gentlemen all we need is more stories we got more Brody coming up right after this look at the design of this we get this from China but let me assure you the quality is remarkable his lips are soft for any cock no no no no come on Bryan asshole dude you're ruining everything we're so close to getting him up to 25% I'd smooches I think the real numb dough I know what is he honest no what is it saying that's nice Kyle look look it's not come on man 25% here's why rush of it this is what I said at that I'm gonna be honest with you what do you fire at that moment okay at the moment where that guy is sucking on your dick I happen in person all the time I think you're a 40% gay are you are you kidding for the moment presenting this could mess oh my now for that moment what I'm offering you is a fluctuating scale of gayness yook but you brought me all the way up to the world as high as 40 when you come in a man's mouth he's give me a I think I'm being very generous a bit very generous by often year 40 because for most of the population when you come in a man's mouth you hit a hundred and you don't wanna know yes you do yes you did you say if you were in prison you got locked what prison Brody I don't plan on going to prison like just a nice guy I don't break any fucking laws I did I defy you to find me like job you won't with prison if you would be because that's the only place we have no options a sexual part why I was I know options at night most people don't go to prison Brody it's a dumb thing to bring up most people don't go to prison and when they walk upstairs on their own without a security guard having them shackled risk to and cuff you like pretending hey they brought me to the mess hall and then they sucked my dick that's not what happened okay go back to me go back to me being below the hole back to that that they didn't blow the buzzer and give you your one hour outside to play basketball and you wind up getting your dick sucked that's not what happened Brody you made a choice to go up those stairs there's nothing wrong with it but you're unfortunate ain't gay I don't believe those numbers Ryan what do you think when you come in a guy's mouth what are we up to I think I was just say I did that I'm just assuming um he's da but say definitely 25 I don't like your numbers Brian that's a shocker you've never brought that number up to me I cannot believe that Joe said 40-person I said 40% because I love you I should have said 100 man keeping a man's mouth can I say something I think it's almost immediately gays fuck can I say ass thing you could do cousin fucking the guy now did he spit it back in your mouth Brody what is more gay what is more gonna say something to you hold on sir please I'm gonna say it a little I know what's gay if you think
