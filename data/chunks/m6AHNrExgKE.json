the Joe Rogan experience it was a place in Australia and the the property owners like the ranch has called me up and they said you need to come out and shoot some of the foxes like they're devastating our lambs and I end up going out there and when I was driving in with the four-wheel drive at night with the high beams on I seen this massive big black and white boy walking between the flock of sheep with a lamb in its mouth it was this pig and it got a taste for meat and it happens all the time like so a big boy especially a mature animal will get a taste for meat in harsher conditions and they'll just stick to meet after that and end up catching up with his pig the next morning and shot it with the bow it actually attacked me with the first shot wasn't perfect and it charged me and I end up like stabbing it to death I was on a slope like this on the mountain cheese and it was really a battle like any hand up hooking the bow out of me hand because when he charged me I put an arrow on and shot and just went down one side and like hit one lung and it just infuriated this boar and he was on me and when I was fending him off with the bow he's tossed went into the bottom limb of the bow or the cam or something like that and ripped the bow out of me hand and I ended up getting me knife off me and I end up like stabbing this pig was like trying to run me over holy shit how big was it it was a big boys like big meeting it made Ayden boy like this and like how many pounds you know I fucking big that's how many pounds 300 probably not 300 our mountain boys just get real solid yeah probably 200 or something like that and anyway I end up stabbing this thing to death and when I end up cutting it open its whole insides like its whole stomach was like lambs hocks like the feet the bottom of the feet where they can't swallowing skulls and just like little bits of wool and stuff like that we've just been going around and just picking these lambs off and killing them yeah and it's a really known occurrence in Australia now that if things get harsh so just go though just because they're they're just absolutely ruthless so just walk right between the Sheep and just fucking grab a limb walk off of it chew it up and eat up dude how much comes out in the fucking forest bro yeah that's where the next no wonder swamp thing happened well I was thinking this once they found out that in some plants some plants contain DNA from salmon because the salmon yeah we used as fertilizer by the plant as it decomposed it got into the actual plant itself and you can actually somehow or another through some sort scientific process that I'm too stupid to understand they can actually detect salmon in the actual plant itself we're closed so if you were whacking off on that tree and that tree it's every day that's your spot you went down to that titty tree yeah and and whacked off on the roots yeah and then like after a while you did an analysis and you found your DNA in the tree itself yeah yeah oh be great man if it maintains the information of everything that walked off on it you have a little Sun made out of wood one day mmm they had a kid in our town of one time does he's got made his son a wooden shirt that I tell you that a wooden shirt yeah he made his son a shirt out of plywood for Christmas what yeah he wanted a kid to wear it oh yeah he did and I remember I was armed wait a minute is it a stiff shirt or is it he make it like little itty-bitty tiny pieces of plywood and weave it all together oh no I was pretty stiff and the dad was a yeah like an Elvis impersonator you know what dad was an Elvis impersonator at a casino or did he do it at carnivals notice locally oh um but we didn't even money in that no no money really I think he's probably an alcoholic but he had uh he had four kids and one of them he made I was going walking home one night and I heard him in the garage and he's making like a Sun like a like a for Christmas like a wooden shirt like a you know oh yeah oh not as nice that one is nice wouldn't shirt yeah can you get oh but that's a like a sculpture yeah that's nice can you get one more that's like like if you went over someone's house and they have a wooden shirt on a hanger like and they think that's cute just leave no now this kid needed it because people we just we just get that salmon sculpture yeah yeah it's a framed wooden shirt it looks like he's used to beat him up because of his wooden sure no people used to beat him up anyway on the bus well the wooden shirt would protect you from a lot of it's a healthy idea and it helped him where that would ensure you better shut the fuck I swear to God he did my kids not walking around with wood over his body like that not happy that would be yeah this was your pads inside it looked heavy fuck no dude who do you think his dad is estee lauder ladies so to play devil's advocate here so that that stuff that comes in those dick pills you can get from other steroids but it happens to be in those dick but you certainly can yes but but that is one narrative that you that took clear that you could say what's in these dick pills I'm not saying I'm sayin can do that that's true but it's in such a small amount in his body and it wasn't in his body before and it wasn't in his body after which showed that it was only in his body and extremely small amounts for a small wind all trace amount yeah but a small window of time so it's not like he had it's not even like this stuff which is a metabolite which is showing a response to the body you be the body responding to the steroids then let me ask this Joe okay why does no other fighter have any puker picograms that this pulsating effect really well that's not true I mean the other fighter tested met Frank near tested positive for something that two years Tom Lawlor tested but Frank Mir didn't go through the same steps that John Jones did he didn't provide them with I forget what the exact there was there was something that John did also that lowered his sentencing and it was remember he's performing yes it was cooperating with you sada yeah or or agreeing to cooperate with you sada yeah that well then we're just cool with that listen I don't even know that mean I don't either but let me ask you this if I agreed to you sada to be an informant snitch stitches correct but unless you're John there no one can beat you up so you're fine but the thing is is the only way I can inform you is if something that of that I'm knowing that I know of I can't inform you if just off that circulation that was what I asked Nowitzki I was like if he didn't do anything wrong like and what he gonna offer cuz if unless he took something unless you know what you're doing like if I'm an informant for the FBI or for the feds for a cocaine right I know my cocaine I'm not gonna get Joe Blow that makes my fucking expresso you get the guy who knows the ins and outs of cocaine right that's Jim again that's all my guy cool or they have a conversation with him and he says he can provide them with information where how guys are getting away with passing drugs and how would you know about that unless you're in on that no I don't understand again to me all of this is a little too much of coincidence that the best fighter on the planet has these issues the best fighter in the planet Earth also ran away from a hit and run smashed into a girl and broke her arm he also drove his car into a tree he's a reckless person who takes a lot of chances and he does some at least in the past has done some things that are not very wise this could social under that or it could fall is correct or stop again the plate Devils out yeah I'm not accusing them of anything play devil's advocate or a guy who is that loosey-goosey outside that gun might have taken some performance-enhancing things because that would be the similar traits I I think that look I there's certain things that this administration's doing foreign policy-wise that I think are good and makes sense there are other things that I think you know you just leave you scratching your head but that's like every administration I guess my point is we've gotten away from that ability right I have conversations I go out to dinner with folks that you know on the on the on the hard left and when you talk to them they fully believe fully believe that President Trump is a Russian puppet a witting asset of Putin who is just doing Putin's bidding and they honestly honestly believe that and nothing is going to shift them off that position when you have a you know that sort of frame of reference you don't have the ability to look at anything rationally and say yeah okay I like this policy related to China it's about time we call them out and say that you obviously have not been a fair trading partner right that's something that every administration has agreed to but has never done anything about so you would think that everybody will be able to say mmm makes sense yeah I like it everybody should be able to say the immigration you know system here in the in the states is somewhat dysfunctional it needs fixing everybody's talked about that and yet they can't do it because they've got this this mindset that that prevents them from having any sort of conversation any sort of rational discussion that could lead to some compromise that could then advance the ball and make this government more functional for that Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's animated it's on YouTube now of you and him coming over your house in a limousine and you either it was a lion or a tiger tiger theme of the line for the tiger dude it is one of the craziest fucking stories I always went for people who don't know I got to hang out with you at one of my shows one time and it was a great I had the best time talking about everything what made you think you could get a tiger so I'm in prison at the time so I'm in prison I'm talking to my car dealer at the time and he has a he has some cars to belong to a friend of Mines esposa friend of ours and he's discussing if he doesn't pay for these cars imma sell these cars to someone and get some horses lions tigers I'll see you do can you get me some tigers yeah man how cool that baby because I had a bunch of friends because man that man you be in the Aston Martin or Ferrari ever that would
