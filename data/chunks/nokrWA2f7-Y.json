and if they don't fuck up I don't trust him I my father my father used to say if someone doesn't say the word fuck or if their name is an initial don't trust them yeah that's such creepy one initials are creepy yeah but you never know it's like it's not a hard fast rule no I give everyone the fair shake but I'm looking yam mmm yeah if they frickin if they're all the time it's frickin this and we're making ficky yeah I had that once I never heard that one yes someone said a motherfucker yeah I wasn't happy about shut the front door is one like mom's like to do around there yes yes yeah mmm yeah I come from a wop South Philly family so it's like a fucking Richard Pryor it's the Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve is like Oh Richard is like him on the Sunset Strip you know surprisingly doesn't swear Teddy Atlas I know teddy does I I've seen you know animated he I don't they tell you he gives very show very animated but yeah he doesn't really yeah it's like freaking this and freaky yeah yeah what the Frick he says what the Frick it's nuts yeah you know who also doesn't swear Henry Rollins Rollins does not does not swear yeah Brett makes note of it note that I don't swear I mean I feel like that happened in the second half of his life Black Flag records not so much yeah I think he's trying to get I almost say more people to listen to him like trying to be more mainstream but he's trying to eliminate the noise sure and what he's doing sure yeah he's a brilliant mind he is yeah yeah unlike me I mean you're really Rogan you've hit a you've hit a little snag here Teddy Atlas Jordan Peterson Shapiro Henry Rollins then this now dude I love your music we're saying you were saying you know about fuck-ups before the shows and I don't know anybody who's an artist who doesn't fuck things up like if you if you really create there's something about being like legitimately creative there has to be something wrong with well you're wired differently yeah so what what we perceive as what what people see perceive is bit fucking up isn't to us yeah so technically it's a fuck of in reality to us is just just behavioral it's just how it works I suspect traits yeah if you were working in an office in Human Resources you there's no way I'd be gone in like three hours yeah yeah but before that I probably put a bullet through my head just give up at that point some people can do it though so people it's not a problem no I did just wired that way from but I knew from such an early age no I'm not wired this way you know I'm saying yeah me too yeah I I was terrified again a job oh when I was a child yeah it's fearful but now well you've done though man it's I've told you how much of a fan I am but I'm such a fan of how punk-rock you've built all of this outside of what you were expected to do this show is a fuck you really it's just what it is you know I mean this is that this is what happens when you don't calculate yeah well there's no count you just do what you want to do yes is what happens people don't have the balls to do that it's it's a little bit balls it's a little bit Fear Factor gave me a lot of financial freedom sure that was that that helped too sure yeah yeah news radio did a little bit of a fear factor did way more it just gave you gave me enough money so I go okay the money part I got yeah so now let's just have some fun sure but look what it's become yeah change people's lives man that's weird that's the weird part that that wasn't that wasn't anticipated it wasn't a part of the plan yeah it's supposed to be smoking weed and having a good time yeah well you're not aware until you're aware and so people say yo you've helped me through tough times this show is God you know I people tell me about your show you like that guy gets me through tough times you know and that's what's more important than that well people need friends you know and they need community and one of the things that this show has shown by having all my friends on all the times like this is a tight group of people that love each other and care about each other and want to promote that way of thinking right being you can do that you can get through life and I'll support each other like this backstabby bullshit that people get involved in that is so detrimental to you to them to everyone to the sense of community that you you you create around each other a clip of yours when viral of you talking about just get the fucking negative people to walk away from me and I had that around me and it was draining my spirit these are the worst things but it's when you're living a certain way and everything's fast it's the same with comedy and you're on the road yeah you're grinding it out you can't always analyze you can't always step back and say this is why things are fucked up but everything's moving so fast right you know and it was until I took that time and said there's cancer in my life that they're basically there are emotional barnacles yeah you know what I mean they and and once you once you cut the cancer out you see how different things become and it's it's kind of I didn't realize it was that easy yeah you can do it you can do it but to them to it's a good lesson for them to be cast aside and for them if they're smart or if they have some awareness or some objectivity they're gonna look at themselves and say you know what I'm a fucking mess yeah like I'm negative all the time and people don't want to be around me I was real negative when I was young so was I yeah it's it's a it's not something that's insurmountable you can get over it yeah and and it's whatever whatever whatever hand you've been dealt you have to realize the reality is situation bro there's people living in mud huts in places that are smiling yeah and though and I have the balls to be complaining about your you're right right and not getting enough sleep I don't like the trout eat right you just really have to assess that and say this isn't the way I should be thinking or processing information because we're blessed yeah to do what we do you know what I mean you make people laugh bro for a living I know there's also there's a balance that you can achieve between discipline and the creative people like we were talking about like yourself who are just off you know hand tattoos why something about you people see you though the fuck is this guy doing to follow you when you're walking through a store sure there's a balance between that and then real disciplined people like you know fucking Navy SEAL type cats yeah you learn from them too sure and you go well there you can incorporate some of that into your life as well and it helps balance out all the the whacky creative aspects of it and it makes you a little bit more productive a little bit happier little bit no dead prez they had a song discipline makes things easier yes to great fucking saw this it's a great song because it's real it really does discipline makes things easier it is real organize your life like for me what when I'm I feel Most High of course you know because of how you live but your body feeds into your how your mind works through when you feel what when I'm when I was talking about that those horrible negative years it was also dictated by terrible diet terrible you know not that I'm in great shape or anything now but I've changed things and I felt it up here yeah you know what I mean that's what people don't think you feel it in your brain I feel like a different person man thrive enter I spar a little bit or whatever it is feel different I get more energy where you would think logic would dictate you would get tired right I'm like now I'm ready to right now no crazy right you know what I mean he's counterintuitive it is it's but it's um but again like you said it's discipline you know it's you know my mother's making gravy and meatballs it's it's hard to say him I said oh settle down yeah you can eat that once a week sure once a week ago just go whole hog you know gravy that's such an East Coast Italian word my grandparents in New Jersey it was gravy to everyone it's not in New York Philly in Jersey right it's barely New York it's like it's not Manhattan no fight now they'll fight you they'll say it's sauce yeah fuckin gravy man not do this yeah gravy's New Jersey New Jersey like old-school Italian soprano style yeah that's that's gravy Philly's gravy did you go south of Philly it becomes sauce again yes yeah it is good it's weird how like if you go to it have you been Italy yes you my most a lot of my family still over there the food is fucking fantastic level but it's a different kind of food it's I what what Italian Americans did yeah is is a totally different cuisine yeah it's interesting right it is the meatballs the lasagna yes they will put some shit in front of you that you you don't know what it is all right let's have at it yeah the Italian food in Italy is lighter yes you know it's a lot more fish and then you have the regions if you're north of your south from your insid G if yeah you know it's it's it's yeah it's it is odd it's it was culture shock just to think of what I've been eating for my mother's food and grandparents and you know what I mean that's like it's just different my grandmother was fresh off the boat and she's to cook everything from scratch tomato sauce from scratch everything to pasta she would roll the pasta herself she would everything she would make her own bread she would do everything everything from scratch the bread wasn't what there was the bread was occasional because a lot of times there was a when they lived in New Jersey there was a store that they would go to a bread place that you would go and buy fresh bread basically every couple days sure and it would go bad like within hours because it was real bread without without eight thousand keys right now dude I had a piece of bread the other day and it was sitting on the kitchen table for like a few hours I left I went but it was still soft as fuck cuz it's all filled with chemicals course man everything is know everything is that what it's like when you realize that there's fluoride in our drinking water and people are just not right with that yeah I'm not sure that that's that should be there I've read about fluoride in the drinking water like the pros and cons the pros don't make any sense to not to me like brush your fucking teeth pitch yeah use toothpaste yeah I'm not I mean uh you know I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I don't think it's well it's you know and then there's ah you get into all the conspiracy theories that's when you got to wade through all the bullshit like okay it was a Nazi plot to soften minds and no it was it or is it just like I feel like somebody just got a lot of fluoride they're trying to sell some sort of a deal with the government that helping it to the wall it's probably more logical but the thing is with all that conspiracies you have to sift through shit because there are kernels in there mm-hmm there's a problem they like that yeah they like the more ridiculous the more ridiculous the theories the better it is for them because that it seems more ridiculous in that you're alone yeah and oh you mean they like the government but whoever low is dumping the floor yeah whoever they Florida man when your grandma used to say there you go go who's day right they say that you're not supposed a who are they but whoever they is whatever they're doing the more ridiculous things seem it it nullifies some more realistic things like they're pumping in the food into cattle new steroids and cattle why like for me when we were younger bro white girls didn't have fat asses yeah but they learned squats with cattle I don't if you think it's squats there's a lot of white girls out there with flat asses to this day there is they're just lazy all right I'm gonna trust you because I believe you you're a gym guy most of what's going on with food is not steroids most of what's going on with food is antibiotics because they're getting sick from eating corn okay if you watch there's a great documentary King corn okay and it all documents how a lot of cows have huge issues digesting all that corn it's not a natural thing for them they're supposed to eat grass right sure sure it fattens them the fuck up and makes them quite tasty sure but it's really not what they're supposed to be eating that's interesting well I mean I guess I always started chemically speaking that that's what was being pumped into everything now because it's expensive they don't need to do it either like in Mexico they still do it that's how Cannella got here with allegedly yeah air quote allegedly yeah we got clan beautiful all came from the state I gotta fucking bridge to sell you you can get it from mistake unfortunately oh yeah no there's fighters that say I oh no I trained in Mexican someone recently said I don't say his name right I said yeah I eat it and it's got cleaning it and they're like then why didn't you get popped he's like cuz I don't inject it yeah well without a doubt there's some shenanigans going on in all combat sport and all professional sports get a little edge that's just the money involved of course being able to yeah and teddy loses his mind with that yeah I mean rightly so he saw when someone's that passionate about it anything I mean the guy is just like yeah Jesus man yeah he's a treasure he is he's an American treasure yeah yes yes he was great man yeah he's about his dad did you hear it did you hear the pot watched half of it but I read his book so and you know teddy bear teddy was a goon man yeah you know what I mean well that's where you got that slicing yeah it was hanging his face is hanging off yeah yeah it's crazy yeah but um yeah well the Jordan Peterson but I mean it's I mean all of that guy yeah he's a very really fascinating gentleman he is he isn't just scary smart yeah you know III would just crumble trying out a conversation like a nitwit you would catch up that's what happens later my friends but the thing about people like that is like if you are around a certain caliber thinker then your vibration sort of matches their operation sure when you're around people that are way smarter than you you realize like oh there's some shortcuts to thinking that I'm taking yeah and then there's some there's some pitfalls and the way I analyze things and these people don't have those things and then my vocabulary stunted maybe I should increase my vocabulary maybe we should start reading more or reading the things and that just with most people it's it's the same thing as with fitness it's amount of how much time you put in for how long right and that's the same thing with your intellect it's the same thing with your emotional stability its how much energy and effort and focus have you put into it and for how long yeah of course yeah but like like you said though to be around someone like him you're naturally gonna fall into a line of thinking where his understanding of the his calmness man it's like it's just I I can't see that guy being rattled I've watched the Bates and he's just he's so confident and what he believes yeah you know what I'm saying that's thought things through it's not a silly person I mean I think I am so that's their problem there yeah I am too yeah I'm a nitwit watching him it's it's you know it's um it's humbling you can watch someone like him that's got it together and has that level of understanding because I spend a lot of my life trying to get to that level understanding so to watch someone that's there yeah it's like it's just humbling there I'm just curious where he's gonna go because him being known you know is relatively new mm-hmm you know it's not this isn't a guy who's been you know a couple years right well he's up what you would call like a public superstar intellectual now you're right that's a new thing it is really in it really hasn't existed over the last decade or so no hasn't been and now they're starting and I think because of YouTube and podcasts and things on emotions these guys are getting super popular I mean he's selling out places where fuckin Iron Maiden place absolutely I mean he's absolutely it's crazy and he talks about the book if you told me that the a place where Maidan would sell out someone would go talk to a modern-day philosopher yeah I wouldn't believe that yeah because it's idiocracy now you know he only eats meat it's all he eats no yeah he's on this carnivore diet really no vegetables at all no salt and meat and water Wow yeah he's so wacky with it he told me that he had like a glass of cider and he couldn't sleep for 24 days like he's he's not okay he's he's eccentric like you're in a heavy way he's a heavy guy yeah but um it's it's it's a burden being that guy is a burden well not and I don't mean that in a negative or a derogatory way I mean to be that smart and now don't you feel historically that they're the people who are the most sad and broken and as they know too much there's nothing worse than knowing shit the dumbest people I know are happy is a fucking man right it's simple people sure and it's obviously his level of intellect is next level but even if being a bright guy or seeing just being a Rita or one or reading Kafka and Salinger and whoever and just becoming aware of certain things you realize certain times realizations aren't always the greatest things I used to say that say that to kids when I was coaching them when I was coaching martial artists huh I would say you're scared because you're smart yeah see these people around you that aren't scared they're stupid of course they don't understand the possibilities you're aware of the dangers and all the variables you got to put that aside yes and just concentrate on your technique and your task in hand sure but the reason why you're scared is because you're smart everything my life exists around fear it's not good it's not healthy I'm not healthy mentally because of it and I don't know how to shake that but it's what kind of fear my father died when I was 10 so I have that like missing my mom's my best friend you know and she's 72 now so like just everyday is worried about her yeah about in every way it's not even driven by anything that's rational right it's like she's sick she's the best you know what I mean she's 70 tool this is the Jay Z and where's Jordans yeah she's she's the best but it's it's fear of not having her if you have what the unknown really I fear the unknown I fear what if this all ends right I've lit my adult life has been I do which is music it's yours has been - I don't I don't know how to do anything right I don't know how to fix the fucking car I don't know how I literally don't how to do anything but that that fear is for mechanics - because they like fuck what if there's no more cars what if these electric cars come along I don't know work a computer everything's gonna be computer-controlled I mean people's business look good think about the poor bastard that opened up blockbuster he's like we got this yes forever right they just spending money like it's crying then one day they're like oh we got this uh this new thing it's called a Apple TV people might fuck Apple TV yeah my second Michael blockbuster is not living in a box somewhere right yeah probably yeah boy you're probably sold for smarter I saw the writing on the wall yeah but I mean there's a lot of things that just go away and people find a way to make do you get through whatever made you a successful rapper you could be successful at anything I don't know that I want that well you don't have to luckily I don't I don't want to be a successful I don't want the fear of not being able to continue the way I continue yeah I know again from being a fan how you let you do what you want essentially yeah of course work is work and even though we love it it's still work and I think we both have people in our lives that don't get that yes they think of it's what when we talk when you were in Philly I know people hit you up the day of the show you gave me two passes back but like it's a fucking party right it's your job man yeah it's it's how you it's it's how you you know what I mean put food on the table and I think there's a disconnect there with people that don't live in that world that they think everything we do is of a party yeah well they're sorry it goes back to discipline what we're talking about early that you got to love it but you also have to have the discipline to get the work done of course you know of course but I I have a problem with people that don't understand that that there is discipline involved they think that there's not that we got lucky mm-hmm we didn't what we did and we didn't we did get lucky we created something we created our own luck though this a little bit of that for sure we're lucky we live in America we weren't born in a shack ashore Opia sure there's luck but then there's also you you have to put in the work and you have to figure it out it's a puzzle it's this open-ended puzzle you you make what you make it you turn it into something but you did it you did it you started you got your shot and you took it and had the balls to run with that shot some people fumble the ball deaf is a lot of fun blurs out there I fumbled a bunch too you just get back up I figure out why you fumble I fumbled but I knew that I had to get back up these people from fumble the ball and then go into what was me what was me the point catch a break universe is out to get me I can't catch a break this doesn't and that's all I can't say all but a lot of it is self-inflicted yeah it is well instead of look at it that way what they should look at it okay now I know how not to do it I learned now this is my gonna make me better you have to learn yeah you have to learn from everything that happens if you're not if it's your my father would say it's not a mistake if you learn from it yeah you have to be able to look it's adapted I like what blockbuster write so adapt to die everything's changing with us you know what I mean that this podcast is bigger than shows on terrestrial radio if you told me that back when I was listening to Stern I'd be like what what are you even talking about the podcast could not what is a podcast how big could that be and you're bigger than radio what person well I thought that when I did it to when I first started doing it I never thought it was gonna be a thing I thought it was just a goof I was doing it for fun right like I would like respond to someone on Twitter like just fuck it just have some fun yeah and it but you you changed culture you shifted culture and how people communicate with this show I mean you should be very proud of that man if you're not already I don't think about it I think if you think about it you'll you'll trip over your own feet I don't think about if someone can give me the best compliment ever and I'm like I'm a piece of garbage crossing floor Joe we don't have a problem there well like you were saying about your fear of it all going away I think that fear is what makes you show up at the studio ten minutes early that fee is what makes you get out that notebook and start writing yeah that fears what makes you sit alone thinking about how you're gonna structure this or you know write your next this oh yeah that's that's a it's all important people think that like like a guy like you who's a successful rapper or a comedian and successful that you just got no worries anymore that's bullshit I have more worries now that I've ever heard of my life I have way more worries than when I had nothing in my pocket in high school when I was rapping on street corners I think about it all the time yeah Howard that and I looked at the worries I had them and they're laughable I crown right I can crack up at the shit that used to that used to bother me you know what's interesting could you imagine going back to the first day start knowing from scratch knowing what you know now how much better you would be I can't even imagine but think of that in the future as of now that's that's heavy yeah that's heavy you know if I look back on your sound like if you're a 60 year old man looking back at yourself you like Vinny you had the world by the balls of course the problem is I have a problem with living in the moment I'm always thinking about the ramifications of that moment while the moment is happening hmm yeah and it's it's it's it's detrimental to my mental health to think that way you know I mean I know I can't I see people live in the moment I see people that just are able to to let things wash over them and I'm envious of that because everything is overanalyzing and every way possible and it eats at me you know but I think that that's one of the reasons why your lyrics are so good it's like person a person has that sort of that with this the overanalyzing aspect of you is also it makes you go over all these details and find better hooks and find a better way to phrase things and yes you can't be complacent you just can't I just wish I could just only exist in that part of my life I don't think it works man everybody that I talked to the successful is the same way they're all a mess yeah what are we gonna do gotta keep fuckin you just got to not give a fuck and keep pressing forward and know that this is just part of who you are I mean we go back historically everyone's alone that was brilliant looking Lenin you know like look at all these you know what I'm saying Oh crazy economic that's every long when craziest fart I think Stan hopes one of the brilliant most brilliant minds ever batshit crazy you know yeah he's good buddy much yeah I know he is um you know you look at you know whether it's Bill Hicks whether it's Louie whoever you know what I mean innocent yeah yeah I mean Sam was the most troubled person well that's my defense of Roseanne you know all these people coming after Roseanne I'm like you don't understand she's bad she's not just batshit she got in a car accident he has severe brain damage yeah she's on all sorts of medications she has multiple personality disorder she's drinking she's on ambien and she's seven years old what the fuck do you want right what do you want from this lady you you know and you spoke that way and so did norm you know norm talked about Louie and Roseanne and the same way you like yo man she's batshit crazy first of all like if you're going to her for uh you know if you're going to her for political discourse yeah yeah and that doesn't mean either one of us agree with exactly what you wrote it's just how she got there but that's also why she's so funny you know if you go back and watch Roseanne in the early days well that show was fucking heavy it was a great show and her stand-up before even before that was fantastic I put her in the top 20 of all time she was brilliant she was brilliant but it's also a monster man like there was nobody like her before like where she was just as brash I don't give a fuck yeah she was like a man yeah I feel like like a like like a world class standard sure I mean I remember like when that show came on just seeing that house I've never seen a house like that on television you know what I mean like closer to what we knew then what I had ever seen my house didn't look like the Cosby's Ryles do you know what I mean maybe Archie Bunker you know is laying a little bit like closer but it's when people are batshit crazy and someone reacts to that with cannot confusion with contempt I'm like you understand they're batshit crazy right and it's part of why they got to where they're at yeah don't don't act surprised now that did someone said something Looney yeah this many years after you know I mean it just seems strange to me that now you're blown away she's been saying batshit crazy shit for a long time I think it's also part of this new culture that we have in where people just they find a target and they attack of course it's like if you have if there's any sort of weakness like if you have chickens and one chicken gets sick that's what that pecking order thing is sure one chicken doesn't feel good the other chickens you know they don't like make moral judgments on this chicken they just find a target wrong with that chicken so they start fucking it up right and this it happens with dogs it has it's a it's an animal thing it is and human beings we have to if we're gonna be real if we're gonna if we're gonna be compassionate we're really going to be compassionate if we're really gonna like try to engineer a better culture yeah and a better community we gotta stop doing that I agree we got to just stop attacking people like she didn't I believe I talked to her on the phone just me and her she did not know that lady was black she goes she looked Jewish she looks like me she that's what she said I believe you I believe her too I think she was just cracking a joke fucked up on ambien sure and drinking and smoking weed all night and but no one cares what her intent was right all they care is I got a green light that's a target sure we're gonna go in well here's my issue with the modern the modern left is is they talk compassion but they don't they pounce yeah it's I feel like a man with no country now because ooh because I don't I don't the modern left isn't something that I gravitate towards and neither is the right and when I was growing up and listening to public you know the end that left of it changed it changed and I didn't yeah yeah yeah and you and you have these people I don't know where I stand anymore man well I think there's this rational left-leaning people that are against discrimination and for welfare and for food look I was on welfare when I was a kid if people say I shouldn't be on welfare well what the fuck right my parents were on well no I came from a moral family we had food stamps yeah and eventually they did better and we got off of the shore but if you want to tell me that that doesn't help that fed me absolutely so how could I ever go against that and that was a part of my child absolutely there's all these things that people want to associate with being you know like with left or right I I think there's just a gigantic problem people being tribal that's what it's it's you're I believe at it's at its highest degree which and since I've been alive I haven't seen never seen it like this before it's I think we know why but well it's facilitated not just by Trump and but it's also by the ability to communicate instantaneously of course without any consideration and you could just tweet something or make a youtube video about something instantaneously sure Roseanne's ability to tweet that yeah that quickly with the phone is why sankar show cost millions of dollars yeah people lost their jobs ABC junk you know they're gonna do the connors guess what that shows gonna fucking sink like the Titanic course it's gonna cause an get the fuckers n without Roseanne right three episodes yeah that's like flavor free diet coke tastes like water just have water motherfucker it's diet coke but without the flavor it's true what it's true and I don't it's just it's it's the hypersensitivity and it's like the ability for anyone right or wrong to be able to say something right then right well you would have you know if if you're doing Fear Factor and Rolling Stone interviewed you there's thought-process tears wet and there's editing and you're sitting there and you're talking with a journalist all of that's gone yeah it's like it yeah that's what it's it's come down to you know we are all all three without phones in our pockets can see some crazy right now if we stubbed our toe right it's not you studied fuck this for about and all the sudden you're done yes so there's good in that because the tyranny of these gigantic organizations like if they were tyrannical if they did have an agenda and we're trying to smear you you were fucked you had no recourse right and they did that too many people I'm sure there's group ulis journalists sure but also journalistic integrity takes a backseat to because now they have to get clicks like these people are real journalists are fighting for their lives absolutely because these publications are going under real journalism is almost dead it's not totally dead but real it's bad it's hurt but like I've got emphysema like like the Alex Jones thing right whether I agree with shit he says or not corporations shut him down and that to me that's scary that the the corporation's can decide what we are able to hear yeah well I was having a good conversation about this last night with some friends and they were talking about whether or not things like YouTube or Twitter or Instagram should be regulated like utilities okay where anybody can use it okay now like you have the right to get the power like if you have if you have a house your you have the right to pay your money you get your power turned on it's a utility yes maybe a channel like that whether it's YouTube or whether it's Twitter maybe a channel should be treated like a utility but then the question is like what is it exactly that is good enough to get you kicked off because I've seen some horrible shit I want people have read or written rather on Twitter that and they're still on I've seen shit whatever he's being whatever you know is why he was brought down I've seen people say much why she the big thing was the Sandy Hook right he was that the Sandy Hook thing was he said that he thought that it was fake he's since disavow that yeah but they don't care if you disavow they have this thing on you now you said that the kids didn't die they definitely did let's get rid of you but but are you saying that people aren't allowed to make mistakes are you saying that people aren't allowed to evolve their thinking are you saying that people aren't allowed to say things that are wrong because a lot of people say things are wrong but is it only things that are wrong about children like we're what is the line I don't know where lines are anymore and I don't know who's the one drawing well it's these people that either are the CEOs or the stockholders or you know the CFOs whoever it is they're yeah that is in the meeting that's dictating these standards they're deciding and these are gigantic corporations that we were just talking about this I don't think they ever anticipated this I think when they made Twitter they thought it like Jamie was saying it was a fun way to like tell your friends you know you know Vinnie Paz and Joe Rowe gonna go to the movies sure and that's what you would do it was just like I'm eating pizza at the mall yeah it wasn't anything crazy right and then people started using as a platform for well Sam Harris has been tweeting to Jack he's been trying to get Jack tab and Trump it's like look he's like he's clearly violating your standards of practice it's clearly doing that right and he's like Jack just won't respond to him anymore wow this is my life I mean you don't want to do that right now maybe when he gets impeached then you ban them yo greet that guy's Twitter the fact that he's the leader of the free world is batshit crazy yes threatening nuclear war I love my favorite is very sad with the exclamation yes oh yes that's like my that's my favorite thing if we get through this without getting blown up we're gonna look back and laugh at the Trump days they're gonna be fun um I don't know how long we're into his presidency when I walk by the TV and hear someone say president Trump I still have a little tremor you know it might not be a party land might not be a belly laugh but I still crack up well it's been two years yeah because I my lap this hard no I know by Netflix specials Oh cuz my last Netflix special was exactly two years ago and during that special I was like we are that close to President Trump and people laughing like ha ha I was laughing I was like I went to bed or whatever whatever knowing that there was zero chance yeah you know and I didn't think Hillary was a great candidate but I thought of fucking I thought of a cardboard box would be there yeah I thought people would think of him as more of a liability than anything but the thing is these people in Middle America just don't feel represented they feel disrespected yes and not represented and he figured that out and tapped into that good well I saw Jordan Peterson say something in this interview and it made me think because obviously we're joking right now and the joke about a missile dummy is and Jordan Peterson said the bit the reason he's in and the biggest mistake Americans have made is under estimating him and thinking he's dumb yeah you know what I mean you're not dumb he just does dumb shit yes and he's definitely an egomaniac I think he has narcissistic personality disorder and that's but that doesn't mean you stupid right you know what I mean but he he took advantage of exactly what you said there's a big portion of this country you've been there I've been there there's well you're an East Coast guy I'm an East Coast guy now we're both on the west coast we because of what we do these are the worlds we know and what we're surrounded by and that my father used to say if you don't live near a coast you're a retard I have to cut more than half the country hates me I don't believe that but my father said it anyway and you when you go through the middle of the country on tour and you meet people you I've been like yeah I've never met anyone like this before not in a good way or a bad way I just you're not around them I'm not around them and they probably feel like no one has ever spoken for me yeah you know what I mean and even if a dimwit does that's better than no one's be right that's better than someone just calling them flyover station disrespect course of course and I and when I was younger I did it too I talked that way I said you know when tours would get booked oh I don't want to go there but it's just youth it's just it's ego of being where you're from from the east coat well obviously everyone on the East Coast is very proud of that fact everyone the West is very proud of that fact you know it's you know I I don't I don't know anything about Arkansas pride you know it's just not able taste God you don't know anyone them well there's no fuckin Italians there I don't know that's what I am yeah my family's from Italy but it's just not able to and it's being an ignorant American I spent a lot of time like that until I saw the world not the country the world and and being on different continents it's it changes your thinking man and yeah you know what the thing you were talking about with diet and discipline like you know these people run water walk everywhere run everywhere ride bikes everywhere McDonald's is eaten like once a year is a crazy yeah you know night outlet my son lives overseas you know he he's had McDonald's like three times his life you know little kids here it's like every day mommy chicken McNuggets yeah just you see cultural shifts and and why there's no like I've talked to people over there who didn't know what autism was they never heard of legitimately like what is that and I had to explain it and that shit got me thinking too it's like okay why why is that why is that not happening there what what could be the reason autism autism autism autism yes autism yes oh the disease yeah yeah okay I thought you've seen art is our I'm sorry I was like what is that I don't know what it is either you will you're looking at me like anything I thought I was trying to figure if you meant artisan yes yes autism autism yeah it's that accent Pro sorry sorry buddy you know but yeah well they you know it's it's more common I think now than ever before but the question is whether it's more common because it's more diagnosed or whether it's more common because there's more incidents of it yeah there's a lot of questions as to why one of the big ones is apparently older people having kids people waiting and putting off the children and particularly men apparently there's a big risk for older men older men a lot of times have autistic kids I have more than a couple friends with autistic children me too and and I just it like do you remember when we were young I think like the first time I even was aware it was probably the movie Rain Man not being funny but know me 2% first time I was aware did it exist and what wasn't diagnosed or it's something about it I don't think they made it up for the movie it's like the disease came along right right but but what happened what happened chem is a chemical is it people that were on drugs is it things or did it just was it undiagnosed I think there's a bunch of factors I think undiagnosed is one of them I think also the ability to exchange information now allows you to be aware of it much quicker because the internet because people you know text and tweet and do these things on phones now you hear conversations about autism and all these different things you don't hear about before and then I think it's entirely possible that well first of all there's definitely more people than ever before yeah so because of more people are gonna have more incidences of all sorts of diseases cancer or whatever it is and the question is is it more per capita or is it more period because there's more people now that I don't know the answer well what you said about more knowledge and information being the only shit I have a dissociative disorder it's called depersonalization disorder what does that do so basically I'll be sitting here talking to you and I'll just my mind and my mind body and soul will remove itself in my body I feel like I'm floating down over my body I look at my hands and they won't feel like mine do you smoke weed no that's the problem no it'll it'll trigger it well yes all right now if we got I you would you know float above yourself I would fucking take that deer head and put it through my ear I would lose my shit and real envious I'm envious of how weed has helped so many people and that it can't help me what does it do to you it makes me but I smoke when I was young and what happened was something triggers DPD in people it's you know it could be a traumatic event it could be PTSD you know what I'm saying gun to my head I would say it was my father dying but it didn't happen right away because he died when I was 10 and this started when I was 14 I smoked a blunt of dust oh yeah and lost my shit and for about 18 months I no lie I thought I was in purgatory how old were you 14 I was like I'm never lean on how I'm definitely not in heaven whatever those might be Wow yo man and this is so this is back then there is no Twitter in it I didn't even know what it what I went to a doctor told him what happened he was like oh it was it was what you smoked you know something don't do that again and it never left and then I get these episode I'll be in the shower on tour in the Czech Republic you're washing my hair closing my eyes and I'll open them and not know where I'm at no clue where I'm at and I feel like I'm floating outside of my body could talk you know when you would hear the stories of people dying in an out-of-body experience that's literally my disorder I hadn't had about experience once when I took salvia I was like I was over here like floating above my pulsing where you see myself tripping balls yes I get I think I think it's it like I'm doing the Fred G Sanford Elizabeth I'm coming to see it when I hear those uh those drug stories where a guy gets fucked up for like a year those scare the shit out of me well it happened Marc Maron was telling us about that like he did coke with Sam Kinison for like a couple of days they didn't sleep and he was fucked up for a year it's a whole year he heard voices I would trade being fucked up for a year to do coke with Sam Kinison no butts what it was like it was like 18 months of my life yo how do you tell your Italian mother that no you can't keep your mouth shut you when you come from that culture man like my family that like old-school Italians they don't believe mentally you have to see it right they believe in cancer because they see it destroy your body right if you say I'm bipolar I'm the Prez the you know them said like I'm diagnosed depressed I'm diagnosed DPD I take medication for it it that still isn't enough for these people right it's it's to shake it off right you know what I mean I can't my fault if my father was alive you probably throw me up this is the flight of stairs for that you know what Joey Diaz calls immigrant mentality immigrant mentality is really still that because it's really day one no fuck again if it's not tangible they don't believe in it right if I broke my leg that woman would do everything for me if I'm in the middle of a fucking breakdown she's like you want gravy and meatballs I'm like mom I'm losing my shit I need to be hospitalized right I can't process then the best woman I love no one in the world more than my mother and she's no one has been more supportive of me and that's rare to with the immigrant mentality you'd think I'd get to get a job go to college right and she was like baby you do you like if that's what you want that's amazing do it but you better do it right don't do it have ass and don't bullshit you know this drinking 40s and smoking blunts rap shit looks good in the video but you got to work right you know what I mean and and it's the work ethic of the you know like Joey said the immigrant mentality but it helps you in other places because when you when you have relatives that didn't have shit and you know they're dressed in potato sacks as there you go yo yeah I can't let my father down he's not with us anymore yeah but I can't let him down because I carry his name right I don't want to embarrass him I don't want to embarrass my mother I want her to be proud you know and and that drives everything man like yeah I'm getting choked up talking about it because it's like I do everything for her and my son and and when you're driven by that it doesn't have to be your mama you say it's you driven by something that you care about it changes everything man that yeah we have people in our industries and entertain ministry that just have this fucking sense of entitlement mm-hmm it's it's plagued I know you know comics with a fucking sense of entitlement when they're rude when you go backstage I I know from how you are that you shake everyone's hand say how you doing thank you when they bring you something please thank you sure yo people don't do that man I know you know what drives me crazy when they don't do that of waiters and waitresses well they don't say thank you and they don't tip or they don't tip well last night the bill was 130 in the bar and I gave them 2:30 and the guy like chased me into stop yeah I made a mistake he did he said did you or did you mean to do this man you took care of me on man and I know the people are shitting on you right I leaving a dollar or maybe not even that yeah and same with waitresses man no one gets shit on one of them what are you thinking like two hours and hours you know when you really appreciate them when you go overseas and they don't get to yes those people barely pay attention those motherfuckers don't care you'll sit in Amsterdam they won't even come over to give you your soda and in Italy we were eating at some nice restaurants and the service was terrible awful awful good they don't give a fuck why would they I act any different than someone at Burger King you know where the lady said to me at the restaurant she goes sister we'd only Kalu the tip but if you want you can leave well sure I said listen baby I'm gonna leave you one that's right care of us okay we had like a little American exchange then so don't worry about it baby I got you if you set it up if there's a preamble yeah then it works what you got to do like when they're sitting you down see listen I'm from America we tip and a man set the press and said tip I tip big right okay let's make this wonderful you're setting the Rogen precedent I'm taking care of you yeah so take care of us yeah yeah man but but but that it's just you know the kid brings in a case of water like hey man thank you I've had those kids say to me yo I've been doing this 15 years no one's ever addressed me right and I'm like that's awful eh and I'm sorry for that but it's not gonna be from me it'll kid that brings the towels for the stage hey thank you thank you so much for having us I appreciate you I hope we did good I hope I hope the bar did well because my fans at the generates I hope this what you know yeah and I think I think that goes a long way bro in life you know I don't want to get into like a karma discussion but I think whether it's a comic or rapper of a metal band if you treat people like shit for a long time that gets around bro yeah like comic promoters know each other yeah music promoters know each other they'll fucking call it this guy's a fucking dick face I get those stories you know like I was talking to a promoter the other day and he was telling me about some guy who's an asshole it's like yelling at the sound guy at the sound check and yelling at the promoter made them fly to New York to something because the sound wasn't right or he wasn't happy with something and you know they have to accommodate this guy but they're they're shaking their head and then every chance they get they're gonna tell everybody else of course when Madonna he is and I don't and if he's popular right now when he starts to wane those motherfuckers will remember that you know when dudes like me and you if we start to wane we'll still get loved because of the way we treated people and that's reciprocated like yo maybe he did 5,000 people last time this time and he's you know talking 20 years down the line of some yeah and then you only do half they're still gonna have you because of the way you behave the way you were raised well it's also you got an opportunity when you're interact with people like if you're working with someone and you guys are doing something together you got an opportunity to just put smiles on faces and they they put smiles on other people's faces because of that everybody smile and then you got a nice trickle-down effect yeah that's and what's community what it's it takes more energy to be an asshole it does for me cuz I can be an asshole and when I am I feel drained yeah it drains the shit out of me I don't feel good about it I just have a temper tempura but I try to curb it and I realize when I'm I treat people the way that they deserve to be treated everything changes the energy and the room changes they might bring you I don't know if you drink or smoke before you perform both oh okay so if you if on your rider is two bottles of Grey Goose you might look over there might be four just because you were sweetheart not because you asked for it right it's just it's just little shit I'm not even saying it's a big deal and it did it it's life changing there's just a little shit that that people will you know it'll it makes their day just by us being polite instead of the guy that they had the last night there was a ballbreaker and saying the soundman the bummer about it first off the guys don't you don't have a fuck with a soundman is a performer that motherfucker will get you that motherfuckers got a ponytail he fucking listen he smoked weed the Allman Brothers he's gonna around the block yeah people don't realize that shit that motherfucker is 60 he fucking listen to the mc5 you know he fucking did sound for everybody you and I probably worship he is not impressed but he's probably pressed by you he's definitely not impressed by me a rapper from Philly he don't give a fuck you don't want to be doing my sound right so the last thing I need to do is be like yo schmohawk mentality with a lot of people adopt that when they become successful they want to be a prick they want they want to let everybody know they want to be that guy who yells and Rex hotel room yes you know that kind of shit I do I do but but I can't I don't understand it yeah you know I understand it it's a weakness and it's just they waited for so long to make it now they finally make it they want everybody suck their dick but do you think that things like that can be controlled by upbringing yeah they can be but it's always mom I hear alright so I'm ready to smash something in a hotel I hear my that that made is gonna have to spend all day you know I mean do it she tells me when I'm cranky about a shore I'm leaving for tour no sleep so you talk to every one of those kids you sign every autograph and you take every picture I'm going upside your head with the wooden spoon and the wooden spoon still has the crack from my head from back then and it's still the one she started the gravy with but it's so cracked but she said she said you are here for a reason and these people look up to you and these people respect you and you do your best to cannot just continue that but to have them think you're a better person than they already do because that's gonna trickle down and then maybe they'll treat people better you know you said it all of this is all this energy travels man it does you know if someone was in here right now just all three of us will get miserable real quick if someone was in here bitches yeah everyone's out to get me and everyone this is everyone's fault man except there's you know that Scrabble motherfucker yeah it's never there for every fucking decision they made it self-inflicted you know they can't self examine and say maybe it's me how about just give me a maybe motherfucker some of these people I know that's not even in their head it's all of us it's you it's me you didn't give him a break you didn't let them on this show motherfucker maybe it's you yeah maybe your Energy's also our responsibility to cast those people aside agree as a lesson agree and that's what tribes would do but when you're talking about a lesson I think when you're too deep into it you're not learning I think when you hit a certain age and you still like that right I think you're done some people you know I just think you're done I know that's a negative way and we're talking about not being negative but sometimes just realities reality well if you're being pragmatic and you want to talk about like the good use of your time yeah you're not gonna fix a 45 year old guy who complains every day and that's what I'm sorry 25 year old kid might be going through some shit it could be a breakup a loss of a parent that pattern that they're in the missile pattern and you have to break patterns and if you don't break them you end up being that 45 year old yeah I was a shitty friend to people man I'm I've always been loved and like in my twenties and shit I was just selfish like nothing crazy I never did anything like horrible to someone but just just I thought about myself first and I was like maybe the like best friend is some of these people and there's still in my life and I had to make a conscious effort to evolve to evolve and break patterns may be breaking patterns is hard as fuck it's hard as fuck but that's part of growth you know and that's one of the reasons why it's important to be around people that are also doing the same kind of thing you feed off yes yes and when you're around people that are just real negative that feeds off of it - of course you want to be negative as well yeah and and you don't feel the need to break that cycle because you're around motherfuckers that are thinking like that - so becomes this this pity party where you're all it's a circle jerk of misery mm you know what I'm saying and and the circle jerk of misery it's just it's it's never-ending there so I think that one of the things that really expands your understanding of people in life is just being in a bunch of different places and understanding that where you grew up is just one part of the world yes that the world is this massive plate like I just got back from Thailand I was entirely in the summer I've never been around so many friendly people by friendly nice smiling people that I think they call it the land of the smile or land of a thousand smiles or some choice that's beautiful but that's what it's like when you're over there people are just so friendly and I was like wow okay if you grew up here something about whatever momentum that these people have developed in their culture their cultures like smiling and friendly to each other yes this is this is just the what the vibe the way they do it but if you around some real aggro super shitty insulting aggressive culture then that would be what you had to adapt it bro Philly was voted the most hostile city in America by Time magazine oh it's up this so recently what I said this is how I described said they're very smart people who will punch you yeah like I took a description of Matt that's not a very smart very smart media of average intelligence that will punch you but it's Philly's a sophisticated city it's a real city but they're all they're hard people goons man yeah they're hard people that look man we through you know we threw those snowballs at Santa Claus my michael irvin broke his leg and we cheered well the famous bill burr rant yes when they booed my era yeah bill burr went on tortured philly for ten minutes yes yes i love that me and ami did the same right I'm working with Dom tonight are you ice house big P little P do yeah he's Dom's great man the best we eat at a place called poppies in South Philly and I see him all the time he's a sweetheart sweet great guy man legend yeah I just saw him on the Bruce Willis roast and he murdered on that yeah I murder but he's great guy but um I've been friends with DOM for like 25 years have you yeah Wow no he's a Philly guy oh yeah yeah yeah okay but yeah what you like there's also a level a guilt though in cutting some of these people off that you're talking about that's kind of hard for me yeah because like loyalty is a big thing true when you're talking about all these you gotta tell them these parts they don't listen well then you gotta tell them again then they don't listen then you gotta cut them off and you go look I told you that's what's happening now but I still it's it eats at me I feel bad like I should be like it's a savior complex hmm you know what I'm saying I know that I don't want anyone to be fucked up man and I have a hard time being like yo this person is detrimental and they they're my energy is fucked up with them being in my life but when it's time to cut them off I still feel like am I being a shitty person am i doing that yeah well that's what they want you to think cuz they don't take care of themselves right you got to take care of yourself before I take care of you I mean you gotta at least want to I'll help you if you want to yeah but if you're not taking care of yourself you want me to do it for you hey hey hey you got to get your own shit together first yeah please get make an attempt you can't just ask everybody to carry your bags like come on they want you to carry their emotional bags it's not all the time and and again like I said there's no there's no introspection there's no well maybe this many years and all of this should happen to me maybe it's me and I'm a dad when you can't see that I feel like I don't know man I call them people lost cause it seems very dark and grim but I think they exist well I think you probably have this attitude because your dad died when you were young and you were left alone yeah you know and I have a lot of that because my father and my mother split up when I was really young and I haven't seen my dad since I was seven so it's the same sort of thing you feel abandoned and so you don't want to leave anybody behind so I always rescued stray dogs and feral cats and took in crazy friends and this my whole life has been like that are you making in the misfit and your father made that decision and that weighs on you and my father made the decision to die he had through yea bypass surgeries they told him stop smoking stop doing this stop doing that he had my older brother bring cigarettes to the hospital he drugged the IV down to the bathroom when he had a young son and made a choice not to live for my other brothers at 11 and 12 years older so they got him for 21 and 22 you know I can't remember his voice you know what I mean and that shit weighs heavy because you it's like did he not love me enough to live for me you know and those things manifest themselves in different ways as you get older that you don't even know you're not you know what's crazy it's a gift in some ways and the gift in a curse yeah the gift is that you you have this energy that comes from this lack this lack of something in your life yeah young yeah you know I mean this is something I struggle with with my kids because I try to keep my kids everything always give him love always your kiss all the time make sure they know we were talking about this gesture all my friends that are interesting came from fucked up childhoods all my favorite friends right my favorite friends their life was chaos when they were growing up and they became these really interesting people I hate that that's what created us but you couldn't be more right I mean you're talking about your favorite friends that are I mean my favorite every day every odd painters musicians rock band hunk metal head all of them were fucked and I don't know any well-balanced people that that I feel like oh that guy's brilliant mind he came from a two-parent home in the suburbs of Connecticut I don't know anyone like that pressure creates diamonds yeah man it busts pipes - it does buzz but yeah but but you know I wonder like how much of that stuff haunts me and create you know like you know your parents splitting and being seven like how many of the the fucked up things that go on in your head now relate back to that and you're not even aware because the mind is still complicated oh yeah you know a lot of it you know and I started realizing that when I was smoking weed I didn't really start smoking weed seriously until I was thirty okay and then when I started doing it and then I started thinking about all sorts of different patterns of our havior and why I was angry all the time right I think a lot of it came from this resentment of being abandoned when I was young well some of your early stuff was fucking super doc I think you're a brilliant comic so I love all you but some of that earliest stuff man yeah well pretty fucking and angry dark place it's also I was that was also like just a few years after I was done fighting like I was a different person I guess I had a different mind Shore and yeah that's a very strange transition between competition and then stand-up comedy of course it's just a very different kind of mindset I carried a little bit too much combat with me yeah well you were still fighting it was still fighting and and sometimes when you don't know what you're fighting yeah it's worse it's worse and you start internalizing it and you don't know what the what its war with self yeah in the war with self because you don't you want to this needs to this energy needs to be channeled and and how can it be and you went batshit on the knife yeah went really dark with it and I've done that too but for us to be healthy here's the other question though if we were to get healthy what we just suck yeah why I used to worry about that when I was young I used to worry about being my idea was that if I became somehow you know air-quote enlightened right but I wouldn't be funny anymore right cuz all the funny people I knew were fucked up of course I don't want that I needed to be a drug addict like damn Keenan was a drug addict prior with a drug addict maybe I need to be you look at these people that I mean historically look at Hendrix okay you know what I mean look at look at Morrison yes Bukowski fucking mess the town drunk yeah and one of the best I thought and think the same way I might need to pick up Abbott yeah just do drink yeah I shouldn't I drank a lot and had a Epiphany I woke up one day and cold turkey did really yeah yeah I drank a lot for a lot of years and now you don't drink at all a little it's like cash a little bit you know a bit a bit a little bit but uh it's uh it's it's more like when I perform right you know what I mean just loosen up yeah but I was drinking two bottles of Grey Goose alone every night oh yeah alone Dola Oh every night seven days a week that's a lot two bottles to the head that's uh Bert Kreischer love Bert love the bird I know the place he's got a bottle as it would he's listening what who love the bird yeah yeah you guys are close yeah yeah yeah we're doing sober October we're trying to figure out the bet well grampers yeah well we're trying to figure out what to do Tom Segar has got some great idea instead of yoga classes there's some application that you are you in on this bad cop I want money on this yeah crash is gonna crack with joke you you're not gonna be able to do the pot no I took the last sober October off the whole month yeah I took the whole month off no pot no no pot you don't believe me how dare you Wow let's see look at me crazy I'm gonna find the order here Joseph I don't believe that you're sneaking the pot no I wasn't either I wanted to get me tested went to yoga class on it if I put money I'm getting blood work like we're gonna sue us we were Georgia Ted he's still gonna do mushrooms when he's like camping or some show that's okay okay I'll let that slide so this is what the fuck this thing is it is a it's some sort of a heartrate application was it called my zone some my zone it's you wear this thing around your chest and it registers on an app okay and it gives you points for the amount of work you do okay he and Tom suggested that we try to achieve some ridiculous amount of points for the month there's like 40,000 points or some shit this is it you got it I forget what the number that Tom said but we're gonna have to agree on this number and what it basically means you got to work out almost an hour and a half every single fucking day of the month or no off days no off days oh you're in good shape you can do that yeah I'll be all right I'll figure out different shit to do so I'll run hills I'll kick box I'll do little jujitsu if I get in on it you guys can bet on how long before I die well you work out right I know you do a little boxing well here's the thing I didn't was in good shape as a kid then when I got rap money I did the dumb thing turn into a fat pig hmm you know so late the past maybe years I you know a couple years maybe 18 months I'm back yeah so you just regular hitting the bag hitting the back cardio skipping rope I know you're a giant boxing fan yeah like obsessive yeah me too yeah I know you are yeah you are yeah I like to post on Canelo Alvarez triple G to the casual boxing fails are the worst I mean I don't it's like it's it's really like child molesters have their the word like pedophiles are the worst and then casual boxing friends yeah it's the same with Noah Mayfield oh I'm sure well those those kids hate me they just yell at me that I should why when I post something about boxing watch MMA faggot yeah well how come you could be a soccer fan but you can't be a boxing fan yeah I don't know man how come you could be a basketball fan can't be a box I don't know it's very yeah the hostility is there man well the it's a stupid conflict between MMA and boxing I think it's stupid it's it's it's a deal to a lot of people you know what I mean it's so stupid because so many MMA fighters have learned from boxers absolutely you know max engineers sure yeah max a friend of mine and he's he's a huge box yeah and and and with Trena wild card he's one of the rare mac danzig was one of the rare vegans that competed successfully for a long period of time yeah ma one of the rare ones yeah these are smart guys very very bright yeah I really watched his diet correctly and made sure he got the proper foods and fatty acids and all the different things yeah I couldn't do it yeah well I mean for him it was a in his mind it was an ethical choice I know there's a lot of other ones that are vegetarians that do really well like Jake Shields he's a vegetarian but he eats eggs you know and milk and cheese and things along those lines but you hunt your own stuff yeah yeah do you enjoy that I do yeah yeah yeah but how did you like how do you learn that process of what you do after the animal like yeah I got lucky that I learned from people that know what they're doing yeah but Steve Rinella is a good friend of mine took me for the first time on his television show okay so the first time ever 100 was on TV which is kind of yeah nerve-wracking you don't want to fuck up your wounded animal on television but but what it is to me it's like I I saw so many PETA videos I saw some of those factory farming videos and like I don't want to be a part of this me too so I was either gonna be a vegetarian which I tried to be when I was fighting to I was trying to stay at a lower weight class and I was a vegetarian for a while and I felt like shit and then I probably was doing it wrong if you're ready to scream at your keyboard right now you can plant power plant based yeah you're gonna get it you know get bombarded but um when I started eating meat again I went up a weight class and that's I became much better yeah I just my body has reacts better with meat me too yeah yeah me too I like I tried it too you know what I mean I just found that you know making smart decisions forget vegan vegetarian of meat diet just making smart decisions right dietary decides you know what I mean it was uh was all the difference in the world for me and like as someone who works out as much as you do you feel better you just do yeah it's not i-it's not no-one lying to you about it you just feel better when you work out well the thing about the fighters and people that are in competition though it's like it's there's more at stake because it's not just about feeling better it's like you have you have an obligation to your brain to your body into your culture to perform at your best in your life yeah because that's not a game you don't play MMA you don't play box right it's true that you know you can die and people have yeah people have if you're cutting weight the wrong way well you know what I mean if you because there's tons of wrong ways to do shit you know we know that diuretics all of that you come along you know malnourished and someone hits like a fucking mule man you know that's no joke it's no joke I mean if anybody thinks you play box and watch Canelo Alvarez versus you know anybody where he like watch you watch any like real vicious knockout of someone's weight off the county he took he took James Kirkland soul out of his about how about Amir Khan ah we cracked Amir Khan with that right yeah boom I mean we go back to the 80s and Julian Jackson would just separate people from there from there from noon Julian Jackson was a murder he's he's the hardest puncher I ever saw my life here's Aamir Khan right here and Canelo Alvarez right hand see this is oh good lord that was one of those fights were like this short-circuited right yeah he doesn't know where he's at that's not a game right there no you're not playing with Canelo so much bigger than him - there's so much bigger yeah I mean he made 154 but he's a middleweight yeah and I'm air con is blown up well - yeah but he just separated his soul from his body right there just fucking hammer time that was one of the interesting things and you put this on your Instagram about the first triple G fight he landed in on triple G and triple G shook it off and kept walking towards them yeah and you can see it as I was like oh my goodness I caught him clean I mean you're a fighter man you hit someone with your best shit and they don't buy yeah yeah especially we used to taking people out that's what I'm and everything shifts well that's where a guy like Paulie Malignaggi has a slight advantage he's very rarely knocks anybody out yes used to hitting people and keep yes yes he's got bad he's Durance he had bad hands we had to change his style you know to box and just poke the jab over and over and over mm-hmm throw a right hand every now and then to keep him honest yeah we're bad hands but the beautiful thing the Canelo did he he just he just paused with the jab he's to draw just to draw him down then it came over the time on the right hand but yeah beautiful stuff man yeah that fight I watched it again after Teddy Atlas and I had a podcast I watched a triple G Canelo fight again for it nope no I didn't because what the kids were running around so the I test what is your I test a fucking close fight fucking close fight you know I think triple G came on real strong towards end right yeah makes you want 15-round fight is what it makes it does yes he does but again dumb motherfuckers were struggling yeah you know what those 15 right like the dude cook the Dooku Kim stuff when Rey I think like a lot of that shit was because of the 15 rounds you know cuz a weight cutting back then of course I know are these and same day weigh-in yeah dangerous yeah real dangerous yes but uh 15 rap I mean it's funny we watch fighters in any professional fighter in combat sports you see them gassing in like the second you know Larry Holmes had tits and was going big tits and he was going 15 easy yeah it's crazy you know it's it's it's just the human body is it's also understanding how to manage your energy - of course of course of course I mean when you come out in the first couple and you're just letting shots fly then you're Gantz in the middle it's that's not a shock yeah yeah that's it's it can work but when it doesn't work you're fucked exactly yeah yeah when you ice them in a second you look like you have a you had a brilliant game plan yeah when your guest in the seventh people are questioning you know your ability your ring IQ your corner it's a risk it's a heavy risk to throw all your artillery at someone in the first round absolutely yeah it's just such a fascinating sport you know I love all combat sports but one of the things that about boxing is it's a combat sport that has the longest richest history yeah when you go back and you can want me when Teddy was here we were watching Max Schmeling versus Joe Lewis the second fight and yeah you know you can go back and watch some of Sugar Ray Robinson's greatest Henry Armstrong yeah yeah man I mean you get to see the the rich history of boxing and you look at Jack Johnson fighting with those you know black-and-white films Jack Dempsey yeah yeah yeah it's crazy it's beautiful that we have this it has the audience with hats on was that about I don't know like the old days dudes all wore hats like one guys yeah strange very strange yeah I mean this there's a there's a history to box he meant no other sport could really come close to agreed yeah no I'm uh I always have been a giant fan of boxing before MMA came around I mean that was really all you had to watch you could watch like a little bit of kick boxing on television rarely but it was always bad well the other thing was those guys were superstars the heavyweight champ of the world we were younger was yeah like you know if we walked out on the street right now and ask someone who the heavyweight champ is no one knows no one knows some of them might say Mike Tyson well for the longest time the crazy thing was it was a white guy yeah no one knows like everybody will more kids wanted a white a heavyweight champion that's why they Punk him you know Gerry Cooney so hard like they were tracked Tommy Morrison yeah they wanted it so bad you know but like those got like you know Sugar Ray Leonard was a hero he's on blue McDonald's commercial yeah it's like though that those days are gone though you know it's becoming itch yeah it's now a niche sport again you know why do you think that is I don't know I don't honestly don't know is it because people got tired of corruption you know IBQ I've talked to Teddy at fights you know not let lank like you did but when you know when I go to fights and he's calling them I always pay my respect but I'm not sure how or why or when it shifted that shift from the 80s to early 90s and then that's it mm-hmm you know was it Mike going to jail I don't know was it you know de l'eau de la hoya was huge but I don't know you know why these dudes were like you know the alley was the most well known and he still was well-known athlete ever maybe right probably close to it you know I don't know who else would be to me Jordan by name you know what I mean what was really interesting was when Larry Holmes was a champ nobody gave a shit cuz he had to fill the void of between Bailey and he was between Ali and Tyson yeah you know the two the two dudes who basically transcended meanwhile the Ahly that beat the fuck out of Gerry Cooney yes I would have loved to see him against Tyson meet sir that's a different excuse me Larry Holmes yeah Larry Holmes that beat the fuck of the jurors he came out of retirement for that payday against my god yeah looked out of shape and still look good in the second round up until he got what it was dancing yeah a prime Larry gives Mike problems all day yes yeah a prime Larry was a beast he was a special fighter here a tremendous job the best heavyweight jab I ever saw when he the the Ali that fought Larry Holmes was an old broke Michelly they shouldn't ever let that fight take place a shell of themselves horrible to watch but that Larry Holmes without Larry Holmes would have given Mike Tyson fits absolutely was a different Larry absolutely he was a monster when he was young absolutely long snapping jab criminally underrated in history Eddie Futch trained yes I mean the you know you that he fucks maybe the best trainer of all time one of them for sure but but again like you said things a time and place man and everything you know the two you know comedy some some some brilliant comedian slip through the cracks due to what was happening at that time yeah in comedy and and with and with Larry it's like yo you came after the most popular fighter of all time ever and before Mike who you know again two dudes who transcended the sport and he beat up the most popular fighter of all time when everybody knew it was long long yeah yeah so he can't he wasn't happy about that and then he talks shit about Marciano which didn't endear him to pee I was a mistake yeah he said Marciano couldn't carry his jockstrap yeah that's my son's name my son's name once ya know so that that's a hurt one little bit yeah it's you know Larry just just had poor timing unfortunately for him yeah you know he saw he was very smart with his money though cuz I still see him at the fights and yeah he's paid that's good yeah it's good to hear cuz you you know as well as I do what happens to some fighters well didn't he own like a shitload of things you know eastern Pennsylvania just took over Easton he did bought like car dealerships watches and shit like that yeah Larry was smart man and he still talk shit too does he yeah I remember when he came back and he boxed the face off a Ray Mercer yeah he was old as shit when he bought butter bean and - yes he still he still had it he's in when Mike Tyson went to jail he's like as long as Mike Tyson to jail yeah that's great keep fighting sure is hilarious yeah Larry Holmes was something special he was for a lot of people he slipped through the crack people in the know know though and that's what's most important that yeah there you know yeah that's true yeah that's true I mean and then Trevor Berbick fought oddly - right yes that was like a night so yeah or second-to-last but he was the Parkinson's was already starting there yeah you know because you think of him a couple years later at Tyson when Tyson beat Barbic and he was trembling man you know what I mean like wow yeah so that's we talk about you don't play boxing and you play him in you don't play MMA you know it's your life it's interesting to that alley you know I always like to watch that fight with Jerry quarry because it was after three years off yeah man and you see his body looks different yeah it just looks softer you know if you see Ali versus like Cleveland Williams yeah and then you see Ali three years later after all that time off he just doesn't look the same he was never really the same he wasn't but you ever you think about why he did it am I having the Constitution to give away the prime of your fighting career did not do that yeah it's very specials they wanted him to fight in the Vietnam wars like this is a bullshit bullshit none of them ever caught he said none of them ever call me the n-word yeah you know what I mean I'm not going over there to do that they took three is prime yeah yeah you know you got that window as a fighter yeah it's like four to six years and and he and half of it was taken it's kind of amazing to that they did that and then they gave it back to him they let him fight again well I don't know what was the circumstances like how did they reinstate his boxing I actually don't remember I don't know either but I remember when he fought Frazier I was like man I would have loved to see this fight three years ago yeah man cuz he just was a different guy but he was way too flat-footed it just was a different guy yeah like well the Joe because Joe Joe and ila hated each other for real for real yeah cuz he was you know I li was saying horrible horrible shit oh so he's trying to fuck with his head that's why he was the original shit talker yeah you think about it it's like you you you see Connor and you're like that's Ali oh ya know what I mean for sure you know like Ric Flair mm-hmm yeah there's a little bit of both there too well you remember when Henry Cooper knocked down Ali that was like the biggest thing in the UK I hurt him bad and then and - Angelo Dundee cut the gloves yeah I mean if it wasn't for that move all he could have lost five stoppages absolutely very easily he got fucking crap rat fight right on the fucking button and sat down he was on queer Street Oh hundred percent yeah yeah he had a house on queer Street he was picking up the mail here it is right here again I mean that is a fucking picture-perfect left hand and Ben look at him right on the button he is staggering back to his corner and it happened luckily for him at the very end of the races and if that happens I'll leave back then right this was Cassius Clay correct so this is before he fought was it before he fought Sonny Liston I want to say it was it was yeah who man who knows that cheated him though yeah they did they cheated him it's different world oh we got to change gloves they gave him a long a style we got on undo these laces cut this cut this tape brilliant thumb oh yeah Wow hey Angelo Dundee he wasn't a newcomer no it was not you know what the fuck he was doing he was great yeah my favorite stoppage of all Ali's fights is Cleveland big cat Williams because he hit him with these just welterweight combinations oh he did it yeah I mean he was throw it really I never saw anyone throw combinations a heavyweight like that before combinations like Ray Robinson and the fluidity of them so just that fight out this is was one of my all-time favorite cuz Williams was a scary fucking dude too he was a big puncher and Ali was just a body no one does that anymore yeah and and Williams just kept pressing forward pressing forward well Lee Williams is a big puncher he could crack he just couldn't find Ali and Ali was so loose in front of him look at that beautiful he's a shelter on boom check left hook move around and then once once he started tuning them up then just after the body and then back up top is beautiful man yeah this is because there was never a heavyweight that moved like this people have to realize this just didn't exist man and rarely does exist the only guy who moves even remotely like this today is Tyson Fury Tyson Fury can move he can touch you motherfucker damn yeah he can he dances and he's six foot what nine or eight or something I think he's huge he gets clipped a little too much for me he definitely gets tagged yeah he got he got tagged by a Steve Cunningham from Philly and dropped that's the cruiserweight yes it was even crazy always chin might not be all there well you know what Cunningham is a shorter guy and sometimes for those really tall fighters it's very difficult to punch down that's how Mike was getting over yes he was in the chest he was real yeah and and the peekaboo that you know the custom model developed pulled up put the end of that fight up so I see the the the combinations that led to the stoppage see once once he had Williams in trouble go big screen I mean even there by my Bom Bom Bom yeah like once Williams's face had been jabbed off and Jo the craziest thing a beautiful the craziest thing about him is everyone historically has to sit down on their punches to get leverage on me he did it yeah he's dancing and yeah he wasn't trying to knock you out with every punch she was just cracking you okay and we're getting peppered yes fucking yeah rough the deal it's frustrating cuz you like if I touch this motherfucker on my hurdle but you can't touch it and you just keep getting pepper yes Lee your legs start wobbling I'm trying to fight Willy prep yeah you know usually he had the you know the footwork of Willy Pepin in a heavyweight I'm fucking heard of that's another guy that people forgot about Willy pepper is one of the rare guys that won around without throwing a punch yes yes like what the fuck yeah unbelievable and a day go yes yes indeed we had a lot of good ones back in the day not maybe not so much now Joseph well you know we had a run we had LeMond oh yeah you know Graziano well the community got established the problem people start doing well exactly then they get soft exactly exactly last guy we had was Arturo Gatti really rap yeah - really rappin you know yeah yeah it's it's that's how it goes though right the early immigrants the ones that get shit off yeah the ones who come up strong they're tough fighters and then you know now it's Cubans and Russians yeah yeah cuz because you come from that rut that russian amateur program like there's no fucking joke right that's one of the reasons why I love low mashenka oh he that guy you talk about man yeah I haven't seen anything maybe 30 years I haven't seen anything like him I know work oh it's ridiculous I've never seen someone he's in a position to not throw a punch and throws a beautiful yeah three punch company I don't even know I mean the you know they call him the matrix or high tech to perfect names but I'm I've never seen anything like them it may be maybe a prime Roy yeah you know me boy was different too Roy was technically awful he just had such reflex yeah when they went that's when he got melted yeah because because he never he didn't jab no he didn't do anything took a lead lead left hook writes from weird angles and it worked because his reflexes were superhuman he was Superman and then as soon as they deteriorate it a little bit and in fighting you can deteriorate a little bit in baseball you're gonna tear I think what got Roy what really got Roy in my opinion I'm a giant Roy Jones jr. fan he's my maybe one of my all-time favorite fighters what really got Roy's when we went up to fight John Ruiz yeah and then he went back on Tarver yeah he was depleted depleted and I think when he went up to fight Ruiz he might have had some Mexican supplements in the system yeah wink-wink nudge-nudge sure yeah I mean he was like 200 plus pounds 208 or look good I think you should have retired after that went well he definitely should have consulted with an endocrinologist and tried to figure out what how his system was and then that weight cut down to 175 must have been brutal because he was smooth he looked like shit he lost all his muscle tone yeah he just didn't he looked like he was shredded in the 90s exactly yeah he looked like a guy whose system had been shut down with the thing that these guys don't maybe don't recognize if they take some shit or if they you know even if you just cut too much weight your body stops producing hormones sure your body's all fucked up well yeah you're on you're on your way to die your body's telling you what the fuck are you doing down yeah so if he was 200 plus pounds when he fought Ruiz then he has to cut down to 175 yeah oh yeah 30 yeah and who knows how sophisticated his methods were I mean some fighters today are amazing at doing that yeah I mean they know how to do it correctly they know how to rehydrate correctly yeah and boxing at least has the the benefit of not having you sada in place like the UFC does the UFC has a real problem with a lack of IVs and these guys can't rehydrate correctly or the way that they want to is dangerous it is dangerous but in their defense it's it's also a way that they can detect whether or not someone's cheating okay because when they're using IVs you can mask a lot of shit right yeah I didn't think about that yeah that's why they do it okay yeah they just won't let you do it so when I don't know what happened with Roy when he did but then you know I can't take anything away from Tarver either because Tarver almost beat Roy the first time he fought yeah but then fucked him up Zak he fucking flew his head yeah oh and the famous words any excuses di Roy right before the fight he was so confident yeah yeah I think he gets his duty no he doesn't he doesn't he uh he had some great wins yeah he had some great wins he's still at it too right yeah at heavyweight 4647 Hey fer steroids yeah yeah so well duh if you're 45 and you're still looking good there's something going on the only the only person I truly believe and I realized you'll you'll think I'm biased because the way I'm from but I don't think Bernard ever did anything you did anything you know Bernard just lives clean yeah I've seen him order grilled chicken and get chicken that was fried by accident and peel the fry off of it rather than snow just this once I'll do it right watched him take it off yeah just you know what I mean to not eat that is just insane Dietary in the gym mmm you know I agree but the Joe Smith fight was sad to watch of course there was a the Coppola fight was sad though I was there I was ringside and I love kovalev yeah but it's you know a Philly legend like ah man this is rough you know it's crazy to see how deep into his career he was still successful like I wrote a blog article about the Kelly Pavlik fight uh-huh cuz I'm like I don't remember how old he was the time but everybody had already written him off oh my brother and I were there like Pavlik is gonna beat the dog Bernard he gave him fuckin lesson he put on a clinic well people have to realize he was technically past as far as primary fucked up Tito was 36 yes yes it was 36 in 2001 yeah that was two weeks after 9/11 fight and he was 36 then Oh crazy yeah how old was he when he fought Joe Smith 5050 maybe maybe 51 definitely 50 crazy so he was he I'd say he lasted 15 years longer than than the average guy yeah you know well how about when he came back and boxed word Junior yeah well Roy when Roy beat him the first time was beating him with all those reflexes and then when the reflexes slid off clearly outbox run the seconds life with just fundamental yes perfect mechanics Roy didn't have them he didn't have them yeah he's relying on what was once there yeah but it wasn't he was a shell of him for his former self well was also the Glen Johnson fight was a scary knockout he was on queer Street yeah well he was just flatlined and astral travelling after the got knocked out by Tarver yeah then there was not that much time in between those two five no it was it was the next fight yeah yeah and he and that those knockouts where you're you're out on your feet before you hit the ground then your head hits the canvas which is two shots and he was stiffened up uh-huh it was sad to watch it was it was that was I thought that was gonna be the end me too and then he started fighting like in Russia doing sanctioned over there it's a Russian citizen yes ma'am Bizzaro russian pussy involved he's gotta have some total over they had to do that when you talk about Larry Holmes he looked up as Wikipedia's last fight was in 2002 against Butterbean yes 51 or so yeah and he put it on Butterbean 10 round fight that's crazy Butterbean can crack that big motherfucker hit hard but Larry just that snake that's sneaking through that yeah every time he tries to come in bond remember that but due to where those golden palace was the first person he did Ana Tito fight it was that the first yeah yeah that was so weird someone did it in the UFC too they wore that shit on their back it's odd yeah but only a trunks are you gonna do it I guess well you don't get as much money but it is I know Bernard got 50k to put on his back and he bet it on himself against Tito real yeah and you know he was a huge underdog everyone Wow everyone thought Tito was gonna whoop his ass everyone everyone there wasn't you know I was jumping off my brother's couch yeah he fucked him up yeah man yeah Bernard was a special athlete he really was absolutely special fine all-time great for sure yeah definitely yeah and it was interesting because I used to watch him when he was in his 30s and he would complain about crooked promoters and all these things yeah and my thought was man it's too bad this guy like missed his prime right and then he did what he did and then he did what he did after the afters yeah cuz he got he was in jail for like strong-arm robbery and got out and kind of like wild in obscurity and then his shot was that Roy fight yeah you know and I and so uh you got you shot I guess that's it yeah he just got better you know better were they just show man it's like the rarest thing and anything well the discipline that he had that's what it's extraordinary discipline and you know is his mindset it should be a lesson yeah to everyone yeah you know that the discipline and dedication to whatever you want to do yeah can be achieved through that and he's still in good shape amazing shots the other thing he doesn't make no never never I see him at the fights he's still the same yeah yeah you know Oscar's chubby now yeah you know but I don't blame those do it like when Duran got really big that dude was cutting when he was trying to make 135 and all that yeah he just kept going up cause he's like the heat yeah before Iran Berkeley at 168 I miss it dude turn throw 135 well I remember when he fucked up Davie more like what is this everybody thought Davie more this young line line destroyed this old legend and Roberto thumb demands on my top five all-time yeah any weight class times five yeah well I always tell people if you really want to watch Roberto you gotta watch the light weight Roberto well before I even went to fight Leonard the black and white fights yeah Buchanan most right mo can be caught that's beautiful most people in America think of Duran from like Sugar Ray on yeah I might you want to see art yeah and and just subtle shit on the inside he was doing before Chavez that little subtle shit on the inside and picking off shots that the people don't know his defense he was eating none of those shots on the inside and then back in the body and butt and all of that that was fights were art yes he was great at 4040 75460 he did amazing things and again thrives in my top five but you're right if people want to see door and watch those fights a lightweight yeah he came up and wages to get paid of course he could have stayed at lightweight for a long of course and just dominated a bit I think I still even now think he's the best lightweight ever Wow I don't think there's any lightweight it was better well he was shredded back then yes was that fucking dark goatee like the donkey I said one time on a post I said if I'm in a dark alley I'm more scared of Duran than Tyson really yes all day that motherfucker will do some shit to us I don't know Mike's capable there was an interview where they went to see him in Panama and he picked up a cat by the tail and smashed it against a brick wall yeah okay yeah yeah I don't want to I want to see that guy now yeah and and the interviewer was like what yeah he just grabbed a cat and chucked it against a wall look man look there's a darkness that yeah you're not you know you're a couple sandwiches short of a picnic yeah well I mean the you gotta think about a guy growing up in Panama he did and just fighting for your life no rugs no floor mudding yeah it's that's another that's another level of poverty that we don't get like when you say the very first thing you said in this interview well we were born in America yeah we already had that yeah what one step above all these you know what I mean these you're talking about Castro's Cuba like he won't let those amateurs leave bro they're going the Ilyich had to escape yeah all those dudes had to escape Erislandy Lara his family's there bro like people these dudes leave their family on a fucking boat not a boat on a fucking raft yeah because Castro's like no we want to build the amateur program that's why we're rigging on the I like he's got dudes in like two Olympics you know you try to make it to one and then go pro you won't let yeah the program it's so you know I don't know if his son it seems like there's a different now there's a shift culturally they let you all Romero come back yeah Yoel Romero went back and he was hanging out there but he said it was very tense like you don't talk you don't say nothing really he's like yeah he goes because everybody's jealous they're all mad that you get to come back and forth because you know Yoel Romero top UFC fighter yeah he went back I wouldn't you know what I mean of being a top guy and getting paydays yeah I understand why he went back of course I understand why you know what I mean but if me and you go to Italy no we might not come back here look things they can have it you know I want a picture I got family and we got what's happened yeah whatever yeah I'm not interested in going anywhere I can't come back now man yeah but I just don't think we'll ever understand what it's like to be essentially a prisoner in a communist dictatorship absolutely grow up through the amateur program and when you all Romero was on the podcast Joey Diaz was translating for him was beautiful and he was explaining you know what life is like in you know these amateur programmes yes like you are sharing time with ten other people that want your spot yeah and that's what you're doing all day long you're training with ten other pets of all those domain that's all they do it's all they know you know and and you think about there's no scenario I'm jumping in shark-infested waters on a fucking raft right and if and if you're driven to do that yeah whatever drives you to do that must be fucking heavy man yeah you know and of course we don't him telling you that allowed you into the mind of that fighter that's a very rare experience that you had to be that he shared that because a lot of these dudes don't get to tell their story you know what I mean of what it was like and the amateur program being stuck there being a prisoner you can one see these dudes get out you know like some of them they'll be like you know like they'll be Olympic Games in say Europe and all escaped from there you know they'll just dart after the fight that's what that with you well oh that's what it escaped in Germany okay yeah yeah a couple people did it the same thing like Russia wherever they were at for games yeah and got the fuck out yeah I mean that that him getting in the ring after going through that is cake right you know what I mean that's this is he's living the dream you know training in a gym and sleep sleeping on a bed sheets and it's like this is cake you know that's the shit we don't we don't appreciate when I was talking about being a negative persons yeah well he was talking about in the amateur program if you do well if you're at the top you get three meals a day if you don't do so well you get to like you're literally fighting for your ability to eat it's insane like we don't we can't understand them oh man I don't any level no I mean imagine that's all you've ever known to of course then you see these slobs in America complaining yes you know that's how I when I started seeing shit some of the places in Eastern Europe that weren't a part of the Union yet and thence koala and and two-year-olds asking me for money I'm like yo man like get your shit together meaning me right yeah you're like okay your your way of thinking change it because this is what this is this kids reality yeah she's a two-year-old girl her mom's telling her to come over you know asking me for your oh yeah that's that's a game-changer yeah and and if that doesn't change you yeah I don't know man you're off the biggest mind fuck is that if you make $35,000 you're in the 1% of the world yeah what people talk about 1% as you think about people with yachts and private jets and of course fucking diamond rings of notice nope 1% is $35,000 a year for the world yeah man yeah that's that's sobering that's scary yeah when you travel a lot like where's your favorite places to go yeah I know you do Europe you travel all over the place you're I love Scandinavia really yeah why's that I don't know I like I hate the heat row oh dude yeah I'm like one of those dudes the air conditions on 24 hours and it's 30 degrees it's mega clean - yeah super clean it looks fake it looks like like a movie set really yeah but the crowds are crazy I mean I'm from Italy so of course I love that Australia was incredible but I almost had a nervous breakdown on the flight because it's too long bro bro bro it's five five or six hours from Philly and fly out of LAX and was another seventeen this is it seventeen tell us really if you leave from Philly it's 22 right oh look at me look man how much this is if you go the other way on the way home and on the way home we were the farthest point in Australia so the flight in Australia was like six hours so the time the time I texted my mom mom I'm leaving to come home to Philadelphia I got on 36 hours later who so they are they offer me constantly to come back and and you know which is what we do we go places and I'm like yo man that flight nervous breakdown oh it's you you had to decide what's more important money or your mental stability yeah and I'm already nuttier than squirrel shit so I don't need I don't need anything to push me any further than it's already what's going on in between my ears Thailand is a similar thing it's like 14 and then another five like I think it was like 11 to go to Europe or where did we go I think we went to Taiwan first and then it was another like five or something or but when by the time you're back you're so confused it took me two solid weeks for I started sleeping at night I think it took me three I'd wake up like two hours later I go to bed tired as fuck wake up two hours later wide awake it was 2:00 in the morning I'm like what is this your whole circadian rhythms jacked fucked it takes forever to get back yeah man took me two or three weeks to and I we fucked up my family we did two trips in the summer we went to Thailand and then we took two weeks off we went to Italy so it was just a double bunker so was it enough for you to be like I'm not going back would you know I like it I've learned how to travel a lot I really like taking my kids places too I really like the fact that I like to expose them to places like Thailand do you like Italy and take them to different places I like I like exposing them to Costa Rica and we didn't get to do that yeah so the fact that you have the ability to do yeah it's beautiful for them you know that that's a lot that's cool shit yeah to say that they did that yeah I'm enjoying it more than I ever thought I would being a parent to me is it's not just a beautiful thing to watch these little people that I love so much grow and have fun and be happy but it's also I'm getting to experience the world through their eyes watch them ride an elephant in Thailand watch them you know watch them zipline with me in Costa Rica we're laughing together that's heaven it's intense man it really is it's intense and it's made me shift my values and shift how I think about just experiencing things yeah it's a heavy thing man they change they change you in ways you didn't think we're possible yeah you know empathy you know just but like you said seeing things through their eyes that's like the the coolest thing you know because we didn't have that yeah it's weird it's weird man so it makes you feel super vulnerable too you know like you were talking about your mom like worrying about your mom yeah yeah you worry about people that you care but it's one of the things that's like a catch-22 it's like if you're on your own you know have to worry about nobody you don't give a fuck about right but you also don't have anything right so when you have all these people that you love and you care about so much then you worry about losing them it's a double-edged sword that's heavy yeah it's why when I was alone just Wilding it's like I was behaving that way because I had nothing right so you're looking for something then you find it right and all you do is worry about losing yeah it was like it goes back to what we're talking about earlier like if you're not scared a little if you're not nervous a little if you're not like you don't get a little bit of anxiety well you're not paying attention but you you know you're not living your life no you're not seeing anything put yourself out there right if you're putting yourself out there you're gonna have some anxiety you can have fear you're gonna have some worries well those people that don't have that don't put themselves out exactly live in a bubble and they're comfortable and gray and dry yes it's that Nietzsche Mori that Nietzsche question would you rather live your life in a series of tremendous highs and tremendous lows or just flatline flatline these people think flatlining that that Square life is like oh you know 2.5 kids in a house like this is it like no that's not it man it's not it you mean it's nothing wrong with having 2.5 kids in a house but go do some shit no that's my kids yeah the woods rafting sure yeah gets get some done man we went whitewater rafting last year in Montana that was shit shamon a glacier River you know fucking freezing cold water bears everywhere nuts man Wow you going rafting down this river and seeing trout jump and it's like just get into me to see them experience shit like we took them to Yellowstone they got to see bison you know while bison up-close so their minds are just blown by I just want them to see as much shit as I can show that's I want them to see I mean I'm like every you know a few months my wife and I see now and talk like what are we gonna do this summer we're gonna take him but this year was Thailand where we gonna go next year he doesn't take them somewhere else weird god bless ya it's fun man it's fascinating it's um it's a weird life education that I didn't anticipate of course yeah you build it man and you deserve it because you did it your way and that's punk rock is fuck punk rock is fuck that's funny yeah when you're traveling how many guys you bring them with you it's usually a so there's three of us onstage like me rhyming a hype man and a DJ and then a tour manager and a merch guy so usually five that's a good thing because comics a lot of times travel by themselves right they get I know last I know like RT would talk about it a lot just being alone in a hotel room and fucking Schenectady I figured that shit out a long time ago though I started bringing my friends with me because in in promoters or clubs they wouldn't pay for the friend you wouldn't they wouldn't pay for so I would just say look give me a flat rate I'll pay my opening act I'll pay their airfare I'll pay their hotel I'd rather lose money well my earlier tours I was the promoters didn't care about opening acts and I was paying my homeboys to be the opening accident just like you know my I what I was getting paid I was handing it to them same thing Experian is cuz you keeping yourself safe yeah and you have family in the road like when I go on the road if I go on the road with Joey or Ari or those guys we're family yeah Tony we're having a good time sure you know wherever we are like what time you guys want to eat let's eat at lunch all right noon okay I'll meet you guys down yeah that's how we are guys wanna go to the gym all right let's go hit the gym so we're laughing and having a good chore but in the early days I did a lot of those solo trips there's a weird empty feeling you have man that's a very dark that's I mean yeah did you see that Louie a basa hood nobody did about traveling and he's alone it's a whole episode dedicated that what you just said yeah and it was very dark it was not humorous you got to take friends with you yeah I have friends to this day that don't do it that way they go on this they'd use local acts in a way man don't do it yeah but then I have to pay for his air frame like pay the money more man sure I know you're gonna make less money that way but you feel better you have to there comes a time where those decisions where you're doing things monetarily you're making this decision based on financial and you have to worry about your mental stability more yeah whatever the opener will get if it's five hundred a grand 3 grand five got whatever it is that's worth having family with you not only not I feel like your performance is gonna be better because you're gonna be with friends are gonna have a good time you're not worried about the show you bring a funny guy to open up for you you know he's good yeah yeah and then so then more people will come to your next show it's like it's better for you financially it's a short-term investment or for a long-term game of course of course that's these people think they're Pennywise and pound-foolish you know what I mean they don't understand it when what you're doing everyone's gonna kill and then it's gonna be double the people next yeah you know at least everybody's gonna have a good time and you're not gonna get out of there crazy when I come back Sunday morning I might be tired but at least I had a good time sure yeah I don't feel like I'm gonna fucking shoot myself absolutely yeah that's the real problem with travel it's fucking depressing you know I one of the things I read about an interview with Bourdain after he died I started reading a bunch of shit the yeah it blindsided me I didn't see it coming yeah and then after he died I read a bunch of his stuff where he was talking about how intensely lonely it was when he was traveling and I knew who traveled with people that he cared about you know he traveled with people that he'd like but I think just traveling 250 days a year period will fuck you up absolutely I I can't say that people being with me I still don't feel lonely because there's something there's a connection to home right that once I separate from that from home from Philly for my mom you know all of that once once I'm separated from that reality it I love having my friends around me and it makes it better but it doesn't fix it yeah there's still this sense of I'm out here alone you know right there's still and and I don't I don't I can't make any sense out of that because I'm technically not alone so it's not yeah it doesn't make much sense not home though right I read something where you were saying they this might be your last tour I'm just I don't know man it's cut it's coming yeah yeah how old do you know four I'll be 41 and October fifth and you just getting tired of it Reina me man it's really forget the physical it's draining my spirit it's the anxiety before I'm leaving is say you get nervous like three days before you leaving now it's starting like two months before I'm leaving really yeah when you go out how long do you go out for that's changed too I mean I will go out for six weeks 42 shows in a row before you know before now I got like two two and a half weeks of me then I'll come home then I got like when I when I come back from Kylie and I go to Europe you know but you know again like to say last tour it's like I don't want to fucking turn into Jean 7 yes you know what I'm saying where it's like this is it so come see me you're never gonna see me again like I'm not doing the 1980s they did their 83 or something you know it's I don't want to do that that's so I don't it's why I chose my words properly where it was more like you know I'm getting run down and it's you know traveling is uh it's again it's no different than you it's beautiful being up on stage when people are laughing you know but getting there yeah the flights the this that the hotels it's just I don't you know it's something that you could never explain to someone who doesn't do it and why exactly you're tired still when you walk out on stage in Germany or some shit all goes away and everybody goes crazy it all goes away no it still decided the plan the other side of the planet it's it's still the most humbling thing in the world because it's still in my head like now I'm a kid from Philly you know like it was rhyming on street corners ladies and gentlemen fini path yeah that could never crazy never not feel great you know it's um I almost feel bad for people that will never experience that sure sure it's a mindfuck it's unreal it's like it's to pinch yourself shit yeah you know you're like we all have a fuck sometimes you got to step back you know I don't think it's people we do that enough yeah you know because we're living in the moment like even right now like is like I've been a fan of yours for a very long time and just to have this convo with you is beautiful and and it's gonna be a mindfuck later as I think about it I don't I mean we was talking like old friends now yeah I don't I mean but it's right for I've been following your whole career you know what I mean so and I've been a fan your whole career so it's I still get weirded out when I meet people that's weird of course known someone for a long time by watching their stuff or listening yeah yeah and then he's you're right in front of like hey man yeah like I became friends with Bill Paxton because he like was like can I come to the show I'm a fan you know why that guy was great I was the best he doesn't know what I loved him in remember that vampire movie oh shit the fuck was that movie remember what that was called it was a goddamn it did you see the shitty the rounded frailty I did see that oh yeah that was very good yeah yeah it was creepy it's very creepy yeah what the fuck was that vampire movie Jamie's got it what is it Jamie near dark that was a great that's one of the best vampire movies ever and one of the ones that people forgot about Jamie's like you for this month wizard yo man like not even finish sentences and shits on the boys too what we working together a long time Stella yeah that's what's going on I got it yeah tell ya much respect man Paxton was in a gang of good movies yeah man he was great bro Chet yeah your stupid wad yeah aliens yeah this isn't aliens NIC an alien remember he's in the first scene of terminator he's the punk rock take his clothes that's right yeah yeah talented guy very sad man that guy went on fucking Good Morning America yeah it went on Good Morning America and big me up to like Kathie Lee really she's like I heard you're a hip-hop fan is like a Jedi mantra one sock on my head sticking up a little Paxton saying my name on Good Morning America how old was he when he died he was like I said he's something yeah man he's young have a stroke he was young and and and not a dude who like he was in good shape and you know lived well 62 fuck stroke Jesus Christ had a young son has a young son you know very young he's only 21 now 22 you know so that's yeah you never know man you do never know yeah that's a hard life to men that moviestar life may be little poor baby but your movies all those set days are rough man 16 hours 8 16 18 hours standing around waiting and then you got to do it again the next day and you're working six seven days a week rarely do you have a day off yes their budget is only a certain amount that's smashing all the so you're doing 42 days in a row or something everybody's on everybody's nerves or on top of people and stressful and tense you ever hear the Christian Bale right yes that fucking the sound guy or the lighting guy was in his way you fucking amateur man losing it yeah who loses his shit yeah well he's an intense guy brilliant actor yeah he's uh he's one of those I'll almost die for a part guy definitely when he did the the Dicky Eklund the Micky Ward shit I almost died well and then that was the second time he did that mechanic mechanic yeah machinist machine is gonna catch it is brilliant it's not even a good movie there's no problem it's just the horror scene yeah it's just a harsh seeing him literally on death door yeah that's the brilliance in yeah I just don't understand people that are willing to do that I mean just do something else man yeah I'm not willing to do anything sorry he almost I do a role where you don't have to starve you're right yeah you had to have another script in front of you that day and was that's the thing it's like do that movie and all that movie is known for is the fact that you almost died yeah that's it nobody's like man the machine is like like when when Robert DeNiro gained a shitload of weight for Raging Bull yeah you know he got in fantastic shape played Jake LaMotta was ripped and then gained a fuckload of weight here for your sake as he was old yes like you go wow that's some serious goddamn commitment and it's one of the best movies ever yeah that's the thing it's one of the best movies ever but if you do that like like Charlize Theron did that when she monster oh yeah yeah yeah that was another one and that was even more bulk she's a beautiful yes yeah so for her to get fat and disgusting like that yeah yeah and that movies great it was a Creighton it won the Oscar right or she did well yeah I think yeah she got gross yes yeah it's a horror movie my friend patty wrote and directed that oh really yeah why Jenkins in the house yeah that's crazy Lee think about how fuckin smoking hot she is yeah man she got girl roast got rid of her eye but eyelashes or eyebrows everything look at her with that Oscar same person how that makes you think all those chubby gross ladies maybe just maybe they just need a little yeah a little motivation I look like Charlize Theron yeah it's a it's a tough craft that acting you know it's um it's one of those jobs where you know everybody wants to do it but very few people can and when you do do it it's it's like such a unbelievably grueling grind yeah yeah you can only do it for so long and if you're a woman man you got out just a few years in your window is yeah especially your hot woman yeah there's a gang of those 22 year old cupcakes coming up try and take your spot absolutely just as crazy as you then cry on cue and they will always be coming up away always oh it's always bad parents out there making good actors absolutely making bad parental decisions and sending the kids Lollywood mean that's what it is here there's a flood of I mean how often you spend time out here pretty often a couple times yeah I have a lot of like close friends and yeah it's a strange place bizarro world yeah yeah and and like Philly is not a showbiz hub no but there's a lot of great showbiz Kevin harsh or bands music of course great stuff comes from Philly yeah but it's not a showbiz huh it's not it's not I mean 190 miles from New York so that's like you know but yeah not close enough this is a showbiz hub of course this attracts all the weirdness everywhere I mean every weight is an aspiring actor and you know bartenders but that I still through all the times I've been coming here I can't wrap my head around that like everyone's in aspiring something one yeah one yeah that's what it is yeah stole place well the other thing is you get to know like I get to know people when they have kids oh yeah your kids become friends with Derrick enjoy and then you meet the pain you think the parents are normal then it turns out now you know there were actors that gave it up and you know how cells fucking computers or whatever right it's like everyone had this dream and absolutely come out here it's I think if you if you get if you just took into account all showbiz aspirations in Southern California saw it on a map like a little red light would go off wherever the showbiz aspirations were it's be overwhelming it would be where is it in places like Philly or Boston where I'm from you don't see much no not anyone would ask anyone with aspirations it's sort of self-contained yeah you know and they do what's necessary but you know it's uh it's just I've always been intrigued because LA and New York of those places where everyone you ask isn't from there right you know what I mean like no no the girl walking down the street in Manhattan is from Iowa right she wants to be a model or whatever and it's like the same thing out here like oh you know from where like nobody's from you yeah well not nobody but you very few yeah very few yeah it's a total transient city you know and New York is a weird one too because whenever I'm in New York I go I look at all these people are okay how do you afford this I just see a small walking down the street and I'm like yo a closet here is like five grand a month and you just look it looks like you just walked out of a sewer like a chud I don't understand it I don't either and you know I've talked to people that live there and the 90s and it still live there today yeah they're like New York City used to be a lot of artists yeah and a lot of like weird people especially downtown yeah now it's all finance people it's just so gentrified it doesn't look like the north New York that we you know you Centrify it's a fun name for white people right it is that's what it is right it's happen in Philly - why is that yeah Whitey's bum-rush in places that I used to hang out where you had to speak Spanish to be there and it was the hood and now it's like white people walking they look like they're in Weezer walking a little like poor dog it's a murder scene well that's a weird thing like DC has that - DC is weird in that the hood and the gentrified neighborhoods are like a block away that's how silly is and these motherfuckers are gonna walk one block or the wrong way and be fuckin [Laughter] how does that work it's just people go there for like some sort of a professional gig and they run out of real estate so they just start redoing houses yeah man it's like it's basically like glorified slumlord shit like you know and and you can't you can't displace poor people it's not like they just disappear right like everyone's got to go somewhere you know what I mean so you're just like you're basically playing playing Tetris with humans like you're moving moving this is like one of the worst hoods in Philly and now it's bougie is that really happening yeah absolutely like the only city more gentrified than New York is Philadelphia in my people that's happening in Brownsville right yeah I mean you're stuck on the East New York and Brownsville bed-stuy you know and you're talking bed-stuy do-or-die now there's not any more white guys named chip walking around what's happening they're so strange it's bizarre gentrification is bizarre in general because I'm like yo where are you putting the people that are leaving right where are they going well whose responsibility is it if you like if you wanted to buy a building are you supposed to think about the people that are poor that are there he's supposed to think about your money that you're buying the building for the people that want to do it have to be cut from a different cloth yeah I'm not cut from I couldn't do that I couldn't do it just displace people sure yes I don't it's just you have to it's there's a there's a cutthroat mentality that's needed and and it's needed in the um the music and entertainment industry that I don't have and it's probably held me back by being just like a good guy they're shitting so like in what way what should what could you have done that would have propelled you further well as far as far as like as far as being more popular I don't know but decisions I've made like when when you said you know you would pay for your buddies to come and I do too now if we had like a financial advice maybe like you two are morons for doing that I would tell them these wrong cuz I'd be performing better so to be better shows I like my lawyers like you're the worst client ever you pay everyone you pay them to well you pay them two handsomely fuck everybody I'm like yo man like I just I don't know if that helps you get by though I don't think that really advances you like if you have that mentality I don't think that really advances you I think what advances you is great work and what what is fair what does it take to make great work I think there's got to be a certain amount of you have to have a certain amount of chaos but also a certain amount of peace yeah of course you know and you get those from the disease there's decisions that you've made that I've made that ultimately get made them because that's who you are yeah well I think in order for me to have altered Who I am then I would have had to live with that too yeah and I don't want to not be Who I am because if I I wouldn't want to do that this success would it mean anything to me if I got there by not being me hmm you gotta live with that and that's worse than not succeeding to me yeah you know I don't know about other people a lot of people just fake it right and they're not who they are and they're okay with that if it comes with success in order for me to shift Who I am inherently my fiber my being the way that I was raised to treat people if I had to shift that and have success the success wouldn't be success to me it would be on paper but that business is just so strange right and I don't know how you feel about mumble rap but mumble rap is one of the weirdest things to me it's I'm confused it's bizarre it's bizarre what is happening I just I feel like I feel like I don't want to be that dude who doesn't get it right you know what I mean you don't get it I don't I don't get it either I don't but when you start dealing with youth culture and when I was the age of these mumble rap kids there were older head saying you know the the the generation before us the cold crush brothers to the Big Daddy canes they probably thought we would was crazy so is that what's happening I don't know maybe everyone's like what the fuck is that it's like it's to the point with me where I'm like yo is that even a genre rap right like I almost look at it I guess I don't I I guess I don't have a problem with it because I don't process it as anything close to what I do right it's almost like if you said you know what do you think about EDM I don't know I guess alright it's right where I don't even look at it like I can't listen to that and then a big Daddy Kane I think it's the same thing when we were kids listening to music right if you're you were listening to something that you enjoyed one of the things you loved was like good lyrics of course and when you can't understand what they're saying yeah it's also it's just so driven by it's like phrase driven yeah they just say whatever they learn over and over again yeah I don't know if like it's just because these kids are doing Molly or whatever yeah and they're just in a zone is it drug culture because that's happened before too you know one thing creates the other it's like chicken or the egg are these kids doing Molly and make mumble right where they don't mumble rap and they eat Molly right and it's all it's you know the 60s you know going back to the 50s and beatniks in that scene and jazz and heroin and what what created it you know what I mean that miles and Coltrane makes some of those records because they were on her on or vice versa and it's happened historically is this just the drug driven culture I don't know because I it's I'm detached you know I'm detaching and I and you know I'm a kid who grew up you know listening to metal and stuff like that so I don't I'm not at a shortage for Alice in the Slayer I'll just listen to Slayer before I listen to that if that's my only option right then I'll listen to Slayer you know what I mean I listen to Black Flag I listen to Minor Threat that's what I'll do you know it so there whether I however I feel about it becomes irrelevant when you realize that you have so much good shit out there so I don't need it's like a film like I'm not worried about a bad movie I'll just watch a dope movies right there's so many movies and that's throwing them away right yeah and it's like yo I'll just listen to Thin Lizzy right if I if I don't feel like adjusting to that you know and there's other things that we might not get cuz we're not doing what we used to do maybe if we were out of the bar of the club five nights a week and you weren't married with kids and we were hammered maybe it sounds different right you know that's it's time inflation it yeah it's like you hear certain songs you like I'm not listening this is my car I'm rolling the windows up if someone sees this yeah but maybe it affects them differently in a live environment it's something I don't know I'm playing devil's advocate I just just it's just just a strange trend where it's a lot of mumbling I'm like I don't know what they're on about cough syrup' yeah I think this is lean and Rolly I just and I think that that that drug culture created that I think a friend of mine who's a real estate agent some mumble rapper was working in the house and she's like I literally had no idea what the fuck he was saying I was talking him him talking as a human I thought it was like that style when they rhyme but maybe just this one she was showing him this dope house and he's mumbling up a storm Wow so he's like asking her for jacuzzi and she thinks she's ordering a pizza I don't know I mean I you know I love listening to NAS and I love listening to Public Enemy clean lyrics yeah yeah yeah yeah Big Daddy can that's yeah there was there was something to it though that you knew that they were trying to get a message across along with the music and cool about it yeah though I think I think maybe these kids think you can't do both yeah and our era was different it's like people could dance the Public Enemy and they were talking about what was going on in urban community yeah that that Arab you could there were they were Boogie Down Productions Kos records you could dance the sound of the police you danced out of here you could danced it I think there was a there's a disconnect with these kids that they don't think you can say something and have people dance or whatever I don't know what these fucking mumble motherfucker just slobber in the corner it's just well they all have to have tattoos on their face so yeah that's not a program that's like another mom the tattoo thing settle down man you know they don't come off right you know I think they can come off I don't think they care I just don't think they care I don't think they're thinking I mean it's all this I don't give a fuck culture yeah it's like you just and like they're not trying to get cool shit on their face they're trying to get like scribbles ya know it looks like you know you know you draw on the face of the drunk ate at the party that's what they all look like yeah you know they all look like that with pink dreads there's a lot of rap music that slip through the cracks too like a lot of people forget about Gang Starr yeah and then one of the greatest groups ever yeah you know but it's like it's it becomes the responsibility of the culture to uphold that like when someone like Mitch Hedberg who passed away young someone like Bill Hicks it's like look the the comedic community is their responsibility that those guys don't get forgotten right and it's the same with hip-hop it's it's my responsibility to talk about Gang Starr in interviews so the 16 year old kid says oh I'll check that out it's my responsibility to say talk about Big Daddy Kane and Kool G Rap and these dudes so people called G rap to me he's the greatest of all time he was one of the greatest so much shit here to me is the best ever that's such a cock blocking stand up and wipe his dick on your curtain time people forgot about Kool G Rap but do you think about like Hicks right so he was 33 and that was like 93 you know there's young kids that love comedy that don't know about Bill and he influenced my life yeah because towards the end he was doing more social commentary than anything like it wasn't even love it wasn't even that fun it wasn't it's not more jokes it was just like he was expanding his mind start like talking about it and Hedberg was brilliant like you know it's it's our responsibility to like carry the torch of all these people that were great minds that left too soon what Bourdain I don't want people to forget about that you know I'm special well luckily we have a lot of shows to watch yeah his show was so unique too because of his narration was gonna be interesting I have the newest one with W kamau Bell I haven't watched that yet but it apparently is the last one where he does narration oh okay and then all the other ones from this season was after he dies or someone else no no no no they're not gonna do any narration oh they're just gonna let the show play itself out they're just what it is they're gonna do it I guess somehow with editing and they're gonna figure it out yeah man stuff man another punk rock guy too oh yeah man that guy went home man he went whole G yeah yeah if you look at him from like 2014 and then look at him for 2018 it's like he lived several decades yeah inside of a few years yeah he went yeah I don't know if I recommend it but you know I mean he said it best you know life you should treat life like treat your body like it's an amusement park he did yeah I did I mean there's something that we all we all have in common with all these artists is that there's an understanding that we have that they're all living this non-standard way of getting through this life that they're all living this this strange chaotic way through and and creating these amazing things through this strange chaotic existence and y'all cling to it and celebrate it and and look at it I mean whether it's Henry Rollins who travels you know his crazy thinking's he'll just pick a spot on the map and travel and stay there for a couple weeks yeah he doesn't even know anybody there just goes there yeah or whether it's Bourdain who would make these shows about it or whether it's the musicians or comedians or anybody who does these thing it's like we are I think I take comfort in the fact that there's guys like you out there and that everybody's not trying to be some cardigan wearing you know button-down fake progressive who's just trying to not have people mad at them trying to say the things that you think you're supposed to say so that everybody likes you and then before you know it you're dead yeah there's no rebellion no no personal real objective opinions on things and everything like great that's ever comments come out of rebellion yeah it's come out of a fuck you if something if not a fuck you fuck me yeah like fuck ever what is this what are we doing yeah fuck my life fuck yeah and and more this if I don't know what I'm doing then I have to explore everything I can to try to figure out what I'm doing yeah you know what I mean that's the only way that's the only way to learn is to to live in a say I don't know what I'm doing and then and then live in a bubble is that's the antithesis of how to fix that yeah you know yeah and you know the the beautiful thing is that a guy like you or me or other people that are living these different alternative lives the other thing they do is they send a signal to that kid who's sitting in his room right now his parents are yelling at him cuz he's got all DS yes and he's like I can't fucking do this but you know what I really like to do I really like to listen to rap or I really like to listen to stand up yeah I really like to do whatever the fuck it is I really like to read books I don't own it telling that kid it's okay is an important part of what we do it's a huge crime tell my kid the system that they have set up for you where you go through this bullshit education process then next thing you know you're in some fucking factory job or something nonsense cubicle that is not good right and they're not telling you that that educational system they're not telling you anything they're not telling you about finance they're not telling you about diet they're not telling you that think about what we learned in high school almost nothing not formation with no it's literally like giving you an engine but not giving you driving losses yeah and and and think of what they could be doing to prepare you yeah it's out there like why aren't you giving these kids Kafka or Nietzsche or why aren't you telling them that this is terrible for you or this is filled with chemicals or this is yeah this that's information that needs to be out there you know I don't I've in terms of did you ever learning about money nothing you have to have it pay your bills I know that good job yeah don't be a loser you're right that's all right no fuck and yeah how am I gonna do that because I don't want to do that I don't want to be in a cubicle I know that so how how do I maneuver this what do I do nobody knows nobody knows and if you tell people you want to try something different like I want to be a rapper fucking about it man forget about get a job yes yeah so your fight you're not just fighting the Machine you're fighting people that love you yeah they don't want you to be a loser yeah and and it's it's you're trying to do the opposite of that you're trying to change yeah you're trying to break the cycle of this you know this you know you go to school then you get a job or you go to school and you go to college and then you get into $250,000 worth of debt to go work a job you hate to pay off that $250,000 debt and it's the cycle and that's what the crunch the cycle of this country and the fucked up thing is if you want to do something different nobody's they always got a path for you like if you say hey you know I really love hip-hop I want to be a rapper yeah that no one says oh well that's a viable job opportunity ously a lot of people are rappers right you can do this that's something you can do no one says that no one no one no if you tell them you want to be a stand-up what are you fucking out of your mind you're not funny right my mom told me that wow I never thought you were very funny we talk shit about you and all the people laugh yeah and the way and the weightlifting skit you did that was me and Brian Cowen brilliant yeah but this uh alternative lives like outside of the straight and narrow structure yeah then most people follow that's available to people they just have to they have to have more examples of it it's it's example if people like us are examples and they also there is though I will say this you have to have balls yes to do it and you have to be able to look at things honestly and Horrocks things that aren't of course and I write that shit I didn't do I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't being self-aware at certain times and then once you start doing that and saying maybe this is me maybe this is me and if I change this you see instant results yeah you know what I mean how long you been doing it for I wrote my first rhyme at nine but it was like the worst thing ever Wow what was your early influences the well my brothers brought home sucka MC's that was 83 it's like little I played on my Muppets and the first record where I said I want to rap was lotty this cuts got flavor I was like I want to do this and then I did a member candy girl by new addition yes I did I rapped on that at the like third grade talent show really yeah bird great yeah my mom's got it on VHS and threatens me with it I'm like that's not a threat put it off when I was in junior high school I heard Sugar Hill Gang for the very first time my life change and I remember thinking wow this is a new kind of music yes a new thing hip hop hippity hippity hip hop a Dimity beat don't stop a rocket to the bang jump boogie crazy yeah I mean I remember thinking like wow this is a new thing yeah and then when Run DMC was so hard when the sucker MCs yeah because Sugar Hill I'll obviously love that record you know change the course of history but they were rhyming over the chic instrumental you know so but when sucka MC's those drums you know those hard drugs and then being from Philly like having school Edie and like you know these hard records but like first time a first time like I rhymed like to record something like like 1991 you know and it was awful you know but so you just work on your craft and hope that you get to a point where it people don't think you're awful when did you start getting paid let me see so we put out an EP on our own that we pressed up at night six and like where I was like I'm living off rap that way yeah 98 98 but what kind of jobs you have before you I didn't really have jobs I like dirt bag the yeah perfection yeah for a couple years at the high school justjust some scumbag shit and then the first check came I was like there's no turning back now man right you know what I mean this is the greatest shit ever like money from what you wanted to buy Jordans from rapping what are you talking about yeah blow my fucking mind man you know I blew my mind like you know buying a pair of Jordans with that with that it's unreal but yeah it's like never if I can die never having a square gig I'll consider it a success oh yeah yeah when did you really say to yourself okay I'm a legit professional now like this is it there's no turning back I'm a hundred percent now like I don't have to worry about this going away I still don't think that really I it's the fear again fear of like the second I think that it'll go away you know what I mean things get bigger our office gets bigger you know the merged business grows the toys grow and I'm still the fear is it's like yo I'm just lucky I just feel lucky that I'm able to do it so I never want to think that way you know I guess I have to answer the question if someone a stranger says what do you do you know I have to answer it because it is what I do and I made a lot of money and I'm good my mom's good because of it you know but I feel like the day that I I feel like that that that that maybe uh I don't know you know like the philosophy one of when a fight is thinking of retirement it means that yes they're already retired yeah head I'm sort of applying that logic like the second I say yo is my tail you know I could play for seventy five thousand kids in a festival in Switzerland I still I'm still still doing on a piece of garbage right and that's it's sort of a driving thing with me you know what I mean whereas you know historically rap has just been so eagle driven i'm the best i'm you know that's the cornerstone of it when you rhyme but yeah some people carry themselves like that in real life you know and i don't want to be that man you know it's like i'm so i'm so scared of of someone ever thinking that humility isn't the most important thing to me and being polite is the most important thing to me you know and it is and and that's not really how people are in this game right you know and not just a rap just the entertainment business or meet an actor who's a dickhead right yo man you get paid to acts you get that's a blessing yeah we're lucky to be here right here I'm I'm just blessed to be sitting here with you man so I would why would I be anything but appreciative of that and I don't want to think oh that's why you know I just want to like live in be in the moment yeah maybe when it's over I'll tell you you know I was a if you don't tour if you say you're not gonna tour again do you mean you won't tour internationally or you won't tour will you still perform locally like what are you gonna do well I just landed on yesterday from Seoul that we did we started in Baltimore Baltimore New York Philly Boston of a mind and like just to sell out your hometown and it's like this many years later you know and to sell out New York and sell our Boston it's this thing that way you it's still fucking mind-blowing right you know what I mean and it's still people cheering your name it's mine I just maybe I did maybe it's more of like sometimes people need to decompress maybe I just need to decompress for a little bit and I'll completely change my mind it's just not just not to what next year or something you know and then maybe I'll be ready or something mm-hmm it's just I love walking out on that stage man I love being out here talking to you I love y'all so be real yesterday from Cyprus doing his stuff I love all the smoke box I it was just him in there with that bro they was I don't have to tell you they were smoking heavy I think I walked out Zonk just being in the room with them I'm sure yeah I was zapped yeah he's one of those all day dude yes I can't oh yes no I can't do that yes sir I have too much stuff to do yeah sure of course we all go he's getting shit done no girls one of those rare individuals yeah I could stay stoned but uh yeah no I just I I think maybe some decompression I like I think like in Dante's circles a hell I think airports might be on just loathe them I hate the whole process and it's like you know people god bless people will have that private jet money that you Elon Musk money you know what I'm saying like yeah but that's wasting your your burning off all that cash sure like if you're making a hundred and spending 40 on the jet like shit man I spent two no indeed it's just the the process man it's when you were talking about being alone in hotel rooms I hate I hate the hurry-up-and-wait of our of the entertainment industry and that's what it's built around you know it still trips me out when I wake up in the morning I look at the ceiling I don't remember where I am yo Ohio no yeah Philly no no no yes yes oh what country am I in yeah it's right it's fucked it's weird it's very weird do you think when you take the time off are you gonna still right and you just um in the studio I write I write five days a week and I record every Thursday every Thursday every Thursday really yeah so you write five days a week now what's your process like how do you write it has to be super late at night um yeah I can't I really can't do anything during the day um just nocturnal by nature I just sit there with a beat blasting and just sit yeah let it come 1 bar 1 bar 1 bar until it's done so do you have like a raw beat with no lyrics and then yeah yeah so who makes a beat for you first there I work with a lot of producers so with those send them and when I love something I'll go alright I'm gonna work on this tonight so you get the beat and then you sit and listen to it you start thinking about things yeah exactly like what's the hardest thing for me is the first line whereas the hardest thing yeah I'm sure that authors say this I'm sure I mean the first jokes probably odd is that everything goes off of that yeah you know what I mean so it's that that line is super hard and then I love being in the studio I love it the whole that's where I would be unfortunately because when we were kids records sold right so you could be like I don't want a tour I'm fucking them the other Beatles we sold fucking 100 million record we don't have the tour they decided they didn't want a tour like 67 and they never did again yeah you know what I mean but but it's everything is generated monetarily through touring merch you know what I mean so it's like the grind is there and you I don't like to feel like my hand is forced ever because that that's when it starts that's that Square world then I never want to feel like I'm obligated to do something and that could be some of my hand of my city towards touring right you know what I mean like yo this is what you do this is what you have to do you know go out this many days this is this like it's it's just it just fried my brain man you know I know obviously all this shit takes a physical toll on you but if it fries my brain where I'm like just completely zonked you know like walking through life I never know like I never see anything people like how was blah blah blah how was the louver my I never saw that shit you know how was the blubber butt in here with the same shit man yeah it's like oh how was ba I never saw shit man nothing right ever no room venue hotel room van or box what I mean yeah it's and repeat yes I grants repeat you know and people you know people like I said like I think just the inner entertainment business in general its there's a there's a perception that it that it isn't work because it's not the work they do yeah like try working on a car all day I might try driving 15 hours with someone who smells like balls you know like or try but you'll take it though right I mean you take it over a regular just cause now when you've right do you write with a pencil and paper do you write in your head do you write on a computer right I I wrote in a rhyme book it's like a spiral rhyme book for all my adult life and then I started not being able to read my handwriting because I used I write like a graffiti writer and I got what's this word hmm so now I go what I do I go it over my head when I have enough when I have enough I'll type it out oh you know and then like go my head go and my head type it out now it's like clean and organized which is not me on any level how long you been do it that way really recent like within a year really yeah and do you write like on Microsoft Word or something like I don't even know what it is just like a note thing on the computer it's called like notepad or something okay yeah but like on a Mac no a PC but but that wouldn't writing five days a week and going to the and recording every Thursday only started when I stopped heavy drinking like everything changed yeah everything changed because you don't want to be creative when you're hungover and you know you want to sleep you know what I mean like I recorded more in the past two years than the previous ten yeah man yeah I have tons of music recorded you know maybe it's not all great but it's recorded you know and I'm writing I'm clarity you know hmm on a lot of levels is there any window that you could see opening up where you could make money from the actual music itself because it this is a I mean the last couple of decades through the music business on its head but there's streaming services now and Jamie was just talking about the thing that Steven Tyler was talking about it's called mmm music Modernization Act yeah yeah that's a thing where they're trying to get the streaming company correct because the they're giving you a pittance mm-hmm well Pandora there was a Pandora that just sold for billions of dollars and it's like what do you do right you're worth billions of dollars what you do you distribute other people's art right you don't really have don't pay them yeah you don't pay them you make all the money you're talking to say pennies on the dollar wouldn't be enough I'm not exaggerating it's yeah it's less even no I'm not sure if either one of you guys saw the tweet from [Music] Crosby from crosby Stills and Nash it was like a breakdown of what he got paid from you know how huge those records were and it was like $55 or something for like 200 million streams and then Peter Frampton responded to him with another screenshots like here's mine and I have one of the biggest records ever Peter Frampton Comes Alive and they were going back and forth and like people in the industry will retweeting it because I mean these are guys who are a older and be richer than we can ever imagine and they it's important for people like them to speak up like I was I repeat the streamers don't pay us for the damned music that we made in all caps don't pay us this is David Crosby got a few tweets that are similar yeah there's one with the actual numbers and that yeah it's it's stunning and I don't understand how they're getting away with I don't either I don't even I'm not powerful enough to do that that's why I dudes like him like at one point Taylor Swift pulled all our shit and I was like that's great because she's huge yeah that's an important statement you know what I mean it's like if if you guys weren't getting paid correctly from a stream and up and someone like Eddie Murphy spoke up that's important yeah a fucking hack and Schenectady tweeting about it second well I don't I won't let them put my podcasts on they and they've been trying to do it for years and I'm saying no yeah what do I get out of it right of course they're like well it's just another way for people to get your you know there's a lot of people that are listening like this people are already listening right I don't want that shit happens to me why will you do this no and they're blown away that you say no yeah and again that's why I think you're punk rock whether you do or not you just say fuck you well I just understand what they're doing they're thieves yeah and they want to put ads on it and they then the most recent thing is that they'll give you some money but like not compared to what you're making right and you're what are you gonna do all you have is other people's work right other than that you just have a bus station I mean I feel bad for you've built your own everything you're your own entity I've done the same thing on a smaller level where we're outliers bro like some people really need that ya know you know what I mean like well they get stuck in the system and then even worse they've become a part of some sort of a network where they have a bunch of executives telling all the sign those major label deals that are you know in the videos with the jewelry and shit it's either fake it's rented those cars are rented I know what I mean there's good still living in the projects and then and there in those videos with Lambos yeah you know it's like perceptions become reality through social medias so people think like you know you have a rented car and ran a jewelry on that you're worth this and I'm like yo you don't know the fuckery that that label offered that right he's got a 360 deal they're taking his merch they're taking this that's what's crazy they take your merch and your ticket sales music company that doesn't have anything to do with performing they take a piece of you perform yes yes and these things that like you things are offered to me and I'm like yo man I spent my entire life building this and you you want a piece of the pie that I baked for no reason yeah I'll share with anybody but what's the reason for it but you got to be offering something bring something to the table you're not offering you know they're not bringing anything to the tape what are they saying that we can make you bigger we'll get you on the radio which nobody listens to anymore what do they say write me is there any what is is there a big radio station these days that anybody listens to not that I'm aware of I mean I know they still exist like I know the hot 97 still in New York but I don't have any one listens to it well where are the kids find out about music now it's gotta be through the internet it's there the interwebs yes they asked the kid a young barber was cutting me and he was like what do you do musician you know I casually got into it I was just making conversation I was like how do you listen to music he was like Spotify Apple music and SoundCloud yeah okay I don't use any of the three of them but yeah but it's good to know you know what I mean it's like it's like I listened I have your podcast on like an a podcast app on my phone you know what I mean and I'm assuming that's what people do yeah it's a little bit easier to track I suppose but again it's like the the Peter Frampton and David Crosby thing like I said it was some number that's outlandish like 200 million streams or something any 50 bucks like criminals how is it legal it shouldn't be they rigged the system they I did they have to figure out a way to quantify it the same way record sounds would have been like we went to the fucking store we went to Tower Records or the mom-and-pop store whatever goes that's it recent numbers per scream Napster was Rhapsody 0.019 title 0.0125 Apple music you know so you get your song played a million times and get less than five dollars seems fair that's fucking insane million streams you get less than five clams man that is insane it's so small YouTube's zero point zero zero zero six nine is that what is that what is that what is that that's fucking insane one hundred sixty nine hundred thousand hundred Hardware just a hundred thousandths of a dollar can you even quantify that as money at that point but what what does anyone do when they they're faced with this sort of information like is anything gonna change well if it does change we're gonna double it that's right that's not ten bucks that's my worry that it's being brought to people's attention and it might go to you know the big government might get involved and how much is that gonna shift right well the this you say artists can't pull their music the music is owned by the record companies the record companies are gonna play it and they're not gonna pay them the same they would pay someone who was buying it right I know Taylor Swift pulled her shit for a minute on some making a stance but however it was rectified she put it back up gave her money probably I'm sure they gave her money yeah yeah they give people money yeah they're giving people money for podcasts - they give you money for like exclusive use of it for a couple days okay like for two days yeah something along those lines or they they want to put their own ads on it those lines but people can get your podcasts you don't need to do man just letting someone make some money off you for no reason absolutely absolutely and well and what we do it's like we control our shit why would we give that up yeah tell me why that's what they need to tell me why I would give up control of my shit to you yeah I can't right you can't there's no logical explanation unless we're talking fucking money and you're on all your music deal yeah see that's nice that's nice and there's not a lot of people that can say that no because you know you know when you sign with a major they own your masters man yes so it's like you can't do it you know if I want to you know an album of mine that came out in 2010 say in 2020 I want to do a 10th anniversary edition on blue vinyl and but all that kind of cool shit I can't to ask anybody right interesting right it's like too the consumer shit is basically what I'm doing it's on my merge companies run you know I try to do that as much as possible because that DIY aesthetic is important to me yeah I mean it's well you know we go out with people and that they seemed untouchable you know rock star shit certain superheroes you know what I mean and I would like to sort of bridge that gap where it's like no come up and say what's not man right you know what I mean yeah that's let's talk how are you you know what's your name do you still sell actual physical CDs anymore yeah we do because there's a niche audience man that like how many people buy them is that like it's like well see i press vinyl I press tapes before but they just we just to be cute yeah no yeah tapes vinyl CDs vinyl sells the most really yeah it's a big big comeback CDs still that's that they're the most honestly right now today tapes are more popular than CDs Wow yeah it's just like a nostalgia thing it'll probably go away yeah but like we discussed not even pressing them Wow yeah like that's how much I did because I'm old school but we discussed like not doing it but vinyls still coming and strong yeah do you buy into the sound difference I do yeah yeah yeah but I buy into it with first you have to start at the source like if it's recorded amazingly then if it sounds it it's gonna sound shitty right like well I'd rather listen to the Beatles on vinyl I reckon you know right listen to Thin Lizzy on vinyl metal stuff like I mean a lot of a lot of hip-hop shit you know kids have a mic and a laptop in the bedroom and that's the that's the recording studio yeah that's not gonna make any fucking difference it's gonna be what it is in writing but bands who care i I it's it's warmer like if I listen to Stevie Wonder records it's not warmer warmer yeah yeah I've heard that expression before yeah I don't know how really out of articulate it but in my head I know what it means just the bass lines and drums everything sounds warm to me can they replicate that is it possible some people can with electronics to a degree you still need to you still need to get analog to a degree you know what I mean there's still a few studios in the country the do shit on reel-to-reel because that sound you can't write you can't have a fully replicated you can get close but you need to go to a reel-to-reel to really get that you know sound that we loved yeah now what about like Apple music and people buying things on iTunes yeah it's like that the people still do that right yeah but that's dropping too yeah yeah it's it's it's streaming it's so streamed dominated you know because even when people are doing that like buying albums on iTunes buying albums digitally or an Amazon or whatever someone's preference is it was sweet it was good good money all that and then the streaming shit like yeah because logically if you're a casual music fan you pay $10 a month for Spotify for every album that's ever been recorded right can you really blame the fan right you know what I mean and their ways of the ways of ingesting music is so different like I loved opening the vinyl I love reading the thank-yous right I love the smell of the fucking cassette tape I loved one who's an experienced going to the store being on the bus with the headphones on the first time you hear it ya know I can tell you where I was when I bought nas Illmatic well I can tell you all that that's dead the experience that it's you know boom bong and now I have the album you know comedy I got the new Joe Rogan album right two seconds with a click that's a weird thing to me yeah you know what I mean it's not weird to them but those stores you would go to where there was little stations we could press a button and listen preview of all these different people just stand there all day listen to the music all day we get it and if they didn't have them you were buying shitting guessing yeah you know a badge badge look at a cool yep I bought you know like metal albums with a badass cover and the band was just terrible yeah you know you see Sugarman yes how crazy is that motherfucking crazy I don't know what's crazier the story or that he got big in Africa batches that movie made me cry I've been me to batshit crazy but just how insane that this guy went on to become like a laborer for a construction company had no idea that he was a superstar in Africa and sing and then goes there as an older man who sold out Stadium yeah and they all know the words it's beautiful man it's that is one of the craziest documentaries of all time searching for sugar man if you haven't seen it folks yes you got to see it it's brilliant well done yeah and that's a different era - yeah you know that guy gave all his money anyway I do nothing saying these are real fucking deals or no fucking joke yeah I mean he still lives like he lived when he was a poor construction worker yeah both elevated level evaded way of thinking yeah I think he just got so used to being in that space for so long and his fucking music is good really good it's really good I think sometimes man like when that's brought on you you're still more comfortable in that other way yeah you know if some people don't want to they're not comfortable embracing that yeah you know whether it's wealth or fame or a mixture of both I just think he was like I'm good yeah I'm content and there's people with billions that aren't content what's more there's nothing more important than being good with yourself and he seems good with himself yeah that is one of the scarier things is someone who's insanely successful but never satisfied I think a lot of people are like that it's one of the things that I was saying about Trump like if you are 70 years old and you have billions of dollars why are you still working yes what do you do you think something's gonna change and you're gonna live forever right do you have no perception that you literally on the the last finger full of grains in your hourglass yes all you got left and you're not spending it on a yacht in Acapulco right getting your dick sucked right it's a big pimping in the background like what's the what's the mechanism in his head it's this Drive Ennis I know yeah I think about like that about Warren Buffett Yeah right it's like you go he's like four hundred and nine years old yeah I don't even know how much money anyway he's a real weird one cuz he still lives in fucking the middle of nowhere he's a strange but in a regular house yeah and his suits always looked like they were just pulled off the rack and yeah and weren't tailored yeah he goes to Terence Crawford fights though always he's always there he was hanging out with Floyd won Ronnie yeah sure he reps Nebraska yeah hard yeah he's an interesting guy he was super interesting yeah yeah but listen man we just did three hours believe in now we finally got a man means a lot of cool fan for a very long time to tell people how they can find you on twitter instagram box-cutter posse on instagram what is Twitter it's a vinny underscore pass and website JM t store comm Jedi Mind Tricks everything's on there thank you brother it was all thank you so much thank you man see you
