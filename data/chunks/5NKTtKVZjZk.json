I got this all Dino boom live okay what the fuck will you just tell me why hi Matt Farah what everybody you're just talking about Rolls Royce yeah because I was hearing you're in your new baller studio which congratulations thanks sick admiring your skylights and we're discussing the rolls-royce and the the star filled ceiling they do yeah which is they put all these fiber-optic lights into your headliner and it looks like the Stars and it's I think it's 15 grand option and not only will they do it so you can get your standard star pattern which is just whatever the guy just random bright random lights or they'll make you exact constellations if you prefer right like a few one of those astrology pedia or they will make you you know the sky directly above your house if you give them a coordinate there's a photo so badass it's like it's so awesome you you ballin so hard you were so driving around with a car with stars in the roof well so the last thing I said before you hit live was that they have just announced they have come out with a shooting star so I think how it works I'm not sure exactly what but I guess you could do you can get shooting stars you're silly that's crazy what are they gonna do make the whole thing a big LCD pattern or something yeah I guess or I don't know I guess you can you could have run an LED or a fiber optic line that works in a some kind of a tray I I emailed once I got that press release cuz I get press releases and I just delete them I don't you know but when I saw a shooting star ceiling I responded can I have further info and video on this and they said they'd get back to me so I've never been in one of those things never no no you must what is it like in there it's like sailing it's like yachting Phil Hartman had a really really old I think it was an old Bentley I mean like really like sixties old old older than that like 30 it was fuckin old man I wish I paid attention to cars back then but back then it was when I just started getting on TV I really did and I you know when when I was broke I always loved cars when I was a kid but then I was broke my attitude was like don't think about some shit you're never gonna be able to afford yeah so just don't think look at you now Joe Rogan with all the toys tell us somewhere to park them somewhere to park them but he had this old baller looking thing it was like it was like something out of Citizen Kane oh yeah just this incredible hmm boat and you know punchin fenders the whole deal I think you shifted it on the tree probably I would say if I had to guess something baller that Phil it's like I would say Bentley Continental s1 would be the most likely it might have been candidate but he loved that thing you just had this giant smile on his face with that thing he was like a smile that kid loves cars that's great Phil Hardman's bit like that something yeah I wish I could remember cuz like I said back then like if you asked me to like there's cars that I don't know shit about like Rolls Royces or Bentley's but if you showed me like an old Porsche I'd be like oh that's a 73 long nose yeah you know that we all have our areas and they're dumb muscle cars I can I'm a good muscle car guy I understand most muscle cars yeah pick them out in the lineup but well Bentley and rolls-royce were a weird one because they have sort of this intertwined history where they were separate and then they became together and then they became separate again so there's a lot of Rolls Royces and Bentley's that are mostly the same car those are that's like super baller level were you like okay look forget about it let's just get a car that's makes no sound like you can't hear anything amazing cause they're so fucking cool dude I can imagine even like - a lot of car guys especially like you know you are such like a manual transmission you know you want your car I know you you want your car to be like really close to a race car I like it being dirty where I could being gritty like I want I want to feel the rocks as I drive over them right well you witness you would appreciate a Rolls Royces ability to make a hundred percent of that disappear you know I'm saying like disappear entirely and like there's really neat details and like you are the word flying or floating or sailing is so true because you don't really drive it you just kind of fucking will it down the road and you know how it like your your Porsche or a sports car will have like the thumb grips on the wheel at nine and three like so Rolls Royce has thumb grips at four and and eight really you drive them underhand gangster extremely underhand you see it's that you yeah it's underhand yeah because you don't even lift your arms above shoulder height and then you know your car has a tachometer right it shows you your rpms is there a rough indicator of how much power you're using right roughly not exactly but before people go crazy about the lack of a technical term Rolls Royces don't have tachometers they have a power reserve gauge which shows you how much power the car has but that you are not using at any given time whoa right so if you're if you're coasting along it's at a hundred going down a hill maybe you're just off the gas off the brake coasting there you go power reserve so if you're coasting you are using zero percent of your engine right and the idea is to keep that gauge low because you want to be able to pass cars and and cruise down the road right while using 25% of this cars in July so and there's stupid horse power right like crazy right like not like crazy crazy were like four four to five hundred so high yes high high high torque yes isn't that funny that saying that is not that hard for carve to do our standards are so crazy I'm blown out our standards the Internet has fucked us all up the interstate I was reading about a new Miata which by the way might be like one of the most underrated cars ever the new Miata this is Lady Miata yeah they're great like for the bang for the buck oh yeah for a fun little car to drive that kind of real nimble gets around they're fucking great mm-hmm only like a hundred and fifty horse but yea that's there it is that's the new Miata 160 horsepower I think that's like like you hear that you like what yeah but you know there's a company in Colorado called fly-in Miata you know them right yeah you know where I'm going with this yeah they put an ls3 in one of these so I drove one that has a 575 horsepower ls3 and it's fucking great I was being say it's great you know why cuz it's got these long legs you know like it's a little car but it's got the Corvette long legs so you're you know third gears good for like 90 that's great now when you drive it a car like that is the balance fucked up by the engines because you know it's actually similar weight it it's I think them I think the LS conversion is like I don't want to say exactly but it's like maybe that's the older car Jamie that they do it to a newer one as well it's like it's a few extra pounds in the front but actually they have to use the rear differential from a Camaro so a lot of the extra weight goes in the back and so the cars maybe a hundred pounds heavier with the v8 in it but but it's four times the power which is the weight of a Miata like it's 20 350 that's so light hmm and then that you see that that thing in the picture was called a nexus set which is so that that exoskeleton thing that says fly and Miata on it oh there's an interesting photograph actually sorry podcast people we've got two two vehicles on a track from flying Miata the one in front is an exoskeleton car with really no bodywork on it at all and that's called an EXO set and so what is you buy that chassis and you buy a Miata and you take apart the Miata and you put all the Miata shit on this chassis and so you end up with like a 1200 pound thing and you can put turbos and you can put VH and you can do all different kind of stuff is this street-legal yes it is street-legal car bleah and then the thing behind it is called a bower catfish did you say carb legal like as far as like emissions yeah yeah I mean if you use a carb legal like the e-rod engine like like John Ward likes or the stock Miata engine for sure yeah if you use a carb legal engine it's a car blitz California leads that's crazy I driven them there they're fast but you know not nothing about EXO sets design should be taken from this statement I don't feel safe in them you know I'm not trying to insult her in the open yeah it's just to me you know I like having a body around me but it's way safer than a motorcycle true but a motorcycle I was thinking about this a motorcycle offers an experience that cannot be replicated right and if you are gonna take the kind of risks involved in riding a motorcycle that experience yeah is kind of worth it in to me in short bursts whereas I don't think the experience of driving a car with no body on it is worth you I don't think it is either but because you can get a lot of awesome car with bodywork yeah but it's also like the the thrill of the motorcycles like it is either you either have it or you don't yes you're either in a convertible or you're on a motorcycle yeah and the way in the leaning of course is is really and is that thing any more thrilling than a regular convertible honestly it's faster um it's not faster than all convertibles having the no you know the no roof right I mean you just feel connected to the elements yeah it's crazy and you can go because it's so light you know you can use an a relatively mundane engine and go very very fast yeah I imagine 1,200 pounds yeah it's nothing I mean it's nothing you know I need imagine imagine a Corvette engine in that thing which you can do you know I mean yeah people are crazy I Drive some shit that is dangerous I know you're one take video series that you do where you're kind of people let you drive their fucking crazy hot rods no souped-up cars like whoo I've just retired from driving people's personal cars yeah yeah good for you I just saw this I might go to Reno and this this is these weird software guys built this thing in Reno that's called a tests Londa that's a did you hear anything no you didn't it's electric that is a Tesla drivetrain in a 1981 Honda and it weighs it raised 2200 pounds and it runs like an 8 second quarter hilarious awesome right I just love that these people that got out there the Nerds are winning that oh they're winning a hundred percent the other test londa yep so I died you know weird shit but i'm i figured i'd i have rolled the dice you know you got to know when to walk away know when to run nobody count your money yeah I think the dealings done I'm sure you know good for you you may you may doubt you one of the rare few that beat Vegas right I mean either I decide when to stop or a lawyer does you know that's so true I just what we were talking about it's just so amazing that the horsepower wars it's because of their steady increase every year you know you come out with a 2018 Corvette you know expect it to be faster it's always gotta go to 17 come on a we got the same thing yeah well hey fuck it for just put a new engine in the Mustang 350gt and so there's always something hey they got the gt500 coming well shit yeah I'm gonna go up to 900 horsepower like isn't it crazy there's just much money like not even a lot of money like you can get a Hellcat for used Hellcat like forty five grand you know what I mean like six hundred bucks a month seven hundred bucks a month and you got 700 horsepower you hooked me up with one of those when I was in Denver when I read Hellcat I remember that with the astronauts outfit on fast right great it's a great car now they have a wider have you seen the whiner bodywork I like that and so you it's actually got quite a lot more tire under that's what it that was good I had a complaint it doesn't have that muscle car ass I like how it's done the wide-body Hellcat does yeah there's something about those fat tires in the rear man like as an old school muscle head dork that's what you want I saw you know moderator Matt D'Andrea no he's done Adam Carolla's podcast on Carla's car guys he just posted a picture on Twitter of he saw your old sick fish up on it somewhere that's funny it was not in a it was not in this this it was in a bit of a sad state honestly it was it really yeah we just was a little tired looking beat up into the picture yeah someone and that's unfortunate yeah it was a cool looking car when that came out yeah that football player Reggie what's his name Bush he bought it oh really he bought it off the guy that I sold it to thing hasn't been around yeah it's a it's a great-looking car that that year like all those years like 70 71 those those second-generation barracudas that's a special look and I think a lot of the Hellcat is in that same kind of it's pretty close it's pretty close but I really wish it was the same size mmm the Hellcat is a hundred and twenty five or a hundred and thirty percent inflate overinflated scale version of that those 70 71 CUDA 's are the most valuable muscle cars that there are today those Hemi ones right the Hemi Cudas are the rarest and most valuable yeah of the of those they they're the ones that only get over over over like a million usually that's incredible for a car that was what thirty thousand dollars new back in nineteen seventy five thousand dollars I don't know my reverse doesn't go back that far really let's take a guess let's say I think it was like I think like five to six thousand wouldn't be out of the question Hemi Cuda alright perfect the motor let's go with 8,500 8,500 bucks okay you go with 8,500 what did I say thirty thousand I'm gonna re reevaluating to revaluate 426 Hemi Cuda I'm gonna play a dirty game prices right I'm gonna go right above them is Jamie coming in with a dollar fuckin us all up winning the show 426 426 Hemi Cuda which year 1977 yeah that's the good year well the two years of my favorite years 70 and 71 said the same I think seventy ones got four headlights yeah he also has the smaller grille face like the teeth are small in the front which is what I have had a 70 where 71 has the full yeah yeah yeah it's really more aggressive I think 71 might be a little bit better looking to be honest with you I can't recall if one year is more valuable than the other 71 I think is probably the best look are the results in Jamie window sticker yeah you know yeah 3433 3433 tapas oh my god the Dalton with Jamie's $1 wouldn't want it that's their this yeah Jamie pull-up 1971 Barracuda nose that is that's my I think my favorite look in any muscle cars in 1971 Barracuda it's just like this aggressive American oh yeah we're good yes I mean that is that is about as fucking aggressive as a grill can get it's got a mouthful of teeth it looks like a barracuda it really does it does actually fucking nailed it man they were better at actually I think naming things what they looked like back then goddamn that looks good I do still think the Corvette Stingray looks stingray ish I think that's still where a little bit the works kind of yeah that looks like a fucking Barracuda that yes it does that looks like it's gonna get you I just found a way for you to spend another million dollars Joe Rogan I would never buy one of those I don't like I'm weird with shit i don't like stock old cars well cuz they drive like garbage that'd be why yeah i've zero interest in them you got your vet right yeah but that's like a modified bob pro-touring chassis and on yeah and it's got a LS one and oh so it drives a supercharged yeah yeah normally they're driven a stock one of that year no it's not good you're lucky did you die up the street he hates me we live in the same block and he's got a original he's one of those original guys he drives around with a paperboy hat on drives around the neighborhood lawn chair at cars and coffee and play fucking soft rock music his face when I told them that it was none of it was original except the shell looks original does I'm a goddamn thing in it the inside I guess the the shape of the dashboards original oh Kim well I was like look man I like them to drive like a car that works good yep like why is it bad to upgrade the brakes no it is not you're fine but this whole thing that it's somehow another like doing a disservice to the vehicle by upgrading the brakes these people are assholes some was the M piece man it's enough if you're if you're going on the lawn at Pebble Beach you keep it a ridge than that I mean especially look it I mean you you love the depths of the Internet look at Los Angeles driving circa 1960 and then Los Angeles driving today you know the heat the traffic Oh an old car is not meant to handle that shit you want to drive an old car here you need to upgrade a few things cool bad brakes when I find out that a dude just drives an old car I give him an extra level respect you know what he's going through yeah Jimmy Smith my partner in the UFC now he used to work for Bellator and now works for the UFC he drives a 1968 Firebirds every dark stock stock seats stock brakes everything I'm like whoa does he know what he have you let him driven drive grandfather said to the fuck he doesn't give a fuck he likes old muscle cars he likes in the way they are he had a Camaro I think and I think his Camaro got hit by some asshole and totaled it so he's alright there's another one guys in my hood in Venice where I live there's a lot of old old daily drivers for sure what I don't know I can't do it I just don't need that in my life experience you've got to realize that you're not gonna be only hit the brakes real good that's not worth it to me I like to drive too close to the people in front well even if something steps out in the road yeah I mean how many times you've been driving at Deere steps out in front of your car a bunch I was driving down the road in the video that's been viewed about three million times and a guy was dragging a log on like a 50 foot chain behind a Ford Explorer back and forth across the road oh my god yeah what the fuck it was it the most viewed video on reddit for 24 hours it was crazy just dragging a log like a like a log like you know four feet by two feet giant tree trunk log fucking assholes out there shitty suspension whoa whoa remember trying to turn in one of those cars oh my god but you know what else is like tires is a big difference to like you know old Porsches used to be called widow-makers and shit but you take one of those old 70s turbo Porsches that you know there's volumes about how scary they are to drive and you put them on in Pilot Super Sports and you're like oh youth you thought 300 horsepower was scary that's cute funny you're scared of 300 or so here's my log video look wait watch this boom log that is so quick that is so goddamn crazy yeah sitting there going what and I was in a supercharged Lamborghini Huracan making like 900 horsepower look at that and look at the road this guy is just free dragging up that guy does not seem wise but I totally I choked I mean I had an opportunity to to throw a zinger there at this person and instead I just talked to myself and drove away no you're better off you're not gonna fix that guy if he's so stupid he's driving a giant vlog down a public road yeah 30 and looking look on the other side of the road look at the marks like the log actually as I go up you can see the mark of dirt like moving back and forth across the road it was easier to see the other way I guess but Jesus don't do that people yeah I mean I guess he couldn't pick it up it looked too big so I guess I don't see how that's an appropriate solution why would he be so convinced that the log was gonna stay attached to the chain I don't know how much does he know about logs and chains you know and he seems like an advanced chain scientist in the specialty of logs dragging a log behind a car on a public road big-ass log that chain is not gonna hold up that law is gonna bounce and go through someone's fucking windshield god damn it god it was I'm sorry like look look how it's so crazy it's and and I mean not that we need to like you know go back in the video but see that like trail of whatever it's leaves on the road there like that trail I had noticed starting like a couple like a half a mile or so before that on the road and the trail is going back and forth across both lanes of traffic and there was like a couple like signs crazy shit - you mean you're making obstacles for people that are driving especially if you're on a motorcycle if you're on a motorcycle when you coming around all your gonna kill somebody yeah shit like date motorcycles don't want sand on the road yeah they just don't yeah and you're putting it on the road 100% with that Stoeger site also don't get clotheslined by logs and chains yeah my buddy wiping out on a turn on some sand was one of the major reasons why I was taking motorcycle safety classes I was trying to get my license and I was gonna get me and a couple of my friends from fear factor we were gonna get a we're gonna get motorcycles couple of guys that worked there and then as things went on we were like fuck this couple they they two of them went through with it two of us bailed Alonzo Bodden is all about the bikes all about the bikes yeah John how many boats broken he broke his arm on a bike couple a couple years ago that Betty did yeah he doesn't he doesn't seem to think it's a bad risk time I ride I ride a scooter I have a little yamaha scooter that I ride around Venice and running errands and go to my office and stuff like cuz I can Lane split and it really makes my life a lot easier oh yeah but I'm terrified I had a motorcycle and I wrote it in the canyons maybe four or five times it's terrified I have no problem pushing a car you know a little bit in the canyons but on a bike like that gravels a week yeah it's really fun I get it motorcycle people I'm not saying you're wrong you're you're you're just braver than me yeah I've done I've gone through a lot of surgeries I know what it's like to rehab from serious injury and like I am just so not into that yeah I've had I mean I've had two back surgeries in the same same spine so you've had those discectomies yeah you know how was that did it work for you yeah yeah first one lasted like 11 years and then my bad decisions led to it being re injured and the second surgeries fine I'm in the best shape now that I've been in in like 10 years so that's what are you doing I do seven days a week of cardio and I built a gym in my house I did seven days a week of cardio yeah I got one of those are trainers it's awesome is that like sort of like an Olympian it's like the hardest elliptical machine I've ever used and it's I do like 45 minutes a day on that I used one of those who really recently it was great it's amazing though had a good report yeah yeah yeah it's like a hotel up a video that bad boy it's it's like a hotel quality yeah so no pounding you get your cardio in but your body's not getting none and I'm now in 45 minutes I'll burn according to the machine I don't know how accurate these machine counters are but I'll burn like 850 calories in 45 minutes mm-hmm and then I do three days a week of weight training for an hour oh so you getting in daily doubles three days a week and I haven't and I haven't had a cigarette since October 2016 yeah yeah the Arc Trainer I have the one with the arms yeah yeah guy behind him is get the arms yeah like it's it's it's a serious serious workout man I shouldn't it is a really good workout yeah it really is so and then I do speed back I'll do 12 minutes a day on the speed bag which I like I'm sorry you could do that's what you how you hurt your arm yeah yeah we've been talking about tendon issues folks who has never had tendon issues and I never had him until this elbow I mean I've had it on elbows before but I did it smart and I didn't keep working out this time I tried to meathead my way through it yeah again and it it flared up pretty bad to the point where four months later it wasn't healed it's a slow healing thing right you were slow yeah they don't have any blood supply so I got a bunch of shit is that why the platelet rich plasma works so well yes it just gets it right yeah yeah it's very effective yeah the other thing that's I think the most effect is what we're talking about is those Thera bands and actually that's the cheapest no the twisty blue thing that I you use it looks like a big avatar dildo and you hold it out in front of you I wish I had it with me and then you twist it like that yeah then I hold it like this and then I let it untwist yeah so I just got one yeah and then you like and when you do the untwisting it strengthens for me that was my you're on the inside I'm on the outside so I go the other way yeah there would be there's another one they'll show they have diagrams for different girls you could do but it's different it's but it's just those kind of muscles don't get strengthened a lot my muscles in my hands picking things up and I'm doing chin-ups and rows and stuff like that but I was never doing anything twisties yeah started to add the amount of driving I do isn't good for me right for you back no for put on my hands or for anything it's my whole body do you put a lumbar pad or anything no but most cars I Drive have like real sporty you know seats and a lot of them I'm lucky enough to have adjustable lumbar Mercedes right now is killing the seat game Mercedes C game is so fired what are they doing just they they work with this spinal Center in Germany oh Jesus to develop all their high-end seats and the seats on the s-class the AMG s-class is are so ridiculous it's like he they have it okay so they have a simulated hot stone massage function that works it's boss as hell it's like a nine zone massage seat in the s-class coupe so while you're driving it gives you a hot stone massage yeah what is it different seen a hot stone massage and a regular massage the air pockets that get inflated like you know it's it's like a behind the seat the leather there's like these pockets of air like old Reebok pumps right we're gonna pump them up and D inflate them and deflate them in sequence right to simulate kneading or whatever it is well the Mercedes s-class heats those pockets so they're actually the not with hot air the there's a thermal thing on the surface it's so gangster whoa it feels like a hot stone massage it's awesome yeah to the next they have and in fact I got caught the car you know it's got $225,000 car I got it for a week I drove it around at road trip all this I ended up like writing 2,600 words on the seat has the fans behind your neck below the hot air because it was a convertible so oh you got the convertible goddamn that's the back seat there Jamie look at that go for the front seat that's the the the front seats are just just delightful it is but it is amazing that we are in this book there's all the zones oh that's six zones it's amazing that we are in this time where the technology has gotten to this level where cars they're working so hard to improve upon what is already ridiculous oh my god of performance yeah and have you have you experienced any of the semi-autonomous stuff yet none no I haven't I'm surprised as intellectually curious interested in cars that drive themselves they can go fuck themselves you're not interested in a brief experience into the world I am I am it you should be him but for the most blow your fucking mind cause those cars are gonna take away our right to drive oh that's well you should join the human driving Association Alex this is real we're speaking of starting a lobbying Association for the rights of human drivers bill it sounds like a fuckin goof right now but it'll matter to me no it doesn't to me yeah because this what we don't want to ever have as a situation where you summon your autonomous pod and you say take me to wherever and it goes no Joe yeah you're not going there today because of some you know political situation yeah the government tells you the war on driving is here Jack your side oh my god what the fuck and is that an RS America on the left there I think it's a sign I think it might be an older car it's a Carrera whaletail like my 911 yeah what years your 911 it's an 87 that's a good year we're built we're doing a safari build what does that mean oh so you're making it like one of those off-road alley cars around yeah it's called the Kean project my friend Lee Kean is a reporter racing driver and he built one for himself and it is the most glorious thing I've ever driven and it's everything that you love about a 911 applies to this on loose surface there it is that's your car that's not my car my car is going to look like that although it will be a different color and have a roof rack and it'll be it'll be slightly slightly different that thing's crazy that actually is a Richard Tuttle build from England he's kind keen safar ke en and you'll see it closer to mine Turtles the guy that made that yes green card oh that's my this is my video of driving Lee's car and it is see look I was fatter there so it's just drift II woods oversteer and and you know the that that rear engine kind of snapback thing that everyone's all afraid of in 911s the pendulum thing yeah well you get that when you slide and then it catches and comes back on a loose surface there's no catch so you slide it but you don't have the scary snapback it just drifts back injury you know there's Lee he's building the thing so it's probably really good to have a rear-engine bias it is look it is the most controllable delightful and you've got four inches of extra suspension travel so la speed bumps ruts think about this in Los Angeles right so you're gonna drive this rally car around LA yeah yeah yeah it's not a race car it's a street car it's a street car yeah and then you know that looks like so much fun driving it in the dirt oh my god we have so much desert here no one cares you got so Mirage there's trails like there's no speed limits nobody gives a shit I got to be honest there's two videos that made me get really interested in older Porsches one of them was the Chris Harris build with the the Tuttle and the other one was you driving that project nasty car Joey Seeley he's a local as well yeah that car I was like oh that's it yeah that's it just like get it down to the raw dog yeah he took everything out of that car and Richard Tuttle who did Chris's car in England is like the rally you know master he's like a there's there's a project manager and there's Joey who built it and he also I loved the little things he did like make the exhaust come through the rear bumper and those funky wheels on it and the fact there's no carpeting at all like everything inside was stripped away his Instagram is emotion engineering and that has been through a few changes since this video was made it looks like different now he changed the wheels or different wheels different like there's a bunch of different stuff but it's amazing and that guy he used to be a part of this business BBI Autosport he left to go start his own business emotion engineering and he is a master of chassis setup yeah I believe it yeah that's a very very impressive video it's a very interesting video and that's not like the highest horsepower vehicle right no it was really light though it was I think it was me horsepower to them I don't remember maybe 375 380 I mean it was it was fast there was not a slouch at all but you know have you seen what singer is doing now with this air-cooled engine yeah it's crazy well you sent me that whole thing of the price difference between a 911 engine air-cooled engine that's got 200 horsepower versus one that's got 500 yeah like wow yeah the exponential curve of Porsche horsepower costs is really scary since then was $250,000 yes I was like okay if you to buy an engine right an engine on a stand you want that engine this is Porsche air-cooled so a Porsche engine for a Porsche that is earlier than 1995 300 horsepower is gonna run you about 40 grand and that's a ton of money for not a lot of horsepower 400 horsepower will run you about a hundred grand I mean a hundred thousand that's an engine on a stand nothing all right you want 500 horsepower out of that motor it's $250,000 just for the end just for the engine why is that cuz that sounds so crazy in comparison to other cars because a lot of techniques that you would use to make horsepower in other cars you cannot apply to a Porsche engine you're limited on displacement size so it's not you could shove like a nine litre v8 in there like a 4.2 is about as big displacement as you can get in that case and that's with like a stroker crank and bored out so you're increasing both the lengths the Pistons move and the the size of the hole to get to the 500 horsepower mark you have to run some highly experimental cylinder heads and singer to do that I don't know if Chris has been on the show recently but sees working with singer to develop there's a company called Williams that is a Formula One team they are developing the cylinder heads for singer so Chris Harris is a part of this he's doing to development driving for that yes great which is a good decision that's amazing decision plus the videos will be epic right so most of they're doing a four valve air-cooled head which as far as I know has never been done before all your your engine my engine all the are two valve engines and and they're doing a four valve engine so it's gonna cost a million and a half dollars well the engine is 250 grand this is why yes so crazy a custom cars are a million dollars now isn't that nuts I mean you really want if you really want something next level it can easily be a million oohs Jamie pull up that new singer 911 yeah singer 911 Williams Williams engine it's green yeah but it's got a lot of that that what is that who's the Japanese gentleman who takes those Porsches and saris you make our WB a yeah it's got a lot of that to it well alright so our WB is really interesting cuz in Japan they're like the singer don't you think that's a goddamn gorgeous car yeah don't you think it's an odd choice to artificially different stop please artificially differentiate like the way he's got the fender flares he's just he's making him like he had a gloom on carbon fiber yeah the whole cars carbon fiber why did why did they fake like they had like extensions okay so I don't want to disappoint you but that is a rendering and not a picture of an actual car as far as I know the actual car does not exist and I think if I had to guess they put those over fender lines on the rendering so you would specifically notice that they have widened it that's and if I had to guess the final car may not actually have a seam there you know what man I'm not I'm not mad if it does it looks amazing Jamie can you make that bigger again Oh real that's crazy that that's not a photograph uh a render T I'm almost certain that's not a real car I'm almost certain it's not a real car I could be wrong there could there could be someone screaming it there whatever right now saying I'm pretty sure reflections in the window three years ago this dude well I play a video I absolutely believe it I'm not arguing against that I'm just saying it's so good yeah anyway if they make a car like that holy shit that's a gorgeous car oh yeah and they will and it'll look like that but it may not have those seams it's pretty similar to what their car looks like but wider much different you know the wider I saw one of those it might have been the best-looking car I've ever seen in my life it was a silver like a metallic silver like a bright silver singer yeah and it was on line under stadiums like glory god damn see if you find that bright sill a silver singer have you seen one in person before up close dude you mind would be blown they have at a minimum minimum forty five or fifty thousand dollars of leather in one of those cars in the interior the leather work in the interior of those cars is unbelievable beyond anything from any manufacturer today really yeah that's it that's a sexy motherfucker right there damn that's a good-looking car yep that's very very nice what is it about certain shapes right does is they distill you know the best of each generation of car into one car yeah and so you're looking at a highly idealized 911 but you can't exactly picture what came from where and why yeah it's gangster and those Fuchs those wheels for whatever reason they just work mm-hmm like especially that green car those we go back to that green card they made them all they made them real big on the green car but the design works so well there's the Williams engine goddamn yeah it looks good yeah like that's perfect so scroll down Jamie the the Williams look at this so you see look at the air intakes that's where your rear windows would be there are no rear windows there are only those air intakes that go directly into the engine cool that furnace off that's no not cooling that's the actual air intake that goes into the combustion chamber the cooling it's air-cooled so you see that silver kind of nipple on the right side there that's the center of the fan it gets cooled in from the back there now like this is basically the same size as a regular inline six flats yeah yeah roughly that the engine itself is roughly the same size yeah so what they've done is just engineer it to the max oh yeah well they have them they have what our in theory are the most advanced cylinder heads ever put on to an air-cooled 911 looks incredible and they're gonna stick that in a car that was originally what 93 something that yeah something like that yeah 91 to 94 isn't it funny though that there's something unbelievably appealing about those air-cooled cars that is willing to have these rich people pay a million dollars or at least their current singers a half-million dollars off this car just because you feel it more yeah when you drive it it's just got a feel to it there's a certain kind of mechanical brilliance to it that's really really you can't it's incomparable really it's very unique yeah well there's something about those old cars particularly the ones that don't have power steering uh-huh you just you've you get a thrill out of them there's a weird thrill even when you're not even driving fast well especially with a Porsche when you when you have no power steering combined with front-engine car it sucks no power steering when the engines in the back is okay cuz the front of the car is pretty is pretty light so yeah you don't need too much muscle but the 911 steering is just super super direct yeah it's super direct and it's just I don't know man it just it just feels like a different thing you're doing I mean I had a buddy that had a Volkswagen bug growing up didn't have a lot of power in it but those Volkswagen bugs those fucking things like when you drive them around they give you a little smile on your face because you're driving like this little tiny thing that feels completely connected with the road he's like very capable but it's like you're smiling when you dry well you see the ultimate Volkswagen is they're taking in Germany they take the the buses the micro buses and they and they chop them down so they're you know compress and they put full Porsche floor pan drivetrain and so remember that 996 turbo you had the all-wheel drive so they'll put that whole floor pan on a microbus and they'll go to like track days and beat up on race cars it's crazy there look seriously look here so here's what is so crazy 530 horsepower Porsche 993 by turbo powered Volkswagen microbus same little window see the intake on the rear window there that's so crazy and that's on a race track oh my god it probably weighs nothing right nothing and I mean look what happens god forbid you crash one of those yeah there's crazy people taking VW bugs and put Porsche engines in them I know they've been doing that yeah well they the common one is a suit oh the old 356 engine yeah or no no no I think someone was putting an older 911 engine in it or a ninth 912 912 engine yeah yeah the 4-cylinder yeah 912 SR people are paying way too much money for them stop it yeah they're like like 30 $40,000 really they're so slow yeah that's a slow ass yeah yeah yeah you might have like I get that it's about feel and yeah 909 12s have feel but at a certain point there has to be some paces so see ya know when they made those cars it was the same shell on the outside yeah yeah they just like Dee contented it you know cheap and everything interesting the old engine if somebody wanted a hot rod a nine twelve out and like put a crazy 99 three engine in it and to all the suspension it would still be a 912 yeah weird there's people that convert 912 sort of into 911s all the time yeah but yeah well no yeah like all the new year no but that's what's so crazy about it is that you're essentially it's the same good stuff yeah the 911 yeah what it looks like on the outside but do the numbers match that's the thing but the difference with Porsche people I'm the difference between $40,000 and $400,000 will be the most minut insignificant bullshit of this one was delivered with you know leather covered vents in a leather covered fuse box in a fucking fuchsia steering wheel and it had the lightweight glass so that one's 400 grand in that one's 40 I mean that's really what it is it's the only muscle cars you do the same thing this was one of four delivered and plumb crazy and yeah automatic transmission on a Tuesday with a white roof and a cum stain in the backseat from the factory I love those auctions receipt that's to greet in people's eyes just going off the funny thing is when they people like well they'll get in a bidding war and overpay for something by 40 grand and still feel like they want yeah they feel like they school outgive long as that motherfucker didn't get it yeah I went to barrett-jackson for the first time ever this year I had to see it in person it's a shit show is it an absolute shit show yeah yeah yeah it's crazy and you know it's in Scottsdale and but barrett-jackson itself what they don't show you on TV is that you can buy anything they're like you can buy fan they had a jet turbine powered fan boats whoa that you could buy like it's thought it's like the auction and I'm gonna render that and then like a mile of swap meet II shit and you could buy custom-made cowboy boots and tempur-pedic beds and you know home furnishings and terrible art and watches and it was massage chairs anything you think of well it was it was just such a like sea of Commerce damn and there's like a lot of cars that don't make TV that are either amazing or very very sad in the in their own what do you have to do to get in there do you have to is there like a qualification thing to just walk in no to set a car in there oh you just go on their website and apply to sell a car I think I've I don't think there's and I think they're happy to take your money and try and sell your car so the guy like Eric on ray from going there I like just Pinto I don't I mean I don't know I don't think anything other than someone figuring out the joke before he did it but I don't think much I think you could probably do it but for the most part it's people that are pretty serious about cars it was a lot of dealers it was a lot more dealers that seemed like they were selling to each other in terms of the actual buying and the selling but yeah I mean there's a lot of NASCAR jackets out there and then you see the they have some of the higher-end auctions too which sort of resemble the Pebble Beach II ones do you still have that crazy Corvette sold it oh I have a crazy Mustang now what you get oh yeah yeah it's on the cover of Car Craft this month it's in speed hunters as well did a great article and in speed owners that is a ridiculous car it's awesome on your show you were him called it like the worst piece of shit ever fuck you rut why'd you decide to soup up that car the consumers in Karawang I wanted in high school but like it's my highest it's a high school you know the high school reliving car oh wow well over the top magic pulling up to high school with that thing she'd go back in a time machine bro I went to my actual ten-year high school reunion in a orange Lamborghini as a goof and there was literally not a single soul outside when I parked it up front zero people saw right well it couldn't have been more wasted shit that's what you want a car like that it's like 80% of rival yeah yeah never set it up again now if they see the Lamborghini there's my Mustang if you see the Lamborghini on the way out of the reunion it's really lame hmm it just was not the best looking year Knoll I have the notchback and the notch attack is better mine was a police car was it yeah it was a highway patrol car Wow um see that's the notchback there and it was cheaper to get those I remember you can get the 5.0 engine right we didn't know that and the point of that is the police cars were the lightest ones so no air conditioning no sunroof no fog lights no power windows no power door locks so you know that was the lightest v8-powered Mustang ever made look at my interior that's the job I love crazy fabrics so much that interiors badass cholo fantastic I actually like it I thought it would hate that no it's like 70s outdoor patio furniture keep that image back up there I like the we're getting Joe and interior today I don't know I could never go like that just leave doubt they're like the gauges man everything you did there Porsche style steering a lot of tipo I love that I love the shifters that a Hurst yeah her shifter and then the center tray in between the Recaro seats is from a 73 Mercedes a 280 and then the pattern came from modern fabrics and it's like an outdoor patio furniture fabric so it's like UV resistant and spill resistant what are those wheels Jamie click on those wheels in the right hand side what are the wheeled the wheels I have a it's called their HR e RS 105's which is about three place forged wheel and I'm running 295 tires at all four corners so they're eighteen by ten and a half at all four corners they're awesome no us handle amazing oh it sticks so it sticks like a gt3 it turns in so hard and I'm running see the tires are sport cup 2 s which are like gt3 tires and what is this car we think 3110 wet so it's pretty good it's it's it's got really good brakes really good handling it's medium fast it's about 350 horsepower so it's quick enough are you gonna leave the engine the way it is well it has a crate motor in it right which it could use some more could use a little more yeah and so if I keep the car long term I'm gonna take out that engine and put in the GT 350 yeah if I keep the car long-term how many horsepower gt3 525 but it revs to 8200 that's what it's really about yeah no I heard one of those on a video it's a great it's like that doesn't sound anything like a Mustang it doesn't it sounds like a something a more Italian yeah just yeah yeah I was gonna say like a Ferrari oh yeah well they do a different firing order and they also I think it's is gonna happen harima that's wrong but the flat plane crank changes the sound gt350 exhaust 2018 gt350 it's pretty glorious yeah well I'm terrified that they're gonna come out with that gt500 and I'm gonna fall it could happen it could happen it has a very yeah yeah that sounds a mate yeah no I think you have one of my videos open in the background Jamie because I'm hearing double god dammit Jamie listen but look at that oh that sounds so yeah it's not it's are very unlike anything else on the road very distinctive so that's that's that's a one of the most special engines are 37 they're all heavy why can't anybody figure that out because my features people want features right everybody though some people don't want that that's why people like you and I are so fascinated by something like singer life don't want Spencer out of money you can't have light and cheap and fast you gotta you gotta pick one if you want light and cheap it's your Miata you know you can't have a if they're if they had a three thousand pound Mustang that had the features that people demand from a modern car yeah it would be two hundred thousand dollars you'd have a Ferrari you know yeah but even Ferraris aren't that light anymore that's true that's true nothing's like what is the lightest thing you buy like a Porsche Boxster there's the Lotus Lotus Evora Evora 410 is under three thousand pounds I think which is a really really really really nice car I drove that little one too little big Z's yeah I drove that a few years back yeah a Evora doesn't eat you up like that does it didn't have any horsepower though it was very for 410 the other one no not that easy or of the exceeds yeah - really the one where doesn't have any floor panels didn't have anything yeah I was like this is kind of interesting because it's like I'd like this little go-kart it doesn't Lotus this thing yeah so that's what I drove that's the Evora sport for ten I just drove that and it's really really good yeah really nice and that's also a manual transmission it is yeah it's a supercharged Camry engine believe it or not really yeah how many horsepower 410 supercharged cameras that's a beautiful car it's really good-looking and it's got of that thing it's got a titanium exhaust God it's so unique mhm you know in a sea of 911s it does stand out why you would like that car I think that could that would be a good one for you mmm like you need another one that's a pretty car too but that's the other one that's the least yeah yeah the Elise is the one that I drove that gray one that you just clicked on Jamie I drove that that's a beautiful looking car but it's got no balls no but you can stun those like this is crazy how slow this is they made some you might have driven the smaller engine one they made some that we're a little faster yeah yeah the base one was like 180 horsepower and then they go up to 260 or 280 but there's something thrilling about it oh it's like driving a fleet yeah so how much does that thing weigh think 2,500 or something is light it's very light yeah it's nothing and it's beautiful they just make beautiful cars those lotuses are that they will be $30,000 used cars for until the end of time the Elise yeah absolutely bottom doubt at 30 grand and you can buy them and sell them at 30 grand all day isn't it funny how cars were worth almost nothing and then like a seventy three RS mm-hmm America no it wasn't RS America just at RS RS 7 3 RS is worth like a million dollars now yeah it used to be worth $20,000 just a few years ago mm-hmm like how did that happen I remember I saw those for sale and someone's saying this is the perfect Porsche it's not the most powerful right it's only like 225 horsepower so I'm like that but it's so light and so fun to drive I was like get the fuck out of here with 225 horsepower well it's like you know the world the world has become more automated right everything is faster more efficient but less involved in less mechanical and at the same time you've got especially with Porsche a younger audience a very wealthy audience you know that has really decided to use the older collector cars as a currency that you can drive and investments and yeah there's a lot of rich people out there right now and they're not making anymore 1973 911s yeah that's one of the things that people have a real problem with with singer is they're taking those cars and chopping them the fuck up mm-hmm they're taking in 964 and just yeah taking a hundred thousand dollar car and turning it into a five thousand dollar car that if you can get on the list and get one and you take it home it's immediately worth seven hundred on the open market I bet right because people want to be on the flipper market for a singer it's like you name your price name your price if you wanted to get a singer made how many years is even his waiting list two years three years so two years three years for waiting less than a year to make the car yeah and they're making it by hand with carbon fiber it's crazy I've seen the videos of people visiting the factory which is not here you should go I should go I'll introduce you they're very good I'll do it I'll start doing numbers in my head yeah it's just all this I mean and there's and then there's a whole cut singer I think not to dwell on singer so much but they opened the door for a a sub industry below them that's doing $200,000 you know builds that are like halfway to singer mmm you know for most people that's probably like yeah that's what most feel that's really fuckin excessive yeah yeah I bought you know I'm doing this Safari thing but I bought my 87 Carrera and it's stock and I almost didn't want to start modifying it because it was just such a nice thing to drive around yeah it was just lovely well that's recent enough where they have like good brakes yeah and it's a superlight car so you you know 80s is good I mean I think the the what's great there's a there's a series of shows now called rad wood well yeah it's a car show for 80s and 90s cars fuckin great dude it's great because these are cars you can drive right you know they have air conditioning they have reasonably you know modern whatever you could just start them up and drive them dude it's like old 80s Benzes and and just just this great great scene of 80s and 90s cars at rad wooden they've got a bunch of shows around and come out and say hi up I'm at a bunch of them but you know people like my age I'm 36 or seeing these cars as collectible now and it's gonna I sure in a new market dude there's a lot of good investments to be made in 80's and 90's cars yeah yeah yeah Wow yeah you know what is redwood that's crazy these are good-looking cars dude there's the mean like this is like an 86 Acura Legend that looks mint honey mine had an Acura Legend just like that he loved that thing a 787 Legend that's a great car one car that I had that I wish I didn't get rid of Prelude it's so clean I had the last year the NSX oh really the o2 yeah well yeah the headlights just to fix headlights you shouldn't have gotten rid of this a big dollar car right now it's hot I don't have did I loved it too that was a light ass car I don't know what those things weighed 28 tweet all right I'll tell you what if you like that car that Lotus 410 I just showed you you would love that real that is the new version of that car really yep I don't know if I want the new version though I don't think I like to over that's the thing no no the new version feels like the old version with like bluetooth and your basic said it is yeah fuck that was a great car so light they're very and they're they're durable you can drive them yeah people hope my Honda yeah I mean how did they figure it out so much better than the Americans did when it came to reliability well they just built a light car and then put their Accord engine in it pretty much yeah but I mean all their cars oh I mean it looked you go through across the board we were talking earlier about Land Cruisers that's like gotta be one of the most reliable cars in the history of the free world Wow why the fuck are they so good at that and most companies like American companies during that same age if you get a 1990s Ford no I know it's terrible running right yeah I know but 1995 Land Cruiser driving through Africa right now Land Cruisers are a specific are an interesting example specifically because I went on the press launch for landcruiser so I know this most cars are built to a 10-year service life the landcruiser is built to a 25 year service life the land cruisers parts are almost a hundred percent unique to land cruiser they they share very few parts with anything else in Toyotas lineup and that's why you look at you go oh it's a full-size SUV why is this thing ninety thousand dollars because everything on it is industrial grade shit designed to last twice as long as like any other car yeah it seems like when you drive one to me tanks absolute absolute tanks and they're over engineered but I think in the in the 80s and 90s I think the Japanese design and production philosophy was just so far beyond where we were yeah we were making shit during those garbage absolutely I mean I have a 88 Mustang you just saw I have an 87 Porsche and I had a 1990 Nissan Skyline GTR the Marsha and the fuckin skyline are same time same time period yeah they're spaceships compared to the hunk of shit that is my Mustang I mean those guidelines are bad out there man awesome Scott oh yeah yeah I sold it but I I doubled up in six months though they're hollow think about what they did with the GTR when they came in when Nissan came out with the GTR the new the new instable newest one dude I've only driven one of those twice but one time when I drove one though the most remarkable thing about it was I was taking a turn to hit an off-ramp and I was like a little late I was like oh that's the light I got to change lanes and it just went like this crossed the lanes zip yep like nothing yeah no lien there was nothing it just defied physics yeah I was like this thing's crazy it's just it's calculating how much mass is leaning this way and adjusting right to flatten everything out electronically so actually the new Acura NSX that's like the supercar II won it's like 150 grand does that same thing that the GTR did in Oh nine but it does it much more seamlessly so you think you did it yeah that awesome driving that just happened in the GTR you're like wow the GTR is doing all this awesome shit right in the NSX you're like I'm a fucking hero because you can't cuz it so it's so seamless like the GTR it's a mechanical you know all-wheel drive system with these clutch packs and whatever so you can hear it like clunk clunk clunk around in like moving power and doing all the shit right the NSX is rear-wheel drive gas engine and then electric motors in the front wheel so it can do all kinds of funky shit with the front wheels the two wheels can be going completely different speeds from each other it's completely independent of what's happening at the back it's all this computer algorithms but it's magic front end its front end that cannot happen within the constraints of like normal rotational physics whoa yeah dude you should work for an Acura I should sell cars you got my dick hard for nanosec hmm mmm it's a good buy right now people don't want them touchy why I don't know because they're not like the old one like you said you want the old one that's people want the stick and simple and it's complicated and but if people were looking for a double clutch supercar that seems to be a really good bargain it's a great looking car it is I had one for a week it was awesome awesome and apparently the the power seems very accessible right sorry I'm thirsty it's a four it's very forgiving and very easy to drive and it makes you feel like Mario Andretti I hope they don't not make them anymore I think there are they've got to make them for a bit they've committed but I think you should buy one if you think you might like the tinge of responsibility when the Viper went out of business that I never bought a Viper this is so good Posterous it's such a preposterous it is like I thought about getting one those AC ARS with the wings yeah vented hoods and yeah I'm like just for it just because it's such a douchebag car yes it seems like if you were to list off like the check boxes of things that you personally enjoy it seems like it does actually tick most of those boxes in there yeah totally looking like a penis besides that it really ticks the rest of the box yeah it looks like Godzilla's dick it looks like this sort of like super saij automatron it's very shredder but it's so American - it's such a ridiculous thing to build well it's a merit what's so American about it is that rather than you know Porsche developing this insane gearbox you know that can shift in a microsecond and and Nissan doing this crazy fucking all-wheel drive system and you know whoever Acura doing their torque vectoring electric motors fibers just like more downforce you know we don't know manual gearbox just yeah just more downforce develop the stickiest tire you can find here you can pop these things out and get even more downforce and that's that's like the whole thing yeah just put wings on it and it'll that'll be fine but meanwhile they brought it to every racetrack and they were nice tractor breaking records yeah it's crazy yeah it's the most American thing ever yeah look ya'll just bought a bigger gun the biggest 50 caliber machine gun ever desert eagle oh yeah it's America big ol American dick it's super America yeah but then they stopped making them I'm glad because murca isn't necessarily commercially valuable something come on the age of trauma things you bring it back bring it back vipers for everybody life is every coal miner gets a Viper a job and a viper for every coal miner it's the most preposterous American car would you agree ooh well we have some preposterous vehicles here in America I mean the fact that you can get a pickup truck version of an Escalade is pretty funny you know do that still I think they may have stopped I'm thinking I think I may have stepped on my own joke but okay let's see preposterous it's up there it's pretty and some yeah the Ford GT is pretty preposterous in a very in a very good way that's a super toy supercar though it's extremely supera and that's uh is that is John Cena in trouble for selling his Forge I don't think so I don't think the contract is enforceable you don't think so I I'm just going by what I've read I don't tell people with the story is so to get one of the new Ford GTS right it's what's called a homologation racecar okay so they wanted to go win the 24 hours of Lamaze the the LM GTE class in order to race in that class it has to be a streetcar right so you have to build a certain number of streetcars you can't just build a dedicated race car that would be called the prototype class okay so they had to build I think the number is 499 it's four hundred and something for 50 49 whatever it is Ford decides that the demand will outstrip the supply and there rather than you know highest bidder ring or whatever they make you like apply so you you have to be a social media star or a celebrity or someone you had to like tell them why you should have a Ford GT and what you were gonna do with it and how you were gonna share your Ford GT with the world and then they would decide that you had earned the right to buy their four hundred and fifty thousand dollar car and it came with a contract that she couldn't sell it for two years they didn't want people flipping him right which apparently is exactly what John Cena what it did for an must be so fuckin rich like why why would he violate the contract for a couple hundred bucks he's huge see a really very huge person Ormus how huge is he like enormous well he's just enormous like whiff I bet he's probably only like six three or six four I write a few says four he can't fit in it so if he took delivery and can't fit in it that's probably why he would get rid of it rather than sort of at all mr. scene is but I I'm sorry when my head hit the ceiling that's probably exactly he's probably six to at least he seems like a guy who should be even longer and taller than he is because he's so thick it's almost like they chopped off a foot of his arms and every place on a giant but his wrists are like fucking tree trunks hilarious what 250 yeah see home so you probably close it be closed six foot two or six foot six foot two hundred fifty-pound oh oh well I don't know why he sold it but he did maybe even for him if it's two inches for you maybe I felt squashed in there look I drove it for one day I I don't know what it what kind of sacrifices to buy it but I say fuck me might be a good car if you're good for you so the seat is fixed and the pedals and steering wheel are adjustable you can't adjust the seat how bizarre yeah the pedals come to you yeah I don't think I like that that's what you got to do man it's what you have to do because their car the shape of the car dictates the the seat back angles a bit can't be can't can't you just make this seat slide put the seat on like a seat no you can't the car so low you did see a seat rail is like inches inches precious inches yeah the roof is 43 inches from the ground that's like this whoa it's so low it's that low it's 43 inches is from the roof to the ground yeah compared to all the car it one limo by the way in the year was supposed to wow you park it next to a 911 a 911 is like six inches taller than one of these things whoa that makes a really big difference in the 24 Hours of LeMans a mile an hour straightaway speeds like that's a huge difference yeah so they've designed the car without seat rails to get everything even further down you know it's a dope looking car I saw one that was black with red stripe that was the press car that was what I was driving around there letõs got the same color - god it's a pretty car it's gangster that's a pretty car carbon fiber wheels it's which are lovely carbon fiber wheels so there's two kinds of weight in a car there's sprung weight and unsprung weight it's not with anything so strong weight is weight that is most of what you think of as the car the engine the body anything that is sprung on the suspension unsprung weight is weight on the car that is not sprung on the suspension so wheels brake rotors tires suspension components that aren't sitting on the suspension right so it's like a rough calculation but like roughly 1 pound of unsprung weight will translate the feeling of 5 pounds of sprung weight so meaning like if you are able to pull 20 pounds of unsprung weight out of your car each wheel is 4 pounds are as 5 pounds lighter than a stock wheel ok so you know about 20 unsprung weight of your car your car will feel like you pulled a hundred pounds out of it well and it will stop start accelerate turn better commute totally in awe little perform better in all areas so to go from a forged aluminum wheel which is 23 or 24 25 pounds of wheel to a carbon fiber wheel it's like 11 pounds a wheel you you're pulling so much unsprung weight out of the car it'll feel like you know swinging a baseball bat with a weight on it and then just throw in that weight away Wow yeah massive massive massive massive massive difference and the wheels are so expensive I would imagine like how many companies make carbon fiber wheel one one call carbon revolution and they're from Australia and though they only make them for the four they make them for you can buy the wheels they have fitments for a few different cars Porsche gt3 is one and they make them for Ford we do me a favor Jamie and pull up the photo of that black Ford GT with the red stripes it's on my Instagram if you have my Instagram handy the one I drove och it's an incredibly the road presence is just obscene and it makes noises that only thing god damn it makes noises that only race cars make there's a specific sound like you know the pops and crackles you get from most of these modern cars and they dump the fuel in the exhaust and shit it's just it's cool but it's a synthetic e sound it's programmed right this does that not programmed it's just like fuel into header bang it's just sorry scars and this it goes for like five hundred thousand dollars yeah 450 if you can get one but you can't get what you can't get unless you know john cena and then it's the root I mean the rumor has he got like over a million for his butt oh so some of the otter well that makes sense it flipped it he flipped it yeah and so they're suing him yeah I read that it was thrown out they sued him for breach of contract for selling it yeah but he he claims or claimed that the contract didn't say he couldn't sell it oh so it was a verbal agreement or something yeah no maybe it was one of those things they just hoped nobody would call him out on and maybe it's unenforceable you know I mean how do they sell you something and then enforce that you can't sell the thing you bought you can't do that so you literally can't do that I don't think that's enforceable I think once the contract is signed and you take possession of this object that's yours to do whatever you live I think again morally I can agree this America motherfucker but for fucking hats off you made a dope ass car that thing's amazing it's extremely extremely crazy it really in it it's it's unlike anything else on the road because even even the very very high-end super cars you know your lamborghini aventador z-- that are four hundred grand and your v12 Ferraris and all that stuff are fundamentally their road cars and even when you they go racing with them they they sort of take the road car and modify it for racing this is so clearly a race car that they had to build some Street cars you know why and it's fucking rockin it looks amazing it's got an air brake on in the act doesn't mean so the bill back to the rear picture yeah so the wing the whole wing that that whole wing that goes across the back there lifts up when you hit the brakes well it lifts when you start driving quick it lifts up and becomes a wing wing right and then when you hit the brakes it flips up and becomes an actual air brake that's and it is extremely effective imagine what it does is it you know when you brake you the card nose dives and it completely eliminates the dive so the car does squat straight down Wow it's wild it's fucking gorgeous yeah are they gonna keep making them I don't I don't think so why not Ford if I had to guess they lose money on every single one they make if I had to guess kind of a bullshit word it would run in here I know Trump I thought you were gonna fix all this I thought that was a party platform that's what I heard it's gonna make American cars great again - we we the the car economy is it's such a global economy like American collect we make a bunch of like Hellcats are built like in Canada open like we make BMW x5 s in South Carolina well we may not afford Tundras in Texas that's we make Toyota Toyota Tundras sorry yeah Toyota's make couple different cars here in America right I think couple cars in America I think Japanese automakers probably have at least as many auto workers in America as American car companies do this is definitely the same car I was driving the press car thing god what is great is just the the buttresses like when it goes by you can see right through the side of the car you can just see the air there between the tunnel and the pod that's so pretty yeah that might be the best-looking car I've ever seen it is so cool you're so fast as far as I chimeric encar that literally might be the best-looking car I've ever seen I think if it's my money I well I would buy the older GT the 2005 one because I like the manual transmission sure and I just think it was that was just one of the best cars ever made do you ever drive one of those yeah what's that like the best really the best the best best yeah cuz this is a race car right and and everything that comes with it that one it was a road car and it was let's make the best Road car we can make and so it wasn't a particularly successful race car but as a road car it was just glorious the ride and the power and the style and the sound and you know it's they had to develop that car very quickly I think the last time I was on this show we were talking about four GTS and you know so everything's over built so you can run like double stock horsepower and you can run almost 280 miles an hour in the fucking mile and these things on stock Aero and people do crazy shit with them like put twin turbos on them and stuff oh I started with not crazy it's expensive but it's it's proven science at this point they're not breaking any new ground yeah Wow it's it's actually because they're supercharged from the factory right so they're meant to handle forced induction so the turbo system you take off the supercharger and the turbo system supplants it is that the right word I don't know it's just it runs more boost but it's a very very strong engine and so they're not completely different systems they just they both force air in just they do in different ways and when you buy one from the factory how many horsepower did it come with 550 550 is a lot back then it's a bot yeah with no traction control that was the last last car the Viper it's the same year viper might have one year but basically the last car without traction control for stability control yeah so a lot of people would crash them oh yeah we'd imagine yeah my gt3 doesn't have shit on it oh yeah it has I don't think so no it has anti-lock brakes I don't think it has traction control really oh I think the next model did cuz it's the RS huh I don't know how fortunate for you if it doesn't a very raw car I loved your car yeah I had a lot of fun driving your car did fun cars man that's great I think maybe the next maybe the next thing i buy might be an RS they're great I know they're getting so expensive I know but it's safe money well thanks 1007 year two is like that's the year yeah the one afterwards they became then they started having traction make sure that's true I'm pretty sure it's true 2007 gt3 RS no traction control pretty sure there's a period of mm and mm up to an end of 2003 Porsche was using the engine called the Metzger engine which which traced its way back to Lamar it was a very very strong engine Lamar that would give me correctly yes we sell a man's a man it's like the movie with Steve McQueen fuckin hate that movie the movie stinks does it yeah I Steve McQueen movie stink wow you are a crazy person I dare you I like the image of Steve McQueen I like what he represents this broody American from the 1960s you know like one of the last of the real men yeah I mean I like Steve McQueen based on the photographs of him I've seen I don't like his movies like I thought the mom was interesting because it was like a snapshot of time like what's the other one Oh bullet bullet yeah bullets interesting it's like you're you're looking at a snapshot in time you know it's like well it's weird Sanford San Francisco so empty in Bullitt there's nobody alive back then people there was no technology there was very few people really chat traffic was nothing back then and talk to somebody about what traffic is like in 1960 in LM when I just brought that up earlier this show well I moved here in 94 and I remember when I moved here it was nothing like this really nothing it's gotten a hundred percent worse it's like just twice as many people here it's a few of us it's it's so crazy like you get on the highway on a Saturday night just heading into LA on a Saturday night yeah you're stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for no reason no one's dead there's no accident I remember eating a book right now called traffic it's about the science of traffic and it they did a study in LA and Saturday 2:00 p.m. traffic is worse than any weekday rush-hour in law says everybody's out yeah yeah everyone's out doing their shit dude you know when you go to another city like if you go to a big city like Seattle and like you're there with them and they complain about the traffic first yourself shut the fuck up second of all what I'm doing must be wrong then because I'm dealing with way too many people yeah guys have got it right this is the right amount like you got a lot of people but enough too many people I get a medium-sized city that's not LA yeah yeah and then traffic makes sense it goes in it goes out yeah like here it's just like the hence the scooter you want to get out before it gets all Bladerunner e well you know it's like those dudes like Magnus Walker lived in downtown LA dreadlocks and garage warehouse district those guys like that shit right he likes that shit he likes being an urbanite I'm super fucked I'm in Venice when that tsunami comes I'm super fuck yeah you're right on the edge yeah it's not good for me not looking good all the cars are done there's an app what's the app that wants to give us access the early warning app says you have 60 seconds for your fucking death that's because that was I had in Hawaii I did well yeah there so there's an app now that's working in California but the figure Eight's that you're about to die it's it's an earthquakes about to hit they apparently have it depending upon the magnitude of the earthquake which is really scary because the higher magnitude possibility the more time you have oh they can really yeah they can give you up to a minute hmm to know your fucks Ville dude I'm just thinking what can i I'm thinking about one again in a minute no we're no we're worth getting mmm I can get to like a my closet do you have stored food or anything I'm embarrassed that I don't have a list of shit I need for probably should probably get for an earthquake that only you must have a whole room of shit in this fucking policy right here but here I've have meat in here but I have do have commercial freezers of course you do LEL right yeah yeah but I have emergency rations I have freeze-dried food and you know that could last me a few months how would you like how would you physically get out of the city you only do you would really be fucked he says you just start walking would you by school well the real fuck would be cars to be too many cars right there's way too many cars for the you ever see what happened when the Hurricanes were hitting Texas hmm people tried to escape or Florida like floor of the last one you can't go anywhere and they just get stuck on the highway stuck and you run out of gas and the highway it's never be scared and desperate it's not good in hurricanes you see coming this earthquake yet 30 seconds yeah you know all right I think my scooter is what's gonna save me it's gonna be gonna go you gonna go somewhere they're gonna meet you yeah yeah they're gonna hunt you down and put me on a spit yeah you gonna keep you alive so they could eat you longer because there's no refrigeration just gonna tie you up and cut off parts of you eat it in front of you and they come here and bust into this fuck this yeah I mean that's the move come here we'll help you about this space dude who has a float tank that is so awesome everybody should have one I agree I just my real concern is that just that the mass of humans does the sheer number is so insane and I don't think it's I don't even think it's sustainable like this number of people that are there's never been a time ever in human history when we've had masses of people crammed into areas like we have today in our urban areas you mean modern America modern Mexico City is like that jammed up yeah there's quite a few places that are like the population numbers higher now than it's ever been recorded human history and so the population in these cities is higher than it's ever been we've never had like Matt we never had 20 million people in a city before in America like we do in LA what's that Jamie states with a smaller population than Los Angeles County is that all of them 30-something states is LA County 20 million people yet it's like 16 something I think this is like on the 10 to 11 million units so look at this this map in it's one tiny little area of California and it has more people in it if it was a state then almost every fucking state except Florida that in Texas New York Pennsylvania Ohio and give me Illinois Illinois god damn that is just fucking banana that was so crazy I don't is it was it worth you didn't live no if I didn't live yeah it's not no so where would you live if you didn't live here I probably like I like Colorado a lot Colorado's good state mountains are good I like no I like Northern California but not San Francisco like mouths yeah farmers get fucked up I deal with that weird do to keeps knocking on your door yeah you would um Colorado I think I like Utah - I like Utah Utah's very underrated those people are very nice they I think you everybody thinks Utah they're all fucking Mormons I can't do it Mormons are friendly some of the nicest folks ever I spent like four months in st. George where's that it's the very corner southwest corner of Utah right at the Arizona Nevada corner yeah and it's like the the town nearest to like Zion National Park I was doing like a landscape photography for a while that's a gorgeous Zion is awesome it's so pretty and actually if you bring it back to cars we had a show at NBC Sports called drive and did a national parks their roads through our national parks here in America are glorious glorious yellow Yosemite Zion Death Valley Bryce Canyon all have amazing roads go through them yeah yeah and just the view that you get mm-hmm we're very lucky here we've got a lot of cool shit uh-huh and in California we got the best roads in America possibly we got some pretty good buns mm-hmm you know that just that place where everybody goes to just to drive to fuck around that Angels Crest Highway god that's pretty that's where I was this morning before I came here yeah we'll be driving up there my Focus RS I was having fun we adjusted the suspension and so I needed to shake it down those are fast little cars very fast I worked with mount hoon on mine so it's making 377 wheel horsepower and 455 wheel torque from a four-cylinder and we have an adaptable you DDC adaptive suspension adaptive coilovers that's hilarious awesome the car is very very fast right now and that's a really light car too right that's not so light yeah it's small but it's all-wheel drive which adds to the weight and so it's it's it's not super heavy but it's not a it's not a featherweight Porsche alive not a little last name 33 34 but it's it's got a lot of stick and Porsche at Porsche fuck me Ford the RS has this trick all-wheel-drive system you can actually power oversteer so it's not like when the front wheels slip you get power to the back like it has a what they call a drift mode which can send up to a hundred percent of the power to the back Wow so you didn't want you to get crazy even actually oversteer it and slide the engineered craziness Wow the newer and the new m5 you know is all-wheel drive in the new AMG c63 is all-wheel drive and you can electronically disconnect the all-wheel drive through a button in both of them whoa yeah so you can get drifty as well get drifty mr. Harris yeah wanting to get drifty whatever yeah what do you think of that new Cadillac what is it the a600 ct-6 with the super cruise I think it's the new big Cadillac that has a giant engine in it now oh it's putting a 600 horsepower engine what does that thing called somebody 6ct 6v seats at what it is I don't I'm gonna say that thing I haven't I saw this thing got me excited about Cadillacs well there's a cts-v no not that one it's the Sam I think it's called the CTC yes ct-6 is their biggest one it's the brand-new the brand new one has a crazy V engine I don't think it has it has a twin dual overhead cam v8 which is like the most advanced General Motors engine ever and it's gonna be a Cadillac exclusive engine which hasn't happened since remember the North Star right that was the last time caddy got their own motors they're making a big deal about it being Cadillac exclusive okay Camaro go fuck yourself yeah because that's that's sort of what Cadillac hasn't had right is you know they Cadillac like they actually the CTSV is the lightest fastest car in its class that is the best steering in its class as the most horsepower in its class so I'm an amazing little cannot sell them they can't sell seats CSVs they can't sell ATS fees like what do you mean no one's buying those well I mean I'm sure there's a few reasons but the infotainment system that q system is really pretty terrible exFAT dick a lot of people don't make it to the test drive because of that yeah that that thing is really like a liability not good it's very bad I tried to like I was I rented an Escalade yeah and I was going through all that shit to try to get to the navigation like what the fuck man the tie-back cars forever I'm good at this no I can't figure out how to get the navigation where do you where's home where's the fucking home button so that there that's why that's one aren't they switching over to car play now or worse in the Android or Apple phone yeah you can get those yeah that's you still that still doesn't get you around the touch button right stuff and the heat there it is the CT 8 CT 8 dad yeah fucking slide I mean if that actually artist's rendering own boy that's what it's really good that's a CT 6 if it looks like that will say Cadillac has a really nice history of coming out with very bold concept cars and then not building them oh come on cattle are seriously make that they have they built end up building water down shit forever to Cadillac was always the car like my you know grandfather's day yeah you made it you got a fucking cattle I could put that back up for a second please that thing to me looks like a modern version yeah of what I felt like a Cadillac should be well that's not entirely different from a Bentley Flying Spur if you pull up a Bentley Flying Spur that looks similar but that again is a rendering that's the best-looking constellation during like day I hope they make that that way because that is like the best-looking Cadillac I've ever seen its aggressive I mean aggressive for American cars aggressive cells like Chrysler 300 saved Chrysler and when I say best-looking Cadillac I mean best-looking new Cadillac that's what I mean I don't mean like the Batmobile style old-school catalog because I've really feel it's unfair to compare because it tails those are works of art yeah I mean like what year would that be like a 57 Eldorado would be tail custom 57 you know and they're like 75 feet long big bodies are coming up big so the the slammed on bags you know with steel wheels yeah so there's your fins look at that yeah Jesus Christ that's a chopped roof oh my god that one they've really gone Batmobile yeah god it's beautiful though but fat man I wish you can't bring fins back but that would be nice yesterday and impact and all yeah that is hot that's older that's like a fifty five maybe seven that's a custom but you know do you you would you roll big body like that you're full big wad I mean you would take it out on Sunday and then you'd go fuck this car yeah and you would drive something that you could actually drive as part of the thrill of driving is the interaction with the road right and like those cars are not interacting very well no there's so much weight you're moving them around they're sloppy whereas like you got into like an old 73 Porsche you could drive that thing yes even like stock from the factory you could drive nothing no problem yeah so the American car the older American cars like you have no idea where that limit is coming it's like I'm there I'm there I'm there the wheels falling off yeah they're just there was no communication the steering wheel yeah old-school electric steering is like a terrible zero communication up and I used to be so afraid of old cars and then I started driving old European cars no and oh to go it's just America well it's a product of their environment right like in the 80s those fucking GM guys that chomps cigars and they're off the rack shitty suits they never left Detroit right and if you go to Detroit it's just fucking potholes and it's straight lines and so of course the cars would ride like shit and it would float around and not handle because there isn't a corner for 300 miles you know now you get the CTSV cuz these guys and they go to the Nurburgring and test they it's a global you know world now yeah it's a totally different yeah they didn't to treat these these closed-minded morons built cars for their own city and sold them all over the world with no regard to the fact that they didn't work for shit in Italy or anywhere with corners in it you know that's interesting that's a good point and it's set up America those do you go drive of 57 Cadillac in Detroit and you go well this makes all the sense in the world right the roads are straight 92 57 yeah yeah how's that beeline coffee this is your coffee yeah this is really good that's good you you you did you go to the place where they ignore I work with this company beeline coffee and at first they started sponsoring my new watch podcast called watch and listen watches or can watch dork to you a logical extension from cars so this is a delicious coffee and so thank you yeah I got you some it's a light roast medium body single origin and that's an aid lung and Sun watch thank you and that's the back of a long cronograph oh that's the back yeah the back oh that's beautiful yeah it's amazing and that shit's all all anything that looks like gold that's gold so is that glass yes sapphire crystal so there's a crystal on the back and from yes Wow yeah they call that a display back I also just you could show peeps so you can admire the hardware within it is crazy when you look at the detail involved in one of those watches a lot of parallels with cars so many that they've they rose up in parallel I mean the obvious connections of timing races and stuff like that and wearing a machine on your wrist that's called self-dealing as I went to advertise my own watch for sale you can do that what's that one on the far right that's a Panerai that was just called a Rotter aponte which is also known as a split second chronograph so it's actually two chronographs laid on top of each other so it would be used to measure the time differential between say two cars on a race track whoa that's the most complicated movement Panerai makes I think that watch is about 13 or 14 grand that's a beautiful watch very nice watch it's pretty that was a demo I sent it back sent it back I sent it back I said I said most of them I sent he send them back as opposed to giving him 10 grand a month every watch oh is that how it works yeah it's part of mice I have a sponsorship deal crowning caliber com what is it what is what what is it a sponsorship deal like whoa well I started this watch podcast so there are title sponsors so they gave me a budget for a year but I can also loan out watches out of their stock if I so desire I want to try something so it's like a chick trying on jewelry totalus jewelry for men right yeah yeah it is yeah it's the only jewelry that you can kind of get away with pretty much I got a fat diamond ring on asshole no but it makes sense if you have a watched look that's Jonathan ward from icon that was his jay-z brother Jonathan is really into old weird watches right I follow his Instagram as well he's into old beard anything like fascinates me that guy is he's the most interesting person that there is he's very intense he's like you like you you guys both like just do so much stuff I don't know where all the hours are in the day like he runs his business and he's makes videos but I also see like every week on Instagram he'll put up like handbag he made from scratch leather like where did you find the time for that yeah you too I don't know where you find the time to do all this it's an illusion because the the time I spend here is very easy it's just conversation you know it's it's fun it's great you know having a guy like you get to talk cars I agree it is crying stand-up comedy I've done so long it's like a part of my life yeah it's normal the working out stuff it's like if I don't do it I can't do the other things I'll go crazy I won't be balanced and I want to stay healthy so I do that it just seems that you you seem to churn out a large volume of content and you also travel in the UFC and all that kind of stuff and you know it's a lot of content the unit you you told me the universe rewards hustle what it does I you know I have that engraved in the back of the first Rolex I bought myself really good for you matches from you that's dope and I sort of lived on that mantra for quite a long time until I recently I actually just totally burned myself out on it a bit you can't burn yourself out yeah you got to be real real conscious of how your body feels well that's what I like about what you've been saying that you doing cardio seven days a week and well that's what happened wait I've spent so much time working and focusing on I was like look as long as I can stand and lift my arms I'm gonna keep making videos because this shit could all end tomorrow right but my body completely fell apart and so I had to go alright I think it's time to to take care of this well sink with it there's a car analogy here because this is your meet vehicle and the difference between having a 500 horsepower engine and a 125 horsepower diesel yeah is literally how you take care of yourself and if you you can turn your body into a race car yeah unless you know obviously if disabilities or something wrong right right for most people the issue is just will yeah will in their mind and discipline and then knowledge what standing how to do it correctly and I've lost large amounts of weight several times in the past I lost I've lost I lost fifty pounds and then I lost a hundred pounds and then I lost this past two years another 50 so like I know how to do it what are you doing now differently but the difference with this one is I wanted to do it every time I've done in the past it is drastically interrupted my day-to-day life it's like either you go to fat camp into it or you whatever you know it's it takes away from something this one it was much more important to go I have a job I have a life I have to figure out how to make this work in within that life so it became a lot more hotel gyms really doing that really making sure to just do that shit oh when you're on the road yeah road is really hard yep it's hard with diet too it's very hard I don't I didn't change my diet that much I just started exercising a lot my big problem wasn't that I ate badly it's that I would eat big meals spaced very far apart and so my body would go into like storage mode mm-hmm but now I try and eat smaller meals and more of them and it seems to work much more efficiently well everybody's body is different but for the most part one of the biggest most significant things you could do is cut out most sugar and cut out most refined carbohydrates red is my Achilles everybody I love red outwait would fly off you know especially when you're telling me the volume of exercise you're doing Oh cut out the bread cut out the sugar you would lose ridiculous amounts of weight you know Jordan Peterson was on my podcast he was talking about autoimmune issues that he had and what he did was cut out everything except for meat and vegetables that's it and all his problems went away yeah I know I've done the Atkins style caveman II whatever you want to call it you know all protein and fat cut out the and vegetables and cut all the car behind like I it works I've done it I've lost weight and and I just I I couldn't stick with it because I fucking love bread so much and I just don't want to kill myself you know what I mean I wanna the it's like it's like growing a show or something if the curve is going in the right direction and I'm okay pushing forward mm-hmm let me just push forward right I'll get there I don't you know so well I'm just definitely going in the right direction I think about saying that you don't want to kill yourself I get it I love bread too and I love pasta I'm a big fan of lasagna and I just love Italian food I really do I love pizza but I just limit to one day a week it's probably good one day we got allow myself to eat whatever the fuck I want and if I decide it's Wednesday night if Wednesday night I go out to dinner and I say you know what man I want the fucking spaghetti and meatballs let's just do this then that's the night that's the night I cheat and then the other six nights I eat normal yeah it do do you I respect your your it makes it feel better to when you get that cheat day yeah like then it really counts if I get spaghetti with meatballs with grated Parmesan cheese over it if I've fucking digging in on that on whatever Friday night like ah just let yourself enjoy the share of it yeah yeah yeah it's not just a regular spaghetti and meatballs because it's dinner well which is normal you know on Wednesday Friday whatever who cares no it's the one day the one do you eat that fucking pizza maybe this is what I take home from this one maybe I take home the cheat day philosophy from this show she tastes good the other thing is your body if you get into that habit your body won't be craving those things anymore because a lot of the reason why you crave it is because your gut bacteria that's being supported by that diet and then you sort of like go into gut bacteria withdrawals that makes you want more and blah blah blah crazy but you got to do is get your biome in check like start eating a lot of probiotics yeah like if you can stomach kimchi I don't know if you're into that I like to taste like I mean I like Korean food I don't know how much I can use a daily thing for me really yep acidophilus yogurt is good if you could eat yogurt you have the time to just I don't to find the Stephanie yeah this kid go to the supermarket takes ten minutes to get some food I know it it's amazing I when you had to run around the city this is what I'm surprised at how you how well you do it because running around this city you could have a whole day that's three activities and it takes all day to do those activities and you barely have time to eat in between the there's bad at bringing that stuff with me you know I know he's better at carrying my own whether it's bars or kimchi or whatever to bring it with me so that they don't get to that oh my god I'm starving and then murder food when you leave I'll get me your address and I'll have some on it stuff sent to you oh cool because we have some new on it protein bytes they're coconut and cashews no guilt I like protein for each one of these little squares and their fuck hell yeah that'll just get you to the next thing yeah they're heroin I like that yeah I'll have some sent he said that in like three or four hundred pounds of elk oh I want to tell you I killed something I went I went I went hunting I went bird hunting I shot a quail is gone I didn't you know I can't shoot a quail with a ball hard but they were delicious and delicious food it was really the dogs the dogs were so impressive the dogs were amazing well-trained so super well trained went to this place in South Georgia and they that they had the most brilliantly trained dogs like I've ever seen the dis found everything I think I got like 90 Birds it was a lot so you went on a full Dick Cheney full yeah without the humans I didn't shoot any humans this fellow I really did you cook the quail no they they sent me some which I cook at home but they they'd they were doing them there they were turning the quail breasts intellect nuggets like like a McNugget but a quail breast and then like the drumsticks bangin absolutely delicious and what did they cook the the when you say bleckie McNugget so they bread it yeah they breaded it and fried it and it was like a whole quail breast was like a pop it in your mouth nugget it was really good it's a delicious meat yeah yeah there are they're crazy crazy tasty Birds yeah but I didn't I was like super conflicted about the hunting portion of it yeah and I don't know why I felt my dad was like that's like fishing it was likely not it's not like fishing but I didn't feel as guilty as I thought I would you know what man it's like and this is a crazy thing to say but I'm gonna say it anyway it's it's like an old relationship like you're like oh look you run into an old girlfriend on the street and you haven't seen her since 1989 there's no way to see where this is going okay the fuck it is long time ago and you run into each other and you start talking to each other like oh I remember you I programmed something not even that just you you use a relationship with hunting an animal like people feel it very quickly with fishing because fishing carries very little guilt some people like oh is it hurt because it is it gonna get hurt some people get like that would fish most people don't give a fuck about fish yeah little kids they laugh my kids laugh it's like this flop wouldn't die fish has a fucking hook through its head and my seven year old thinks it's awesome oh my god she's so happy that this thing is dying yeah that's crazy but if that was a rabbit she'll never have that real right right there's a natural thing that we have with with we have a hierarchy of life things that are closest to us we feel more connected to we don't feel connected at all the bugs nobody fuck about but right vegan slap mosquitoes all day long nobody gives a shit about that yeah but there is a life that you care about when things get warm and bunin huge yeah they get like too close to us yeah I wouldn't when they get too close to mammal like people freaked out yeah I went on South African safari last year and it was like I couldn't fathom someone going and hunting a leopard or something like that it's a weird thing that's a big game shit that's a very weird thing it's a very different thing it's not it's not it's a it's almost like what that is and I'm not saying sadism maybe a little but what what that is is like it's an aberration off the original idea and if this is the only way to look at it and people would get mad at me that are hunters because I'm a hunter and like what do you say look it's not the thing to do unless you're doing it on just to control population there's no reason to do it but what what happened was in the past the only reason people hunted was for me right you barely could stay alive anyway and when you went on a hunting party didn't go for sport you went to go to kill things when you have so much food that you don't need to worry about food and you've already been shooting all these animals then they start doing these things called Slams they call doing super slams or the Grand Slam there's a doll sheep lamb is a sheep's lamb a rocky like a big horn sheep slam there's a white like a jamboree no no you you try to kill one representative of each of the subspecies God really yeah yeah it's a big thing it's a big thing with these guys like a poker run calm like the the the big six or the big eight in Africa Africa it's a big five is that what it is the big five yeah the five most dangerous animals to hunt on foot it's like cheetah lion hippo rhino and whatever the fuck leopard that bird yeah there's a bunch of these kind of slams they have them for turkeys they have a wild turkey slam you get the Gould Turkey get the Osceola Turkey there's a bunch of different turkeys all over the country one in Florida there's one in Mexico it's different turkey point being people start collecting yeah yeah it gets it gets weird well that's the trophy right yeah it gets weird it's like it gets to this weird place like you don't think they shouldn't do it like okay are you eating the turkey you are okay that's cool are you eating the deer yep okay well then I have no quarrel but when you start going like leper yeah lion knows I said Cheetos elephant was the other one yeah yeah man I mean the only reason why you shoot an elephant is if the elephant's going on a rampage through her village telling people and you want to protect people's lives and I'm on Team people other than that mm-hmm why the fuck else would you shoot an Aleph I have no idea like I saw an elephant that the biggest elephant I've ever seen as far away from me as you were sitting right now oh my god and I almost had a hard life yet Africa on this sea but I think those things are amazing it was amazing it was amazing but like you just know cuz you what you're doing the reason I was so close is because we were watching them push trees down with their trunks like 4 or 5 inch trees just some oh my god don't like it's nothing you know what I mean like you'd crash a car if you hit one of those it would crash the car and like they're just from from from and they're right next to you and if they go thump on your Jeep that's the end of that you know what's complicated someone was trying to explain this to me and I should really be honest about this a guy was trying to explain to me that when we of Africa we think of a country it's not a country its continent and it's a way bigger content in North America we seen pictures of United States stuck in the middle of Africa now he was fuckin huge and he's like unfortunately there's places in Africa where they have over populations of elephants and they encroach on human civilization and they do have to hire hunters to come in and do it and kill them or they don't hire them the hunters pay and the money goes straight to the village the meat goes to the village and people get very excited about people hunting these elephants so and when I hear that probably seems like a sort of short term solution to the village right they the village doesn't give a shit about the elephant's they want there they want to eat probably right well they care their agencies eat their crops but becomes a big issue and they eat the fuck so when someone was explaining this to me I remember you know we were saying this I was like why the fuck would you ever want to kill an elephant we know there's not that many of them he's like yeah this is why it's complicated there's not that many of them in some places it's like in LA there's no grizzly bears right now but if you go to Montana the people that live in Montana are going to start hunting these fucking things they just declared them open for in Wyoming they're they're not they don't have they think they just started a hunting season and it's very controversial and they just in Dayton down anymore no not anymore at all no they have a lot of them and the people that live up there especially people that have been mauled or know people have been mauled oh like a fucking enough enough I get it we made a great comeback yeah but you know if you're in Chicago there's zero bears yes like so if and this is a tiny place in comparison to Africa so when I was saying that like I thought that elephants were endangered he's like yes and no you know they're endangered in some areas within good point the fucked up point the most dark point about all of it is that trophy hunting is the only thing that keeps those animals healthy this is what's fucked up I was talking about playing campaigns about this this weekend when and this is when I say trophy hunting I'm even talking about normal hunting for meat like impalas or you know eelain's these and big-game animals that people hunt for because they're delicious and even them in Zimbabwe there's a lot of areas in Zimbabwe that are not high fenced they're just open enormous areas all the money that would come from people hunting there would sustain these local areas sustained these lodges so it makes it viable to keep these animals alive and stop poachers a bit long as my anti poaching right exactly yeah only thing that funds the anti poaching so here's what happened to Cecil the lion shit went down nobody wanted to go to Africa anymore to go hunting and all of these businesses are going under so there's nothing stopping the poacher so the poachers move in and kill everything kill everything by that that's gone the other ways how many elephants were killed last year by people something like 400 or Google this legally killed elephants the number of illegally killed elephants 30,000 come on 30,000 most of them are killed illegally most of them are poached they have this one elephant you know that last elephant that was dying the male or excuse me Rhino rhino white white rhino or black rhino which Rhino was it a black rhino yeah they have that that poor bastard with armed guards around 24/7 yeah because they were worried someone's gonna kill it shoot it and copyop the fucking horn oh yeah like the poaching is way scarier than the hunting and the only thing that protects the animals from poaching is hunting it sounds so weird and so full but you have to look at it honestly yeah they said something similar to us in South Africa about that that that if they need the funds because the anti poachers you know they face there they're all over the place and then here's the other problem when you say poachers these poachers you know what you're really saying poor people that's what you're really saying they're poor desperate people they don't know what the fuck to do and if they could chop off a rhino's horn and make some money they're gonna do it if they can shoot that animal that's not theirs and use it for me they're gonna do it yeah they're starving to death well I mean they have no options there's a piers people in parts of Africa that are living in grass huts my buddy Justin Wren he and makes wells for these people in the Congo and the stories he tells you would just make your eyes tear up these human beings and they're living like this 24 hours a day for their entire life and this is this is the norm so we're talking about poachers who are you're talking about people that are fucking desperate yeah you can call them poachers you could dehumanize them with that term but they're just poor people and the only are none of them the movie stereotype poachers gotta be some of them but most of them aren't now here's what's even crazier most of the anti poaching agents used to be poachers that's not you know it's not surprising and now they're poachers again cuz they're hunting people but they got out of that got out of this position that can't be anti poaching okay so now they just come poachers again perfect this happens to a lot of us gone well so sorry this when cam Haynes was explaining this to me and when he's explained to me I'm like well course so they don't even know how many animals are left in these areas where people who abandoned them fescue branches that were once thriving ways to see the thing is most of these animals a good percentage of her were on the verge of extinction just 30 years ago because people were just over hunting them and poaching them and doing whatever they want to him then they started putting value on them people would go over there to hunt them so people would keep these huge areas and that populations boomed yeah because they were taking care of him because they were they were a resource mhm and and this is couldn't this is conflicting to people it's wild it's very wild I just went to the Galapagos on a vacation which is interesting have you been it seems like you're kind of spot the one I can't kill anything it's it's very it's like Hawaii if there were never people Wow so it's an M it's a completely empty Hawaii how big is it about the same size as Hawaii the Big Island or no it's just chain of it no it's a chain of islands it's like 13 or 15 islands whoa yeah none as big as the Big Island but most like Maui Oahu things on them there are two or three like towns with like 25 thousand people and the rest of it is nothing National Park 97% but they talk about these the giant tortoises yeah you know and there were like potentially a half a million of them on the islands and it went down to like one like they found like the last one and they tried to breed it there's like three varieties of tortoises and the one of them got down to one and they tried to save it and they couldn't save it and now it's like you know embalmed and fucking taxidermied on the Galapagos Islands but you know these giant tortoises that lived at 200 but the all the passing ships would just like grab a few of them and they'd eat them on the ships and they completely decimated the entire population they're all gone and they're trying to bring him back I don't even know why we started here but will they take forever to grow right yeah Mir ever yeah they have thousand years no they live like 200 years yeah and then the the whole rest of the islands what's crazy about them is nothing's been hunted therein forever so the wild animals have no problem with people no problem like you're face to face with sea lions and stuff I could be two black birds like what kind of wild bird would let you get within like a foot of it but there's these giant blue footed boobies that have no problem with you just being right here watching them like where they can have a baby right there and they won't even fuck with you Wow and like huge lizards and but underwater the density of the underwater sea life was insane hammerhead sharks I think a baby hammerhead shark is the cutest animal I've ever seen a baby hammer like this do you know why they developed their eyes out there and the ends like that mm-hmm presumably it's like an echo location or radar sonar type of thing gives you better range I think as they are in darker waters if I had to guess they are really really cool to see in person though there's nothing like a hammerhead shark isn't the Galapagos where they had that thing that they were doing with Judas goats do you know that yes that is it the goats wait whoa Captain Cook dropped off a bunch of goats on those islands yes and they did it so that when they came back they'd have something to hunt and the goats Gover ran the island yeah and they over yeah there was a big problems they're eating everything and then ibly everything in sight and then what did they do with the Judas the Judas goat had like a disease or something oh no no no no they took one of them and they stay neutered him and then they sent him out with a radio collar on so here I find out where all their other goats are they would gun them down helicopters and they would keep him alive they would go that's the Judas goat we keep him alive so they've done all these goats down he will move the killed all my Froome them makes new friends and he would go and make some new friends and then they would locate that new pal yeah cuz otherwise it's very difficult to locate packs of goats if you're really gonna put a dent in the population they wanted to wipe them all out yeah there was they they killed like 75 thousand goats it was a crazy number of goats but they were completely over running the whole the whole thing well in there yeah trained sharpshooters from we're sent in helicopters for goats once found the goats would be shot from the air either in the head of the heart to ensure a quick death whatever using the stop lion they shot them know whatever caught them in the arm yes I could they're in a helicopter you're not even a steady go back to that police so I can keep reading let me you know they're not even in a steady a place where they can steadily shoot do you don't have a good rest from fucking hell they're like had like many guns they're just gonna those fuckers down while I like that in the heart or in the head to ensure quick down okay using high-powered weaponry and military precision stop with your military precision who wrote this many people including the plans orchestrators had misgivings about such a large-scale slaughter of goats however the decision was made that the Galapagos ecosystem under the threat and under threat found nowhere else on earth was valuable enough to justify their actions yeah they're invasive species history was written by the winners yeah it's just it's funny it's funny that they're essentially preparing for people who are animal rights activists writing this that's why they're writing you know they're shooting them with such precision it's actually very funny because you know to the Galapagos is ridiculously restrictive you cannot set foot on a beach like there without being like without a naturalist with you the whole time and you can't be more than like 50 feet from the naturalistic ever how'd you guys do it did you hire someone to you go yeah organised thing it was like a smallish yacht with like 30 people on it heard they check your shoes they do it on seeds and you did this yeah they rinsed off the bottom of your shoes and they hand sanitized you when you get back on the boats they said they've had real issues with people that have tramped on on plants and then come to the glob goes now those plants grow there yeah well there's one island that has I was expecting tropical right cuz Hawaii's kind of tropical none of them plants are fucking native the none of them like none of them all the jungle plants were brought there like the Galapagos has one island that has jungle on it and all of the rest of them are like volcanic rock and cactuses and shrubs Wow yeah not what I expected and I was like how come this island has a jungle on it and the rest of them I said all these plants are not native they were all brought here in like the 1700s yeah yeah so the plants that were brought there like those plants whoa look at that shit I don't I'm sure that looks like an artist rendering to me we're looking at this crazy tree that looks like it's right out of the Lord of the Rings yeah dragonblood trees oh that's called that's an awesome name for that trick want that shit in my yard you got a big building here can we get one of those dude I need a dragon blood tree in my life look at that thing that was like Avatar Island that Island floats remember that one that floated but uh it's great looking rivers it's a very cool tree it's a weird economy but the same naturalist that we're like you know preserve everything are giddy when they talk about shooting goats from a helicopter yeah well they they look at the goats as what they really are yeah they're an invasive species I mean they're life forms and then it's not their fault that they're there but like I was trying to explain to my friend I have a buddy mind who's thinking about hunting he eats meat and he's like if I if I'm not going to kill my own meat like why should I why should I have the right to eat me he's in this weird moral thing and he's like I'm thinking about being vegan but I know it's not the right move for my health I'm like we should try it see if it's the right move your health it might work good for your body but if you want to shoot something the thing to shoot would be wild pigs because they have three four litters a year each one of them they get at four or five even six babies and they fuck like crazy and they eat everything and they're and they might be four or five hundred pounds they can get bit you kill one of them one of those a year you're golden you mean they get fucking the point is they get destructive and there's nothing that kills them where do you find these wild games everywhere all over the country now I don't hunt Joe where's Nina it's not even a hunting issue it's people live in San Jose or I'm with wild pigs I'm going through their backyard and fucking them up yeah it's a real issue because because no one's paid attention to them people getting in their highway getting going to schools stopping at Starbucks doing the normal shit while this happened they're out there in the bush earning it they're fucking and they're making babies and there's a shit ton there all our basement all over from Bakersfield on up Northern California filled with wild pigs yeah are they taste look at that they taste like they taste like domestic pigs currently exist in 56 of the states 58 counties Wow yeah where's that what state is that California 54th no they are a biological plague there are completely invasive species and they're designed to live in places with wolves and lions and I mean that's what they're Orange phenomenal really better like domestic pork great yeah especially when you cook them right like you take a ham and you like slow and Oh smoker yeah brine it medium for a few days first dude I'm telling you goddamn delicious not surprised they're delicious today they're everywhere and they eat everything ground nesting birds like fucking anything on the ground they just they're just all the time fucking up people's lawns digging in people anybody who just want to be ready you just have locked and loaded in your yard and well in Texas they just shoot him I mean they did get in helicopters they have a helicopter helicopters yeah I was I was at a thing and a guy was telling me about shooting pigs from a helicopter there you go a pork lips now is what you want to look up that's not a porno no no no it should be probably is too but it's a guy named pig man who I'm buddies with this guy text each other I know him you and pay text me and I text him back I was like okay it's crazy dude but anyway he he's his whole thing is eradicating these wild pigs they did him with Ted Nugent with their shooting machine guns out of fucking helicopter and they killed two hundred and something of them in one day 30s feral hogs and now in 37 states look at this well this is a point five billion in crop damage yearly I mean I like the like the anti Pig propaganda film this is going 6 million hogs in Texas alone do you know how crazy that is and again delicious they've got a bunch of brucellosis and a bunch of different terrible diseases so fuck Ted Nugent Ted Wow how dare you tell Ted Nugent how dare you he sucks well he's definitely got issues yes so they're up there with machine guns gunning down these wild pigs out of helicopters and party is like they shouldn't be able to do this but party is like they have to do this because if they don't do this then these things keep breeding and there's more of them they don't eradicate the numbers what's to stop these things from just spreading across the entire country and becoming a real problem well they're ready a real problem so what do you do which part of you goes that looks kind of fun looks they were very fun none if it wasn't a life form it looks yeah I would I would want to do that with like targets like you today can they do that and put wouldn't be as targets out there it's fun you'd want to do it with but the thing is like they see a mama and her babies and I mean it's the whole thing is it's kind of fucked up because you there's not a whole lot of other ways to do this here's the thing it's like you got to locate them on these enormous ranches so what are you gonna do you're gonna have people go out there with you know hunting camps and slowly make their way through the bushes well yeah and now they would might kill 250 of them in a month yeah or these guys get 250 the efficiency of this process this is extremely efficient it is an epidemic though I mean what they're saying is accurate he's seeing all these pigs I mean look at the populations that these guys are gunning down and this is just a fraction of what exists shot right there that was like that right out of the Godfather the helicopter look at that that it's not on me that freeze-frame on Ted Nugent's face was an extra he's coming wait it's a real show oh yeah yeah that's real oh my god yeah porca lips well the pork lips his episodes on pig man's show so what you see as a person who loves animals and en also eats meat I understand conflict you know I love animals I love wild animals I love pets I love them but I also eat meat and then they do too there's a weird relationship going on with people and animals but that to me in modern world is one of the weirder aspects flying around a helicopter gunning down feral pigs that destroy cop crops cause billions of dollars in damage and are spreading across the entire country what else do you do no it just seems so unfair but the question is is it unfair if you're jogging through the woods and a bear eats you is that unfair that seems unfair to probably also unfair I mean you barely levels of unfair barely able to just sustain a nice pace and go jogging if you got a rustle up they're just trying to drop a few lbs it I don't want to get eaten this grizzly yeah I don't know man we got a we have weird relationships with animals you know I know you eat meat I do obviously know I don't feel too guilty about weight no meat from the grocery store I don't feel too guilty about it I'm sorry to say well yeah that's fucking life what do you know do you do you feel bad about factory farming I try to buy good quality meat from good quality places and but that's the that's about I don't write I don't know I like farm raised fish and you know I don't know I'm try and buy good shit if I can I prefer to eat high quality things you know oh yeah but I don't know we talk about cars more yep do we want to do you want to in yeah what else is what else seeing in the pad we just got that we stumbled into an area of dead animals and put this is your show so that's what that's what's gonna happen I didn't mean to bring it there this is when I get to talk to you so what are you gonna do uh what happens I'll tell you what I'm interested in man I'm interested in that new Corvette zr1 going to drive it next week on Monday and Tuesday I wrote Atlanta that thing looks ridiculous Evan hundred and fifty horsepower see that's what I'm talking about when are they gonna stop I think in horsepower and a regular car that people can buy yes yeah you know who will probably do it first actually in terms of like a quote regular car with a thousand horsepower would probably be electric like an electric car cuz it's so easy to make that power look at that thing it's aggressive holy shit yeah that's aggressive and you see they had to put this monster power bulge in the hood there in the center so you know the score bed zo6 was out before and it was very fast 650 horsepower but it had this issue where it was heat soaking where in like it was you'd lose power because the supercharger would develop so much heat and it was a small supercharger to fit under the low hood because every the low hood is sort of a thing for Corvette right and the way to make more power while also creating less heat is to use a bigger supercharger and spin it slower as opposed to a smaller one that's spun faster so they had to put a bigger one which also which raises the hood so I said fuck what you don't know yet or even driven it let's gonna say your your vantage point your view point I don't know I don't I'll report back you pull that couple weeks picture up but I think it's definitely a big a big old cowl hood I have driven um there's a company called Callaway you've heard of them yeah they they modified there's a way beautiful car man yeah back to that image that you just had the the aero package is certainly aggressive look at that thing yeah it's a beast yeah that looks so good so I've Drive driven of a Corvette of this generation that has an engine like this and I can that drove something called the Callaway Aero wagon they actually turned a Corvette into like a shooting-brake like a again Oh God it's not that bad it's pretty cool but it had 775 horsepower and it was one of the scariest cars I've ever driven that side profile that look you can get it as a convertible wow that's amazing as the other one is it convertible yeah they do anything to extra stiffen it up they actually the reason they do this is they say that the roof itself is not a contributor towards the chassis rigidity so they can sell the car as a coupe or convertible without any loss of rigidity that's what they say thing drives like honestly I think you're a douche if you buy a zr1 convertible Wow how dare you because you can you buy the coupe and click the roof on you can buy the coupe and take the hard roof rap that's not the same this it's not the same it is because you don't like a douche convertibles are for douchebags the fuck the top-performing Corvette engine track package with an aero kit in a convertible go back to that picture of the red convertible again Jamie races are people who suck how dare you you son of a bitch what are you doing with the top down and out looking amazing winged looking like a play me can you break all in what's your verdict convertible and suitable tiesto music and letting people know just by yourself no convertible if you're that girl come on out oh okay no convertible yeah we look desperate yeah out there by ourselves you guys are convertible two guys and the convertible is weird that's a good point a guy in the girl that's a very good point my guys than the convertible is still weird still weird in two thousand eight ten he convert well not so good but any convertible two guys in any convertible is weird what do you losers do him it's real men don't put the top down by yourself yes you know I'm worried I'm just driving around you know you can tell someone's a real bad driver it's a really surefire way to tell someone's a terrible driver if they've got a convertible and it's like a they put the windows down but the front windows go down and a little back windows stay up like a 3-series BMW where they don't notice those little rear windows are just still up by themselves that's how you could tell someone's a bad driver never checks their blind spots well even when you drive it and convertible with the windows up like stop for is even worse two guys in the back 204 up that's yeah in Venice I see that I see all the convertible Mustangs loaded up when I see that I always look at those four guys like one of those guys dead weight three of them hate yep yeah one of those guys always short on how much he puts in for the tab it's funny one of those guys we do we when I'm doing better I'll pay man that looks so good though pull that picture up again it's me they've really good that looks amazing yeah red with black that that zr1 convertible heads fucking amazed dude and it's apparently faster around Virginia International Raceway than the Ford GT which we just looked at and the Ford GT is like a racecar racecar this thing is like a big trunk and you know then it's and it's a for all intents and purposes it's pretty normal car that's awesome I like it's not you know it's not there's not a lot of sacrifice going on with driving one of those you know you you get it in you drive it and it's got a big trunk and it's reasonably comfortable and easy to live with but it's interesting that this is like this game of like okay let's look at watches there's no real improvement in performance right I mean they're beautiful and but I mean the performance difference between now and ten years ago is not clear ye-yeah a mechanical watch no I mean it's watch if there's artistry and there's technological complication I mean is there's complication for the sake of complications so they'll have watches like to use a car example imagine a car okay and from the outside it looks roughly like a normal car right four four wheels I don't drive or seat right it has one engine and it has four transmissions coming off of that engine all of which come back together to make it the car one wheel drive hmm right imagine that applied to a watch so it'll be like one main movement that goes out into four gear trains and then comes back into just an hour in a minute hand well why would you sync up for gear trains when you could do the same thing with one and it's like well because we can Brian it would be like building a car with two engines like that's not smart but you do it just be like I built a fucking car with two engine less you're talking about like the NSX engine we have the front engine yeah electric exactly exactly but I think what I'm getting at is that with computers and with cars those are the one thing that you expect an improvement every year yeah just that nobody's can accept the old way you can't just build unless you're singer and you're making something custom well that's that the singer is what that example is what the mechanical watch kind of industry is you know they they position it as a luxury item from a time gone by sort of thing you know whereas actually if you want to talk about innovation this right here is a grand Seiko which has a movement called a spring drive movement in it and it is one of the most advanced and unique mechanical movements available and a watch today so this is a Seiko it's a grand Seiko with difference so the difference is it's like think about a Lexus think about Alexis Seiko is a Lexus not a Toyota this is a Lexus LFA this is a grand Seiko is built in a different factory from the regular Sacco's it's built by hand completely by hand all hand finished hand polished it's built of exotic materials it has a cool movement dude should sell watches watch podcast it's called watch and listen and it's on YouTube but you see the phone yeah I mean I have what is called the display back on this so you can see the the movement in the back and how high the the level of finish is and you've got sapphire and titanium and so the spring drive movement is without getting crazy crazy nerdy about it is is actually a true innovation in mechanical watch making so run the chronograph it's on the front the top button not here to watch the the sweep of the car and the big secondhand you get a perfectly smooth sweep the smoothest possible sweep that there could be it is smooth it is it is it is how much does it watch like this worth around ten thousand yeah amazing yeah god but it's just watch $300 what's no G shocks are the shit dude G shocks are awesome as far as like on is that I'm a light no but it has but it's polished so that it can see the date' motherfucker dude g-shock so dope a G shock is a watch guys tool watch like a highly functional durable a G Shock is a total watch guys watch you can get G shocks in like $5,000 you know what yeah they have dude Jamie look up a $5000 G shot clock that's some that right here hold that up that's John warlords own design it's amazing I think it's based on the Duesberg yeah Duesenberg gauge cluster the watch is called the doozy and it's it's got a complication on it called the jump our complications so the it's a basically just a black face almost looks like a bathroom scale and it's got two windows hours on top minutes on the bottom and the minutes sweep by slowly whereas the hours do not sweep by slowly at 59 and 59 seconds the hours click overwrite fast so it's a jump hour as opposed to a slow moving hour now he designed the look or did he design the internals he designed the look the face the complications and he worked with a Swiss watchmaker to design an actual unique movement to use for this watch he designed the case and that's crazy it is awesome and that watches 12 grand he's making 50 of them I

Ruby it's probably Ruby odd the sun's probably a yellow diamond a motherfucker that is incredible yes see I don't get it but I get it well you must be able to appreciate that someone is making a machine that fits in a little fish bowl on your wrist look at that and look I mean look on top of the crazy artistry of this and the ridiculous price and the jewels and all that stuff the mathematics of that machine work that is not that's not just like that for nothing that does like moon phase you know the what's astrological sign it is there is a actual function look at that one with the dredge dragon in it you gotta be fuckin kidding me don't say something to come out of a little kids gumball man so crazy right go scroll up that's amazing looking scroll up the other images though they had those three watches together if you ever look how good those things look I mean that is that is a crazy thing to have in your arm it's so crazy right that's a million dollars and if you see someone wearing one in person it's it's big it's like it's like it's like the size of you know that and coffee it's so big there's really people there actually I mean you'd be shocked at what people are doing with certain with machinery in watt and mechanical watchmaker would be mercies it's like the fight against friction is the whole thing right you've got this tiny little spring and you need to get as much power out of it as possible so they engineer these like micro grams of friction out of this stuff so they they that's the ER work fuck you think that's an earthwork Star Trek yeah and whoa that's pretty yeah I think there's a lid liquids closed it looks like a Star Trek communicator now how much does something like that go for like 50 or 60 I'm sorry yes I was gonna gets higher I was gonna get 75 I think you can get different versions of it there don't hold me to the price it's expensive but what do you think it cost Jamie take 75 it's Tom the top article should have it the ho dinky article usually has the price if you scroll down to the bottom of that article it should have it that's it closed right there so you can read the time when it's closed so that on that watch its 827 yeah yeah and what does the louver glance closed go go up that's close yeah that's closed yeah and then that's another version which they have different tops yeah the clear top or the or the metallic one of them there's a carbon back and that's a pretty watch yeah it's pretty looking if you scroll all the way down it should say the price no 68,000 there you go fucking expensive it's there's some wild stuff there's a company called hyt that is that makes watches that have a liquid that moves around and it tells you the time based on like almost like a thermometer the liquid goes up to this level there's a watch by a company called Devon dvo and it's a belt-driven watch where you have like a series of conveyor belts on your is yeah there's hyt so the green the green liquid goes around the dial yeah it's like a nuclear who's that like flows through the dial yeah so it changes depending upon the time yeah yeah yeah so that that gue like it flows go back to the one with the green goo on the top left there so like fills up around the dial and then it is when it goes all the way around is in a minute you know it's an hour I believe hazing it's awesome right that's amazing you look down and that's how you know where it is in the a yeah and had it had a typical hour hand yeah and then this one it flows around the skull dude you know something like that cost a hundred grand or something geez Axl Rose is actually sponsored by them believe it works right it's on brand for him I think it's about a hundred grand so when you say sponsored like what do they do they get Axl to wear it I'm just well yeah wears one I follow these dumb watch spotter Instagram accounts me it's they sell for upwards of fifty thousand so I think that's I think it's more than that yeah fifty or seventy-five yeah they're expensive man it's David Cross selling watches 285,000 h3 a particular ultralight high-end model which ones that one but it's there's you know there's some materials and this stuff they're they use crazy forged carbon there will ninety-five grand used for a skull one you know let me see that that's pretty yeah they're real crazy I mean it's you can get lost in this stuff I mean the machinery of it and the the materials do you think the the liquid is that goes around that fault I don't know they may have a different picture with a different liquid so that's how the minutes go yeah and then there was an hour is so crazy press that let's see if it works here's the lick here's the the liquid going so cool that is fuckin dope I just I love the fact that people are so creative yeah they can figure out how to do things like this on something like a watch so look at the look at the red dude going around the skull isn't that awesome oh my god I'm in love with it it's so cool amazing I'm in love with this and then look it goes back but it goes back quick it goes back quick and resets oh yeah eyes fill up when he goes back yeah oh you gotta be kidding me oh that's some really next level like there's bellows and pumps and it's like pumping like liquid around dude right I had no idea yeah I had no idea people were doing this to it people are doing crazy things that is fucking bad like autumn more so that's really crazy is like so I have a watch that is called a perpetual calendar which is like a traditional complicated watch so it does day of the week date of the month month of the year four-digit year moon phase power reserve okay and the time obviously and it has all of those functions and it you if you keep the watch running you know it's a mechanical you got to keep it wound up if you keep it wound and running it will be accurate for all of those things without needing any an adjustment for about 300 years likely peers how many days are in the month that you're in like all of that shit yeah IWC Perpetua eyelet perpetual calendar see this is like I like a watch that looks like that like a classic look and you look up the big pilot perpetual calendar I like their watches IWC they make beautiful launches that like that right there to me that's like a perfect looking one yeah yeah I like normal addition yeah big pilot yeah yeah it's orange hands down oh yeah that's it but go down one on the left bottom left or yeah that's the one Wow so it does it's got a lot going on what you have that's the one I have it's a beautiful one yeah and it's it's big it's big and chunky and heavy but you see it's got four digit year and then the month at the at the six o'clock mark day of the week and the second hand at the nine o'clock and then the date and the power reserved at the three o'clock and if you keep that running that'll give you June 3rd 2018 by day you know whatever automatically it knows all the math hundreds of years Wow crazy right all you have to do is keep it running just keep it running so you have to just put it in a perpetual watch machine yeah wear it or wear it fortunately I like wearing it and it has an eight-day power reserve so if I wear it one day out of every eight days it's great oh so it has a battery assist no no the spring will keep going for eight days yeah yeah eight days Wow yeah and then you see in the the inner gauge at the three o'clock position it says days seven six five four three two one right this one's dead it's in this empty gauge but normally it stays up by the s in days when it's full Wow yeah and it shows you how much is left this one this watch has a fuel gauge as well that's you know this is yes you look right down here at the seven o'clock position that watch has a fuel gauge as well very helpful that's crazy my favorite feature in mechanical watches the fuel gauge is that an actual fuel icon it looks like it does kind of look like one yeah Wow yeah that's dope so watches I have a podcast about all this called watch and listen with what I do it with a watchmaker who'd like to take shit apart Cameron why she's the man watches are connected to like extreme materialism and a lot of people's eyes like totally yeah it's one of those things like oh god you're in the watches he must be a dude totally it's a fair argument yeah cuz watches are so are used as trophies and flashy shit and but they're also cool they're also cool yeah it's like usually people get it that is true I feel with cars mhm I mean look if you is every person who buys a you know Ferrari laferrari is every one of those people a hole a douche no some are and some are represent the ultimate enthusiast 75 no it might be 50 I know there's enthusiasts and there's douches in everything in everything yeah and the thing is those there's a reason why those things are highly coveted because they're fucking amazing yeah you know that watch I don't want a million-dollar watch but that watches the shit I would never wear it if I had it do it if you're in Beverly Hills go in the store the Jacobs store in Beverly Hills we get frisked through the fucking TSA thing on yeah right yeah I'm sure they must be like really worried about people walking in that store you got to get buzzed in it do you really yeah fuck you he's selling something dude you could smash and grab like six million dollars crazy somebody just did that recently in England they smashed and grabbed a watch store with machetes yeah because you know there's this thing in England going on right now I don't know if you know it but they have London has for the first time ever passed the United States past New York City rather for the most murders really yeah ever since the stabbing each other and stabbing each other so the London mayor Mayor of London on Twitter wrote a tweet that has been getting him tortured online saying there is no reason to have a knife oh I saw that knife you will be probably we catch you you you regular guy you regular guys knife I open packages I carry a knife I want to cut a piece of rope I have a knife on me he said okay not anymore no in London this guy saying if you have a knife and you're caught with one you'll be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and of course United States we're going crazy over here like oh so I thought it's a gun problem that was a fucking gun problem you gonna ban nice what's next fucking scissors yeah yeah well you gotta wear it where's this gonna end yeah yeah I I do have to think I think we have a little bit of a gun problem we definitely probably definitely have something going on but this smash-and-grab these motherfuckers use machetes that's gangster that's gangster nobody had a gun yeah try to use a machete and dudes behind the counter of shotguns yeah a real problem yeah there's a homemade machete a homemade machete Wow okay sir is that how they know it's homemade cuz they caught the guy it says quote all made in my house good for good for you I guess he didn't get away no good attempt yeah but it's again watches like wouldn't you think about something small like jewelry and watches something that's this little yeah on something you fit in your hand could be worth a million dollars it's one of the only things in life or something that fits in your hand those are the million dollars yeah and there's all so a lot of the mainstream brands like you know Rolex and whatever there's a lot of false prop up of the value they intentionally you know they don't build as many submariners as they could as they want to drive them the market up demand up and it keeps the used values high and there's this there's a entire ecosystem you know based on new and used watch values and yeah well I think the craziest value thing and anything of like high-end things that people love is diamonds yeah cuz they're not even really that rare anymore it didn't I just read you can make him in a microwave now it's not a thing Mike I read an article that they figured out how to make diamonds into Mike how do they do that the same way they make until lap just someone figured out a process carbon and heat you know when they make them in a lab it's really interesting I don't think they can make really big ones in a lab yet I think they can only make like one or two carats huh I might be wrong I wouldn't definitely be down with getting cremated and being turned into a diamond oh here goes signs you figured out a way to make diamonds in a microwave and it could change the diamond industry oh shit it's over bitches it'll 9th just happened oh yeah I read this article and I just noticed now it's Business Insider I don't trust them look at this yeah placing a tiny fragment of a diamond a carbon seed in a microwave with varying amounts of carbon heavy gas the result is a synthetic ethical diamond with the exact same structure and chemical composition as a diamond that came from the ground who works so well experts reportedly need machines to tell the lab grown gems apart from the natural ones estimated by the 2026 the number of lab made diamonds will skyrocket to 20 million carats so then here's the thing anyone who owns a natural diamond that diamonds now in the toilet do you think so yes this is natural came from what if they can't tell the difference though did you go to a machine like this motherfuckers got a machine who's got a machine would want to know they would want to know I need to know is it machine certified that it came out of the ground I don't know is this blood dime I don't want blood diamonds I got engaged a few months ago and I thank you and I got a great deal from somebody who I nicknamed Blood Diamond is not a Blood Diamond I share you but I just love calling him blood and I get a variable can you fucking stop it I don't wanna wear this thing around god this guy's Blood Diamond yeah well that's the thing too it's like they've got that business on lockdown do you want to prove your love and your commitment to relationship well you need to buy one of these you can't buy out a fucking a car nope you can't buy her an engagement car I tried to do that actually I was gonna propose with an engagement Jeep Wagoneer that's a good move it was until they get mad at you an issue they want the diamond show their friends black no Matt stepped up they stepped up clarity and it's amazing he stepped up did Mike step up Mike didn't step up Matt stepped up I did step up ha ha Mike so I fucked those fucking diamond they're all thieves dole did you know it's not really worth that see zis bro she need a cz if a girl found out that you had a fake diamond look that was the thing that happened to an aunt of mine they found out she found her diamond face yeah she was getting divorced and she went to bring a ring in she found out was fake downtown to Trump Trump gave someone fake diamond cufflinks who was that somebody that's all someone in business he gave him a pair of diamond cufflinks and he went and looked and they were fucking Suzie's if that's the case if he did that to you they're guys ready to fuck you Mueller Mueller that's Damon right now fucking respect Trump you fake diamond cufflinks for years oh my god arias he's hilarious do they shrink his hands for those pictures on purpose no because his hands aren't little everybody always calls his hands little there's something he does with his hands that make him look little it's like he does a lot of stuff like this it's like he could just be little in proportion to his head which is gigantic and getting bigger apparently poor bad he's going down now man when they raided his his attorney's offices here's the thing that too in order to get all that stuff passed through Republicans have to agree to that yeah like there's like in order to like actual Republicans and people that should be his supporters had be a part of the read that everyone that signed it was an appointee of his administration yeah if they're reading your lawyer's office you are so fucked and if it all goes down that he winds up getting in trouble not even for Russia but for paying off a chick that he had sex with imagine that it's a porn chick that takes this whole thing down listen man I need Oh Justin Martin deal an apology he was saying that she's the Monica Lewinsky for this administration oh come on he's gonna brush this off it's gonna be nothing nobody cares cuz everybody knows they know we did it so it's not it's not even a question of whether he did it right yeah but it's a matter of whether or not it's legal the camp gets a campaign finance violations the lawyer is yeah that that's a campaign finance payment admitting to knowing about the payout is like obstruct admitting through obstruction it's like a whole other when he talked about it in that interview when someone caught him getting onto his plane and he acknowledged the the lawsuit whoops just he fucks up man he doesn't know how to shut the fuck up and not only that his whole life has been about not shot in the a cop about saying whatever you want like that's his instincts and all sudden you put him in this position yet you sought ability what's that I want you to be a totally different thing now I want you to be presidential yeah meanwhile he's trying to pick fights with Joe Biden on Twitter you're not gonna change a seventy-year-old billionaire to change that guy he's been told yes a thousand times a day for us forty years do you think's gonna happen with him do you think they're gonna kick him out like what do you think yeah I don't I think it's not gonna I think it's I just don't see how he can make it through for you I don't know it's only one year yeah it's very bad it's very bad while we've been going on Paul Ryan has announced that he's going to not seek reelection oh thank god Paul Ryan he's probably sees the writing on the wall yeah what does that guy do apparently he had some kind of realistic challenger Democrat that has been really ramping up their campaign and he does not want to stick around to see how that's gonna go really doesn't want to lose he doesn't want to get humiliated you know wow that's what it is you think or maybe just tired of losing it no way maybe needs to get paid for all those fucking bribes like now it's time I saw today that the former Speaker John Boehner I said yeah now on the board of a mate major marijuana yeah he went he went all pro-legalization gotta get that how do you how do you feel about this legalization situation I hate it I hate that too you should lock people up they're getting high lock him up but compared to prop 215 compared to jet 17 to 18 what do you think wouldn't California got it well the 30 percent sales tax yeah it was inevitable but this is what I like about that it's still reasonable you can get high on a very small amount of money for a long period of time we should be complaining about that too I think we could show that there's a real benefit to legalization that benefits communities benefit schools firemen police officers whoever can get that money and I think that's where the money should be allocated and I think you could get billions of dollars for the state just doing that and I think that is a real positive aspect of legalization that might be the one thing that's gonna be the straw that breaks the camel's back across the country when people realize that you can make real money and that real money can be beneficial to things that communities need yes you starve out illegal drug selling illegal drug selling is what the real problem has always been when you make something illegal only criminals are gonna sell it then you have criminal mentality you have people that have guns and gangs and those are the people that were scared of not businesses yeah if we were scared of businesses we'd be trying to close liquor stores nobody gives a shit about wineries you know we're not those are drug stores a winery is a drug just sell delicious drugs yeah I mean and I'm four I'm 100% I love wine that's not my point my point is selling wine yeah yeah things should be legal yeah things should be legal and when marijuana is legal tax the fucking shit out of it and give that money back to the community and everybody benefits people like you and I who are responsible grown adults yeah pay our taxes and are good people and we like to get high occasionally we should be able to buy it with no worry about being locked in a fucking cage and that money should go to schools that money should go to fix the streets that money should go to cops and firemen that's what it should go to that end we know where it's being allocated yeah I have no idea no idea I would hope it's here goes I'm joining the board of Anchorage Holdings a treaty holding acreage sorry because my thinking on cannabis has evolved that's my man got high yeah I was always anti and then I got some of this good shit right here I'm convinced D scheduling the drug is needed so that we can do research help our veterans and reverse the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities yes I agree man I would add to that get high I'd say so we can get hot yeah put everyone out of jail I think there is their evidence showing weed reduces opioid use it is right well it really depends upon how it's used it can benefit some people with some kind of pain I don't think it's realistic to say that some people that are in horrible horrible pain would get the same reaction for every one that I get for opiates people with like really bad burns for instance 24/7 addicted not for non-medical reasons I'm talking about if you're become addicted to oh you know oxys there's better drugs yeah there's better drugs that get you off it yeah there's quite a few that can help you probably the most powerful and the most efficient is ibogaine because like a walk sky begins on ayahuasca ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic that is from South America it's dimethyltryptamine ibogaine is from the iboga tree and it's uh that's from breaking open the head that there's a book called breaking I'm sorry I'm sure you did okay but ibogaine is like a Ruth and it's something I haven't experienced I'm just talking out of what I've read essentially a ruthlessly introspective 24-hour trip that rewires the way your brain use addiction has a high level of effectiveness interesting in rehabilitating people like just is killing the desire to do opiates huh they're doing that in America Mexico you go to Mexico can't go to America it's a Leo in America of course is it like sweat-lodge shaman type fingers in hospital situation Hospital type situations there's my buddy Edie clay runs a I think he still does runs a clinic down in Mexico and he started it because of his experiences with pills he got hurt got on pain pills and had a real bit hard time with them went to get on ibogaine to get off the pain pills it worked like a charm and he was like holy shit I need to let people know about this you can get your life back yeah and it's not something you get addicted to it's apparently something at one time all right I'm doing it again yeah yeah it's like it's rough yeah it's like the you okay that was enough yeah like DMT exactly it's one of those ones enough you did it once yeah in college and that was sufficient you you can get a lot out of one yeah you know I had a plaid plaid fucking world yes flying around it was it was full out-of-body yachts oh yeah it's pretty nuts yeah I think the difference in ibogaine versus DMT DMT is ego dissolving and very hallucinogenic and you see these amazing visualizations ibogaine seems to not have that but instead be like deeply like to the cellular level introspective and just and and there's some sort of a physical action that happens in the way your brain the way your brain looks at addiction changes pretty radically do you be like pocher through it or it just happens you should probably die think all those things should be done in places where people gonna feel safe and where people have done it before and where people have experience with people that have done it before and having a real Center that have it has you know real professionals and medical health staff that's that's what you want and the only thing that's keeping that from happening in America and keeping millions and millions of people from getting off pills companies drug companies yes drug companies lobbying to keep all these very helpful things illegal and we're slowly but surely gonna work them out and the way we're gonna work the mouse through money that's why I like the fact that marijuana has a 30% tax make it 50 I don't give a fuck what's a joint how much is a join you I can get you high all day think about what a drink is yes you go to bar you get a drink how much is a drink cost mmm $8 yeah $8 worth of weed will fuck you up through many days yeah man I don't know about many days two days maybe one day how much is a job you half a day if you're buying a pre-roll $12 25 bucks this is 25 bucks that's cigar this Godfather put you on Pluto yeah you'll be over there with David Bowie you know twenty-five dollars last month and now it's $33 a shot at McAllen those well over 25 probably at any bar he's right all right fine fine my taxes not my weed are good fine thank you by ten years I've been buying legal weed and all of a sudden I want to buy illegal weed because the taxes and you just talked me guilted me even back into legal well I'm happy to pay it and I think that it's you know I understand well your movie toku for you I get it I get it but what I'm saying making that point money no no you're not but some people would yeah but I'm saying the money if it goes to a good cause if we really can change the way people perceive drugs yeah because it's not there's not a war on drugs that is a lie there's drugs everywhere they're prescribed you can get them at a drug store you can get them at a liquor store you can get drugs there's a lot of drugs it's just certain drug right the ones that they can't you know corporatize as easily so the way to get it in is not through the corporation's influence but through the influence of the consume of the consumer the consumer paying exorbitant amount of taxes on these things willingly is gonna change the opinion you know I like weed being legal I'll pay the fucking tag that's right I will I was just curious I mean uh I look selfishly totally selfishly right my own benefit I as a guy who jumped through the one hoop and got a forty dollar medical card was happy to have it be called medicine and get it didn't have it legally and not pay taxes on it right now it seems like it's the same except I'm paying the tax on it it is the same but it's progress because the money's going into the community I hope I hope if it is let's let's say guess I hope it goes towards law enforcement I hope it's divvied up between law enforcement and education how about that what I hope that goes to education but I something tells me it's not I just feel like it's gonna be so much money like Colorado had to give tax money back to get a refund they keep it back because there's so much money being made by weed that's like Alaska it's like the oil pipeline exactly your state taxes boss I don't know if they have negative state taxes but I know they gave people refunds they gave people money back because they made so much money on taxes that's awesome fucking amazed at saw 'some and if that if that happens in California keep my fucking thirty percent sales tax real estate went up fourteen percent since marijuana was legalized is that I'm going down yeah a lot of people thought all those rolls they move out there's pot heads gonna go straight no friends of mine wants to open a like a cannabis club and there's only in there's a small area in the Green Zone where you can do that and I'm like great here's your map of the Green Zone I go okay what's for sale in the Green Zone nothing not a single building a place where you can get high like publicly yeah it would be like cigar bar yes there's a lot of rules a lot and there's a very restrictive about where you can put it and you absolutely under no circumstances can have a drop of alcohol anywhere on the premises interesting so if somebody comes in with a beer you're fucked you can't take yeah you gotta kick them out yeah Wow yeah but they're in West Hollywood you there will be places where you can go and smoke on premises yeah that's gonna be weird huh yeah go get high with a bunch of strangers yeah it makes sense in Amsterdam because it's a walking City right you can use your coffee shop tour you know to walk around the city and go in coffee shop to coffee shop and sightsee and it's really nice sober up but in LA what are you driving from coffee shop to hot fucking come on nobody walks here what are you gonna do it's gonna be like that scene with Ray Liotta and Goodfellas where the helicopters flying overhead i remade that scene frame for frame and it got kicked off YouTube because you have to use the real music and I got trademark infringement but I did it frame for frame with the helicopters we mean you did it i remade that helicopter chase you with me and it into for a car review I was reviewing Cadillac and I did the fucking thing right through the bag and I'm looking helicopters and what was the problem you say music yeah the actual music yeah yeah yeah you have to use the actual music otherwise it's not going stones what is it hmm it's not Layla its Layla no mmm fucking hell that's whatever it is you have to use the exact music and it didn't work got kicked off at YouTube Oh too bad Spence I made that well they're really good at spotting copyright music now or anything copy written I thought I could get away get around it with if I didn't monetize the video but it didn't you know when we get fucked whenever we put up a video of like any nature thing like a bear killing something or something like that yes oh those are all bought by someone almost like patent trolls yeah and people put them up they just take it down they you have to offer money to like stock companies or something yeah yeah all that stuff gets yanked down off of Facebook yeah YouTube and Facebook those are two places that stuff gets Facebook like I don't put videos on Facebook anymore cuz it just gets stolen immediately yeah and also their revenue is what do you mean by gets stolen it's very easy for someone to rip your video off of you know put it somewhere else on Facebook and whatever versus if they reload it somewhere else on YouTube the software algorithm will generally catch it oh no so the software algorithm and Facebook is not as effective they don't really give a shit they don't care yeah they're too busy selling your information so fuckin Russia totally Jamie was watching the video of how did it go he should know the answer I he dad what had to go again today yeah and I was watching right before you got here in this I don't know where she was from but she was saying like you're the CEO of this company and you should know some of these answers and she was like listing all the shit he didn't know yeah yeah I was like this is ridiculous night afterwards now they've shown which I guess it's part of now public information his notes oh no that he had like as references that he was looking at I've only seen one picture of it mm-hmm just very weird stuff that like seems blatantly obvious that he should know or should say that's different from what we maybe we think we should yeah I think they should be able to tell us I get the impression that this company grew so fast that they don't even know what the fuck is going on in now well that was the other thing he was talking about their influence on possibly so are we gonna continue yeah we'll continue don't worry about it he was talking about his influence on all these different upcoming elections that were coming up and about how they wanted to make sure that there was no BOTS that were influencing these elections and I stopped and thought about it I'm like oh my god in that moment of him saying that I realized like what pressure he must be under what pressure that company is under there they went from being a thing where people could share pictures like of hey this is us on our summer vacation like hey you know fucking we're gonna go to the pub on Friday that's what Facebook kind of was right people would talk about certain things in the news they would have opinions you put up something a bunch of people comment on it that's what it was now with this last election and with him testifying in front of Congress what I'm seeing is Facebook being like one of the most important sources of influence in the world today and it's not really being completely managed oh I feel like the Russians the Russians yeah maybe there's a little bit like Google needs to be looked into what's going on Mike Sogo also probably like they have a data I think someone was just looking into this you know people downloaded their Facebook profile and they're like my files one gigabyte how much data is in here right people found out a way to download theirs and find their information what what does Facebook know about me well apparently there's also one that Google has on everyone and it's much larger I'm not shocked you know I wouldn't be I wouldn't be nervous if it wasn't for that I that d'amore memo thing really changed my mind about a lot of things not because you know it's a subject that's near and dear to my heart but because I the way they were handling it was not there were we weren't being honest they were they weren't being honest about the science they weren't being honest about the reaction they were even the way they were describing it we're talking about the James do more Google memo oh I don't know was that the sexism thing was that well as the the Witte was talking about women in tech explain why women put preferred and not like why some women are not influenced by it the way Google handled it was very may be very nervous because they weren't being honest about the information they weren't being honest about the results they weren't be honest about what was in his they were saying he was reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes that's not what he was doing he what he was talking about the difference in the psychology between men and women and why women would gravitate towards different careers maybe that's why more women aren't intact and maybe there's ways to get women intact well you've taken that angle before right with women and fighting and women in sports right yeah there's some women that are not gonna want to be into those things or someone that are going to be men it's less likely that a woman's gonna be into fighting than a man I don't think that's extraordinary to say but a lot of women are into it it doesn't mean that it's impossible but it's just we're looking at human beings like if you're an outlier and you're a woman who really loves to fight there's nothing wrong with that I'm not saying is anything wrong with that but I'm saying it's much more rare than a woman who wants to you know do become a nurse or do something that's traditionally a female caregiver sort of a position which is really common and I see did the letter memo indicate like this that science says women were less predisposed to becoming programmers or something like that no no it's it just was talking about gender like choices and choices people make and why they make them based on personality traits and how why things are more common certain things are more common in males certain things are more common to women and that this would indicate why there were less women that were involved in tech and it wasn't some systemic sort of discrimination campaign right on by men you know but my point was we were talking about them having all the information that you have like Google and yes book how much information they have on you it would make me less nervous if I didn't know about that how they handled that Google memo thing because I'm like well you guys are being honest about what this is and what the guy wrote you're paying the guy out to be a villain and you think if you fire him and drown this that this story goes out and then you guys get to look like social justice warriors yeah and then you don't take the heat from the what you know is an objective analysis of this issue well I don't I'm not sure Mark Zuckerberg has a lot of incentive to be totally honest in this case either he's totally honest and he's malicious or he's totally honest and he's almost comically ignorant about certain things yeah what he's I think he's almost got to say he doesn't know but the problem is vague and proved he knows he should know though is yes like also part of this well here's the thing he shouldn't know now him saying he doesn't know what if they can pull up an email yeah well I mean what if they have access to all of his emails and it shows that he knows that they did I was talking to yesterday about it and we were like worried about the Facebook recording thing is anybody gonna bring that up and it was brought up and he said that they don't record audio Facebook doesn't write you were talking about it with Google weren't you we talking about it with Google that if you talked if you were talking in a room about a certain subject I've never felt that happen right it's the Apple home pod you thought you've had you've been talking about something in a room and then had pop-up ads pop no I'm up right no I have it no no no I believe it though have you had it it happened to me before not I don't know how I couldn't tell you what where the signals went but I've definitely had strain it could be a coincidence but I've had strange ads pop up that are I read that that I don't know if it's accurate though what I was reading that there how people have tried to prove and it could be people on Facebook side just to give him propaganda that that's almost nearly impossible to do right now just throws the technology would take to record your audio have it scanned by something and then deliver and add to you based off of that in amount of time yeah it's possible I could have looked at something similar at a recent time or it would just was just far enough away for me to not make an exact connection I don't think though is that you recognize that that is potentially in the future like things like alexa and things like home pod and the yeah I mean devices that are designed to listen to your voice yeah that's the whole point of them yeah you know so this good I don't know dude I get a lot of there's I get a lot of shit done I'm real productive you know I can I can I have things that are would be very difficult to find that can be delivered bro I had I have a I have a I have a 2001 Mercedes SL 500 rules my traffic car perfect for traffic a nice big Clarion systematic car great I love my traffic car and you know it's got the old-school removable hardtop so I need to get the stand to put the hardtop on when it took it off right Amazon twelve hours I had a stand for a 2001 mercy delivered to my house Wow that level of convenience yeah I'll give up a little privacy a little bit little bit I'm fine I'll give it up you can have it that's what's gonna get us that's who's gonna get us to turn us into machines just give up a little bit here a little bit here yeah I don't want to give up all of it like I'm definitely opposed to the drive vehicle tracking yes you know like like about having a car that knows where you've been and tells somebody about it which a certain company does do that what what company is this well Tesla's no where you been well don't they all by virtue of their GPS but Tesla's are wirelessly connected to Tesla so the reason if the social part of the reason Tesla's semi autonomous system works as well as it does and part of the reason Tesla is doing what they're doing as a company is your car's all Tesla's on the road are collecting mapping data for Tesla you know in real time hmm so they can you know be ethical with that data or they can not and odds are they don't give a shit where you're going other than to help them figure out where to put the next superchargers and and whatnot and in general you have to assume to improve your experience but if you extrapolate this 50 years down the road and some of our privacy's get worn away you could end up with a car that where you know where it's very easy to subpoena the records of your Tesla and find out exactly where you went so a Tesla would be the worst car if you were like a bank robber fuck yeah now if you if you're like over 200 miles analog animal big fuel tank think transporter 1 Jason Statham that's what you want big fuel cell black late-model car what's that in just invisible black again vantablack vantablack no no one they haven't painted anything like big in it yet yet motherfuck I have vent a car on the way there's some weird environmental shit with vantablack because John John Ward was telling me there is one no that is velvet my friend velvet that's fuckin velvet you yep that's real yep well wait a minute that's not that says vantablack but that's not vantablack that is a velvet car that i'm Roadeo wait a minute this this world's royce is not a vente but it's not vantablack is it pot impossible it says it is there I'm telling you they haven't painted a car in vantablack so either that's fake or it's a velvet shit they're doing now yeah yeah yeah now what is it made out of that allows it to get to this level of darkness you know I don't know it is just crazy looks dope Joe please don't put your to break a velvet do that I saw Justin Bieber once driving around in a leopard print out E Oh whew were 23 years old and drowning and pussy he'd probably do this is I think this was years ago he's probably 19 he's probably trying to keep them away from him just trying to have the grossest car possible just to say look stay away from my dick cover who of your crazy guests has rolled up to your studio in the dopest car do you read does anything come to mind hmm did Bilzerian roll up in that six-by-six he's got the left I bet you didn't even really believe me and no you said I knew he had a chrome Fisker that's a Fisker Karma was no yeah and they just rerelease that thing I heard they did though yeah a company bought all the assets and they started blowing up drying water when the I asked for one for review did you say slightly declined yeah I wonder why yeah yeah you got a big mouth I'm gonna drive through a puddle oh yeah electric cars man there's a bright future it's just I don't want to jump in yet and I don't want anything driving for me true have you have you driven an electric car ever yeah I've driven a Tesla they're nice they're nice yeah it's weird it feels weird it does but in an urban environment you can see why it's a nice experience when i drive an electric car is the chrome Fisker hangout when i drive an electric car and I get where I'm going I noticeably more relaxed than when I'm driving a gas car especially if I'm driving like a loud sports car right right right those vibrations and stuff go through your body and kind of like stick with you versus the serenity of that silence I just dove 250 mile range it annoys the shit out of me yeah yeah no it's they need infrastructure like they're considering how many Tesla's are in Los Angeles there's an embarrassingly small number of superchargers in the city there's not a lot of places to charge a Tesla outside of your home and they really need to do the infrastructure and they need to come up with a faster charging solution which Porsche it seems may have done Porsche has a new electric car coming out called the mission II which is a Tesla fighting thing and they supposedly have a fast charging system that can do like an 80 percent charge in ten minutes or something whoa yeah Wow so you know that's crazy ten minutes is pretty close ten minutes as fast if you have three right yeah three to five yeah ten is fine ten works yeah tens good and a competitor is good because you know Tesla's you don't you can't charge them for free anymore you don't know the model threes and the new ones they don't come with free charging Andes motherfuckers that's how they get you by dollar rocks first ones free and yup they get you yep no more free juice Wow was it free for a few years at 2013 the Model S came out and four years or so so what happens when you pull into the airport you go to one of them electric spots credit card or you have a you know a RFID fob or something fuck yeah these motherfuckers got a pay-to-play my friend why can't they figure out how with all the Sun in LA to have a solar powered car uh you just it's just not possible with photovoltaic cells to generate a not much dude it takes so much juice to move a 4,000 pound car down the road yeah so much more than turning on a light or playing a radio like that mass movement it takes so much energy mmm Fisker had something on the roof that powers the radio right yeah I know there are a couple of company uh hmm Fisker was one someone else did a photovoltaic roof where it it like circulates the climate the air when it's really hot out or it can pre turn on certain things and shit like that yeah yeah but it's not enough to run or charge a car what if that's going to change in the future I'm sure they don't have solar panels really have they come that far yet well tell you as a solar has a roof tile you seen this yeah the Tesla roof tile yeah they're trying to do a Tesla solar tile that goes on your roof that then will feed into the Tesla battery pack that hangs on your wall you know and then you can be autonomous basically sort of but you're still in the grid yes and you give money back to the thing the reason why they do that they don't want you being completely off the grid they don't want the grid done right you know people are really worried about that well I I'm building a building right now so get this LA is you know I'm a Democrat but LA will make you want to hang yourself building shit so I have to prep my building for solar panels whether I put them on or not if I put them on there ninety-two thousand dollars to cover the roof and solar panels and I will pay they pay themselves off in seven years so I generate twelve thousand dollars or so a year in power and then after that I'm fully fully positive and the city will pay me every year and they pay themselves off in seven years and the lifespan of them is twenty years so I could potentially have many years of free power Wow yeah so you're you're building I'm building a collector car storage facility here's where I plug it it's called Westside collector car storage it's gonna be in Playa Vista California which is the the sweet new part of LA beautiful area yeah do you know where the Clippers practice facility is I've seen that it's right next to the Fox Hills Mall right by LAX Venice it's conveniently located and I'm gonna have storage for 150 cars it's gonna secur climate control the whole the whole deal so this is you're doing it as an investment or as a business yeah as a business ground up it's creating for customers is not you know it's not for me and we're building a cool studio there like this like you've got instead of my shanty little studio so I do a podcast for hell yeah yeah and the podcast studio is gonna be elevated so we have car stackers so I have 24 high stackers and the studio is elevated and we'll just look out over the stacks cars yeah yeah it's gonna be killer but I have to comply with a lot of California environmental craziness I have to put a fire hydrant in this is like for the city like I have to do it for the city to get a building permit well it kind of makes sense if your fucking cars catch on fire you got a lot of gasoline in that one spot yeah yeah the the fire system that we have to build is incredible I would imagine yeah and we have to have auxilary pumps it flows 3,500 gallons a minute Wow and every car so the stacks every car on a stack has two nozzles at it front and back oh wow every car has its own set of nozzles Wow yeah so if a fire starts over here it's completely contained over here and the ideas they kick on automatically when yeah oh wow yeah it's incredible yeah that's a really neat but I'm like four years into this now so broken ground yet hopefully next week Wow hopefully next week four years my permits just got just got approved wow that's dope dude come back on when it's done I'll be great come back on was done that people know thank you we've been doing this for like three hours and a half is there anything else yeah any other shit going on no I'm just happy to see you I'm happy I'm sure I didn't get to come to your new
