man that PRP platelet rich plasma with stem cells is that shit in Vegas yeah one week later man elbows feeling great it's the brian town show ladies gentlemen we are live Brian Cowen mm a catalan spectacular that's right fresh off a Christmas everybody had a bit of the flu touch the flu put me on my back for a couple hours every day did you get over the rally sure did do you get the flu shots no did not actually who gets they sure don't get those I should things up 70% yeah yeah yeah well apparently it's a very complicated thing to try to nail which flu viruses and hit people and they don't get it they don't get it right a lot yeah the CDC will sometimes be like listen we just checked this flu is coming in its a bitch but here's the problem a lot of times they'll even admit when you get the flu shot it doesn't take it doesn't it helps a little bit it'll make the flu you can get the flu that's what they're injecting the flu and the flu shots like the sickest virus there's a reaction that some people have you can have a when you're sick if you're about to get sick or you feeling sick don't get the flu shot they say yeah they say don't get it when your immune systems company is correct but sometimes they can give you the flu shot and everybody will get the flu and you won't so it does work yes sometimes yeah but I'll do it I need to I just don't you know it's like do I want to go in there and get a shot I'm a pussy I'm like I'll just get sick for ten days I just don't want to do it I'll tell you what if I'm Francis or if I'm Stevie I'm trying to give fuckin Francis the flu some North Korean just something they found that North Korean soldier that defected he'd been vaccinated against anthrax what yeah he's the second guy that defected in a month oh yeah what that guy oh yes idea first guy they found like crazy parasites in this thing he was eating raw like tapeworm everything poor guy they start they're starving to death over there Northern Arena well communism works especially it doesn't turn into it's a monarchy communist all you fucking freaks out there all you young Millennials wearing beads a history major but I know enough about history to know about Marxism oh especially after talking to Jordan Peterson about our dove deep and do it just great as like well what is the history of the stuff it's all terrible of course it's it doesn't work no it's like it's not human because you need you need a central power you need someone to keep the ones that are getting I talked to an academic the other day I said so what are you saying you just kept talking about the the he was talking about the Scandinavian system of government and how great it was I go when was the last time you bought something made in Scandinavia I like Scandinavia but some like sobs sobs an Ikea yeah I mean sobs a good come sure there are certain things but we're talking about an iPad right now you know yeah that everything was made in the marketplace like yourself well it's definitely a smaller place to write you know people in Sweden what's the last good thing Russia made it's a good point the Kalashnikov look yeah yeah the Kalashnikov rifles and they made so they would they had some good strides they made in rocketry you know they were the first guy to put a guy into orbit although they absolutely did fake the video footage that they released of Yuri Gagarin said his name Yuri Gagarin Yuri Gagarin in space they've proven that there's no way you could get the kind of camera that you would need to record that which film in that small capsule that he was floating around the space in and then there's light coming from to Dulles Lee have like lights on these dumb fucks they have lights on them he's in a cabin he's faking that he's like I think he really did do it but they didn't really get footage of him doing so they faked the footage but that footage that the Russians bomb because Russia is just propaganda they all did it the Russians are amazing at anything they put their mind to like that the culture itself they work so hard like when if you look at them they're like we want to be great power lifters great great wrestlers anything they're doing steroids even that you watch that movie the movie aggressor yeah how fucking crazy is that everybody don't know everybody everybody they just get better they band them but here's what's a really squirrely band they one of the things they did they took a medals away from a couple of people but the people they take medals away like they say you can't compete in this sport and now they've pulled them out of a couple sports that nobody gives a fuck about and there's the other problem the IOC and wada the world anti-doping agency they're completely interconnected people work for both of us back and forth in between each other they have an incestuous relationship and that was all exposed by Brian Fogle in that movie it's a fucking great movie it grace if you haven't seen it you want to know like the depths of doping I love that guy yeah guy was fascinating to me and he he had been an athlete and then he's getting a witness protection program right I mean he's basically afraid for his life yes Lane is hiding Russia is banned from the 2018 Olympics and the athletes are told to compete under the Olympic flag you're not representing a company so a country rather so now the Olympics are a country Olympics can't get their own country that's gonna be the new America all Russia they're the country state most of these states it's a lot of it state-sponsored you know the anabolics were coming out of China I think all the crazies do you think Russia is the only one crazy Brian Fogle pointed out that China did the exact same thing in Beijing they want all these fucking gold medals like crazy they were winning gold medals and when there's a disproportionate amount of gold medals that are being won in your home country yeah okay okay skeptical hippo folks why don't why I'm a little uh why am i little concerned here that the financial gains of making that many Olympic gold medals are so fucking irresistible dude look what it did for Jamaica oh yeah you know Jamaica don't have the fast sprinters in the world Brandon they're not known for that in sports right but there's no denying that there's an extreme and rampant abuse of performance numbers up up up up up okay one guys made happen the guy they take the real a gold medal he might have I think they're all cold the Beast well when I was talking to Victor Conte who is by the way as balls deep into that world as possible the ultimate snitch of snitches first team all snitch the guy who was the head of Bunco who made that clear shit that was undetectable for a little while until they figured out how to detect it which is what they always do he said all of tracking feels dirty of course all of it yeah so if you get some dudes coming out Jamaica or France or Spain or whatever they just burst on the scene they start fucking running faster than everybody else they're doing some shit that no one knows about I know a woman who's gonna compete for a country how BIG's our day and she had a she had a dick on it but the steroids in hell with she was trying to be a triathlete and she was going she was American but she was gonna represent the country of her origin and start training and she was phenomenal athlete and everything else and her coach said so now of course we got to talk about getting the next level whoa and she goes I'm a triathlete what's that one is it we we got it we got to start talking about messing with your endocrine system because you're not connect you're not gonna get these times until we became we can be yeah you know and the and then when she saw that everybody was like well no no he's famous coach she's like no no this this is just a reality yeah what she's doing she didn't do it the Lance Armstrong story like Lance Armstrong realized when he was young that everybody is doing drugs yes all of them yeah and so he who competed clean when he was young until he got to a certain level he's like fuck well this is just how this goddamn thing works it's just this week he was sort of three-card Monte game of hiding your dirty piss and he was better than everybody because that guy's taking sponsored yeah it's just part of the game well what do you think like so my feeling is like soso if weight lifters are gonna move world-record weights it's really exciting to see them do that and obviously is it power lifters and stuff like that are not going to be lifting as much with testosterone my question is are we ever gonna be beat like the inexorable advance of Technology are we ever gonna really be able to stop as we are able to gene dope and all that stuff like where are we with this and and is so it's gonna be cat mouse are we gonna yeah are we gonna lease this no everyone's always gonna look for an edge always but in powerlifting yeah I don't give a fuck what they do cuz power link yeah you know so what comes to fighting fighting one yeah fuck yeah for sure football and fighter you guys - yeah yeah football's a combat sport it just got rigid rules when you're running full clip at each other and literally like knocking each other unconscious because you're head butting each other yeah I mean which is Paul you don't big part football was until they stop people doing that yeah it's a combat sport 100% it just doesn't have kicks or punches but I mean but the juice is worth the squeeze in football it's worth the squeeze financially educationally there's the same there's about how about baseball where your bat speed stays the same those getting birdies no kid all the home runs you want baseball is it's a good argument for steroids because it's a boring fucking game too and we also it's fun wasn't someone hits that ball when was it fun when Jose Canseco and Barry Bonds and fucking sorry so Mark McGwire that cracking them out of the park that's when it's fun not only that you get your playing out in 60 games and you break down keeps you too many too many games simply too many get if you're sprinting full-out all the time like that trying to get to third base yeah there's so many times where you're doing damage to your body and you're not going to have a chance to recover yeah but if you're on the Jews you can run faster you can keep going so what do you think but it's weird with MLB how they crack down on it right although they're killing it now but the same with the UFC like they crack down on so now you have you sada but then you're not getting as good as well product that I don't think there's anything wrong with the product right down the UFC I think it's as good as it's ever been but I'm out dare you a few fighters dropped off the map but I think that's probably a good thing because I think those guys are probably egregious I see I think it's a combination I think the skill levels going up just naturally you know through evolution skills going up but when you have such strict testing then we're missing out on certain guys like Jon Jones and the yes well the Jon Jones once is very unfortunate because John is just just one of the most talented guys of all time if not the most talented he's number one and also the the biggest disaster in terms of the big mistakes that he's made like we've never had a fighter that did a hit-and-run on a pregnant woman and broke her arm and then took off and then test positive for drugs because he's on dick pills and then test positive again after his comeback after a spectacular win over Daniel Cormier he's so disappointing in that regard so exceptional and his physical abilities but the choices he makes and the decisions that come out of those choices just fucking terrible but a lot of it's because the strict testing that the UFC hire do I do with the car accident there's nothing to do no car accident but so like car accident yes but yeah now yes he'd be he'd be cleared he'd be all good yes but it's there's a symptom is a symptom of something else going on you know and people don't like to discuss this but one of the things that easily could be is that John has impulse control because he's been sparring and fighting and at the highest level of the sport for many many years now and he's gotten hit in the head a gang of times there's no there's no way around it there was just an article I posted on Twitter that came out a couple of days ago that these neuro scientists were examining brain injury and violent behavior and like how they're connected and how damaged to certain areas of the brain has irreparable consequences on the decision-making ability the person who gets hit I think that's part of it you know he's been wild since high school college like he was always so good that's why he's a fucking one of the reasons why it's good is because he's a wild motherfucker and I love that part Connors a little wild - sounds like he's wild like you like what masterminds of this game they're all little wild them to be a University sport though look at look at Camp Nou some of the coasters wait if Francis ain't gonn o wins the World Championship and spreads those superpower genes throughout this great nation forest okay we won't need sterile world take a little bump here of this as Francis gets part of that mate but doesn't want the devil's dandruff all fuh steep Amy o stitch he's got to get he's got stops knee pay from double a single leg and him taking them to the ground and riding them so you guys be careful cuz I'm saying steep a is gonna arrest them to the sincere Bryan Callen comes out and then he's gonna stand them up in the third fourth round oh that's tres gonna go away well it's entirely possible to steep their wins this Steve pays the world heavyweight champion Steve a beaten Junior dos Santos by knockout he beat Orlovsky by knockout he beat Overeem by not he's a bad motherfucker he won the title with a one punch falling away right hand on the button he's a bad motherfucker no doubt about it but there's there's physical undeniable characteristics that in Ghana possesses that make him the most terrifying guy in the sport but we haven't the only the only shot that I'm seen with steep a win this fight though is stylistically he could be the Keeley's heel to Frances meaning he doesn't entertain the stand-up he just puts that fucking forehead in the middle of his chest as I dude we're riding this out to the 3rd 4th round let's see what you can do it's totally it's totally possible but I'll stir when he clinched up with him Alistair is fucking huge I wished had clinched up with within Ghana and it was like trying to bear hug a wall you see his face he like ran straight and then when he gets flipped around he's like oh shit yeah it's not snowflake that's not snowflake and then just gets no no I think the most he's ever been is two right he got taken out in his first fight against Curtis blades yeah you shouldn't hang your head on that because Curtis blades with a JUCO national champion JUCO national champs are fucking good wrestler he's an excellent athlete too and he keeps getting better and better Curtis blades a real dark horse in the sport I really think that 10 now if he keeps improving and keeps working with radius he's a big guy he hits hard he's fucking aggressive and smart stand-ups he's got hopefully he's working with Christian Allen out there Karl he stand-ups kind of his it's getting better it's getting better he's getting better at it but the thing is he's got a lot to work with like you let him bleed oh yeah he's got a lot to work with an easy young guy look at the JUCO national champs who's well so is he looks 74 but how old is he John Jones it's JUCO national champ the Rumble Johnson judo champion yeah there's d1 he was doing wrestling players I think so I'm play baseball this guys were phenomenal athletes had never wind up going to big colleges because they don't have the flood or financial 26e curtis blades has uh he has a lot of potential - he has a lot of potential he's only 26 thinking ghana was what 33 32 33 how old's franz not a young chicken but he had some rough years right now streets in camera room yeah yeah 31 31 also and gone owes 31 so think about careers plays in five years thank you he keeps getting better five years ago we didn't even know who in ghana was two years ago he makes his UFC debut two years later everybody's lying on their back and he's fighting for the title and I called him to check Congo with braids and I want to apologize yeah he does anymore knows get fired apologize for that now he's tips no one says a word about and not a fuck you not a word dude I saw him in the first year t I've been to since I retired on to that UFC that we were at in Vegas and there I was around the fighters and all that and there was one hot dog left I went to grab the hot dog and he reached for the hot dog he fuckin D bowed me on the hot dog line you can have a bro nicest guy though that's a very very nice guy very nice guy so I think that you know steep a is the you have to say that steep a is the most experienced steep a has real wins over world-class competition other than Alistar and Arlovski who are the two guys that in ghana fought so he's got more experience having being ver doom having beating having beaten you know top-flight guys Junior dos Santos by KO is the style today yeah he's got a chance yeah I mean if he didn't have him as a disadvantage and I steep a yeah yeah he's honored us yeah I watch that that uppercut that he hit with over him Oh Roman he's doing I watch you too useful like I watched it in full like speed full speed it's so fast it like in real time it's so fast it's so much faster than you realize depending on the angle you look at what was over my god watch it knew him so he's trying to be wild over in just well wet oh yeah more the greatest strikers in the heavyweight division all-time fuck it but watch how fast it goes we have it there's a weird yeah let's go find the video like a weird shootout with over and just being all that experience Mike how does the one-way France can win the first round fuck it let's just throw from our hip see what happens yeah yeah I know like why didn't he like kick his legs why she looked good Alistar is doing he's just trying to be like real officer said this was he said that yeah what was the game plan not this good left hook to God yeah you know what that's like that's like Bonecrusher Smith shovel hook and when Bonecrusher Smith used to have that ridiculous left hand it was like a half hook half uppercut that was just a shovel man Oh terrifying and then when you find out his dad was a legendary street fighter in Cameroon like okay yeah oh and then he was homeless five years ago yeah five years ago just did that stuff oh you mean the movie Lion Heart yeah that's fucking him and all he does is train man oh he does his training practically lives at the UFC Performance Institute really he's there every day he's the UFC's being the UFC's Performance Institute is the most state-of-the-art motherfucking place you've ever seen your life is terms of recovery in terms of strength and conditioning equipment I mean it is a fucking spectacular facility lives there and he's there every day they moved him there yeah they moved him from France to his trainers there well he Vinny Magalhaes I know I was working with him when in terms of his jujitsu but his original trainer that found him in Paris is with him here forget the gentleman's name but this is the UFC Performance Institute it's fucking phenomenal my thing with this Joe's so lazy so let's say so France they're doing his camp life Steve Bates like came in I want those I'm gonna do my camp there too it's a good point and he pays a champ but luckily you know it's not an issue because steep a is in Cleveland and he has his same coaches that he's always had and a real tight-knit team that's worth not get that I'm saying at some point let's say let's say why does a girl a full makeup on what she's throwing shoes easy hottest girl ever into the Octagon she fought do you think so dude that girl is I don't know about that man you she's hotter than that Rachel Howdy's her name hasta Vic girl a deficit just fought for the the ultimate let me see an Ultimate Fighter the TV show with that you talk about the TIG ol bitties I'm talking about yeah the girl from Hawaii oh don't care she's wrong for a final we were one of the city sewers during for she's way more I don't say that girls ugly girls definitely not ugly she's very pretty but first of all why should wear a makeup while she's fighting yeah well as a commercial revisers engineer that commercial lab a bunch of Millennials that have a hard time putting their backpack in the overhead compartment yeah see shut your fucking mouth yeah look at yes that's what I'm talking about that kind of body making faster than death geez dude just hey I can't watch this I'm gonna pass out hey keep this going Jamie finger fight - don't be disrespecting fight gorgeous yeah and you know just by all accounts very nice person so there's there's a lot of pretty girls that are finding their way to the UFC and they find that like that's an asset you know what's really interesting to me from one of the best-looking ones of all puts zero emphasis on that and that's rose namajunas Rose is she's gorgeous she's pretty and she puts no emphasis on that shaves her fucking head I know and there's nothing fake about rule 11 yeah she's just nothing fake about that girl yeah we met her I think or at least I did you know before I met her I think with that thing we did was it a spike thing I came her UFC thing it was a and she was in a dress he was with Pat Barry yeah and she but she had long hair back then I mean she was stunning like astonishing looking and I didn't know who she was at the time and I mean so she yes she's she's if she walked in the into a bar back then like that even now but I mean back then you would have been like I mean she turns to supermodel fails she really does she's a model and she doesn't put any emphasis on that at all Oliver emphasis on is honor fighting and trash-talking well remember when she shaped a fight yeah everyone shaved her head when she was fighting Paige Vanzant she went oh your things beauty yeah well she's like my hair was just getting in the way fuck it then beat the brakes off yeah that's what she used to look like she's to have like that's like work out here it's better with her head shaved with the right red shirt on there Jamie upper right hand corner right there I mean shut the fuck up that's a beautiful girl she's that's a model son that is about as hot as a woman's face gets their accountant kind contract for god sake meanwhile how the fuck did no one see her coming I mean it's kind of crazy I think she look so feminine I think she doesn't like her body no how much emphasis they put on promoting Paige Vanzant how much they put on a lot of other girls that are really pretty too but that's a marketing thing look you got to look at like what this company is now right this company started off a passion project by two fucking crazy billionaire dudes well first of all hoary and Gracie right art Davies the original guys you know they're a merits those guys are started off they get it going then they sell it as a passion project to two super billionaires who love the sport who train they're fucking like happiest I feel like we we only you have safe data talk them into it I didn't talk to they're having a good old time they literally were what me and Eddie Bravo used to pray for we said when we were watching the fights back when nobody gave a shit about the UFC the thing we always said was wouldn't it be amazing if some billionaires just threw a shitload of money at it and made it famous like we know it's an incredible sport to watch we know how exciting it is wouldn't it be great if somebody just publicized this thing and then the fruit eaters come along literally like they just they figured it out themselves they're like this thing is like we just need to spend money they spent they were 40 million dollars in the hole when the first Ultimate Fighter was airing oh so they put that much money the money produced The Ultimate Fighter Lorenzo's a genius and then the show takes off the shoten is by the way after they had called Dana White and told him to bail they like sell this thing we're losing too much money we're you know X amount of millions of dollars in the hole I'm not gonna lose my family's business all because of this one project that we have fuck this and then he calls him up the next day annals I change from he slept on it why did she lie because he's a fucking genius I think Lorenzo's the the most you know you there's one a one B but he's right up there's most important people he's so conscious he was he was a important like balancing act to Dana yes i Dana so volatile and crazy emotional this guy and he's a faggot and this all the craziness that Dana especially in the early days used to be and then he goes from that to super calm really reasonable incredibly articulate like laid-back Lorenzo yeah I think I think he's missed now that things are going on like you would never seen the Floyd Mayweather Connor fight Lorenzo was there he really wasn't into that stuff he really wasn't man are you crazy I don't think he didn't like spectacle no no I would you pass on that thing I wanted to see that didn't you want to see that Shelly I wanted to see it I wanted to see it but Lorenzo I think looked at the bigger picture cuz I think now that we look back on Floyd and and Connor and then worthy you'll see that now I don't know if is the best decision it's a great decision I think it was an amazing decision first of all it's an amazing decision for the overall evolution of combat sports incredibly important no chance it's incredibly important to realize that a real specialist like Floyd Mayweather will run circles around someone who does not have the same amount of time and knowledge like Conor has great punching power he's got great speed but as far as his like boxing acumen to compare the two of them the greatest of all time arguably no way there's no there's no there's no it's not even please caveat that with the fact that Floyd Mayweather didn't even fight him the way he fights other guys if you'd wanted not to be touched he could have done that towards some made him work hard I don't think that's great and those are great points but I think if you look at the lay out the lay of the land now Lorenzo wouldn't have done it because now you have two divisions held up you have Conor with all this power we have no idea whether he's gonna fight you didn't ever have to fight again so you miss out on Conor if you want to sell the TV deals you can't guarantee Connors gonna fight that's why and obvious a thing there go ahead also also now we're in the era of the money fighting where everyone wants the money for rankings don't matter divisions don't matter titles don't matter so we've lost all that kind of that the the fundamental that we've laid out no title shot so now I disagree really wants the famous fight not we haven't lost all the rankings we just lost the rankings sometimes sometimes they don't matter when do listen this is a lot of it is because the four billion dollar price tag of that company that's a big part well that is because the fighters are all done because the people that own the fight the the company now are an entertainment business they like where's the money and their money's in these big spectacle things that's right the money is we're here to make some money we're here to put on great fights like you can't tell me that fucking Detroit card wasn't one of the wildest fight cards you've ever seen your life let me put this on great fuckin fights they're putting on great cards and on top of that they're also having chaos they're having Conor McGregor box Floyd Mayweather but I think for the evolution of combat sports that fight is important see how they lend itself to the evolution of combat sports in that there were such different sports so that I think everybody would knew that ultimately but we need to see it yes like James Toney Randy Couture fight is not fair because James Toney half asked that he barely trained he didn't train any grappling we saw him doing his training with some karate guy he did this stuff to didn't it was yeah but but here's the thing with James Toney did was try to just go in there and get paid he got taken down with a low ankle pick he got just completely smushed but really half-assed attempt I agree it was he's out of shape he was his prize i won me with his in his fucking prime even those 40 he's still so good you can't seize lost a step you can't seize lost a step you look at him against me Johnny at gym six year old Floyd medic eats that up Connor landed on him if he fought that way it's depend on if he tried to just walk towards him like he had nothing if he did mr. Danner's runner kind of cracked him with that one shot and I think Floyd was like ok ok ok you can't hit me he's like we hit go let me only just are ramping this bitch up to nine listen listen you a little bit I love the Mayweather Conor McGregor stuff more than anyone I love it cuz Connor got paid I'm saying Lorenza from a business aspect is going if we give all this guy the fucking power now the balls in his court man that's that's not what we're about that's what here's my thought and now everyone else is for me you get a superstar the only way you get a Sugar Ray Leonard on Muhammad Ali don't those that the cult of personality that comes around those people they do have all the power there's no getting away they do you can't you can't stop that as a promotional organization you have to somehow or another ride with the wave and make some sort of cohesive but you gotta make some side of agreement with that person yes I made it with Brock Lesnar they made it with Ronda Rousey the other really the only other two superstars in Alaska see what keeps a champion relevant and in the lore is is the guy who keeps answering the call and and Connor did that in two different weight classes I mean you know he beat the impossible to be well then people can already do that because he hasn't defended a bite and that's what I'm saying that's why I agree with your point about the evolution of the combat sport what it's done now is put so much power in his hands he's got a hundred million dollars whenever you had this I love me too because I like the guy but at the same time like it's you're not gonna see him you're not you're the same fight these monsters like Tony Tony this year yeah why would you say that he first of all I don't like anybody saying this guy's not gonna do this or he's not gonna do that because we really don't know but why wouldn't he wants to fight I haven't seen him even training I don't know he goes hey are you gonna box packages no my next fight is mixed martial arts I'm gonna fight inside that octagon yeah I said my next fight is gonna be a real fight yeah nobody's gonna fight twenty freaks and that Tony Ferguson fight when I when I look at it more and more i watch footage I think it's it's not that bad of a matchup for college my cat's a tough fight but I think early especially early rounds one through three with Connors AXI and the in the way Tony gets hit it's a good fight for here's 300 past the third round it could get bad two parts the problem one Tony finishes motherfuckers off his back he is nasty off his back if he's down yeah if he gets taken down doesn't what I'm saying if he gets hit if he gets hit like Nate Diaz does and goes down like Conor is not it's not like a hundred percent that he's gonna beat him up and ground and pound him Tony if he gets dropped we'll wrap you up like a fucking mummy and submit you so ok I do though and Connor doesn't entertain that maybe Nate yeah difference is the difference is if Tony goes you know what I know you're fast apart from these first three rounds I I'm a college collegiate wrestler fuck this noise I'm just gonna anchor pick you all fucking day turn in third fourth fifth on the start striking with you but Connor could catch him went longer for that car it's a good fight ridiculous speed Tony doesn't get tired seen him get tossed a big defeats tired he doesn't show it cuz he's a fucking serial killer he is less tired than the other guy my mom she gets tired Brian but everybody gets tired no it's just here for it but but it is but he also is ridiculous conditioning ladies Bravo is his fucking jujitsu trainer and Eddie said he's never seen anything like this guy yeah he said the guy reigns for six hours of - yeah he said he's in Big Bear he's runnin hills literally lapping his training partners a five-round fight it means such an advantage in a three-round fight I mean his ability to just not like when you're less tired and the other guy oh my god his camps hurt Big Bear he goes he rents a house he builds his own fucking training facility he sets up his own heavy bags he mats up floors he takes a fucking room who's got like a living room of a house he sets down the borders brings in the mats and they start training he finds of hills runs those fucking hills at 6,000 feet out to plant Conor at 55 no punk men he's not so fast Eddie Alvarez who'd look at Eddie now he's of I don't say like at first I was like god this kind of scared mexicana no I look I'm like you know he does get hit first thing gets hit man yes a prom child is kabhi kabhi it so it's almost a roundtable because to be versed Toni hell of a fight could be versus Connor god that's tough fight for Connor but they can't eliminate each other's whoever shows up that night it's a fucking good fight man Frank takes your legs down when you say we're gonna know all about khabib this weekend when he fights Edson Barboza we were gonna see him with arguably the fastest striker in 155 doesn't give a fuck about going the ground he's like no we're not going the ground I'm not gonna tame that where other guys will play that game right anti wrestling will kick you in the fucking face right but how do you keep him from taking you to the ground when he kicks you in the face when he gets in you avoid the clinch yeah how do you avoid that with cubby it's hard that's fucking hard it's not it's not an easy fight long stretch the imagination Michael Johnson crack could be when they fought and had him wobbling it's the first time we've seen any adversity that could be had a face inside the Octagon buddy handled it with fucking four aces took him to the ground he's got I had no idea could be one up to 205 one AJ well he gets heavy he gets heavy in between fights women do it this time no Daniel Cormier say he has a new nutrition and he said he is been lighter getting ready for this camp than any fight before he was 179 pounds just a couple of weeks ago Josh Thompson was like dude you've never seen thing like it because I was talking about Connor and cabinas like dude I'm telling you man I seen him go with DC I've seemed all these guys and think about think about what he did dos Anjos think about what he did 70 and I go why does it could be just go to 70 up he sees where he's going tier that's his plan all he wants to do is get the belt at 55 as soon as you get that he's going peace and then at 70 enjoy that yeah fuck that 70 it's like he gets you and he takes your legs down it's like oh you're a table take your legs down now you're on the ground and that's it well I've never little anybody get them off all elite wrestlers right whether you're talking about Dave Schultz or whether you're talking about you know Karelin all the best of the best wrestlers they have an ability to enforce their will yeah to just power into God do shit to them that they don't want on and break them they they wear you like a technique with will with physical conditioning with everything beat DC is the same way all the best guys have everything they have all the components and that's one of things no mokou meant off does then you add the fact that he's from Dagestan you add the fact that he grew up and one of the hardest places in the fucking world that's right and everyone around him is hard-as-nails where I think the national sport might be arrests might be murder yeah in high school it's a crazy place which reduces him purse barbozza if it's like a video game you look at their attributes barbozza strikings like this does wrestling's like this yeah they like it could be because wrestling's like this but striking so you're intrigued by this yeah is the most intriguing fight that khabib is ever fought why my father's never reasons yeah one the two fights where he had so much difficulty making weight that his body was shutting down it happened in the michael johnson fight then it happened again in the togi 21st in fact the point they pulled him off the card so they were saying his liver was shutting down like this is serious serious shit he has not made 155 sense right he hasn't fought since so there's so much pressure on him to do this correctly but who knows if he can when your body does not want to do that anymore you run into serious problems it's one of the things that happens to older athletes when they've been cutting extremely amounts of weight over and over again they get to a point where their bodies take every time you cut 30 pounds of water from your body your body goes into like a state of shock you do some damage the question is how much damage are you doing think how long he's been doing it to Josh Thompson brought that point he goes dude he's been cutting weight since he was a kid yeah like he's been in these wrestling terms the somme bow to him since he was a kid so he's older now he's been cutting weight for fucking here's a real question here's a real question for every ins the title if he wins the title how the fuck is he gonna defend it in California he's not going to Wow yeah because California has new strict laws oh no I only Foster the guy runs the California State Athletic Commission is one of the best guys in the sport he's so proactive he's so ahead of it he's adding weight classes he's doing so much to make this safe and he was he's a martial artist lifelong martial artist himself and he competed so here a guy who sees what the problems are and he says okay we're gonna make sure you don't wave 15 pounds more when you get into the octave the night of the fight yeah yeah there's a percentage right is it a percentage of weight that you can't gain no no it's it's one pound slice I think at 55 you can't come in heavier then it's like 15.5 or something so it's 70 which caprese ger well that's why khabib just gonna get the title and dip out public place and Tebow glassing t buy would fight at 55 I mean literally looked like he was 200 pounds in a fight I heard I heard that Darin tell and I'm sure I'll hear this but I heard he when he stepped into the Octagon against cowboy Cerrone he was 201 pounds yes so I heard to enjoy beating Darin tiller enjoy it no no one wants to fight him he suffered much marry for ya he even said he fight my pages listen I'll get fucked about rankings belt I'll fight right now well he wants to put on a show we want to light people on fire and no one wants to get in there with them they saw that cowboy fighting they're like oh he's huge then you learn a story like oh my god he's a nightmare I was like let's do this than one of ways daddy's like oh no but Wonder Boy did not say let's use it let me be honest with you wonder boy had hurt thumbs that he told me about in the ring after the fight his thumbs yeah in the face after the fight he said his thumbs are pretty fucked up cuz he was talking about it in between rounds with his corner and I said what were you saying about your hands yeah man I did something to my thumbs like I hit you know he's throwing these crazy fucking punches on a guy like horny monster doll who's no joke right hell no he's catching elbows he's catching foreheads and he fucked his thumbs up and he might need surgery like he doesn't know I don't know but he was in a position where he had some serious injuries that they were saying like we got a and Dana White even tweeted it or something that we did know David out the fight right yeah I even said thank you Jesus we shot it holy shit it's good yeah I had that's a great place great fight even our boy our boy who fought Errol Spence I was just with fights at wild car West why am I forgetting I'm getting old Oh Chris been the Christian Baron was showing me like he's a boxer quality boxer been around forever and fought fought our offense but got beat but you know a high-level boxer and he was showing me he was just showing me like I said why is Errol spent so good because he I know he's but he looks like basic like he does like jab one two and he so for my eye is not a very sophisticated and he was showing me it was really guess he's just showing me how like he was able to measure his jab so Chris would throw a jab and he goes I was watching I throw a jab me goes and he would move back just like his ability to move back just just enough so some guys will move back just a little bit too much and they'll move back a little bit and then they throw so they're they're measurement of distance is just a little off and you have time to compensate his ability to move back the precise amount so you don't have time to react because he comes back boom and hits you again so every time you throw he would make it so his ability to sort of be just out of reach was better than anybody he had fought well no one's best at shit than low mishchenko correct no but I'll say up to that point Billy Joe Saunders it was like hey Junior what and then beat the brakes off did you see Billy Joe sorry I didn't see you yeah he's amazing he might be a bit trippy he's amazing yet he three dick his fucking jab it's my fingers my booty the bass right he would just plop that son in there pop and then it would be left right here we go title fight hopefully misses with a huge swing in like right hand he goes like this into the stands like he's not misses it yeah just puts on the brains looks Billy Joe looks like as if what are you trying to hit is he Amish from Wales he's gypsy yes it gypsy but he's from he's from the USA gypsy yeah try for now traveler you got to be careful right I called a fury a gypsy and a legit like traveler came with to the show was like traveler quick calls gypsies yeah they don't like gypsy but people say it all the time sorry I gave when they were saying it on HB I mean anything bad shit against Monster I hope fury comes back he's on my face this is just some stuff you don't look him up man he's dockside Zack David Lipman fight on HBO was a goddamn work of art it was goddamn when I was campaigning for triple G and they Billy Joe Saunders Lemieux I mean Billy Joe Saunders verse Canelo he's so much big a canal at this no one wants to fight Billy Joe Saunders on this but Canela money that fucking Corona cash dude he's gonna get if triple G and Cannella don't figure it out Billy Joe Saunders getting one of them I hope they have to change or Saunders hot I think people know who he is though you know who he is I know he is and I think the world was introduced to him at that last night do you know who Lemieux as though but this yeah I just don't where I do because I saw him fight triple G five yeah but in Montreal he's huge and they were feisty trio that's true let's see Billy Joe this is his first fight in America all his fights have been in Europe yeah so this is like he's been addicted watched a lot because he's so flashy like his knee kind of like well he says Christ he's murdered him and he's a mouth on them and you know what I'm the guy who can root for him - Jim Lampley and Roy Jones jr. had a little disagreement in the commentary Jim Lampley was like well if he's this far ahead why does he not try to knock him out Roy Jones is like why would he do you see what he's doing he's he's boxing his face off he's like well you have the added humiliation that you do to your opponent when you knock them out like stay in your lane Jim you just said that the Roy Jones jr. you're talking about one of the greatest knockout artists in the history of the fuckin sport I was telling him why someone should you don't just knock someone out you have to put yourself in danger to knock someone out and you could wind up losing against the fucking power puncher like Lemieux it's inside your life and box and you lose that fight everything's shot well he's the Canelo triple G fights gonna fuse em he's fighting a beautiful pattern for him to alter that pattern to get a specific result that's not smart and it's not boxing that's not supposed to silly yeah here's his highlight reel and you see see him move around he ain't so interesting with his right jab - he throws punches and then he's like whoops not here anymore dude dude the Lemieux fight if you can get that was one of the best fights because Lemieux is a legit world contender but then go class but then with Billy Joe Saunders if his highlights they do him justice somewhat but he always steps up to the level of competition so you might watch him he gets guy a guy looks alright but then when he would Chris Eubanks jr. you look at me it's Lemieux like holy fuck this guy's world-class yeah here's a Jr he will fight to whoever his levels at yeah that's why I think and he's big too for the weight class so a triple G or Canelo you got a fight on yet he's big and he's so fucking smart man that the big thing is how smart he is I mean his ring IQ and his ability to not get hit is so exceptional he steps just back and look how he changes it astral the head he goes to the body he's like he's an artist man a real artist it's really fun watching him you doll Afghan and he has a person how much shit talk smack shit he told them you yet some extra pants that from his son they can work his let me short just kept talking shit and he's also best friends with fury so they're like perfect Batman and Robin they're fucking hilarious man yeah I was surprised that they referred to him as a gypsy on the HBO broadcast not supposed to mean older fella I thought gypsies a cool word but I think so too if you go over to London they told me not to say considered Roma is considered derogatory right so they they were always wrong no Roma in there Donald Cerrone versus Yancy Medeiros UFC Austin that's a good one 74 Cerrone because Yancy is not a giant 170 you know it's coming over that that you fight of the year some people that was a crazy fight against cowboy Oliveira Austin crazy what a fucking performer int 4/18 really that's really that's real close for Yancy from that last fight yes fight was a barn burner and that was only a month ago that's weird and not much time to promote either for Austin yeah well I don't think you need it for cowboy in Austin that motherfucker I'll sell out quick and it's a fight night so it's not paper yeah they're just like it's a good headliner for sure great headline for a fight night for Yancy I mean he took a lot of hard shots and that I don't know if that's giving him enough time to recover you don't make a lot of sense but if you answer you jumping opportunity oh you hear fucking uh Jimmy Rivera's off with John lineker yeah Luna Kerr got hurt and then do you see Jim Rivera who to me is my Dark Horse in that division yeah me too fucking monster tank and then he's kind of trying to get Mariah right you wanna memorize yeah the he goes you if you'd even you said you do that five pounds and give you five pounds this team said no no said no right and then goes I'll give you ten pounds I just wanna fight might not be and just do what no Marlin might not be in shape he's like yeah let's fucking do it well Marlo just funny really recently spectacular knockout didn't get touched against out Jemaine sterling and he's you know he's in that position where he's climbing the ladder to and to take a short notice fight Mark Henry's very wise in that that regard they look not coaches in the world I agree you can beat this guy but do you beat this guy this way maybe but do you beat this guy when you have a long training camp much better odds and that's the way to do it to really show who you really are I agree hundred percent I wouldn't have done it if if I'm Mark Henry I'm tell my fight or not to do it it's a pro sport man it's a pro sport you have to weigh these short-term opportunities like Michael Bisping got when the when he stepped up to fight Luke Rockhold you gotta weigh those yeah cuz look Bisping it fucking paid off and it paid off in spades right he Kos Rockhold it becomes a middleweight champion the world fulfills a lifetime dream all in 11 days notice Lee the fucking man has cast-iron bowling balls hanging from his dick yeah like you can't he's the best deny that about me then but then the same thing the same mentality ass bites him in the ass and he goes in fights Kelvin Gastelum just a few days after fighting a fucking crazy fight with George st. Pierre and he doesn't look good he looked horrible then look at Machida he just got starched now he's headlining and where the fuck there did Dagestan and he not only got start she got starts in any tested positive Machida is last fight Machida tested positive result is last fight Machida Machida was suspended for something two years off I think two years he fought dick Brunson got starch right and then I K we need a main event for where the fuck it is polling or whatever and then he originally said no and then I heard he was talked into it and then who's he fighting who's he fighting Jaime cannot be fast enough here there's no way he could do both things we need to hire another dude come on man yes just while he's doing that my classes one-handed typer in the world working the fucking TriCaster one hand working the team was a high school basketball player probably would have gone D 2 T 3 right Sanders what Anders that's alright you want to see something disturbing this is uh this evidence of Jamie's basketball playing online Anders who's Anders which Anders sounds it sounds dirty but it's it was a gentlemen's name Eric and Eric Anderson to Brazil but he just got starts they singing this one well he could sell a lot of tickets in Brazil no I get that I get almost got legitimate three-point skills I watched your that video of you just hitting threes didn't need to watch this after this I was like hmm Jenni my pen the spectrum bro you have so much room let's put up a basketball court watch the shot seriously swish watch here comes the ball watch this like Youngjae ready do you understand how hard this is to do for a guy who is essentially one mess one just a slight mess look at that swish I mean get the fuck out of here Jamie are you a red array man Jamie's got real skill yeah well that those guys that are like super calm and like measured and level we're always the scariest guys to play pool with because guys like Jamie were always the guys that like they didn't get too hard and they didn't get low it was like they then they figured out how to get into that zone and they'd be terrifying yeah I bet he's that I mean I saw that that three points those shoots the shots you're making I was like okay Jamie's got that weird here I got that weird mental gear click tapped into the zone who's the pool player we met the girl the she's badass pool player she'll make you feel very uncomfortable young manhood something about losing to a chicken pool really I'm about it man pulls a man's game fuck in pool because it's about four it's this is what it's about it's about keeping your nerves together under pressure yeah so when a woman is better keeping her nerves together under pressure and guys bobble shots and miss nine balls and you're like yes there's some people that are just built for games like I did a movie with a guy who was just like you'd played I played chess with him and he was B I used to play with my dad and he's beating me so quickly and I was like what are you why are you so good he goes I'm just you know I just been playing I go all right I'm glad you read books on Jess he goes of course I went oh what's this thing we beat everybody a pool then we played pink might beat everything the games those guys just good at everything he's got he's got game theory like he noticed what my ping pong I pride myself on my ping pong I'm not good but I think I am and I'll talk a big game he noticed that my fucking that my backhand over here is a little suspect so of course he just saw a hole in my game those people who could see a hole they're strategically sounds like you play through like a fucking hole in this game but that good dad I was like play a lot of games if I saw a hole in your game I'm not gonna do that cuz I want to play the game what yeah hold on wait a minute you wouldn't try to win I don't know depending I'm gonna talk about winning give us fuck about beating usually find out the guys get a shitty half guard you tell them you don't go towards the south guard all the time when I street fight yes honestly when I Street but I'm not going into his half we've got see let me talk about street fighters might come back you talk about street fighting when I come back don't fucking shut the fuck don't talk about street fighting with me dude I take it very seriously boxing with Wayne and your friends and then when I come back fucking I'm a boxer and I and I rethink you get hit too much in the head as an older guy who does powerlifting now did you see that new thing where they said that they trained AI to play chess there's a new AI program and not only did it beat some world chess master I just I just tweeted it see if you pull that shit up but up by the way it is from the Daily Mail what you got to go mmm but it said that the that this chess computer had invented a series of moves that no one had ever seen before so it's scary it's being creative yeah it did a move it did like a pattern that no one had seen before so it's figuring out how to play on the job there's this whole movement out people are writing books on how to do their second smart machine in four hours a robot taught it self chest then beat a grandmaster with moves never devised in the games 1500 year history and the implications are terrifying yeah for sure and so what that one with a more terrifying thing besides is the fact that massive massive sections of our job markets are going away yeah look what we do Oxford academic a I could go rogue and become too complex for engineers oh my god hey what are your thoughts on net neutrality because I would talking to people online today about net neutrality yeah I posted something about it that it seems to me to be one of those ideological camp issues where if you are leaning right you think that net neutrality is a bad thing that the market should decide if you're leaning left you think that there's some regulation that the government should step in and be important because you want to keep people from information you know on a big corporation to be able to step in and say someone can or can't have their program on 18 T or Verizon or so I think I think that from what I've read there are six major service providers maybe maybe a lot more that that already smells a little bit like a monopoly but what I think is this if you and not first of all nobody really knows yet but I think that the the bigger issue becomes if these companies provide you service in your area they could decide to break in them to say to bandwidth sake and decide you want regular you want regular service or do you want premium if you want premium we're gonna pay a little more right okay that's one thing they can break it up if that's the case we'll let the market decide maybe that maybe that creates an opening for another service provider to come in and say we don't do that one price covers everything one of the guys on my Instagram or my Twitter rather had a really good point he said the real issue that people aren't talking about is the monopolies that these companies have in small areas yes like if you're in a certain town like you can only get this kind of company or and you know that's what I'm saying yeah and that when you have a company that owns a certain town and then you know and in certain areas is the only way you can get coverage is you have to do with this one company then then it becomes a real issue and not only does it become an issue but the other issue is that the real question is if you are a service provider and you provide people in this area that service if the other service has if you use platforms that the other service provides and they compete directly with this would this service block that would this service have an incentive to slock your access to it or wherever and that would be an issue but my feeling is that we'll find out very quickly and as long as consumers have the ability to go over to another provider as long as consumers have the ability to go I don't like the way you do business I want but they don't summit a lot of area license they have a license in a certain a certain district consumer backlash is how you fight that if there's enough consumer backlash and people who just net neutrality in place and prevent it you know yeah I mean it's just I'm gonna have some experts on to talk about it soon in the future I'm going over all the data and information but I just wanted to get people's temperature and it's so funny how people get so aggressive and shitty with you when you talk about this issue I guess a few people that I had a mutant I was like good luck dude yeah I'm your opinion mean shit to me because you just have to be insulting when someone's just asking a question right you know this this whole thing is is interesting because there's smart people on both sides of it and they have compelling arguments on both sides of it yeah and I don't I don't have an opinion 100% I know a lot of people don't yet know how this cuz this is gonna play out yeah because you know you say though you lean towards what I lean towards the idea that you have to have some oversight do you have to have someone who's looking out who makes sure that these companies can't fuck you over and can't prevent you from having access to certain information certain sites I lean towards that most but the answer the other the other exercise though that does the market decide that was right the other oversight could be i always lean toward the idea that the marketplace would be your oversight let people make their choice but they have to have a choice unless you were talking about there are very few service providers my question is is there incentive for other people to come into the service providing space can they make money what are the barriers to entry drugs right now and secondly secondly is it in these service providers interest ultimately to make extra cash for such bad press you may see nothing happen as a result but I like the idea that the marketplace that that consumers have a choice when consumers have a choice they're gonna go with what works the best for you I do too but I do believe that it's entirely possible that large corporations could have real influence over the way our culture has access to information I think that should be stopped but I also think that these fucking government organizations almost all suck they're all filled with unmotivated people who suck at their job and the bureaucracy and the fucking red tape gets deeper and thicker I think almost every government organization that does any task is flawed so the idea that we should have government take care of these issues I have a problem with that too you see both sides of it I see this side too there's another dark side of the marketplace though you know I think the news nowadays you know makes a lot of on clickbait yeah and and so you you now have companies whether it's the Huffington Post or CNN or whatever who are less interested it seems an objective reporting of the news and way more interested in generating clicks did you feel fun you know Newsweek title that they put out about Trump and the Nazis like stealing Christmas did you see that there you can find it what is that I'm already intrigued you know infotainment Newsweek which what you would always say they're met they have to compete that's what it is they have to compete but you'd always think they're measured their intelligent this is Newsweek what wouldn't is respected when when Christmas their death when Christmas was working on a bit how Trump and the Nazis stole Christmas to promote white nationalist fuckin slow down yeah this is justice air you're gonna get Caitlyn Jenner elected president if you keep this shit up exactly look you have to understand what's happening here people are gonna go nuts the media's rating the opposite according to some polls the media's approval rating is in the single digits and I think they deserve it I really do III am not nearly as cynical as a lot of people but as I get older and I see how irresponsible a lot of the news is how much money there is to be made by just just hinting or sort of you know associating somebody's name with something you had a volatile sure of their environment like they're dealing with what gets a responsible it gets clicks so our request our societies are the ones who are telling them to do this they're not just making this shit that's right right they're like well if we if we say Trump the Nazis stole Christmas how many clicks are really good see but this is what they're doing is they're being they're being disingenuous here in this article scroll up a little bit because here's one of the things it says it says Donald Trump wants America to think he reinvented Christmas we can say Merry Christmas again he has said on numerous occasions both during the campaign of President and presidency Christmas is back better than ever before he told supporters month before the Christmas season hawk is doing what a guy who's very persuasive does to try to get people on his camp he's a fuckin politician a sense of humor but it's not even true but what what he's doing here is not even true because he in the past did a lot of tweets about happy holidays happy I like people pulled them up that he used to say happy holidays all the time very really recently yeah was tweeting happy holidays and then the idea that Obama never said Merry Christmas is 100% horseshit there's a whole video of Obama saying Merry Christmas Merry Christmas over in Australia Christmas nothing wrong with it this idea is he's trying to sell people on the idea that you your Christian values have been suppressed by this mediocre left-wing government and he's stepping in here to make America great again it's all a hustle yeah but it's not white nationalists and Nazis like you can't say Nazis the problem is when you say that you leave that the word Nazi loses its fuckin meaning yeah there are irresponsible journalists they're not journalists they're irresponsible yeah what he's doing is he's being a fucking politician he's being a weasel he's trying to pretend that Christmas was never we know we never had Christmas before we're gonna have Christmas now and all the dopes all the yokels you know this guy's out there with make America great again tattoos you just understand this this is real like there's people with like red hat tattoos would say make America great again ah there's dummies but every fucking quadrant is earth but do you know that I have to say that the the mainstream media and I'm I know I've never been a fan of Trump but the way they treat him with this kind of stuff that I constantly hear this petty shit the way drinks water and so it's me it's made me more sympathetic g12 diet cokes might be truer I don't believe it you know there's another bunch series of quotes from him from back in the day saying why would you drink diet coke to drink diet coke people drink diet coke or also I'll fat diet coke makes you fat it's been proven there's a whole series of tweets yeah like he might've just forgot he made those tweets well he shred just doesn't give a try to just in great shape yeah but I think that you know first of all he as a president here's a weird one there was a terror attack that was thwarted by the FBI in San Francisco you didn't hear a goddamn peep about it because he's against the FBI because this all this investigation shit so the president in the United States didn't it didn't like congratulate the FBI didn't tell the American people that the FBI does great job I know but I know about the terrorist acts rewarded a legitimate terrorist act and this is all this whole make America great again stuff right you want to stop the terrorists he is a political point he avoided this okay is that terrible arrest man suspected applauding Isis inspired Christmas terror attack in San Francisco is a Marine who would you know started going crazy yeah yeah well it's just very it's very crazy yeah and how about he started the economy started to like like Isis post on Facebook and then he reached out to Isis and went hey looking to complete this mission how do I get a hold of the guns and bullets nice is like homeboy if you have to ask for the gear might not be for you asshole get out of here on your truck as you pull up make it super obvious every time I've been pier 39 I've been there every time I go to San Francisco I always think that I'm always like I don't think like that well a lot of people though have been making this comment on why did the president not discuss this like well this is something that like when you address the nation you have to talk about it and even if he's in some sort of a squabble with one aspect of the FBI you have to recognize that they did their job here yeah this is why there's a great job yeah and this is why they're important like the literally protected American lives and he's not mentioning it yeah that they do when they're saying things like how Trump stole Christmas with white nationalists and Nazis that paid that kind of petty shit enforces his petty shit yeah they it's in a way of real news it can they go at it they go at each other back and forth and nothing gets done so nice grill the fuck gum it should be the president but he was weak she needs to grow the fuck up to you can't say things like that that's silly we should be able to rely on the mainstream news and I know I'm gonna get a lot of emails about the main Eddie Bravo was calling you I know we should be a little you should rely on them to at least report the facts yeah at least objective facts that was a whole point of journalism they were the Fourth Estate they keep they keep power in line they hold they speak truth to power that's the whole idea in a democracy you need a free press you need but now with money ratings it has corrupted well there's also many greats the Omegas the fucking internet man the internet came along and pretty much anybody can be a new source now anybody can be a hashtag journalist there's a lot of fuck change the game up yeah change the game up can choose to get spread its acedia pages I was saying this the other day I was trying to remember writing something about this but like the idea that you in social media if you we all have moments where we do some crazy shit where we say stuff out loud that's like politically incorrect or we say well we just behave in a way that like you could make you crazy right yeah like my my dog ran into my knee the other day as like I fuck it hurt and I instinctively kicked out it's just like fucking and I kick and I missed her but dude it looked like I tried to kick my fucking dog in the ribs cuz by the way in that mid split second I was trying to kick my dog who I love very much in the road for she hit my knee like my gosh is anything wrong with giving your dog a little knee tap correct if somebody camera somebody to shove if so many company on camera yeah I mean a dog in the ribs listen I'm just saying somebody it caught on a camera it would have been Bryan Callen and if I was if I was famous they'd be like I say I was a politician wherever I'm fuck I'm done I'm the dog yeah but I'm saying that nowadays and I was thinking about this nowadays anything that you do if you're having a moment if you're ever tomorrow or you make a mistake I by moment dopey I think that'll be careful with hold on I'll tell you you're making a mistake I don't know it could be give me example it could be you got caught at a strip club you were making out with a girl behind a dumpster but you're married whatever it might be there are a lot of examples where everybody's fuck-ups like my buddy my buddy say like Kevin Hart situation is fine hold on oh my my buddy my buddy who owns buildings he gets sued all the time and what he does is he'll just hire a private investigator and he he just follows the dude you'll just follow the pursuing him yeah and and I go why he said he goes well because everybody he's ever followed because everybody is always fucking up in one aspect of their life well especially someone was sleazy who tries he's like you leave him that lawsuit yes he always finds evidence that they're just there doing something I got a girlfriend I got a boyfriend what it's always something but you're fine B's lately so let's say in a hypothetical situation you were Tina and wife who came out here's the larger fund the larger point is this I was thinking about like how I was taking Gandhi Martin Luther King Hemingway Picasso and Einstein Oh dirtbags all known known philanderers known to cheat on their wives just known there they're poor why I mean and and just real real ladies men and and beyond how about Kennedy you know everybody wants to keep talking about how Bill Clinton got caught yet manacle Lewinsky there was a woman who came out it was like one of the aides in the White House who was she was 19 Kennedy made her suck his dick she fuck and so what I'm saying is that in the day in the days of social media now we would have dilated on that and we looked at that he couldn't is that what we want to focus on because with those men let's just take those men they could have been discredited and cut out at the knees depending on when that that activity was exposed okay technology mind everything they were working but hold on isn't it possible that we need to have a more realistic understanding of what a human being yes and then seeing all these flaws in a person and then getting past that is maybe the way to go yes so a the Europeans too but our problem is that we're dealing with this old model where everybody was like some fucking Cary Grant doing a movie and you know the good guys were white hats the bad guys wear black hats that's not real is it's not realistic that's American isn't it isn't it an American because it hasn't been exposed and we don't have a new realization of what human beings are and so isn't all of this excruciating detailed information that comes out about anybody that's seeking power is that ultimately like a good thing to see like oh he's like me I know I'm fuck up he's like me oh that guys like me too so instead of thinking there's some person some Dali Lama guy who's gonna come save us or the one guy on the planet doesn't have any vices yeah instead of that maybe we should have a more honest interpretation of what it means to be compassionate understanding that sometimes were you know Jordan Peterson said something fucking amazing to me he goes he goes we're ruled by different gods depending on the the moment a time of day we're ruled by the god of sex the god of jealousy the god of anger of the god of resentment just depends on the moment which is argument for an overreaching God but I want my president to be better than me you know I'm saying I don't want him to see ya held to the higher standard gonna be better than you anyway there's just because they have the same flaws that you have doesn't mean they're not better you than running the government if he has a drug addiction these fucking hookers non-sharp on the side I don't want them running my country help me the mayor Toronto like Rob Ford did a great job boys mayor Toronto smoking crack Clinton wasn't bad either point of view of what human beings are and I think we've lost it I think we're Americans you think people are being held accountable more though be like this actual like bad do to are like ah it's out there's good and bad to this well I'm just I just hope that we come back around the fact that human beings are complicated that we're all fucking up that it just because I fuck them this atmospheric doesn't mean I'm a bad person all the way through Trevor Noah said something that was interesting he said I when I understand about Americans is how you can't be both things why do you have to be one thing or another you gotta have a black eye that can you be is it possible to put to the test to sympathize with a black lives matter and also be procom can you can you have both cos it only picks teams we pick teams teams that way well Kerri trying to pick teams for sure so it's an instinct that we have I think we are getting better at understanding what a human being is and I think to equate Harvey Weinstein with finding flaws and politicians is very different I agree because what he's doing he was doing was essentially he was not just that he was he was like that was part of how he engineered his business yeah he engineered his business to like feed his sexual harassing and sexual assault appetizer entree but that's going on I think in other corporations just not in entertainment so that I think so he did girls had to fuck him to get parts yeah I think I don't think so I I think with our and there's print in there's pretty girls I think men are going to abuse that power if you think Harvey Weinstein in that position of powers they only got to do that you're crazy nobody beat in our hearts women are also drawing the power right so I like how you guys try to either be like your fucking fifteen-year-old kids in Brooklyn because we're a couple of cuties see and I agree that it's scary but I think it's a witch hunt only four witches man it doesn't bother me I got these guys get turn them no no no you can't say that because a witch hunt is that the witch hunt is also like based on hearsay and accusation and not proof so you you f do props for some yes for some you have to have due process that's all ooh we all know that we live now at a time when just accusations can ruin your entire career well I mean I've you know Park you examples B whose career has it ruined that was it true I don't garrison keillor garrison kill is a good example Garrison Keillor's the best example is a guy like his entire career he's been known as this like super nice guy soul someone hugs her his hand goes down her shirt in the hearth on her back she she pulls back he apologizes he sends her a letter apologizing she accepts it they stay friends and then she goes public with it when all this me to stuff comes out she's about you yeah just get fired a chance to my name of a stale Franken to Cal Franken admitted he did some shit that he shitting it on and grab some butts and you know see out yeah it's almost a better point I think I'll I and all the Democrats now I have in in Minnesota are having second thoughts he shouldn't retire hey you fucking guys you'd mobbed up on Twitter like a little proportion we need that most we though you're talking about such a large number of these some national guard up because it's naturally in there there yeah fucking behavior path there needs to be a national narrative on where the line is to a lot of people know whether like I know where the line is you know where the line is to me like if you don't want something and I'm humiliating you or embarrassing you and and if I did that because I'm an idiot then then I got to make amends and figure out what I did wrong you're 100% right but we have to understand what you're saying when you're saying the line the line includes free speech and free speech for 320 million people is gonna leave an exorbitant amount of human beings to feel like they should gang up on everybody anytime something goes sideways yeah and that's what you see and that's what you feel and I've been to media companies react to that because they don't want blowback they don't want boycotts so they step in and fire because they shouldn't get fired but I also think in the workplace it's scary even for me there's a female come tonight we're on the lineup and you know I'm in a fashion I'm almost too gay with it but she had this dope coat on I thought about I said something out of coat like oh fuck was that - like it was like - Ford with her about a coat like I'm scared of it right you gotta be careful there's a male in the room and I was like dude where'd you get that coat from where time out coat right I saw hers and the shoes about to go onstage is like you're not I love your coat that coat is dope and I grabbed her like our mother oh are you gonna like blast out cease your intentions your intentions are only like you really do love fashion and you see a really nice coat like oh that is nice like you really like the way I would look at a nice car yes wait what about what about if a woman's beautiful and I go you are you are fucking European you can't do that is the way you do it the way do it you just are aggressive now we're about the gas in your crotch crotch oh yeah yeah you take the tape shape of a letter C that's weird why do you think that's my sister I'd want to punch in the face Phebe out in the workplace too like you can't if the girl was a pretty dress I saw a comic tweet out can't can't a girl wear a dress without being fucking complimented on it like fuck man without being compliment yeah what you mean like can't we just dress up and you can't say a word like you'll see guys saying hey nice tie I can't women come in the office and not get remarks fuck that's the world were living in man you can't say man you look great today I said we're confusing this you what you're saying is can't a woman come into the office and get remarks get positive remarks no I'll be a good no posit like can't can't can't a man not say anything about a woman the way she looks in the office place can't she just be enough she was gay a woman was asking yeah a woman goes can't can you guys just not calm yes well you want to compliment somebody there's also the reality and this is something that I've been talking about in my act a lot there's a reality of the way women are allowed to dress both on television and in real life in office situations where they expose enormous swaths of skin which men are not if men in the office we're wearing skirts and you could see their toes and they had sleeveless shirts and this is common yeah this is commonplace and there's nothing wrong with it there's nothing inappropriate about it and I'm not I'm not commenting on it like criticizing it but the reality of the way women are allowed to dress like if you watch megyn kelly on television she's especially during the fox news days and she's the ice princess she wore these very small dresses that looked like she was going out for a hot night on the town Jamie bring that up for a second it's not a bad thing man no it's not there's videos that just show women on fox news criss crossing and uncrossing their legs and then dangling their shoes off their weddings in la sun everywhere so girls the girls who dress like that should be allowed a dress any fucking way they want but there is a reality of the way they're dressing that is way more sexually suggestive than anything that a man is allowed to wear there's not a sexual equality when it comes to wardrobe when it comes to wardrobe in an office if every woman dressed like Barbara Walters in the 1980s a more fucking pantsuit and you know I had like one of those big collars on and shit like dressed like Ellen like every woman was like Ellen this is why all that should be in burkas but that is what that outfit that Ellen outfit is basically like a female version what men wear when men are on television they were a suit jacket there were there were pants wasn't there also a truth to how men naturally are drawn to women in certain outfits I mean like men are more visual to alter the face of a woman who's given you she's a serious journalist yeah she's so and that was back when she was like way hotter I have no problem with that she's probably the one is gay go in the upper right hand corner upper right hand corner in that series that the her at all she's stupid hot right ridiculous all sort here but imagine now imagine now Oh Don Lemon wearing that same outfit well I wouldn't look at that actually I have good legs there okay you don't know dude you've seen me in high heels you're okay Don lemons is bad you don't have good legs who you yes I yeah I just cleared up again shirt driving sore I did I I died I know I bet I think my flu cause my psoriasis I'm sure all the time we have to make sure that we let everybody know what we're saying here I'm not saying that women should be sexually harassed because they dress sex so now I'm saying if you wear something that looks nice in the office I think guys should like damn you look really good today but it's a problem because that was a girl responds to that then the guys like oh she wants the dick has to be is all about how she walks the watercooler by herself and you gotta come up to her and she's on her way to the bathroom and ask her weird question I know I know a lot of people get married in the workplace don't they have romances the workplace don't they not anymore budgetary galore brother maybe it should be but I don't know that's where a lot of like that's where you meet people oh we'll do have a bunch of people are really unhappy that's gonna make men and women unhappy puritanical I know a lot of people that especially in like the TV business that like the writer would like hook up with one of the girls who was in production and then they want to be and married and having kids it's a great story and I also know a lot where the writer would hook up with one of the girls in production and then they would break up and it would be a fucking disaster on the set and one of them would want to believe in angels take that responsibility okay you know what we're all asking for them figured on we want a higher authority a corporate nameless faceless bureaucracy troller pursue to to lay down these laws on high in stone and there are certain things you can't do no relationships whatsoever I don't never do human games awesome the workplace is gonna be fucking great America let me throw fucking happy let me throw a responsibility for managing their own their own relationships their own romance fucking fucking colleges my nephew's got to sit there in every step of the way sexually he's gotta go is this okay is this okay it's gotta get consent every time relax relax cuz I was honest everybody's big brother it's tyrannical and it's not gonna make anybody happy or safer it's all bullshit you know what people you know why you walk a girl - or a car at night not cuz men not cuz a rape culture not cuz men are dangerous because there are psychos out there because there are psychotics because 1% I think both what do you mean there's a lot of guys you gotta watch out for if you well it takes one guy in a van psychos it sometimes just a guy with a couple of drinks and it's whatever it's a man all my friends who are drunk we talked about this you know I'm dragged me rapist in jail rapist in jail have to be protected from the other inmates men who are regular guys like I was done like this no child rapists have to be protected there's a lot of guys that are in jail a party so Neal got arrested once falsely accused of rape and one of the things that he said was that when he went to jail he was worried and guys would be like not on though that's the skin beef they would call the skin beef that's not like nobody no one thinks you're a rapist is one thing if you get accused of being like some serial rapist or brain yeah but a guy who a girl they have a dispute and the girl claims the guy raped her oh it's no one wants to admit happens and it happens way less I think way more women don't report rape way more than women report false rape migration disturbed sickened they feel nice they don't even want to discuss it they would rather not be outed as someone who got raped and let this person get away with it that's a common thing with women so I think some of this hashtag sounds good but also someone in line that happens to that's a bummer but you can't you can't but they're humans they're humans we can't tailor thing towards those few negative apples no you don't but you don't tailor anything towards the idea that those apples are non-existent and impossible correct but I'm going back to the office based you're gonna always deal with false accusations you're gonna deal with people who don't report things you're gonna deal with all these things in the in the wide spectrum of humanity right I just don't think that this zero-tolerance nobody's allowed to date anybody because we don't want to and that's where we're at that's what happens I did I don't really we talked about on our show and I never even thought about - we're at the Comedy Store when I told that girl nice coat on it oh fucking creep wait cuz she's young you know she's 21 back to blazing comet got a piss get the fuck out of here nephew one more fuckin this is nephew I don't know he's gonna some school I just can't talk you know dopey we'll be right back Jesus Christ man he gets on you two are like an old married couple hilarious yeah I want to kill him someday but I think we're talking too much about sexual harassment I agree and I think people people will shut it down you know what the problem is with sexual harassment too is you it's everywhere so they don't wanna fuckin hear it here either well people are trying to work it out I think that's one of the important things about talking about it but the problem is men are talking about it like we don't know jack shit about it like I said I don't really do that deal with it and we don't but here's the thing like no one's coming at us with it like I've only had gay guys hit on me aggressively a couple times ever my and we did tried sucking my dick I felt on good that's Andy Dick I was just kidding by the way he tried but he's awesome yeah I had a comic once at the Montreal Comedy Festival like late at night when we're all hanging around the bar get super aggressive with me really yeah yeah super way back in the day this was like I want to say like late 90s real uncomfortable moment where I'd tell him get the fuck away from my bigger dude to get some problems it wasn't like a physically threatening thing I literally told him I would stop a fucking hole in his chest if he touched me did it work yeah no it worked yeah no I was serious he was drunk and it wasn't it was one of those weird moments where someone's like being sexually aggressive they think it's funny and then then they try to take it to the next level to show you how crazy they are hey bro I was like you do not touch me like this and then I realize like oh this is what it's like when you're a woman I'll accept the woman can't kill the guy no like I'm dealing with a doughy drunk comedian that I could kill yeah if you tried anything just whoop his ass where women don't have words they don't have that option at all and it's not funny they weren't you know with a woman it's not a funny situation with me it's like what's funny it was never like I was nervous but it was like god this is gross well I think you look at it different too because you have two daughters I do now didn't that I'm saying now you do it's like you do that just having children you you look at people so differently because children are so vulnerable and when you have a little kid and you see that little kid trying to make your way through the world you think about them being victimized by some sort of an evil predator and it's fucking awful it's a terrible feeling it's it's a it's a weird thing that we have to reconcile the fact that some people do prey on other people's vulnerabilities and weaknesses and do Boyett oh yeah boy girl I'm looking for a new nanny and you hear all these horrible stories about nannies and the molest kids so it's the last kids I do not play there's some horrible videos of nannies like lifting kids up and throwing him against their crib and you can't watch on three sick they're so infuriating you know one kid was all fucked up and bruised and the parents put this fucking camera and they caught the lady picking the kid up by his arms and literally throwing him the room and you watch it just like oh my god tough for me not to go to prison if I came home and saw that you really throw so tough I'm sorry some more self-control a lot of people it'd be so tough oh yeah you know a joke you know they say they gave they gave rise to the helicopter parent phenomenon and one of the things they talk about like how students are so entitled and they became sort of like this idea that they can say anything they want and you know that's sort of the whole movement of my personal serenity is everything from home one of the one of the theories would be that in the 80s when kids started disappearing and you started reading about it on the back of - all of us as parents as human beings like there's nothing worse right you can't think of anything worse and that created this I every parent your biggest fear right so now you go I'm not letting my kid take his bike down to the neighbors because it might only be six hundred yards but Johnson Gacy might be waiting always happened actually but it was you know now people say remember when we used to be able to play out there it's always happened but we we started learning about it people start establishing patterns about it then we had like certain serial killers like John Wayne Gacy and and Ted Bundy and stuff like that and we do that dogs bullets twice in my own life dodged a bullet or that's when I was about eight years old and again when I was about 13 you mean dodged a bullet you mean guys are trying to fuck me what yeah yeah a guy tried to take me out of a library when I was a little kid then librarian starts yelling out he was gonna show me these books in his car and the librarian start yelling out Joseph you get away from him that guy just got out of jail and I'm flying out of there Wow and then another time when I was 13 some guy like literally tried to get closer and closer to me and my friends he would jog around this lake that we would fish act sit down and talk to us seemed like a super nice guy and then it got creepier and weirder until one day showed up drunk he told me he loved me and that no love could be you can't have love without sex and I was like why oh man and I was 13 and I was I was a skinny kid I was hiding you know we were in this area of this pond where it's like he's not a lot of people yeah he's a man grown at a big man too once and there's you know I'm waiting for a jogger to come by and catch this guy fucking me in the ass and the bushes like what do i do so what'd you do I told him get the fuck away from me I put my hand in my pocket where I had a knife I held onto the network as if I could never a 13 year old cut that dick though maybe if you didn't grab your arms first I wasn't strong me I was super volt but my point is I got lucky and dodged two bullets in my life yeah and they weren't bad bullets it wasn't like some guy chloroformed me and threw me in a van fucking ass for a month that's scary but it's it's not worst case scenario but it was enough to know that those things are real and they're out there there's a lot of my buddy my buddy got from the age of 9 to 12 this guy was just this master manipulator and he ended up like getting essentially raped from 9:00 to 12:00 and he was their neighbor he was like he lived he was like probably 25 or whatever and he lived and he did work around a place and he what he was really good at was he got my friend to like he created a sympathetic character so my friend felt like he was like I had I was having something cuz I feel like I was taking care of him otherwise he would die if I didn't like he was yes we put all the stuff on him and then what happened was he went to all that his mother like they found out his mother said you did nothing wrong but they didn't know they fucking this in the 70s Mills early 80s they go through the whole thing of the guy I think went to jail but it was later it was later that that trauma began officer itself like later on and he was never really he's never know he's got to be feeling gross dirty and just you hate yourself yeah like he when he is he gay no but he's not gay but he was never able to I don't want to say too much cuz you know he's he's I haven't talked to him all time but he was I was close to him you might have known I think I've told you a little bit about him he would paint there was a great painter I have some of his paintings in my home and he was such a great special guy but he would know but he would paint the same thing over and over again and he never ever painted anything a different variation applause yes good yeah well you know I go back though humans need to pay attention to the worst aspects of our behavior and one of the things that Jordan Peterson has said that I think is incredibly important is what scares us the most about Nazis and murderers and Psychopaths and rapists is we are all human and giving the right set of circumstances with the right set of input and the right set of genetics and the right set of environments and the right set of life experiences and the right set of abuse in the household growing up you could be that person too and enjoy it yes when you talk to neuroscientists and and people that are actually studying how the human brain develops and one of the things that Robert Sapolsky said when I had him on the podcast was a really fascinating thing he said that I think in the future we are going to look back at the idea of punishing someone for their actions as being so incredibly short-sighted in foolhardy because what this person is when you even think about the concept of determinism right the concept of everything in your life has led you to be who you are right now and your your idea of free will is essentially an illusion your free will is based on so many different factors that you have no control over and they influence you to such a great such a great deal the idea that this person who's in this terrible situation that does this terrible crime is just acting out of evil intentions is is it's a foolish way of understanding how the human brain develops yeah what you say how would you treat those people it's a very good question and no one answered back in the day when somebody had an epileptic seizure you were you were thought to have been possessed by a demon if you hit somebody they would they would you would be held accountable that but what I thought was fascinating is World War one Dan Carlin talks about this as well in World War one when they didn't know what kind of concussion the bombs and their concussion would do to a soldier over and over and sleep deprivation living in those trenches and what happened was some people would just begin to go into shock they would get shell-shocked and so you could see them their bodies would start to constrict and they couldn't really move but back in the day those guys would be brought out and shot for cowardice because they were being cowards they weren't and could see their bodies actually manifesting right well here's the thing two of like the problem with drafting an army or requiring people to sign up you know we're making it some sort of a cultural mandate is there's some people that are just not designed for Laurel they can't handle pressure know there's a lot of people that just can't handle fucking pressure period and for whatever reason whether it's biological whether its environmental whether it's a combination of nature and nurture who knows but there's some people that just as of right now they're they just can't do it it's not the pressure so there's also there's injury there's also more constant yeah sleep deprivation injury that nobody can handle right and the shock of impacts near you yeah you know there's there's a lot that happens to people on the bed not you know obviously the psychological trauma of it all and knowing that at any any step you could step on a landmine any step you catch a bullet in the head any step yeah well Jordan said something else he's helped people with PTSD when they come back from a war and they were from Iowa and they had a very sort of linear notion of first of all the military I want to be I want to be a man I want to I want to I want to do the right thing duty honor loyalty these linear concepts of course you get into war and all of that gets shattered sometimes it might even get mocked just because there's did the fog of war there's so many things you do and some of these guys end up doing things that are to them or because of the circumstance maybe inexplicably cruel or just they did something that they can't live down and he would always kind of help them see that human beings being the bipolar ape that we are are capable of incredible kindness and in beautiful construction and of course on the other side of that you have in you the ability to do unspeakable violence and terrible destruction for its own sake and oh by the way in the moment to enjoy it that's being a human being we're fucking complicated men that's also how we got here yes the only way you get from the wild apes swinging for the fuck through the fucking trees in the jungle to 2017 with your Tesla driving you down the street without you even touching the steering wheel the only way you get to that is through aggression yeah I mean it sounds crazy but you get to that through aggression and competition because if you don't have those that ability to survive you're not gonna get past the Jaguars you're not gonna get past the the invading tribes you're not gonna get so you don't need that today I'm not saying you need it today but the only reason why we got out of those terrible situations is because we had the ability to become that monster that defends itself or that monster that attacks for its own interests that's literally what facilitated us developing yeah and also the fact that development requires a certain amount of destruction in in terms of like I did this podcast with him I'm gonna drop soon on mixed mental arts and we he said something because somebody who wrote this article is woman a professor wrote this article about how certain speech is violent because when you say something that I disagree with her that hurts my sensibilities it puts me in a state of stress and that would be violence because I and so Jordan said fine let's extrapolate for a second yes it's true that words can pierce your heart I mean he said I'd rather get punched in the face you got to hear him say but but he said essentially the problem is it what what about six months down the line if I am trying to get help you grow and become a better person I see a fundamental flaw in your behavior in your character and I tell you if you have bad breath and you can't get a date I go dude your breath could melt pain at first it's gonna be fucking embarrassing to you but you're gonna thank me six months down the line when you did something about it more importantly if you say somebody do you want to be I see you try to be this whether it might a great comic you don't write you're not disciplined whatever it might be you don't want to hear about the truth the truth and sometimes you have a set of beliefs sort of you built your house around this set of like sort of an ideology you think you're the truth as somebody comes along with a different idea a different point of view that shatters those walls and man you don't like it you want to go back to your safe space but good luck growing you don't get closer to the truth by fucking saying you're you're causing vibe I think the real problem with this is that these people are not trying to grow the people that are trying to change the definitions of words to suit their own intentions they don't want the opposition and it's not by chance do the same people that support Marxist ideologies they don't want competition they want a lack of competition they think competition is bad Thanks yeah there's a lot of that out there Lori says they're not good at it because they don't want to face that ultimate objective view of who they really are and their actual capabilities they'd rather get a bunch of fucking weird social justice brownie points for a bunch of weird things and you know there's something so a lot of that there's a lot of that yeah you're gonna and you could see those patterns in the way those people talk they have very specific ways of talking you can point out very specific things that they say things that they talk about there they're gonna be the first to talk about white privilege they're gonna be the first to talk about you know trans rights and all these different there's a wet and there's a way of talking an actual pattern that the way they communicate your words are violence there's no there's literally a pattern that they've adopted a predetermined pattern of behavior of thinking the ideology and in the way that communicates so they all know that they're on the same team yeah it's called owning your impact your verbal in back yeah and there's there's a there's a pattern to the way the noises come out of their mouths it's fascinating because they're so they're so uniform it's so common to hear these people talk the same way when Jordan Peterson got in this debate on television with this it looks like a man and I say it in the same way that they in them or you know pronouns I don't mean to be negative I don't know what if this is a man or a woman because she's clean he's clearly uber feminine but has a beard and says there's no biological difference in gender I'd be happy to unpack that for you and it's like yeah oh XY chromosomes see if you can find that see if you could fuck just find that guy saying - Jordan Peterson it was noble faces for gender they were trying to force him under penalty of law and fine or whatever and and jail to use to not use someone's preferred pronoun which I would do just because I don't want to hurt somebody's feelings but they're trying to pass it as also if you didn't use sir or whatever you would be bunch of fake gender pronouns there and event rice is in Toronto yes you'd be tried for you'd be tried for hate speech and that's where we had you know with the communist they always communism was a true religion in the Soviet Union and they had essentially clergymen people who were sort of you know the purest form of a priest the idea that somebody would go around and check with the soldiers to make sure that their piety that their allegiance to the Communist cause was intact and they'd ask you questions these are other cultures having these problems were these human certainties you coming up and all that stuff you mean it's happening in America I'm sure it's probably different ways happening like Europe in Brazil in the 20th century it was called fascism it was called communism human beings love religion we're all religious and if you and if there's there are man-made religions and religions that are you know at least afford to be from on high at least with on high religions they're rather fixed it seems that man-made religions tend to be more ideologies and the difference between those by the way is philosophy something that's trying to get to the truth with logic and reason and debate ideologies there's no room for debate it goes back to what you were saying there's no room for debate we have the answers ladies and gentlemen yes that is equality at all costs yeah I'd be happy to impact that for you yes yes no see if we can find that gym fighter this is this baby I can't stand the guy but but it was a bizarre conversation because it's like okay I see what you're doing you're trying to reinvent reality and there's a bunch of people that support you there's a bunch of other people that are delusional and they're also right there with you trying to reinvent reality is there a is there a huge movement like is this a big thing there's enough that people are talking about it the thing about losing my says yeah of course they are of course there's not enough people people gonna support it so many real not only that this is not like a behavior thing this is science you're talking about cromoz you're talking about gender dysphoria you're talking about all sorts of different issues that are like these are recognized actual issues that human beings have well what are these issues though are you saying there's no there's no scientific basis you're saying you can't differentiate between a male and one a man and a female that is bizarre nonsense of course you and distinction between you could make the distinction between male and female and then he and her in a way here we go yes the bald one is the one who said yeah yeah woman yeah woman the woman study yeah he's not transgender there's something going on really yeah it's not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex and I'm a historian of medicine I can unpack that for you at great I'm smoking crazy in the interest of time oh you crazy I won't so that's a very popular misconception so essentially when in my transgender studies classes what we're doing is looking at actual research and identifying ways that current social issues related to trans people or things that are associated with trans such as free speech arguments and claims paradigms and I'm sure your speech arguments a way that people are thinking the way that research has been framed the histories typically I don't focus on pronouns because pronouns are actually part of this narrative culture so what we do is learn about I'm gonna stop you right there yes good so we don't start some more okay let's kill this bra throw up to the Schism girl that's a man did he used to be a woman who's a better beard than me no that's a man no that's a man on hormone I think that's a man on a female that's on male hormone oh I disagree I think it's you know the hair lessee you know buck Angela's no buck angels a porn star that was born a woman that became a man through hormones and she was on the podcast he was on the podcast he's a he now talks exactly like that guy sounds just like I'm that guy right there that's born a woman born a woman with him on the podcast this is what I want you to hear I want you to hear the way he sounds because he sounds literally exactly like that guy like he could be doing an impression of that guy look it's all jacked and yoked and shit Longo's this ah a couple years ago I want to say there's a hundred thousand years ago two hundred thousand years ago when we were women gonna run two women had a fight two women had to stay alive women had to protect their babies and they didn't have to do it as much or often get it get to him get to have the bit smarter today's exactly and they'll be less likely to stick around and raise their children but don't they like it doesn't make sense to me the whole the whole building thing dad used to be a fireman running taking yeah let me see it but fright but here's the thing let me see some more no same voice I think that that guy is a guy who is born a woman who took male hormones just like buck angel maybe you might be fucked but the idea that there's no biological difference I don't see a naked picture so that's it but let me see the girl that's not why no no no no no that's not what I am see what is the word I'm trying to look for I got him right there that was before and after it says come on really this makes it like I feel like if if the world had fool me no definitely not but I think the world might about this like even as a kid if I saw that somebody was very effeminate or I saw that's like say somebody was like I feel like a I'm a woman but I want to be a man if I would have protected that person and more importantly I've been doing I think I would have gone out of my way to make no big deal about it and they would have been included yeah but that's not we're not talking about you what am I talking about that sort of conversation is a nonsense conversation and this is going on over and over and over again because those people weren't called Erik Weinstein was on my podcast when Stein sorry yeah not like Harvey Weinstein Erik Weinstein brother Bret Weinstein was on my podcast and he said here's how you know when you're in a cult when you hear there is no biological difference between men and women you're in a cult come colleges today you hang it left and right in a major major called major universities in America yes in America they're teaching this and people are afraid to correct them what they're afraid to say anything different about it and and that's exactly right and and in fact if you even say Jenna dysmorphia it was because for you this for esri was considered a mental illness for a long time even to suggest that that may be a subset of the population maybe we just it's worth it wouldn't have a child yes maybe well if you have a child who's thinking of themselves I there are people Hollywood actors that are having their children I from what I have heard haven't seen this what I've heard from people that I know their kids are going through they're getting horribly I think there's more mone blockers oh and Ben Jian got in a shitload of trouble for talking about a guy who has a three year old that's that he's putting through hormonal blockers and he was talking about how fucking insane this is people were borrowing on Benjamin from war are you kid this trial develop you talk to any legit doctors who know anything about they go really we should be doing anything to your past 21 so we should be doing anything then if you want to do it yes frontal cortex does not even fully develop for 25 to 25 yeah but they said that there's some kids that at a very young age are very adamant about the fact they were born in the wrong body and some of them you go well it makes sense yeah so it's like who's right and who's wrong and when do you decide but here's when you don't decide 3:3 is crazy 3 is crazy 3 he should be put in jail there's something wrong with our culture where we think that that's a good idea to interfere with the hormonal system of a very complex thing through human being 3 that becomes this sort of this this the thing to do if there was a thing that the CDC would who is what is the Canadian Broadcasting Network CBC they didn't want to talk about a story and I'd tweeted this a while back to this they didn't they didn't want to have a story on about transgender children because they showed that 85% of the kids that wanted to be trans after a couple years changed their mind there was a giant percentage of these kids that went through a phase you know Ruby Rose that famous actress I think she's a lesbian just got it's really pretty she was in that um John wick 2 movie she said that when she was young that she have thought about being trans and she's really happy that she didn't actually go through it with the hormones and every you know she realizes this is just you know she just doesn't fit in and a lot of people don't they don't fit into what society has in line for them in terms of a man or a woman this binary one or zero this old-school I think that makes sense too I also think a lot of the the activism came out of a good place which was that a lot of 40 percent of people who have trans trans morphia what is it just for you gender dysphoria you got to get that ready 40 percent Abby you know but that's the thing you know suicide well here's the thing you know dude by the way it doesn't have anything to do whether or not they have hats or I heard that after they had the surgery it doesn't it doesn't actually change them in that no it does but the question is is it are they depressed because they haven't been accepted accepted as who's who they really are my society is yeah and how society caused them to have these irreparable scars and that's what's led them to commit suicide the ultimately will accept and it wasn't fixed by the surgery is that possible - is it possible that we could be more accepting as a society and as a culture and then these people could just be whoever the fuck they want to be and that's alright - and maybe we would have a lower suicide rate if it wasn't thought of with this this great stigma but you're not gonna fix that by having people like that go on TV and say something that's a blatant scientific lock like I sick in the head like I should not be educating young minds and people coming out of those crazy thousands of people that you're coming out adopting we know what call it cheesy they rebel against their parents and their parents might be some fucking right-wing square-jawed knucklehead you know that has some stupid ideas about what a man is and what a woman is and it is and God says man should not look dude studios and directors get massive heat for not having transgender actors you know and stars and all that and there's this index how many lines did women say versus how many lines and men how many female strong characters are you know we just thought piers but here's the thing you know about this cover with all these women they were talking about inclusivity about is it on time no I think it's an affair different it's a different magazine society it was all white I don't know but it's all why don't you know what it's all it's all white women like what how is this diversity like you're all white women you're not even playing by your own rules they got a lot of shit for it they should get a lot of shit for it what the fuck let that slip through like what alright what message are you trying to send you said you're saying is an anti mail message because you thought you're a bunch of white women yeah but you know dude now you're getting into this my favorite fucking favorite new discipline which is intersection esteem anism don't know traditional is the best so when when when there was a feminist movement really began with white women yeah I think it started in the Women's Studies department or at least the literature party a university is that and they did some work man those women were serious and and you can't say that the founders movement didn't have something to say and that's some work to do of course it did smart women were like I don't fucking want to be you know there are some issues and disparity but what happens with any movement is that it's like well we're white women what about black women they they have it way worse than we do move oh and what about and we can just keep extrapolating what about black women with allergies black women with lupus how about what about black women who come from really poor and violent areas versus black we're gonna come from a better area what about black women who are midgets there do you keep I know little person small pee you can just keep doing it so I said hop sorry buddy got the top at the top of the sort of power structure now the inverted power structure is people that are the most oppressed they're the voices that have to be heard the most the problem with breaking this down into all these sections is you get ultimately to because when they had this huge christine summers talks about this they had this huge intersection esteem inist sort of congregation where all these women got together but in the group when they were meeting in the convention or they started breaking up they start bringing the group oh they were breaking up they're like well we have allergies so we're not over there and by the way you're black but you you're white you're a feminist but you date your white black feminist but you also you date a white woman sorry you're a little more privileged you gotta go yeah so it became this it became one click after another that's crazy that women become clicky that's a crazy thing I've ever heard you want to know my favorite story guards let me just finish the story the problem with that movement is it as you keep extrapolating you get to what's called the individual the founding fathers figured that out a long time ago ultimately you're gonna get down to the fact that you should treat everybody as the same as an individual I like it as an individual that's the whole point that's that yes you can keep going but if you keep playing that game you're just gonna get down everybody is different everybody has something everybody is a white dude my buddy David Lee has a spine like this and he's he's gonna die unless he gets an operation his life sucks he's about that big his email is no neck Dave I said I love him he's fucking hilarious Dave ollie but Dave is white he ain't privileged he came from a Mormon family a large family he wasn't you know his life has not been fucking easy he can't breathe so you can keep extrapolating that's why you treat people as individuals cuz you don't know anything about them you actually don't know anything about what they've gone through it could be a great looking guy sleeve tag it's a nonsense conversation yeah because what they're really trying to do is establish power structure yes and they want to have power over the rest of the people in the group because they apparently have more things that are going against the house my favorite story is there was a all-girls College and this woman is running for like president student council and she decides that she's a male she decides to change her gender the best and then the fucking kids she's get an operation no no she just decided she was masculine of center of center gender queer was how she described herself car but decided to change her name to a male's name then the women in the school were voting against her because she is now a white man and the white man is the patriarchy and she it was the result prejudice diversity or something like that like some student council it becomes of course massive diversity did she go back I do not know I do not know somebody sent me something about that how somebody said something about colleges have become these specialize their specialize in subjects that have increasing irrelevance yeah it's it's a weird thing man I think people automatically have this desire to stand out and be more important they automatically do this is like a common thing and they can do it through merit but merit it's difficult meritocracies are hard you might fall short yes and sometimes you in along the way you see your meritocracy like not working out for you you'll claim there's some sort of a conspiracy against you and there might be you know cute claims other people have privilege and they might you'll claim all these reasons why you're not getting ahead yeah you might be right you might be right in some ways well because colleges are like discerning a lot of comics not doing the tour's anymore before a lot of comics were doing car stopped way before this I stopped into colleges in the early 2000s for that very really for that reason you were just way too sensitive and they didn't have life experience the problem talking to people that have bills and jobs and people relationships it didn't work out so good another fucking kid but some lady who hates them that's my crowd [Laughter] spending their fucking money trying to figure out what they're doing in their life they want to talk about marriage my favorite meritocracies are how you you find out who's real who really deserves it you don't do colleges anymore either do you they don't I don't it's just not a smart thing to do because those people in those colleges are they're very very young you're dealing with 19 year olds 20 year olds and they're in this weird ideological bubble you know there's always fucking people that are just jammed in together in this group and everybody's trying to stand out in weird and unique ways and there's people that are doing it by claiming they're masculine of sender genderqueer and changing their name and wow you're so unique you're so amazing and there's also people that are doing it because they're trying to buck that system they're becoming the the Republicans on campus and people are calling them Nazis you know this fucking shit talks about that and special with someone rushed the stage we've suffered as much as you what he's I hold on yeah woman easy now thought like we've suffered as much as you do how does that invalidate this person suffering if someone's on stage talking about their suffering yours did the nature of your suffering is invalid you're you it's not relevant you you you can relate to that person not relate but the fact you can stop them from talking or that you think you can stop them from talking just because you've suffered yourself as well like what about me know you're there for a fucking audience you're an audience member you're so your job is to sit down and listen that's life you want to be a performer well you need to fucking get an act you need to get books at the club and you become a professional how people come and pay to see you and then you can express yourself you're violating the audience versus performer rules I also think your people are at that sensitive they don't really they don't they ever really figured out what they believe in they don't really believe in what they're saying they just belong to a group and they like being a good foot soldier they haven't really thought out why they haven't been challenged they might have started out but they've been thought of as a bunch of other people that are thinking the same things that they think they felt it out it feels right it doesn't it's not thought well she's gonna do a live comedy show she has some serious issues shaming yeah there's another thing fat shaming yeah it's a very similar thing like you're not supposed to talk about people being overweight you let's talk about people being fat you know and I suppose discuss it as being a real health issue you're lazy you're fat shaming them you talk about reality you talk about your friend with his bad back and his fucked up spine and has a hard time breathing and they're like seriously like from the jump right yeah you can that's just a reality but they'll be the right same thing so you say it's it's worse because it's by decisions that they've made that's allowed them to get that big if you just decided to not eat that is a that is a possible answer now we go back to determinate right that how much of your life is your beautiful man don't worry about that we have suffered more than you Brandon but if you go back to you know what we're talking about about determinism I mean is your life are you right in now in the middle of conscious decision making the shape in your destiny or are you a product of all your life experiences all of the input you've received your it's a very day scary area because I don't like taking personal responsibility away from people I don't like it either but the reality about human bodies and Rhonda Patrick was talking about this the other day morbidly obese people have differences in their sperm that is transferred on to onto their children and that is that does not exist when that person loses the weight speaking of when a person loses the weight yeah though that all those genetic problems go away so that didn't reverse himself that then that raises another question if you do have genetic propensity for whatever it might be gambling alcoholism yeah obesity it doesn't mean as a human being you can't figure out a way to gain the system so that you get all the victim to it and we have to we have to keep that open as a possibility so that my free will counts for a lot almost on to Patrick's and all the fatties in another place but it was a lot of Patrick's saying that obesity is a it's passed down yes oh wow you saying that the the genes that are problematic amongst obese people those genes they change when the person loses the weight so even if a person has gastric bypass surgery and they lose the way yeah and they get down to a normal weight where they're not obese anymore their genes that they express and the way they transfer them to their children they will be different meanings those can have it yes could be skinny I got Roker's fine I have a friend who's overweight and he has a daughter that's overweight and it's and she's you know like approaching teenage years she's thick and no she's overweight she drinks tons of soda and she eats tons of candy and he's not a good friend it's just a guy that I know and it's it's weird to watch because it's like well I see where this is going he not educated on nutrition no no he's not just like Joseph he's not a thinker he doesn't I don't know the guy well enough to obviously I would never comment on hey you got a treat your fucking kid better but I see the kid and I just the thing and I just like Jesus Christ as kids fucked sometimes when they're happy and they're fat though I appreciate kids unhappy so it's not a good it's just it's a it's one of those things where you know if you make choices and then your children see those choices and make those same choices you know you're responsible for passing that pattern on in some sort of way and sometimes people don't realize that until someone like Rhonda Patrick says it and one of the things that Rhonda sent me was an email that she had gotten where someone sent to her this guy that was literally listening to that eating some shitty food and put it down and decided there and then to make a change in his life he's like I didn't think that it was gonna literally change my jeans that I pass on to my children really cool wow that's cool yeah more you learn about stuff out of your destiny but maybe your children's destiny yeah some people just don't know well you're you're not just your you're literally hamstringing them from birth you if you're a fat fuck and you you have these kids sorry fat shaming you let let it out of the gate you know and your children from from the jump are dealing with all your poor choices and you have to see that that's gonna punish you a lot of it's education a lot of people just didn't know that you know it used to be like high-fiber low-fat diets how you lose weight and people couldn't lose weight then they were like try not eating sugar and bread and things that spike your butt then some people who are obese are they saying it's a mental weakness or is there mental illness no they're saying you're well it's certainly everyone has the ability to do things different like nothing stopping you from just cutting all the bad carbs out cutting all the refined sugar cutting all the refined carbohydrates eating like a very healthy diet and then working out all the time and slowly but surely losing the weight and becoming healthy nothing is physically stopping you from doing that right so what is stopping and well there's a lot of behavior patterns that people which is one of depression there's addiction like what are those mechanisms and these are all things that we need to address - you can't just say hey man pull yourself up by your bootstraps because people don't know how to do it how do I get impressed yeah how do they get out of their own way they get depressed they feel terrible they feel maligned by society also but I don't think helping them I don't think you can help them by saying you're fat shaming them by talking about the fact that being fat is exactly it's just bad for its gonna do it anyway yeah the world's gonna do it quite this is my problem with the the the side it's the right on the left actually on the fringes they're way more interested in punishment than they are persuasion you know yeah I know that we can pass lots of laws I know we can have workplace stuff that kind of like makes everybody safe our quote unquote it's just going to suppress behavior it's not gonna change babe you know you need to figure out a way if you really serious about changing behavior appeal to my my heart and my mind and my man and and make it logical food when you teach me how to eat the biggest issue I always find was keeping people motivated is number one they they just they can get you can get pumped up you can go to a Tony Robbins seminar and get pumped up and really make a change the question is how do you keep inspired day-to-day how do you stay so that comment about inspiration that inspiration is like bathing it's effective but it has to be done regularly yeah yeah it's yes I think community and information these two are huge you have to be around like-minded people that also want to do the same thing that helps when you're around fucking lazy cunts who don't want to do shit they're always making excuses it fucking trips you up it's real sad so if you have friends they're always making excuses you got a you got to push them away you got a separate you just tell them hey man this is how I feel I feel like you're always crying about stuff and you're always thinking whoa is me and you trip us all up and if you're negative class you give them the opportunity to see how you see them and if not you got to find other people that are more motivated to improve their life then information and in community and information I also include things like this podcast any kind every time people are talking about these things uninhibited uninterrupted and uncensored well you get to see the the real thoughts that they have and then backed up by information from people like Rhonda Patrick from scientists from peer-reviewed studies things that you read you get a sense of like oh I'm not alone in this okay there's a bunch of other people that are thinking about these issues as well like what can we do what can I do on a personal level to get past whatever weird shit I'm tripping up on my life now why do I keep smoking cigarettes why do I keep lighting these fucking things up how come after work I just go for the ice cubes and start pouring scotch why do I do that why do I do that and all these people have to come to grips with this and having a community of people like I learned a shitload when we did that sober October thing man I learned a shitload because I don't I don't have a drinking problem but knowing that I can't drink is like inhibiting myself from that no smoking and then also having these 15 fucking yoga classes that we had to do 90 minute yoga classes in a month there's a lot of everything but it was also that we were doing it together the Bert was doing it tom was doing it re was doing it I was doing it we were all doing it together we fed off of each other and at the end of it when we were all celebrating and got through it I was like I learned a lot from this I learned a lot from this about the power of community I learned a lot from this about having things that you have to do like there's you just have to do those 15 you guys are also accountable to each other exactly where if you're just trying to sell fits gonna be tough man stuff was tough community and information those two things are gigantic some of them are fucking awesome you know if they didn't want if they wanted to change and they were bitching about it and they didn't do anything about it then it'd be a problem but some people are functional as fat people and they're all so happy and I celebrated I like fat people you know let's look some people are fat and they don't drink and they don't smoke and they don't eat bad food they just eat too much or they eat a lot of Pete's or something like that and then there's some people that are fat and whine and complain and they're always depressed that's a problem and they're happy feel good at anything you know this is the other thing like gotta be fuckin good at something you know have something that you have joy in whether it's a game that you like to play or whether it's a hobby that you pursue I would say Big Country has the good kind of fat he could you have a fuck and he'll knock you out but here's the thing would big country have been a world-class fighter 185 pounds he wasn't he was a heavyweight this is a weird example baby yeah but yeah but think about that think a big country if you like went on a crazy good diet I don't know because it goes back to an animal it back to also the idea that often that hard part of like his ability to fight stay calm you know perform under pressure might be the fact that he could give a fuck like like if you get too controlling about your weight you might get too controlling it might be a mindset that you can't divest from in everything else if you get too calculated with everything you're doing and you step in that octagon something goes wrong you're not as loose maybe or you might know oh you're professional fucking George st. Pierre yeah you know I mean it's who's a control certain certain a lot of champions are control freaks to the head of degree Lance Armstrong yeah I mean he had that shit down to a science yet about it and greatest of all time so yeah it's it's a weird conversation right it's like where do you draw the line like in it what is more important performance or happiness right that's that's another thing because sometimes your performance in order to reach the real peak levels of performance especially to maintain it like as a champion you're not necessarily gonna be happy no no you might be happy in brief moments after you win would that be in everything they'll not just just not with fighting whether it all sports would even entertainment like if you want to be the top top comedian you're not you're gonna suffer you're gonna have to your empty selfish and you know will you not spend as much time with your family you're on the road you know you're doing this you know yeah I think it's with anything there's gonna become where if you want to be the tip of the spear there's gonna be some selfishness there yeah and here's the other ironic thing that if you do spend too much time away from friends away from family that's that's right it won't be as good because you won't be as compelling yeah it's like you have to find the balancing act you have to find the balancing act where or you won't be like happy like one of things that I always bring up is Richard Jeni who eventually committed suicide and I think to this day he's one of the greatest comics of all time the guy was fuckin completely miserable and he had mental issues obviously had mental health issues which led him to commit suicide how long ago 2007 dude if you never your comic and trying to do stand-up you got a watch Richard Jan watch listen into a big steaming pile of me I tell everybody to get it it's fucking brilliant he's the most underrated of all time he really is he's miserable he's my top 20 all-time greatest he's in there and when most people do so or what's yeah yeah tortured yeah I did a lot of plastic surgery I had PEC implants had a bunch of shit done to his face yeah yeah you know a lot of shit done he'd wanted to be Jim Carrey want to be some leading man dies along the way was well this was the thing back in those days in the 80s and 90s everybody wanted to be a TV star they all wanted to be on home improvement they wanted to have their own show like Roseanne it didn't work out for everybody and he was one of the guys it didn't work out for but what he did have that he wasn't getting recognition for was some of the best fucking stand-up back Wow his stand-up was so good but that was enough wasn't enough for him and why I don't know I mean do comics especially back then it's different now it's different now than it was back then but the community of comics is so like it's so tight and so welcoming now yeah like we're all where it used to be used to be way different right yeah something happened not a warm not a warm group not just that like everybody was like all for themselves you know like if you want to see a guy on the road they usually took some guy with him that sucked and that guy would do like 15 20 minutes of shitty stand-up and then this person would go out there and look like a god and that was the standard move that everybody did a George Carlin for the longest time took this guy on the road with him that didn't work any other places and there's a lot of those guys they'll they'll take a guy that works on the road only with them they literally don't even work as a professional outside of opening for that and they'll do this shitty act and then this guy comes on it looks like it's just to make him look good just to make him look good and that was what the standard move was and then something happened and I don't know what it is I think there's a bunch of factors but I think one of the factors that happened was that there was more opportunity available so there wasn't this feeling of scarcity because before when it was just everybody trying to get a network show everybody was like hey man you might be trying for the same part I'm trying for I want to be a host of The Tonight Show you want to be the host night show fuck you it's all everyone so pure sloppy slots you're going to make a living then in the 2000s it opened up and the internet sort of opened up all these different possibilities and then guys like us realized hey I don't really get represented correctly and anything that I do that other people write what I need to do is figure out how to just be myself like like people have this distorted idea of who you are because you hosted fear factor or you we're on MADtv as pool boy or whatever the fuck it is like this is how they view you you go no I did that but I also do this and also this person and back then you couldn't do that it didn't exist before there was the internet and before you could actually express yourself completely uncensored so I think that that led people to be like much more scarcity minded much more famine thinking you know and famine thinking is the fucking enemy of community as soon as you have famine thinking especially being creative there's this amazing book I just finished you should have this guy on your podcast Dan Coyle it's called the culture code he wrote the talent code too he studied highly successful group SEAL Team six the SEAL Team six fucking even jewelry thieves so they were like these amazing jewel thieves they studied them and they released guys and they would come in they stole from a toe in the middle of the day in Tokyo a hundred and five million dollars worth of diamonds I think they went to Monaco saying things stole like fifty million dollars worth of stuff and got away in speed boats right forty forty five seconds come in but bash went and they were like holy fuck they couldn't figure some heroes oh yeah I mean they were daring and they would treat the people in the stores roughly but they didn't kill anybody but they and they were strong they looked athletic and they were like alright this is obviously obviously probably archons Tigers from the Serbian war they're clearly Serbian crowd Special Forces guys right they just they were just too organized they were like like literally they what they move like water they do they would dress up as women they decided to come in like these beautiful women turns out they were men but they look like there are others noble difference right thank you and they come in and they just but they get away with let me say it again 105 million dollars in diamonds at a time crazy shit the most successful of all time so the time finger they have to constantly stymied by this idea what the food the fuck were these guys they've got to be these they got to be a military unit turns out nah they sure weren't they were middle class Serbian kids who'd grown up together they were all friends some were one guy was a he studied to be a lawyer another one said he'd be a journalist another one well these are men and women by the way another one studied will play basketball kind of like for a second almost made a pro but didn't nothing that remarkable middle-class kids they all however and there was no leader there was no mastermind they thought there's got to be a master my got to find the mastermind ah there's always a mastermind that they bring the jewels back to nah not that either they were just a loose confederation of friends from three different towns I think he would known each other since childhood and they had they grew up in the war so they they had a taste for action and adventure and they but they were all close and they would get together and they would plan these they would plan out these whole you know heists and the way they would do it the way they would do it would was it was fascinating because there was no boss they would just spit ball ideas and everybody was safe not only to come up with a good idea but everybody was also safe to sort of like um to to be wrong they were so so that they went and found the one guy that every SEAL Team six SEAL Team six is fucking who's the one guy he said I want the one guy that's the baddest of the fucking bad I want the guy because they are they are such an effective group and and you and I are friends with Andy stuff and you know then we know some guys and every one of them was like Dave Cooper Dave Cooper is the dude he's like the Hickson Gracie of Navis he's a guy and oh fuck I want to find this badass this who's this Francis and Ghana genotype you know right shows up guess what he's a they're white dude just a regular very fit but he's a regular dude bring up Dave Cooper for a second right and Dave Dave was the kind of guy who'd be like I'm he's like what do I call you he was like he's like 20 year like SEAL Team six devgru commando so he's like he's like you can call me Dave Cooper fuckface it's up to you that guy looks regular that guy looks like a fucking eagle guy you're a salmon he's gonna swoop down and scoop you out of a fuckin fuckin Dave but the way he's so American but but he was sudden these guys and when they would come up with ideas very democratic very like everybody he wants to hear from everybody's no stupid my ego doesn't get in the one house all that matters is wrong all that matters is I want results that's all this and when you study these highly effective groups and they look like great basketball teams Popovich you love this Popovich it I didn't know that the great Bob the Spurs were the most winning in the past 20 years the most winning his team in the past 20 years more than winning his American team in past 20 years yeah and it's the same way his ability to kind of like he's a fucking he's got if Tim Duncan is volcanic temper yeah volcanic what does that mean who's Tim Duncan one of the greatest mister fundamentals but he's a lot to do it's not a lot of superstars it's also the way they structured the team running yeah like they've done some studies as far as like oh he has amazing players yeah no doubt yeah but he also makes amazing players and how they work together and in fundamentals and fierce work together and how how they communicate if I keep doing a question to like well what makes a great team is a great team just having killer individual players or is it having really good individual players in a killer environment they all grow and get better together they've done studies like you've got to think that a guy who's in the NFL say for his first year as long as it doesn't get injured if he keeps playing and he keeps hustling keeps learning he's gonna be better in two years right yeah if he doesn't get injured NBA is probably better because you don't get injured as much but you got to think that these players are gonna get better at basketball better at competing under pressure and get better at playing together yeah they're all gonna get better these guys we're talking about this before the best world that the Golden State Warriors you know they call him a super team but they were drafted you know they added Kevin Durant which makes him even better who's one of the best players in the top three but before that they were all drafting came up together so they play as a team right now they're unstoppable yeah so instead of like a Cleveland or Miami you just put all these superstars together at Houston or OKC the Golden State Warriors were draft and they came up as a team now they're super to but even like teams I don't know a whole lot about teams but teams that grow up together get put together they depend upon some sense of community yes when that community thought like a member when Shaq and Kobe were beefing yeah it was a real problem real real problem cuz they were playing on the same team and Shaq was doing raps about Kobe is a fucking real problem that kills things because killings minutes somebody has dominion just on who they are over the group that becomes a problem because everybody has to share ideas this the structural engineer I've been talking about the structural engineer and this architect he did this amazing study where he took CEOs lawyers business students and kindergarteners and he said okay here's the here's the here's the task 26 pieces of uncooked spaghetti a yard of tape a yard of string and a marshmallow might be one last thing I can't remember whoever makes the tallest structure is the one that wins CEOs lawyers the kidding are this kindergarten is figured it out because the way they approach the problem nobody had invisible ideas of authority nobody had sort of this guy might know more than me I'm not gonna say my thing they were like no yes David there's no but we're all fucking idea let me do this and they would just fight over the idea but it was the best time he's listening to the kindergarten I dia would win idly shut up kid you know no they were all together it was a groups of four so therefore cuts but the kindergartners the four of them figured it out yeah they built the 26 inch structure and the second one was the CEOs they built the 22 inch gels are thinking about cocaine and pussy probably how their stocks are doing there's too distracted give a fuck it's a question of like what makes children learn better you know I I've watched kids obviously I have them and I watch them learn things and it's just saying how some kids learn things really quickly and some things don't or some kids don't and how parents just really don't have the ability to learn at the same level the kids do so I'm like well what is it is it a physical limitation is it a clarity thing is it an ego thing is it your identity that holds you back I think it's the amount of time and energy that you put towards something and whether or not you're willing to be obsessed by it yes and I think that some parents and some people that are adults just do not have the same kind of time that a nine-year-old has to think about things all day they don't have the same amount of things in their head they don't have them the same they have too many bills and stresses and distractions and things pulling them away and different angles and they don't have this sense of who they are the way of an adult does that sense of who you are could be very limiting you can have this decision that you you have in your hand yeah that's what it is yeah that's a big part of they've done a huge load of study on that like there's a huge body of study on how what conditions are the most effective to learning I mean they've done a lot of work on this and one of the main things that lends itself to learning fast and well is just the idea that you're you're psychologically safe the idea that first of all there's no shame in making mistakes right that's huge can't be afraid to failure yeah man and you will fail but it has to be competition too like it has to be it has to feel like shit when you do fail cuz if it doesn't feel like shit when you feel like there's there's always the thing I learn you learn when you win but you learn more when you lose labor you learn a lot more make failing and feeling like shit is important to reenergize re-motivate refocus and then to recognize this is a bad feeling I don't like this feeling I have to work harder yeah there have to be repercussions to you yes otherwise you don't learn no that's true but you need somebody if you're a young person you need somebody to help you navigate out of that space yes you don't and you're you feel like shit and in your shame you're told you're told usually you're just not as good right and it's and you're not gonna be able to get as good what happens is people quit some people though some people some people don't and they dig their heels in they gets amantha Mikasa the person so you need somebody to help you realize hey hold on learning is a bitch yeah learning is a motherfucker don't worry this is part of the process so let me help you navigate your way out so the biggest thing that they always do is make you realize that mistakes are necessary important and just as good at this stage they feel like shit of course they do they come with all kinds of weird feelings that let's stay in this stay in this learn how to stay uncomfortable in this and let's figure out a way to get the fuck out of this right because the real killers the real winners they're gonna be killers and winners in any sort of scenario but you can develop more winners if you have a better structure better learning environment you'll have and then also the community will be better yes like this as we keep coming back to that but I think this is goddamn gigantic and we're not just talking about community in the sense of people that know each other like in a one-on-one individual basis well you guys have done with your podcast is create a community I see the community interacting with itself I see you guys interacting with your fans like you've you've made a community of fun silly people to get together when they come to see your shows because he and I are silly yeah for sure but this is this is also community this is even people that don't physically know each other it becomes a thing you know and I think that that that is one of the least discussed but most important parts of happiness and a part of most important parts of developing its community yeah it's giant yeah yeah it is and also like learning that like we had a really good discussion about the podcast and it was funny how I'm gonna piss I fucked up I fucked up do you have any today I feel like I'm gonna throw up I think you so much caffeine that's not my shit my pants learning is important I just talked about cyber back like that that's the first time side work Holly when you get back and broad you take a fucking about how when we have an issue that we want to get like make the podcast better or whatever oh when I called you incidentally the first thing you do is take care of like you your you make sure my feelings are you like you take of my feelings I do the same thing with you like we well I we want to make sure that they like hey I don't give a fuck we got some we had some read some research on the podcast on copper I said here's where we get the most listeners here's where people turn it off here's what we do this and I feel bright I tell Brian this all the time I go listen they might turn off here but we didn't create this thing to decide what people like what don't like if you want to do fucking an hour of what you want to do we're doing our way we're doing we want to do yes they like it great but that's how this thing got to where it's that yeah so we're gonna do whatever you want to do yeah that being said you got quit doing that no map that being said you got to be responsive no I just taught myself you want to do it do it down but here's the repeat back we're good yeah be restore let's do what you want to do though but yeah here's the evidence yeah and so if you're not gonna be response is it's done your job again and just keep doing your own thing yo you Pete when I win a signal at you you'll peep when i signal at you that's right yeah we we've never had that issue like oh we got I have to know this as you and I do that's every single time nobody even in fights I'll get a fucking text a man sorry a little listen all that matters is what works I don't give a fuck about being right I'm your sensei though we've established that and now that we're I'm Rogan gonna meet Rogen's gun call me Road dog I'm gonna kick you in this you're not a fucking Road dog I knew call me broke you're nuts well I had the fire I'm not calling you Road dog he's a road pump dog no it's not comfortable that he sells more tickets than you seems weird now that you ruined my Christmas with that because he sold out the Wilber Wow why are you laughing right now sold out uncomfortable dude you broke in a wedge you put a wedge in friend you put a wedge between us now pocket real sand and now I think about that you ruin a good friend no Yuri doesn't think about this this is a real issue but well this white wants to diminish you John Road puppy she's a rowdy yeah bro I went to Dublin shut offs Tralee on me call me ro doc you haven't heard that yet call me Road and you call me sensei when I give you advice I don't like when I say hey try this and you go makes me comfortable with you okay what's that on okay yes sensei weird I don't play sensei you stayed up fuck out of this bro listen I've been a comedian for almost 30 years yeah I think I'm allowed to talk about rapid I also have a very good friend of Brennan shops correct yeah I don't feel the need to diminish him in fact I pop them up at every step every chance I can just having a conversation on text the other day where I was telling them how proud it was of em hustle discipline that's one of the things that holds a lot of comedians back they don't kind of discipline this guy is out there doing things a couple years in the comedy that guys have been doing comedy for 10-15 years can't do I know well let's just keep this humorous for a second I'm tryna masculine you call me a Road Dogg alright be like I don't I don't want to be called the Road Dogg either so I don't know if that's a good thing to want to be coding you want to be called a road we'll just a fucking comedian Road wolf have an inner wolf it's gonna come out sometimes well I didn't call myself road anything but then you and Delia called me a road pop in Italy is another one trying to diminish you bro but you could kill him with your hands that makes him uncomfortable he's so much funnier though so he wins for now I do I do a shop once a day and I do it does cross from animals like he could he could stifle my life with his hands yeah but I love that part is a given but you should be in admiration of what he's doing with stand-up he's hustling come on who's this biggest supporter don't you eh excuse me you're not his biggest support might be I am but I'm a hundred percent my motherfucker I'm a hundred percent you're not I'm 100% positive you're calling Brodie this way this like my mom and dad finally do my room you're a fucking coward right now let me ask you this you ever opened up for Brendan anywhere never I might be opening up for him in the future I got a gig you know for me too actually I did I opened up for you when you did your Brendan on the sneak due week one of the biggest fucking comics to open for us it's pretty cool unfortunately Rogan would actually do that for us yeah open up for you it was the first time and open for anybody in like 21 years I love the first time I ever went on stage without anybody going on before me like I really like that's a hard gig like the opening spot is a little more difficult so you got to like juice the audience up you got to get him it's a there's an art form to have like smoothing them into the show I just learned that so I bring someone on the road my name's like Cohen you're just going out there cold Oh Mike yeah I just do my thing is like no no what the fuck yeah yeah then you both you guys like you can't do it like some guys like Bill Cosby to the end always just went onstage oh really yeah he didn't have an opening act Bill Cosby would go on stage for like two fucking hours he was a hundred thousand years old he would go on stage for two hours with one eyeball and a hollows friend's shirt with a backlog of rape in his head now somehow the fought through that delivered this family-friendly humour to be one of the grass the graves in comics have alt like the most prolific and it goes to your point that you can be more than one thing and be evil and good you know I mean he was a great example fuck dude and no opening act look at that hello friend one stage like that just with two hours who knows how many rapes in his memory banks she's crushing his self-esteem and thought process and activity had he been been accused when he was doing stand-up on he'd been acute he's blind in one eye and losing his vision in the second or how is very old but I think I know I still live we still whether the trial he died through one trial his trial and then there retrying them again that stress usually kills those like Joe Paterno oh my god do you imagine a body of work though and then doesn't matter but it's what is the human being right what is the human being capable of and the lowest thing you could do to someone besides murder them is repealed and to drug all these women that you took in there they were like confiding in you because you're this great master of show business you were mr. Hawkes Dublin you would never believe it you would never leave somebody told you you'd be like shut up no way like the earth is flat before Bill Cosby rape but don't you think this is a part of what we were talking about earlier is that the more information that gets out the more you understand like the Harvey Weinstein's or the Bill Cosby's of the the evil people of the world that that have gotten away with it for so long because of power but the more this stuff comes out the more we'll have we have a more nuanced understanding of what a human being is like Neal Brennan was talking on we were talking to the podcast me CK I love them too it's great and we were talking about what do you think that it's possible to be a really great comic cannot be fucked up in some way and I was like no never met one never met one it might be possible I've never seen it I think there's something about wanting to crush on stage and figuring out like how to do it and having those thoughts inside you that people find so humorous those crazy impulsive thoughts and those you know like deeply disturbing thoughts sometimes we were just scratching the base layers of your psychology and looking to see what makes it bleed yeah you know though it's hard to find that place when you're a regular person with regular sensibilities and you fit into this you know normal pattern I mean you might every now and then get a really funny guy who comes out of that but most of them when you get to know them you find some dark shit how to present or just dysfunctional shit yep unorthodox yeah I'm trying to fill them whole yeah just I'm just different way of looking at the always on the outside out fighters outside fighters as well it's the same thing I don't know any fighters that somewhere in the back of their head do they not have this this one area like oh you got this spot most people don't have that spot yeah it's like this one area of darkness yes you know yes how many human beings do you think could get to the psychological state that Matt Brown gets into in full combat I mean look how many people are immortal how many people have that level of violence in their head in the face of like like real world-class fighters the one thing that I love about Matt Brown is every Matt Brown fight was a motherfucking Matt Brown fight and he knew it like you team go the kids like well you see how he got into the cage during his last fight with Diego Sanchez you roars they open up the cage door and he just fucking throws his arm back and it's real Punisher d'arnot at that level and he's lost and he's won he said ups and downs never a physically gifted guy not like some insanely fast like crazy athletic just explosive fricking animal hide in steel cable he's got a place that Bob who works in accounting you know is his wife is fucking her personal trainer and his kids call him a piece of shit and he takes his antics every night bring him Salma Hayek he was my monster - oh yeah she said something about Harvey Weinstein that's to your point that we should say so she said it's a once but it says everything it's the first I want to see Matt Brown roar you can't supersede he yeah he knows no though I talked to him in Boston he came to my show in Boston and we actually talked on the phone but he was saying I don't know man he goes mean look he was I was thinking of retiring but now that stuff he's thinking about it to us and he smashed Diego Sanchez with the craziest elbow you don't oh my god that was so crazy here's a thought on that adobo you know one this has been something that's been going on for a while like when is it okay and when is it not okay to hit the back of the head where it counts as okay oh right like if you do it on the ground you can get severely disqualified yeah right because DQ'd or points taken away depending on how much damage do to a person but if you do it stand it up whether it's with a head kick which a lot of times hits the back of the neck it's as if it's a movement right if it's in transition and you hit the elbow you're good okay but on the ground it's not here's my point like if someone's squirming on the ground you throw an elbow and you hit them in the back of the head a lot of times they can take points away but isn't there a big difference between doing something on purpose and doing something in the heat of the chaos why is it okay standing up and I think it is okay I think Matt Browns ko of Diego Sanchez is totally clean but I think there's a reality to that back of the head shot that happens with neck kicks all the time all the time there's a reality to the effectiveness of that technique that we accept standing up but on the ground we limit that I think they're thinking on the ground you have more control of the opponent I don't think that's real I don't either I don't think that's real I think guys they're bucking and squirming and you're throwing shit and it takes there's movement here while you're throwing it's very rare that someone's completely stationary well you're throwing their asses you're also adjusting there they're going shrimping you're bucking you're dropping down there's a lot of shit happening man and the idea that somehow or another you should be able to control it on the ground when you're actually in physical contact with someone right you actually physically have their body that you're trying to manipulate and control while they're bucking I'm sorry versus they don't have any control of your body you're standing up you're away from them and any shot that you land this on the back of the head somehow or another is okay it just shows you we have a little more ways to go as the evolution of fighting yeah you look at some of the rules and I'm like how the fuck how do we still have these problems I'll get judging oh my god dammit to judge you have a helmet could you wear something on the back here head line out they used to wear those entitlements they used to give people these you wouldn't in there's a transition and Taekwondo rules where they started getting ready for the Olympics where they started making people wear actual helmets you were these big foam things but before that you'd have to wear these things in the back your head the video I have but there's a video of me wearing one the video feeling like an asshole I always liked it better because it didn't fuck with your peripheral vision though the idea is you get Kayode because we're all we were fighting on basketball courts and what guys got Kayode this is me I'm the guy with the back to us but if you look at my head that thing in the back of my head is a raw a red foam thing it's you know shitty old VHS but a yarmulke rubber band that goes across my forehead and this pad is just to keep my head you just like that get up yeah how old are you this I was 19 that was at the USO in Connecticut Cici Connecticut on the floor why'd you walk off like yeah I wanted all the other guys to be scared cuz I fucked up my move was always to pretend like I didn't give a fuck walk away like it was nothing never celebrate never like it's just another day in the office the guys scare the shit out of me so I'll try to be like one of the guys that scare the shit out of me what I do yeah and then it was what I do but I was like this is weird I'm like a fraud but I'm not yeah but those those head things were standard and then they changed it to padded floor they changed the floor they used to let you fight wife on a hockey rink I fought in the Bay State games on concrete there was a plastic a thin plastic sheet that was over concrete and when the dudes head hit the mat it cut him open because I owed him and when I hit him in the wheel kick his head bounced off the ground and his eyebrow opened up from contacting the concrete it was so disturbing I was like that easily could have been me I usually could have got head kicked and my head bounces off the fucking concrete that was like practice when you go to practice I don't know and you're gonna spar somebody was gonna get kicked in the head if they weren't careful and somebody would do the chicken like I said there would always be a guy once a month who would get hit and would you guys wear that headgear no high-tier helps it definitely helps like it'll protect your head a little bit it's definitely better than nothing but getting those acknowledges look is pretty sweet though yeah here's Matt Brown here's Matt Brown when he steps in to fight Diego Sanchez he was a head coach now they're in Denver no he's definitely one of the top coaches over there and didn't they just open up a place here he did they somewhere a place in Burbank my all-time favorite you just said check my dick like if you have a cup on there's yes and taps his own dick to get a check his fingernails and watch this steps up to the cage thinks this is last fight ever walks in so four and they brought them back yeah it's like for a guy like that that style is just so it's so hard that's such a hard style so crazy that's not like a Mighty Mouse guy that's not a you know just a guy yeah just Klein just very skillful no doubt about it what is that it's clinch was very good his more times very good but Jiu Jitsu is very good dudes are super underrated his toughness was world-class yeah striking in his ground you wouldn't you wouldn't say it was yeah I just feel like fighting that's no disrespect I'm saying you know his ground game was it like a ver doomed strike was it like a wonderboy specialist besides and toughness right yeah I'm not throwing shade yeah Brendon do you think that if you took if fighting was as profitable say as baseball basketball football we'd obviously have very different athletes in the game no yeah but I just wanted tough like though yeah I wonder if if athleticism plays as big a part in the fighting in it in the umbrella of fighting it does in say basketball football so you're rather making the NFL or the NBA you know yeah there's a lot to the game of course but I feel like athletic plays a bigger factor like some guys can be not as athletic in a lot of ways like George st. Pierre it's still fucking weight abdominal Don would you say not athletic it's a great athlete but no George is the bad examiner who you want to say guy he's a bad example actually but Nick Diaz who was just amazing like he's never been knocked out and Josh Thompson knocked him out yeah yeah you had kicked him stock yeah it was before the ha failed dos Anjos fight yes he losted dos Anjos after that and the X Factor with the fighting where where guys who are not as fast not as strong that is what they can't jump aside not as all that other stuff somehow are able to close that distance let me rephrase that Nate got stopped by Josh Thompson never one conscious Nick oh no Nick's never been snooze no no Nick got stopped early on in his career by that guy who did tough who wound up Jeremy Jeremy Stephens no Jeremy Jones said his name he was a young guy that was really talented and Nick and him both fought when they were both like 18 or 19 and Nick got stopped by him he's flatline no and he's fought the best of the best the best but that guy was super talented that guy was super talented but then went to jail went to jail for some shit do you boys yeah I think fighting requires a different skill set but when you get a guy who has that warrior spirit who's athletic then you have problems like a Francis and gun right or Mighty Mouse Kelvin Conor McGregor you know you get these guys who were could probably play other sports like Conor McGregor in there as an athlete and I'm like really fuck this ability to perform under pressure is undeniable and that that is a lot of wealth movements fantastic give his body to a lot of what athleticism is is effective use of that body like you can't deny that a guy who is a world-class fighter is also a great athlete there's no room for that anymore everybody who's at the top of the food chain is a great athlete obviously Francis is an outlier because he's such an obviously amazing athlete I think Pablo is an outlier to the way can go backwards your reaction time think about also woodleigh's ability to hurt wonderboy in those two fights that he had put wonderboy more trouble that he's ever been yeah that we've seen him inside except for Matt Brown who stopped him great he stopped beating my decision I think you beat him on decision but beat the shit out yeah for three rounds do we get a guy like Darren till look how big and athletic until he's a big boy I'm sure yeah there's a lot of guys in Class C but there's two different weight classes but I differently close brother but I think no but yeah really good Luke Luke can fight at 205 if you wanted to yeah but I think the day and age you're always gonna have those guys and this isn't a knock those Leonard Garcia's those Matt Browns you're gonna have those guys but the evolution of the UFC and mixed martial arts those guys are gonna slowly fade away you get better athletes and just being tough is he gonna get you in the top 10 anymore I think you're gonna get guys too they have the fires mentality but they're the super athletes and that's the evolution or good athlete a fucking monster at everything and he you know he can do both what do you think of that Lima fight that's coming up that's my 820th yep great fight we're gonna be in Boston that's the same night as the in Ghana fight well that's the I got him steep a fight they're going head-to-head head to head I think jail and rampage is on that to get your dvrs ready folks can we talk a little bit about battle of the greatest woman fighter of all time I think whoever wins that but is that but is that the case right because Misha beats cyborg Misha beat Holly never fought cyborg but the way she beat Holly was so fucking spectacular how do you not always rank Misha above Holly I know Misha retired and Holly is still super active in likely should have been 145 pound champion is question if you take away the deductions right under me she should have gotten some bullshit for too late shots and then even on top of that you still see like Holly dropped her with a head kick and then dropped her with a left hand as well how he was also beating Misha in that fight if she was because two rounds when she got dominated mounted and couldn't do shit about it and then the last 15 seconds is a fight Misha pulls out the ultimate takes her down takes her back and then chokes her to sleep usually that's for sure but if we're gonna play that game then Holly murk the girl who meets you could never even hold a candle that is Ronda Rousey that's true but don't you think that Misha kept getting better and that the Misha who fought I think the Misha that fought against Holly Holm was very much an improved version of the Misha that fought against Ronda but that Misha right she her whole thing is grappling yeah so it try implementing that game plan against Ronda grappling you enjoy that she got better than she did in the early Ronda though she did so did Rhonda yeah it's she might you know what she might think step back but do you do it but here's my problem then you got a look at Amanda Nunez a man in his feet the shit out of the both of them and the way she did it was like her cred the way she throws like there's more bang bang she's yeah she's Amanda as his yikes Amanda she's hikes and I wish she got more promotional push Holly Holm were able to pull off this upset she's number one for me beating Rhonda and her prime being cyborg enterprise cyborg it's fucking scary man yeah he belies that cyborg is always be lined everybody she just comes straight in and puts so much pressure on your last fight ton everywhere she went you know why not just gonna murder this girl watch them stick behind a jab I'm gonna figure some things out that's no problem Joe how he has a way better chance because if she does that with Holly where she says I'm cuz I think she's got she's been training I'm you know I think it's almost like she's been training with so many different real time step back the best boxing coach and that's actually that actually favors Holly I think then her old style which is too comment knows that's the favorite Olli that if she book comes at holiday like cool like Rhonda did yeah get kicked in the face last if there was me with it with cyborg is oh she's so strong she do you know cause she she's calculate here's the other x-factor if cyber goes uh Holly kind of sucks on the ground I'm a black on the ground I also can grapple like a motherfucker I'm not just gonna stand here instruct you I'm gonna take you that she's a naturally larger woman she's way bigger so she hits against the our T's trying on pic Tito Ortiz yeah is she black bone now she's like yeah and she's competed as a brown belt I know she did very well and some high-level competition she's a big woman her and Dave Garcia go at it grappling yeah that's yeah she decides to go and he should tape footage s and see how easy me should choke college that's in her back pocket she was alright on the fetus get a little tricky I'm gonna grapple sure she has a hard time making 45 right yes she does yeah she would be better off if there's a 155-pound woman's weight class you so much weight yeah I mean she's leaned out she looks leaner now that she did when she was fighting in Strikeforce you know I think when she fought like Gina Carano she was fuckin gigantic she's much smaller now it's such a good fight though but she's the Hellion her she's still a destroyer yeah you know it's like I think for a long time coming yeah and I feel like she's finally got to it where she deserves this well she definitely deserves this big high-profile fight but so does Holly you know they both do this is a really interesting fight because like clearly Holly's dangerous right she head kicks Ronda knocks her out she head kicks bitch Kohei knocks her out she had kicked Germaine to random e who's a multiple time world Muay Thai champion head kicks her drops her and a lot of people thought she should have got that decision at very least it was super fucking close and Jermaine is one of the best strikers in the world she's a she's a nasty strike so then if Holly and cyber just strike who gets the edge well it's see that here's the thing like you can't sleeve it on Holly like she's probably got a disadvantage when it comes to punching power and probably are significant not probably yeah we won't we really know cuz holly has dropped people and she does have sharp punches and she's an 18 time world women boxing champion I mean she's there's a lot of craziness to what Holly was able to do as a striker with her hands Holly's more decorated straight striking she had so fucking hard she's so aggressive did you see cyborg going against the gold medalist and the female boxing world I think Clarissa shield yeah did you see that's amazing I mean yeah Claressa Shields is no joke no she's up it's crazy it's crazy yeah it's fun to watch too because you realize okay well she can hang in the pocket she takes a tremendous shot if you really want to be impressed by cyborg I say you look at her one more tile off but she loves arena bar beach bars yeah she's in Bellator kickboxing now Serena Bart is a monster she's this really tall woman from Holland who's got outstanding technique and she was hot nobody was fucking with her she couldn't get a fight for years so she's giving her some coaching here so cyber we decided to fight that muy Thai monster and it went to a decision yeah cyborg lands some good shots yeah not only did it go to a decision decide where our new tattoos on her legs no that's tape that's like a performance tape on the top and oh how weird is all crisscross yeah it's a shitty video huh awful video but cyborg got dropped a bunch of times kept getting up you know came after her and was there for the fucking final bell still swing and trying to take my girl Heather had her hands full we're gonna walk in the park it was not a walking up and she's a specialist and she's so good you've watched her fight she's so good so here's a cyborg sparring with look how good this girl's butt looks I Borden that she's hanging in there yeah she goes look how she does the body head was doing work she is she's so good man but these girls are going at it this is not like a light sparring session this is almost like a fight you know and she's got to be careful because cyborg has big fucking power so she's treating this like is a dangerous fight for her look she's landing these shots but she's realizing like the stuff that's coming her way she can't take one of those on the point of the chin she can tagged look at this so I worked hired her a couple times but she's clearly like the more polished professional boxer I'm a cyborgs don't work those she's doing you're not like a left hook to the body ooh that step in left hook to the body oh that's pretty she's so good it's night man for a girl like her to get that kind of sparring into hell yeah I mean who the fuck wants to spar with cyborg came about so burst I meant no one let's spar with it so this girl's like I'll do it Wow let her kick you was it close it was it was a clear unanimous decision it was dangerous at every turn yeah and also that woman has her thing got more respect for cyborg after you watch it yeah she wasn't gonna win but she fucking did work she got head kicked with a stomp she got like front push kick to the face like right on the chin or snap back she falls down she gets up he's still chasing after her she's a warrior man she's a fucking warrior but so is Holly how it just comes off like cleaner and and like you know she comes off like more polished and she's very pretty and it's very she's very calm and very kind and nice to hear her talk I think we're a female Fighting's that that you know it's such a high level now with these two that whoever wins this is the best of all time I think it's the forefront of the feminist movement ladies no worries it's it's a very important fight for the sport that's for sure you know this is no one really out there who in my mind is compelling is willing to step in and challenge cyborg other than Holly we're gonna fight like Andrei Arlovski Frank Mayer back in the day there's no one there Tim Samaras who do working it's a good point good for us young female I don't think they're at the same level yet and the female division but there's some real good talent there there's some good female talent in MMA period or Rose namajunas and Jana and Jen Jack bad that that rematch is gonna be sick yeah that's an interesting rematch you got throw up I'm getting close really yeah they need all day and night wrinkles Kaffee you look really swallowing spits not a garbage can I might man I might / just go oh we did deer stick have a couple of pork chops smoke a cigar you'll be fine how about sausage sub what extra mustard yeah I got the hmm this fight is important man it's important for the sport right it's important to figure out what what style you need to beat cyborg like Tonya Avenger just fought a wild sort of brawling style and that like very limited success but it was like one of those things where cyborg just keeps advancing and in every exchange you're just a matter of time she's so much more firepower but Evan Jers you know she was trying to win that fight as tough as they go yeah she was trying to win that fight this is a different fight because Holly is very dangerous and she has a weird style she'll fight karate style she throws sidekicks a lot of front leg sidekicks she throws those those oblique kicks to the inner thigh and here's the thing Holly might be gonna go down right start eating in the morning he's trying too fast he's doing some fast like married he's really gonna throw up he's got throw up man weird wanted to get that on camera no that's not right that's not right what the fuck can you little puke bro he'll do that he'll just not eat like we'll do podcasts he's like I haven't I don't want to smell it I don't want him to throw up in that garbage can't eat it I mean there's a tiny garbage can there's a bunch of stuff in that can too is they all bile to you you know what last night dude I made elk tartare really yeah it's so good fuck you make a good so good make a good game meat yeah I get good at it now I got a shit-ton I need some yeah I got some here for you hey and maybe I mean I love that I you give me the hammer can I get I'll give you sticks I'll give you a heart dude that is the best part is delicious I gave you one of the elk hearts I know this isn't no I've never ever given anyone elkhart the fuck out of it you can have some steaks bro just can't have all of them greedy bitch you gotta go out and kill your own food yeah but you won't invite me let's not have a 60-pound what I want to do is not is here obsesses yeah let's do that but you're only doing archery right pretty pretty much yeah so I gotta get good with archery before I can come yeah that's a boy that's a hard one that's a weird learn on the job one shoots arrows at animals you got to be completely obsessed with doing that yeah you've got a or not you know honestly the reality is rifle is more it's more effective like you will shoot more things with a rifle you don't have to get as close they're not gonna move while you should bring your rifle and you bring a yeah for sure yeah yeah if you're in an area that allows both things yeah depends on where you're going because I don't have to get an elk yeah seeing else they have specific seasons where you're allowed to most of the time during the rut you have to use archery equipment hmm in most places some places are different there's like some some different that let you use all weapons and some they have some special tags but like during the rut when they're breeding the idea is that it's easy to find them they're all they're all howling and you know they're making those elk like wails and they're distracted by pussy and to get close enough to shoot them with a bow and arrow way more difficult because you could just perch yourself on a fucking you know a nice tree stump and let that site just settle perfectly on them if you have a rifle and just but boom and they're dead they're dead as soon as you pull the trigger or as a bow and arrow you really should be getting inside of 40 yards if you can hard right it's very hard smell you like crazy they see your movement they're constantly tuned in and turned on and you have to fight off the fact that there's like if a bull elk you're trying to shoot a bull elk you might have 30 cows that around that bull elk you got to trick them to oh shit yeah you got 30 sets of eyes 60 eyeballs looking your way and they bark you throw up well under the gills boys youth really puke yeah I did did you want some water I'm good now man damn son that's weird are you wrecking withdrawals from the herald do what English it was the hey I know I do I was a little messy I know I looked in the mirror that you don't you look like shit man did you drink well I had a latte with an extra shot on the way here that three cups this morning but then I drank this thing you never stop drink you drank the caveman and then you drank that up and then I drank the French press and I haven't eaten today because I fast in the morning that's a lot of caffeine did you go crazy for Christmas no no accident cheat on Christmas how do i what are you saying are you saying this he's like he's got a weight issue he he tends to binge no I don't see purse trick time achieved since Thanksgiving secretly sometimes we'll go crazy on not when I'm strict like the keto kid his back bitch Wow keno kid is back I'm back I didn't mean it bitch I'm sorry what you tried pescetarian for a while huh nah Kito's the only thing that works for me it's not for everyone but Kido works for me but is it work for you in terms of the way you feel or or way I feel yeah the way I feel it's easier to stick to but the way I feel when I'm on it I don't want a cheat I don't want carbs I don't want that food anymore so I'm good I go between keto and low carb yeah and then occasionally I'll fuck off and have like a pastrami sub I call that keto ish I do a thing where I go through Whole Foods and erawan and if I look at people and I try to I try to spot the vegans and this is so me glasses boy when I see when I see somebody super pale and drawn out and they just look sunken in I'll look in their cart and like slightly right now they've got oats and some seaweed and it's just all vegan stuff it's like you could use a little protein wow this really is just some people are just doing it wrong yeah that's really what it is you can do it right but it's just like keto like it requires a lot of thinking and planning like in order to I've seen people argued on line so stupid nobody ever gets to ketosis bullshit of course they do stupid of course they do it's measurable people do it and they find benefit to it some people don't find benefit to it though its but it's important to point out it's not hard to get into a state of ketosis you just have to do what's required yeah it can be done it's not difficult to get to the idea that nobody gets there is just so wrong people get there all the time it's a matter whether or not getting there it'll be good for you oh I'll have people email me on social media like dude you know stupid man you can't you can't do that for a long time it's not for me I'm like man I don't give a fuck been on it forever yeah he's been on it forever but Rhonda Patrick was on the other day and she was pointing out how with some people it's not the right diet for you much for me it probably doesn't I stopped I read that book to plant paradox and I said I've told this before but I stopped eating bread and those whole-wheat things and all the things he talks about he's more of about plant-based guy but it did cure my plaque psoriasis up until yesterday because I started eating bread again but it cures I've a bitch cured my plaque for Isis yeah it's all but it's just working on what you eat give a fuck what diet you do that's whatever works yeah I'm eating real low carb or keto yes that's all it is it's either I'm keto or every now and then I'll definitely I'll feel it when I get off of it what do you mean stables yeah yeah a lot of vegetables but low carb in terms of no refined bullshit no flour and when I get into those states I know when I'm have when I have too much fruit because then I'll start craving it I'll start like craving carb I can tell I mean I have tested myself a few times but it's annoying to stick that fucking thing in your hand and extract the blood held it on the tab and but you can feel when you're in that state of ketosis like I'll monitor my diet real steady for five six days and sometimes they'll be like a little dip because I've done it so many times it's not as noticeable to be a little dip in your energy during your workouts but then when I come on the other side of it then as soon as I feel like no hunger pangs during the day at all like I'm good and then I went oh okay I'm in I feel and then Gigi can you eat sweet potatoes you can but you can't eat too much like sweet potato has a lot of fiber in it it's one of the reasons it's one of the better potatoes for you to eat it's got a lot of vitamins in it that's it yams and sweet potatoes are fantastic for you yeah but it's like how much are you taking in how much actual sugar does your body have to process if it's just a small portion of it I'm sure it's fine if your overall meals are filled with like really healthy food avocados healthy fats you know good solid protein with no bullshit and no wheat like keep the fuck away from wheat keep the fuck away from pasta or don't you know every now and then have it but if you could just get you most of your diet free of that shit you'll just feel better it'd just feel better if you ate too many mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes and got to got out of ketosis as long as you're not eating any bullshit yeah I don't really think that's bad yeah I mean maybe your body will have more of an insulin response but I mean you're having all that fiber with your sugar you know if you're eating a yam or a mashed potato or a sweet potato it's not it's it's not like eating candy that's on your activity level oh yeah that's a big factor that's a big one as a post-workout like how many people work out like you did when you were fighting how many fucking human beings know what it's like to put in those hard to a days and just be almost no fried four weeks in the camp realize you got to to go the words speak to it man speak speak take them I into my coach Tony Jeffrey - he gets it he was an Olympic boxer and box it professional he'd go yeah you're three weeks in you have four more weeks of this Brendan let's get to work yeah just fucking with me oh my god that's why guy like you has to like keep an eye on his appetite after you get out of fighting yes because you're not broken down like that all day anymore well you could just fuck and shovel it in people let her fuck anything any time you're doing anything that's super difficult and you're working out twice in a day man you're gonna be hungry all the time now your body gets into that because even back then I wish I was more knowledgeable on diet and stuff like that I hired some nutritionists but I never really clicked with anyone but I have more knowledge now on oh Jesus Christ I must do I just threw up in my mouth it's all good though back to the taquito diet so I've more knowledge necesita keto diet my breath smells like fucking throw up anyways I wish I had more knowledge back then when I was fighting on diet and stuff cuz I didn't talk to people I try forgotten like your burn so many calories eat whatever you want my god I don't think that's the right answer you know when I played at university chorale and I would ask nutrition I'm like I feel like this yogurt you're giving us in gay that's so much fucking sugar and she goes you're fine you're gonna burn it off like I this doesn't seem right to me man yes I look at everyone's bodies we look like shit that is true but you you definitely have different requirements than a person who doesn't do the kind of working out the oh sure well your body will burn a certain amount of sugar and a certain amount especially when it comes to fruits or anything complex cluttered percent but I think more even though you're burning those calories you can put good fuel in and still get calories you don't have to get it from cheeseburgers and candy you can get it through high quality foods even still but what I'm saying again that is in terms of like overall performance if you want to do it perfectly I don't know if keto is the way to go for like a fighter I think the the strains and requirements on your body in terms of like the amount of fuel your body needs to burn there's an argument that especially for a lot of people not for everybody but for a lot of people having more carbohydrates in your diet than is required staying in state of ketosis alright or didn't I talk to I'm gonna see Lance Palmer sorry Lance if I'm off on this i Lance told me one of the fighters fat on my show goes man for the last 3 or the 3 weeks before my fight he has to make weight goes I go Kido I think you ate easily cuz I've never felt better yeah Bryan caraway said that to Brian Kerr talked inside we get down me might be Lance Palmer might be well you look everybody's body responds differently that's another problem everybody's bothered body response responds differently council people ask Matt this is what I do man I don't know if it's free they say for me when I'm on the road I can find ki Romeo when meals when I go to Steakhouse it's easy it's super easy for me I mean medicine is that way sure why they they give you pointed targeted therapy they've got to see what your genome is I always bring up you and your mom when you talk about Brazil nuts yeah your mom can't eat Brazil no just a girl sure you could brush her skin with them it's crazy and she would break out yeah that's fuck did your mommies call those nuts I forget Brazil nuts is that shit out of all the things to be allergic to the wackest nut of them all the shittiest tasting stupid not like when you get one of those things of mixed nuts you get those Brazil nuts oh that's what she calls him I feel like we call it something else laughs toes right they look like sloth days I just made that up now it might have it looks like sick sick but Brazil Brazil nuts like I I heard that they're good they good for sports and for your liver or some bullshit so but I do good old bride decides to start chopping them up six seven at a time put them in the shake that's all good promise I inherited a little of the old allergic stuff now when you are allergic and you keep eating something you'll develop more and more of a reaction with less oh so I would notice that all sudden periodically I'd like my throat would be sore it'd just be swollen and sore and I was like what the fuck is going I'm not sick but my throat and then then my entire mouth at one point swelled up and like it looked like my the roof of my mouth hadn't burned and I and my dentist goes did you burn the entire roof your mouth I went No and he goes your mouth it looks like it's been burned like somebody stuck a thing and I go yeah it's it's killing me I don't know what the fuck is going on he goes you allergic to something I said no I'm not are you eating a nut that you might be allergic to and I said and so I was developing very quickly it's a while ago that's insane yeah have you ever heard as a lone Star tick and that it gives people red meat allergy I I listen to a radio lab elephant yeah yeah yeah yeah there's some some phone yeah the tick is becoming less and less rare that's what's really a tick borne diseases are fucking horrifying there are so many people out there suffering from chronic Lyme you know they don't get it they don't catch you quick enough they don't get the antibiotics in their system quick enough and I know somebody who has that my friend Shandra her dad got a shot for Lyme disease they used to give you a vaccination any caught Lyme disease from the vaccination they don't do that vaccinations the fuck man would you there's no way to cure right massive amounts of tetracycline that's yeah and but everybody's result is different god like some people catch it too late and it's like chronic Jimmy Burke had tuberculosis we called him watching me Burke Ulis you don't know about that when did you have that Jimmy Burke Ulis has got it they thought for six months he or I was about three months they thought he had the disease that killed Bernie Mac well yeah they thought he hadn't had that or lung cancer and I'm with Jimmy he's walking around with a machine that's training his lungs okay they could yeah what does it hook up through his mouth I think a sting to his chest this is 10 years ago who's walking around yeah in the hospital and and that was what he was looking at so I fly to Newark is my fucking brother right I flat him in here and I'm like dude I know you know you have there have the the thing that turns your lungs to sand or to or lung cancer and he goes that's what they telling me about and and we're talking and he's hanging out same when I go how the fuck are you not in crisis right now and he goes dude I made I made peace with my death so fucking long ago that if I'm gonna go like this everybody's laughing and my funeral better be it be a fucking party anyway long story short they come in and they of course guess guess who falls in love with him all the doctors cuz it's Jimmy Burke all right all the fucking doctors and they fall over them and when they found out that he had tuberculosis on the outside of his lung it wasn't on the inside which was really weird he had on the outside got it from probably from his grand father who he had been exposed to and he was 3-4 years old whoa when honest yeah when he was money what I do for tuberculosis so with tuberculosis they give you nine months of antibiotics and what that did Jim have feel good what that did Jimmy is itchy asshole yes no not just that it made him colorblind so he can't see certain colors oh yeah yeah nobody healthier by the way but he went through some shit the way he's amazes day he's still car blonde oh yeah it from an abaya yeah sir it changed his change his body a little bit too he wasn't as muscular I think you lost some weight bro you ever take everybody to make you asshole it's like the ring of your athlete doesn't make the ring of my asshole it's one the side-effects to brick TB like that that that fucking nine months where he was dude I got staph once I got it once and I took the antibiotics and we went out to dinner you and me and Patty Jenkins and you couldn't drink and not only could I not drink my head felt like I had like a lead helmet yes sitting on my head I was like I was like I can't believe how shitty I feel I feel so weak and so shitty and I just gotten on them I was only on for like a couple of days and I remember thinking like how could anybody fight on how about guys fight with him they're crazy it drains you so bad I didn't train obviously because I had staff and they want to give it to anybody but I did try to use some weights and do some working out it was useless I try to hit the bag useless it's crazy we find sliders like yeah he won that fight news on a about yeah fucking Kevin Lee when he fought when he fought against Tony Ferguson I looked at his chest the moment he walked in the cage like that his staff Busha did he have staff yeah he was on antibiotics no way cuz I didn't come here to tap that's another little slug issues that goes on antibiotic - the whole time that's in session on antibiotics not holy shit see the Kevin Lee had a staff hundred percent you could see he had a giant welt on his chest and I pointed it out to Daniel I pointed out I goes Ellie Wagstaff and somewhere is someone in in Daniels ears were saying do not talk about it do not talk about it he's like yeah that looks like staff to me right when you said it I was like oh shit Joe's right man oh no I'm right oh there's no way that could be anything I was right rollin like something either happened like maybe he got burnt cat stitch that can I've heard anything you think you'd be taking a break you know coach his coach calls Robert Falls yeah that was his coach that's a bummer Robert Falls a great guy I didn't know he committed suicide yeah I knew he died I was wait I heard that there had been a rumor about that but it was what I heard suicide this brother commits suicide as well yes fuck their poor parents fuck he was a really really nice guy very very smart guy too very smart guy that's such a bummer man you know and who knows what what causes someone who's so well loved and so liked you know that's that's a great argument for like chemical issues versus like I mean you can tell some people just don't have good lives everything's going bad for them they want to end their life because they can't take the pain within there's other people that are like him that are doing really well you know and you gotta go man what is dream man so fuck it it is a fucking mystery we have we all have this real problem when it comes to people doing things that we would think would you know you'd consider to be something that someone who doesn't have control of themselves does and we we shun that we won't we don't like that bothers us man but there's a reality to like pain suffering that we have to address and you know shaming someone for wanting to end their life is not know yeah until you've been faced with that kind of despair if you're that that if the door despair level is to the point where you take your own life you have my utmost and everlasting sympathy I don't have a judgment on that I've never been there so the idea that I'd be like yes I'll get it together usually a rational decision for someone who's commit suicide only way out of this terrible situation is death that's a rational decision I I have I have nothing but my ultimate well you can do is shake your head and feel sad that's judgmental it's fucking completely horrible I mean when you stop and think about the idea of wanting to end your life you know I feel lucky I don't know but I think it again I think for a lot of people it goes back to you know what what's the chem what's the chemical reaction that's going on in your brain well they've done is it you know it is is it just an issue with some sort of a disorder where there's like something that's not producing the right amount of chemicals or is it a problem of your past like it could be a it's wrong a conflation have dealt a lot of different factors but one thing they know is that you have a set point for your serotonin usually you know like certain people like me I probably a serotonin level from one to ten at usually seven to eight you know no matter what's going on I'm always I'm just lucky I just very rarely get depressed and if I do it's a mild sort of haze some people they could they can invent the cure for every disease in the world and win the lottery and all the stuff they just go back to their serotonin levels being at four or whatever and it's just yeah it's a little bit more complicated than that but I think there's yeah there's some people that are just never happening for whatever reason whatever reason chemically or whether it could be that Neil's always like has always been melancholy he's always been sort of in that blue region and I've always been so brilliant so we have talked about it like he was like yeah with the Chappell stuff and he's like I'm always just here MasterChef yeah medication I'm just here I just go through the motions he's a very smart guy oh man he's brilliant you know I think there's an also an issue with people that are really smart they look at the futility of it all it's sometimes harder for them to overcome heat suffer from depression he's doing yeah he wouldn't call me about where he'd been he goes yeah I got a touch of the black dog and okay and here this does you everyone I like it kills somebody but you can't get yourself off the couch it's like you depress get off the gas it's like some people have a real thing there's no denying it's like but how much can exercise help you how much can diet help you it's it's a factor it's not the only factor but it's a factor you know and there's a lot of people that don't realize that and they go through life they have these issues and then there's people that have all the exercise and the diet right they still don't rest yeah still not the answer like there's so much going for them mm-hmm and then there's head trauma you know there's that's always gonna be a factor there's a you know TBI and CTE and all the different things that that does to your head yeah there's no doubt about that was think about Chris Cornell cuz Chris Cornell had such an artistic fully artistic such an he'd accomplished so much artistically and had a is his artistry was continuing to flourish and kind of in the middle of that with children and so much to live for anti-anxiety medication taking yeah he called his wife up before he did it and he was slurring his words he they think he was on a lot of that stuff well how about the winner of Lincoln Park kids yeah that he had real depression teens young yeah and put anti-anxiety medication has various effects on people you know there's some people it's a godsend for but it's just like the Brazil nuts thing there's some people are gonna have an adverse reaction to it and you have to be prepared whatever that reaction could be yeah that's a good point yeah it's a fuckin bummer man the human but we don't have it figured out but goddamn they're getting closer and closer it goes back to the fact that we're all very complicated we're all individuals you have a little compassion from each other have a little compassion would be nice there's a lot of people lashing out because you don't feel good and I watch this lady they cut in front of somebody is hilarious this guy's trying to get into this Lane and this lady speeds up to try to keep the guy from getting in the lane and the guy sees it so he just kind of eases over anyway and she just lays on her horn BAM and then the guy pulls up like he's in this look he's in this Lane now and he pulls up and she gets in the next Lane she in front of them turns her car in front of them and slams on the brakes she's and so he gets to the left to her and just starts going towards her and she freaks out and turns into traffic and has to slam on the brakes like you just had a crazy hissy fit over nothing because you did that kunti thing that all of us have been guilty of doing where you don't let somebody in your lane and this guy's like fuck you I'm getting in it's like she sped up she sped up to keep it from going in I saw you watch it all play out you're like wow I was in Park City with my mother driving her SUV and I wasn't even driving fast and this woman older woman with a very oh like an old matronly like you used to be the principal of your school and short hair and she had a golden retriever and she dressed in a preppy fashion slow down oh my god and then I go and I wasn't even going fast and she just goes mmm and I can hear her make that noise the hardest middle finger oh my god are you kidding me and she goes I've called the police and reached for her phone right away I don't that's what I said I go Oh have a nice day I remember getting in a road rage situation with this dude when I first moved to LA we're looking at each other on the highway and he takes his shirt off to show me his tattoos he's screaming at me what is gonna happen here I'm like why's this guy trying so hard to scare me he's like fuck you fucking pull over fucking pull over so he takes his shirt off he's got his tattoos and Boies does not look built I'm like you're you're in trouble fella you don't know how to fight sloppy it's highly doubt me get fooled sometimes when I'm like this is a guy is trying to scare me yes probably he's probably terrified a lot of noise yeah and now so I'm just looking at him and the more I'm looking at him II just keep screaming at me because I'm not reacting to him I'm just like like looking at me screaming and I'm in my car driving and he's looking at me and I was driving a suburban - which I thought was hilarious cuz he goes you rich piece of shit it's like I'm in a suburban how do you know this isn't even like a rich car like the fuck are you talking about like where's this coming from was real screaming and I was thinking at this time I could make a terrible mistake or I could say oh yeah I found it just fuck this guy up let me pull his car vinícius ass young guy yeah which yeah I was only like 28 at the time I was still pretty fucking stupid but this guy screaming at me almost made me realize how dumb it is I was like watch this taking his shirt off there's no other side to this day though to this day they'd be like a day would go by that I would think I should just fuck that dude up I literally think I should have just pulled over and kicked out fucking dudes legs out from under them and choked them unconscious be hilarious it's so stupid it's silly 20 years later that's how dumb those instances but you want to go in a lane someone doesn't want to let you a speed up and they're fucking fuck you like that tension it's so dumb you'll hold on to some of those dumb thoughts for decades dude I have a guy the other day I was driving off a beat Kenny I looked at my phone at directions and I was at a stop sign and you know it's my turn to go bro looking down at my phone for directions and this guy behind me he's like a regular worker like in a car just goes nuts not talking horn and I waved that mic my Batman and then I'm driving he goes around me slams on the brakes and starts flipping off talking shit oh my god dude come oh my god and I'm like alright alright go me I got it I got a hooked up keep going and then he won't let me go I'm like dude you gotta let me go man just like what the fuck did you do man I'm gonna beat up this dance fuck am I gonna do but he's playing a game that he thinks he's safe playing no because we're not in Serbia nobody comes out and gunning people down the street this these people don't do that kind of shit i watch these two guys race each other and they were they were cutting in front of each other and slam on the brakes and doing that thing and slam on the brakes and yelling shit out each other at the window and just watch him and you go like this could be nothing or it could be your life correct like you could hit that guy he can go into traffic somebody could die he could hit someone on the street look you guys are speeding like you're in this death race like you're in some fucking Mad Max movie well you're on a residential street dude mean this guy he's yelling at me and I'm like what do you do man what are you gonna do you gonna cut you got a car you gonna fight me with the fucking to do yeah yeah that's a big boy fucking just and I was like I took off my glasses on what you're fucking serious you're serious right now he's I couldn't keeps going and then I thought well am I gonna get out and I get shot and fight this guy he has a gun and I was one dude old left bike coming cuz he's blocked me so I went right oh I thought man my brother my my friends would make fun of me for going right when I sure went now but it's the right thing to do so what am I gonna do fight this I can think of that as being like you run into a dog poster like hey fuck you dog no you sit bitch now ya know you supposed to go I gotta go but the problem is it's a person so a person you think of as different than a dog get the fuck away from that dog you get the fuck away from that person too with the ego thing tonight yeah listen dude well I didn't have the 9.9 percent of the fucking human beings you interact with you could kill yeah that should play heavy on your mind know that you know what played on my mind was I went I bet he's going through some shit looked like a double shift yeah someone probably was texting before me and he he's just taking his anger out on me I'm just gonna go right fuck this man I don't need this yeah but he could been 10 you know and still acted like that and you should have the same reaction like oh god like it's a child time he's a cha he's a grown-up baby when he comes out he's one of two things either as a gun or he's fucking insane it was the only two possibilities you're a gorilla sitting in your car you look at normal sized personal orange Porsche yeah you probably feels like you're some preppy dickhead Belair yeah you know some like road rage incidences you know they've figured out why people have road rage too and one of the reasons why it occurs so off its not just a separation by barriers between you and the other person so you don't have social cues it's also that your senses are jacked up because you're in the situation where you know that you have to react potentially at a very fast rate you have to be able to react instantaneously to someone change kneeling slam on the brakes yeah you gotta be so you're at heightened stings and so then you interact with people that you think may be walking with that heightened state and you don't fucking don't lay on that horn you piece of shit you cut me off and you and everybody's been guilty of it and everybody has to learn to negotiate those that weird extra urge of aggression that you get when you're in your car and don't get out of the car and fight don't do it now don't do what people want to do it man they want to do it all the time people shoot people always look at your head and you've got a kind of a big head now I got a friendly face man what about your ears first of all the bullshit haircut I'm an orange Porsche I probably got skinny jeans on I'm not getting into finding anyone he's not thinking of fighting it's all opposing thing it's all it's all a bluff charge it's all a bluff charge it's exact job though this guy was down yeah but he's not down it's like like a gorilla running up to you who's never planning on smashing it yeah that shit worked I went right yeah yeah go laughing all the way went home as far as they say they say that what was that book that by Malcolm Gladwell we're like wherever you're from has to do with how you react to a front so like they did this experiment where they would have a guy Bailey they'd have you take to fake tests and you had to take a test in this room and then you have to go down the hall and take a test in another room as you were walking down the hall the other test you would get somebody would walk by you bump you and go watch out asshole keep walking and the dudes from the South versus the guys from the north the dudes from the south there's Sarah tall whatever all those levels there Sarah told levels their testosterone levels everything was jacked to the fucking roof they were ready to fight dude some to north nah not at all they were like huh whatever I'm what a dick and it had to do according to global not really also this guy in his bit as well it had to do with where you were from and more importantly where your ancestry Harold it from if you came from a cult an honor culture as opposed to what they call the dignity culture so if you came from a culture where honor was everything and those cultures are herding cultures that's where you get the Chinese that's where you get the Afghani stats where you get the north scots-irish that's why Armenians Armenians as lions will fuck you up yes shoulder checks of our union industry yourself scrap and tight-knit community yeah I like that but but but it was it was from honor cultures and the scots-irish who settled where the Appalachians mmm the the Hatfields and the McCoys the fuck yeah when you go to Ireland you go to parts of the UK you know in the north where Toni's from good luck go see what happens in a bar when you want to get scrappy you'll you'll find plenty of men to meet you halfway whereas if you go to certain other parts of the world where they didn't come from hurting cultures where they came from a culture that relied mostly on agriculture where it relied on cooperation where it's equals when you're a herder and somebody steals your sheep you will not survive the winter so you got to let everybody know that if you do steal my sheep I'm gonna kill you and every man and your fucking family because I'm a crazy motherfucker so so you know it's it's do or die here right right it's literally survival of your family Nisbet and and Gladwell wrote a book about it but like some of these guys who actually did the primary research on that proof that culture even though you don't know those people even though you're generations you know removed from that in this country that shit has deep deep roots in your cultural psyche yeah and of course awesome form of genetic memory genetic memory but also cultural memory also that's you're raised as a man to to protect your cubic space well that guy who want to fight me was it was a herder I'm sure he was he was down he's bluffing just got off a double shift his hurting hurting mentality car did he have it was a LA County truck he was Mexican mmm you guys want to read about that geography a thought I think by Harold Nesbit he's a phenomenal guy brings in his County truck that's a dumb move that's a way to get fired real quick you didn't give a fuck gotcha he got me to go around the block it took me more time it's not that I don't that might you do that to my brother listen my brother said some issues on the road you know and this stuff my dad has to I've sealed my own ice with me the stuff I've going on if I get out of that yeah you're I fight that guy I lose everything I stand for yeah for sure all my gigs do everything's gone for and for what and what do you think the headline raised la worker beats up UFC fighter no no embarrassing yeah I think you fight her twist man's hat off gets arrested goes to prison yeah this is not a good move there's nothing funny about a guy beating up another guy no there's no upside to it and it's also you can't avoid it you know it can be avoided pause posturing bullshit and screaming comes from not being able to fight I agree if you could have a like a bar filled with jiu-jitsu black belts probably the friendliest fucking bar ever you're the tough guys think it's a gun culture I don't even hang out with a bunch of gun guys there they're super formal and respectful yeah cuz they're used to seeing bullets flying around everybody's got a mind their P's and Q's when everybody's actually equal if you're a bunch of gun handlers and all of you go into gun competitions and shit you're shooting blink-blink-blink you roll in like fucking Keanu Reeves and shit those guys you know that's an they're they're equal to everybody in the world although to do is this I mean they balance it out to a squeeze of a trigger and SEAL Team six aren't walking around going I'm in the SEALs watch out bro I want to get to alive exactly there was a bunch of Marines it came to the comedy store the other night real nice guys they were there for this toys of tots thing hanging out with them talking to map towards and then there's some weird drunk guy comes up to me after the Marines left and he asked me about Recon Marines he's like oh look at that he just went here
