here we go in five four three two one boom ladies and gentlemen Joe shelling at Daniel Straus Jones just fucking up my kick machine out there man that thing ain't reading right I mean I hope not I really hurt my ego up you were lighting that fucker on fire that thing is not read we got to get that recalibrated toes in here just in here complaining about a sciatic pain in this hip and still I'll kick me in like what is going on I hear more sweaty forget about sciatic pain Daniel Straus you've gone through some fucking pain dude you are defying science and doctors and that David telling you it was over yeah the whole story put this bring this sucker up how the story goes I was that one night buddy mom was having trouble needed somebody go out with him so I was around the city that night and after taking him home we were leaving the highway has it split off I was coming around was you wanna like yeah I was on a bike so and I had a passenger so what was called 8:26 there's the highway as a splits off 295 I was going around at 8:26 now here's the tricky part don't really remember what's going on from there right so the what me in the passenger remember we were hit from either the side or from the back but coming around the bend boom coming around got pushed into the wall I woke up under the guardrail can't move you know nobody else is there and the car is gone there was not really a witness there until like later pulling up behind us so it fucked me up for a while I mean fucked me up right now but you know getting back to just what it is the body's healing and then so what was the extent of your injuries alright so I had in my sea for five and six I had contusions on my spinal cord and half of my on the left side of my spinal cord it was pressure so bad that it like shut down my whole nervous system like all my body so am i up in my neck and middle of my back was just compressed a lot of the swelling and that's what caused a lot of the you know not being able to walk I'd be able to feel the nervous problems nervous system that but the nervous issues that I asked what did they do to fix it I've been rehabbing they wanted to do surgery right away and boy how many months ago is this this was in December this is September 17 so they wanted to do read I wanted to do surgery immediately you know and I'm trying to tell them I know I'm I'm trying to fight again but why what kind of surgery fuse huh that's what they wanted to do they wanted to go in take the I think that I want to say the three to the five or four to six or something fuse out all together which obviously there's no brain that's and it's a big spot so wasn't trying to have that looked for we looked for you know a couple rehab places and eventually got hooked up with a place called Neil fit 360 so I've been rehabbing there since the accident and I mean it's where's that where's nurse in pembroke pines florida close to miami great crew but yet even give me back in the game I've been I was doing that extensively every day for like two days a week to our couple hours a day you know two to three times a day what kind of shit do they do for your neck for more for me first we had to start with you know just the fine motor stuff touching filming you know I have problems were sensitivities so like you wake up under the guardrail you know just don't remember what happened when you wake up in the hospital what they tell you before they got to all this stuff they were like oh walk could you feel could you like how were you when you woke up for me um when I woke up boom yeah so back to the story when I woke up so I woke up and uh you know I had my helmet on but I couldn't move my legs my passenger had one over top she had her hands so she wasn't like extremely but she had one out too so I can really feel nothing see nothing I was just telling him to get my helmet off get my helmet off finally had a truck had pulled up and I saying that we were an accident and they what they son shouldn't do him but pull me out and yeah because I was you know I'm not supposed to touch anybody that's right you know I was freaking out they pulled me out from under it and you know going to the hospital that whole the scary part was was knowing nothing was broke but not being able to feel nothing trying to wipe my face or trying to grab something and you just can't move my head in my head I move my leg I move my arm nothing's going on so you're thinking you're paralyzed I'm going it's right like Paul Williams yeah I'm just like yeah so I get to the hospital finally you know they're trying to work on me and seeing the doctors he's telling me well you know because of my neck it's unlikely that I'll be you know walking anytime soon you know a couple of days couple weeks ago after that you know just banging I'm in in the meantime I'm trying to explain to him I'm an athlete I know you see this I've been through this you know type of incident before you know I grew up wrestling I'm from Cincinnati grew up wrestling so I've had neck problems for my whole life you know I mean and so I'm trying to explain to him like you know chill out just give me some time let me let me work something now I don't want to do the surgery right now I really wonder if they wanted you to do it in the hospital right right after that there's no other you know there's no other choice you're never gonna walk again do you want to go back to them right now I go hey motherfucker look look who's walking around you know you know me and it's been like that majority times in my career where I've done something something's happened oh you're not gonna be able to do this you got me fucked up well he's hidden pads with me at the gym yesterday the guys in sparring this happened in fucking December it's insane it's just insane well it just makes me sick that they always want to cut you immediately when it comes things any any kind of bulging disc issue they want to get in there and it it's hurtful to us because you know I understand they got a job to do but do your job right you know I mean like they have yeah yeah the one Methodist 30 okay yeah yeah like I said I was rehabbing at nano faith 360 which is a just a great physical therapy place down there in Pembroke Pines and you know I've been getting back with you know they had me strengthen my neck which is small exercises like I said I started with fire motor stuff well had to work on a lot of balance stuff you know you ever fuck with that iron neck thing you ever use that thing yeah no I have not you got one out here try if you want to mess around with it fantastic things fantastic look so you're six months out now six months out you start walking again it took me like even now I'm still like trying to get the form right but it took me about three months did you like read learned yeah we learned how to tie your shoe in my hand my motor like my hand wasn't moving his right it wasn't working as good it's just everything slowed down for me because of them because my spinal cord so Wow you know that is the most for me was the scariest part because I was everything so unsure you know what the most recent MRI when'd you get have you gotten one uh got one about a month and a half ago and look good it looks good every thought the swelling's went down the left side is clear the only way I can explain it there's two there's two two mines white lines and it gets blocked you know saying that's what the fluids coming down my left side of my when the fluid was being blocked so now I'm having a clear line of fluid going down my spinal cord how it's just about healing yeah which you know I've been working that's the part to get overcome you know the healing part the the neurological part and the nerves and all that part that goes with it it's the body that can only there's not too much that I you know can do to tell this other than you know eating right all the simple shit but it's the body that's he'll but it's crazy that you're sparring yeah I do a lot of things I shouldn't do it now you're sparring with friends so you know that everything's gonna be cool I mean good training partners I I was born down that Henry who's okay H kickboxing was training down there so you know I'm living for a lot of gel so you know that's you know working out with those guys you know no one's out there to hurt me right right get me hurt or injured everyone's had a lot of respect to happen yeah it love seeing me back so I've never been in a situation when I'm trying to go super hard not yet but I look to anybody what you can get [Laughter] we can get it so I when you hit in the bag or hitting paths you feel like you have full strength or uh no you know and that's the thing that I'm that I'm excited about I'm a broken to it that is dying to be fixed you know I mean cuz I'm a brand new you know I could be fixed in any way like I'm relearning everything I'm not you know it's not like I can't box it's not like I can't wrestle but it's now just relearning the you know the mechanics of it brain knows how to do it but your body's got to relearn it exactly why and it's like the nerve the nerve stuff is on the the right side of your body right right muscle memory coming back even yesterday I sold fast for my kids jab was a little weak and like his his a lift in of his foot or whatever the thing we were trying to do but once as we were doing it once he felt the right way to do it then he could repeat it you know what I mean yeah I think that's love so I was love to do it and it's big for me man I really want to be back in in the cage by the end of this year really you know I mean I want to be fighting better this year and it's not impossible well you got a great attitude man this idea that you love it that you're a broken toy and you're gonna rebuild it and fix it it's exciting but gives you an opportunity to kind of start again I mean let's give my whole life my whole life so I'm just there again at this point in my career and unfortunately this had to happen for me to turn the corner and get focused in another way but you know it's just what it has to be but it's so exciting that you have this attitude that's the that's the cool thing about it it's like you're not what was me you're like hey I'm gonna rebuild let me get right back in there you must be so excited that you could just do everything again yeah you know I mean like for was finding out what worked had to make sure to dick work first you know the first you know first couple months was just brutal you know not being aware I'm gonna eat did it slowly start to come back well you got like some motion do and I've had a lot of I think it's stenosis nothing spinal stenosis yeah my wrestling for years I mean source do you do any decompression I do a little bit here whenever I can get to the chiropractor's I'm doing some more you know it's like I said it's been bad for you so have you seen that thing you hook up to your neck and yet you hated from a doorway yeah no stretch it no I did the same thing with a rolled-up towel or a banging from the do it helps mine tremendous but I get mine I'm sure from fighting but then also like I'll lay on my back in like two weeks my know isn't it crazy you're a professional fighter you fuck up your back watching YouTube videos or sure but everyone's doing it man that's all we do is I know people's necks are changing yeah it's terrible if it wasn't for like you know being awareness that I have now for like my neck and neck injuries just seeing a lot of things I'm like trying to posture up and just see it and shit because I'm just I'm always like this I'm always hard it always hurting so you know it's been one thing after another for years and that's actually leading into this you know this accident with this injury you know try to keep his mic closer like this no mobile to you so um are you how old you know Daniel I am 33 I'll be 34 I'm at that age where you forget how old you are yeah so I'll be 34 in July well you're you're healthy and you know the ability to recuperate from something that's that devastating that quickly shows what could have shape you're in that must have a big impact on a new rehab process right it does I mean a regular person that has that kind of injury probably is not going to bounce back like that no not as quickly I mean being like I said being an athlete has helped me tremendously I mean what my neck being obviously as strong as it was the you know the damage would have been worse but being able to bounce back was been you know being young and being able to put my body through so much that this is yeah compared to what you know it's been through so yeah being young is definitely helped me and trying to keep that that that time away but you know so how will you know when you can get back in there are you wrestling yet yeah and wrestling doing everything you're wrestling wrestling full clip of wrestled yeah wow you're not nervous about getting your neck yanked on yeah I was nervous before it you know right but now I'm just getting confident with getting my neck strong making sure I don't do the stupid moves I've been doing the cause of injury so hmm my next step is just being clear B and C by a doctor neurologist yes you can fight signing off let's get back to business so on and how's belt or treating all this great I can't say anything negative about them because they've always done nothing but help me out in situations you know I've been with them for some time you know and two times yeah world champion teletoon if you help motherfuckers then though they've always they've always been fair to me that's great obviously you've always had problems here and there but I've never really had any major you know love Scott Coker I do too he's a good dude so always been good to me I hear nothing but good things too about Bellator and how they treat people like guys who have gone over there said it's a it's just a huge relief they get treated with respect you know they're a little nervous about going over there alright you know a lot of people are always asking hey which one I'm like this is home for me you mean ma'am the ideal for everybody would be Bellator gets to the same state as the UFC the same level that would be ideal that's that would help the were like if you see Gennady golovkin fighting Canelo Alvarez you don't give a fuck of its Golden Boy vs. Bob they want to see the two world champions go after it that's that's what everybody wants to see ultimately that's what I would like to see across the board you know I mean I don't think it harms anybody I think it helps everybody yeah definitely good better for everybody it's better for the athletes for sure you know and the more money that gets thrown around and the more promote I mean if if a superstar emerges from Bellator that's at the same level that Ronda was or Connor is or sometimes that's amazing that's great for everybody for everybody and you know there's a possibility there too I mean Michael venom page is he's getting a lot of mainstream press people paying attention to him now cuz all the crazy shit he doesn't write we need more of that I thought he actually I retired from him was boxed Wow like retire from the main box or nothing you know what man dude like that probably retire and unretired just for the press you know yeah this seems to be the thing yeah speaking of retiring and retirement Joe shale and back to MMA yeah I know you competed in the high rollers event this weekend which by the way Eddie Bravo told me he was so high he thought he was going to jail he told me he goes I was convinced I was going to jail that's so paranoid explain the event for people don't know what the fuck we're talking about so as an event put on a Matt stout and big lawn on my buddy's the Hat with the cold of high rollers and it's a cannabis infused jiu-jitsu tournament as witness all that you know what are those two dudes that slapped each other and then they smoked a joint together like me there's something between and they stepped out with a joint I mean it was good the before every match everybody smoked they kind of smoked together and the whole event is understand there was no alcohol the Bible was super chill they played a like hip hop in the background Wow it was like kind of press star-studded event was really fucking cool is it that is by far the coolest martial arts event hahahaha it was though shout out to that DJ man he did like eight hours straight we're playing the same song like only twice paid it twice I'm of what we thought really Gabe Onix it's a weird connection marijuana with jiu-jitsu and it's always been there and people that don't know it people that don't smoke weed I have to tell them that look at his Jeff Glover and his opponent smoking weed it's hilarious man it is really really funny that they're doing that man but I like it why is it real cool event it was real cool Jiu Jitsu and we'd have always been connected as long as I've been doing jujitsu people smoke pot in the parking lot and then when it enrolled right that's you know kickboxing apparently is the same way because is it yeah focus yeah did I always found that I'm not good at learning when I'm high or maybe I get too high and I can't learn like like somehow show me something I'm not sure where to put my legs like what do I do step over here what I put my right foot what yeah I find that yeah but when I'm rolling if I'm rolling high then it's just you just get into that zone like it's like programming like if you you know like when they say like if you take if when you study for a test you're sucking on peppermint and the day of the test you take you like suck on peppermint you supposed to help you remember yeah yeah like that's kind of how it is with uh with martial arts for me anyway like I'm high as fuck and I'm kind of like just programming into my deep subconscious or whatever yeah that's my thought you think smoking all the time when you try and then smoking not smoking when you perform do you tend to has a like a positive or negative effect I don't know I don't really well let me ask you this first time I Bellator said we're not testing for weed you could fight high as fuck what would you do I'd smoke that day I wouldn't smoke probably 10 minutes before how does shit going on in my head you know this is cool this is cool I realize that but like yeah it's different of my online through well it's also you know the consequences are a lot different you know yeah and zagging that's a lot different when necks and punches have been around here for sure sure well remember when Nate D or Nick rather fought go me Nick follow me home well I mean I know Nick and I if you asked him that question he big lie be smoking right there and like he was for sure oh yeah yeah I bet he would fight better probably yeah not a fan of it you not a fan of fighting hi no no no what happened well for once I for one I went through the crowd instead of the the walkway do it like you you're supposed to come out it was at Shark Fights okay and you come out and then you go at an l-shape and go straight to the cage right now that Lester's always fucked at something every time you try to walk out the cage the wrong way so I came out just crowd sitting there just beeline straight to the crowd scuse me excuse me stepping over hilarious got to the cage like stepped over the fence check me out got it oh my god I remember Shark Fights no that was a bud Brotman thing there's some guy yeah he's a buddy of mine bullshit yeah he was one of the original guys that are on king of the cage was yeah and then he get involved in Shark Fights yeah yeah somebody look did they have something to do with like shine fights as well I don't know maybe there's a few people involved so was a good car that was on had Georgy Paul de Leeuw had a show Kaju on it was a bunch of people so what was it like fighting hi well for me at the time that was my biggest event and I was fighting carrying diver ideon so it was the biggest name I fought to me it was like yeah fuck you no I mean I just was kind of overwhelmed I wasn't a digit I didn't know much about you Jitsu actually the whole fight was weird because on Monday I separated my arm or separated my shoulder Wednesday they called me for the fight Saturday I fought you said prettiest thought I guess I'll get high for this right when you see separation sure like what like separation like the separated shoulder like a torn muscle no no yeah up in the I don't know yes we did he level yeah well we got it like bandaged up got a working fought water it he fought with a bandage on it no no then fight what had been banshees up but the next two days kind of held on it I said worked on as much as I can went out there I was in Texas fought and yeah I was just for me it was weird like I said psycho one decision like I said first round he threw a bunch of like leg locks yeah he's a serious serious leg box that's what I was saying like a high leg lock get out of here so it was it was a bad thing for me so one and done for fighting hi done this have you ever fought high I mean I'm sure I've fought and spar high all the time yeah what's your feeling about that I think it like a wool the finished Jiu Jitsu tournament you know Jiu Jitsu is not my strong suit obviously and so for me that was my first Jiu Jitsu tournament and we just put on the key like about a month ago when Matt told me about the things ago I should do it Mickey Cole I trained with every day and him and Bamba and we like alright fucker will do its we start put on the key and yeah I was uh I don't want to make a fool of myself so being high and having that like pressure like not being completely comfortable I think was different but like in a kickboxing fight I could probably be drunk and still be pretty comfortable [Laughter] yeah there's a lot of people to think that and I'm one of them to think that marijuana is a performance-enhancing drug I do yeah I'm certain on certain levels yeah I'm certain levels I think it fuck you up but but it's if you get the dose right I think it puts you in a zone you know a comfortable zone right I think it they're a lot of mean for performance like how what's gonna increase your performance is not being super stressed out over bullshit the weekend right that's where I find benefit like when I would quit smoking weed for a couple days before the fight that was once like now's when I need it the most I was one of most stressed out so I had the most anxiety or gonna have you know hungry yes this sucks yeah Mikey displays this relax that helps hey man are you doing any cryotherapy or anything to reduce swelling a little like I said I was doing a little bit with the the John's like the chiropractor but I was going to but I haven't done much of it but that's one thing I really wanted to get into because of the swelling a lot like I said a lot of its went down over the over the time but body feels amazing after that yeah dude I'm a big fan and you're doing like super doses of CBD though - yeah a lot of CBD a lot is that some of that in that baggie game yeah yeah check that out that's some flavor X stuff that uh flavors you can't stop crazy sure tonight there's a quite a few subjects this morning I'm like zoom medium or a large an extra-large no it's just rink for you Joe which is it's a a company called Flav it's a CVD company I've been working with was a CVD Penn yeah that's a like medicated drops I get it gives you like a certain dose every time you click it oh I've been using you ever heard that company Jambo no they just sent me some CBD rub on holy shit does that work for you fuck yeah 2,000 milligrams CBD rub on I told you the sciatic pains been fucking with me or the last week or so and I rub it on my hip like it's like my ass muscle look right over right here that's where it like it travels down and I rub that shit on before I go to bed awake this Flav has these uh they have like medicated patches you can use it have roll-on so you could use it itself stuff and I just feel like I smoke so much weed with CBD in it all the time that it don't it doesn't seem to work for me hmm I don't notice it you know and then they have leave is droppers I use that like crazy yeah maybe you just got too much of a tolerance well I just think if you you know if you smoke weed constantly there's CBD and everything you're hitting both so I went when my coach was like 65 and never smokes weed and I give him put of that shit on a musical oh my god elbow feels crazy hey I'll get you some of that jumbo shit it's better than anything I've ever used before yeah it's they have two versions they have a thousand milligram in two thousand milligram and I put that two thousand milligram and it's got like menthol in it so you feel it like your skin is like using it on my neck yeah like using it on my neck and I've used it on my hand too well I like the a penis doesn't ache inist goes away but all my neck is what I felt at the most like up in the pain but I put out there's of CBD vaporizers in there there's CBD bath balm he's that before my buddies fight the day the fight we dropped it in the and the hot tub CD bomb there are some fucking monsters out there they're trying to make this illegal it is crap my god Pharmaceuticals gas holes fuck those guys so scary that someone would do that they would try to spend money to try to make this stuff illegal and while they're doing that they legalize like the fucking GMO synthetic version which is like actually kill exactly seriously fuck those move or fentanyl that shit's killing everybody kill Prince it killed David Bowie it killed who the fuck else are they kill it kill it killed a bunch of people this year Tom Petty killed Tom Petty too did he kill David Bowie or make that up that's a it's a CBD bath bomb dang you just drop that and that's it it's fucking good not fucking around that's just legit they don't they don't I'm I really feel like a rub on effect from CBD is like I'll soak in one of those is will never did the bathroom yeah it's good yeah and it's fun to watch that you drop it in all dissolved break some stuff Joe eautiful I got some good little wah you know to chilies and CBD candy yeah sighting live eggs got it all here this is awesome I take this on my international flights allegedly the ki Fateh let is it legal Ola I mean it's illegal but it's a when you put the vape pen and do it uh-huh it looks like a car key oh that's crazy yeah see screws aside the caps on from from this he put it in there and these look at these candy so gems so my complaint about the candy thing is if they're gonna have like um that's those are CBD but they have a THC ones too and if you're gonna have THC like super potent candy they shouldn't taste so fuckin good cuz I'll eat the whole bag right your any mean like who's gonna eat just one that's very good that's watermelon like watermelon eggs Evelyn yeah this is watermelon adults it's like a belt I'm super lucky do jack shit this is the shit look at this thing I love it and then I think it has like there's three different settings repeat no value and I was burning these kids today oh you have to turn on five times click it find on two one two nope maybe that's the heat up getting working joke fuck that up there Joe yeah you got it you got it man we got it go on maybe it had it heat up there goes there goes how was the Bellator drug testing policy you know standard you know we don't have like the additional you saw the random test but I get tested before or after every fight I've been tested most of my voice I know that yeah so and I've had people talk shit like oh they don't seriously well I don't know what you're talking about they test after fights mmm but obviously there's a big difference tree in that and hey it's four weeks out wake up at 6:30 in the morning would even up to Daniel here pissing this Cup believe that it's crazy I mean they they have lost a lot of people off the roster in the UFC the really crazy thing is the body's changing yeah people you weren't sure you know you know everybody passed the test when they were doing it on the weigh-in day but then you're looking at their bodies changes like so many of them just shriveled up and they just look totally different their performances are different their mindsets different or guys they were just unstoppable you know that came in now it's like y'all I got six fight losing streak crazy drop two weight classes already the way anybody who says that steroids doesn't workers they're crazy you ready fucking mind they're not taking it for fun you know they're not going all the way down to Tijuana I'm buying this shit because it's it's fun they're good to do yeah so do you feel like you got a new lease on life um I do man right now I'm just grinding like I'm fully focused on getting back into the cage like you know having having what happened to me and being in a position that I'm in I don't really have too many things to go back to him so you know having a new lease on life really isn't how I say it is it's just what it is I'm just focused on one the next step you know I mean the next step of my career the next step and you know the path and what I've been going through you know it's always just something for me so you know I wouldn't say it's a new lease of life or just a new chapter but you must feel very fortunate that you can from that do I do it's amazing story I love hearing shit like that yes it just sucks you know me sucks to be in this position but I'm I'm here I'm talking to you talking to this guy you know walking around so I'm blessed more than anything but this is just fired me up to just get going you know me ain't gotta feel pretty fucking unstoppable after that before this shit you go back like what's gonna stop ya go get another belt get back get another boat show people I'm not you know not uh no no no yeah no yeah I'm even still run my god are you really fucking savage Jesus Christ to say 176 the other day dude I'd be in H 1 the real one a real Hummer yeah I'd be in one of those bitches and I'd ride in the middle of it I figure out a way to put the steering wheel in the middle on either side and strap me in with a race harness and put fucking airbags everywhere I want this thing to be like an inflatable bath toy I'm an adrenaline junkie so I love to do anything you know I shouldn't be riding obviously but uh you know I need something to steady my mind so like I said training trainings been going something I got back into riding something I got back into and it's pushing me to like move forward how long was it before you wrote again probably started riding again maybe got a month and a half what a month ago what a month Oh a month ago okay not a month in so five months after the injury if you did a month after injury this dude is fucking crazy get barely walk that's some shit I would try to definitely try what do you think makes you such an adrenaline junkie I don't know even right before all my fights like it's just been that way like I would always ride a lot before my fights because I had to release you know all the adrenaline all the pent up like anxiety anxiety yeah and that's just how I've always been you know I've always wanted to see what was it like to kill yourself you know what was it like to do something fun exciting push some women get on the end yeah that sounds very different I didn't like that there's so many fighters that are liked I mean Diego Corrales he died in a motorcycle accident right Paul Williams you know he got fucked up this there's so many fighters that have gotten into motorcycles for that very reason but it's not just motorcycles I mean I've done into all type of shit like what else I mean I love diving waters one of my favorite things the oceans one of my favorite things to do you know I've never been any situation while I buy the diet anything but you know I want to do skydiving I want to do you know rock climbing I want to do all these things honey show shellings on my page he and Joe are in the same fuck all that I don't even like roller coasters right so you drag me on it the first time then I'm like we're going again I'm like no fuck that do you ride bikes a little bit but I don't like it went down to the ranch with cowboy riding with him but they they make fun of me because I'll go like 61 60 then it starts the oh my god I don't know it must be cool cowboy example will be fucking going down the highway 90 with his hat off like resizing his hat you know no hands 90 down the highway he's what yeah or snapping pictures of us while he's riding oh jesus don't isn't that for sure I love that dude I don't want him to get hurt I don't want to hear that yeah fuck he's good at it I guess oh yeah I'm sure he is good at fighting too but it's fucking dangerous just like you should dot your i's cross your T's going 90 on the highway fuck that yeah he's a perfect example of a legit adrenaline jumper so yeah hundred percent hundred percent I guess just some people once I guess fighting is a big part of it like once you've experienced the highs of fighting I guess the lows of regular life are just too fucking boring is that what it is imagine that I feel like you would get I would definitely a man that thought about retiring but when I stopped fighting I think that's what that'll really bother me right like because I'm addicted to like not the adrenaline side of it like the challenge like the you can't do this like me versus the world like that that really gets me going I think if I didn't have that when I'm old I'd be pretty pissed off you versus the world but how so like I like even me versus me man versus man like one on one no other it's just you're the only one that you can the you can count on in that scenario but like that that personal challenge is what drives me and fuels me and that's why I like I think in my career the the fights that I wasn't supposed to win were always the ones that I really showed up for because that gym that that hit me where was if I was supposed to win everyone thought I was gonna win for some on some level I would not show up the same way very common that's very common okay yeah a lot of guys when when they think it's gonna be an easy fight they can't get up they don't they just have this weird and it's weird because like you don't you know your coaches won't let you not train the way like you train hard for the fight that something about that thing in your head doesn't click yeah it's like the thing that everybody hates the most about before a fight that discomfort and anxiety and just fuck why am I doing this fuck that is what is your friend when you're in there yeah yeah it's the fights were got an extent or that's what fucking drowns you at the same time being around people like fucking their whole camp is perfect and as soon as they walk out in front of that crowd that's like the coaches like who the fuck is this what the fuck is going on but don't you think but that's always that kind of person like a guy like you doesn't have that there's not that's not a thing that you experience you know I mean there's the type of people that crumble are usually like the guys who are just murderers in the gym and then for whatever reason none of the bright lights they falter but they rarely rise like those guys rarely win the big fights that they're not supposed to win that's not they're not the same psychological makeup mmm so I like something about the challenge or the unknown to some people it just over whereas other people whatever their psychological makeup is that challenge is what fires them up and gets them excited yeah yeah it's we I think insistency is the hard part and longevity for the fighters in general and that's what makes Floyd Mayweather so impressive to me is for him to be at the top of the game for so long and can make all the money and continue to be at the top of the game and still do that yeah yes is like you know the guys that blow up and then you know John Jones has trouble they don't know how to deal with the fame corner throw him shit through bus windows like it's hard to stay balanced and consistent through that whole I think for middle then the my biggest one of my biggest thing has been you know the mental part of fighting you know getting to the top being pushed back down getting to the top you know just dealing with that as a fighter has put a lot of stress on him like you know every time that I got into the cage like I thought or how I acted you know I'm performing yeah you you just some work with Vinnie Sherman right yep how does that help then he helped me a lot for I worked with Vinnie for other three years two or three years and I find that tell everybody Vinnie Foreman's a hypnotist who's going to show a couple times I actually I was the one that told you about that shit someone wants credit mm-hmm I made you Benny he says me it was a trip right wow this is real it really worked for me and then I find that as I've grown I think just like any technique you you get better at it and asset needs time to like on a resume inside of you and I feel I mean I haven't worked with him in over a year and I still I'm figuring out like oh that was the fuck he was talking about like this is Lee starts to sink in so I think it's been the mental game as a huge a huge asset do you ever work with the sports psychologist or a hitman to strengthen Lincoln I haven't I mean I've worked a little bit with a guy named well back in Florida this is some years ago but something I've always wanted to devil in something I want to explore I haven't really got the chance to do a lot of things but that's one thing I've always like I said the mental part has been key to me so I always wanted to do that it might be a good thing too help you during your recovery - you know like - just really concentrate on recovery and really concentrate on the parts your body that need to be fixed yeah I mean um but uh you know brilli need to reach out to the right people to get the right you know the help as far as like you know people are talked to it was Benny Sherman - the rest the backbone yeah he's probably listening he'll do it over Skype - you do it over you know you look in FaceTime I used to he says hypnotize me over FaceTime all the time and then get on fight day he would call me like would be backstage he'll be back in the states in October yeah yeah I'll look it up I'll make the connection I would definitely look into what we're definitely like but you've been using the lion's mane mushrooms - right yeah I saw mammoths yeah I said him that video and start talking to him but when I found out about what happened to him you know it was like I'm sure not as bad as what he was going through but like we just bet oh I don't know if he's gonna walk again Oh empty and I was in a horrible accident and then every time I talk to him he would just be like real like nah fuck them it's gonna happen that's fucked and uh I'm like are you need to take this lion's mane mushroom you need some of these cordyceps mushrooms take all the flavor ex CBD that you can get you know I'm gonna show you some other mushrooms is good for your brain you'll be cool and I mean look at him look what I did look joe-joe seen you walk it around and hearing that you're sparring and hitting the bag and hidden paths yeah I mean all these things put together it's just what's getting me back you know so it's nothing is impossible I mean I can prove that you know nothing's impossible and shit you know don't know like you said even though lion's mane and the different CBDs I've been taken in just getting my body back to like feeling good mentally feeling gorgeous everything's working like in steps so little steps at a time basically yeah it's day by day so we'd say like 80% now I'll give you 75 75 is good you know seven five minutes you can get to a hundred yeah you know like I'm running you know what I'm saying that was one of my big goes was like by in six months I want to be running nice let it go started running boom from a guy who couldn't walk exactly so that's awesome it's I don't know it gives me in the every time I think about it the reason why I stopped is because every time I have to talk about it I get into mental thought of it in the process of from going laying in the bed not be able to feel shit - you know dragging your foot after you're walking with a you know walker - being able to pull up your pants now it's crazy it is fucking crazy you know what I mean and it just keeps me in keeps me humble enough to just talk about the situation and love it love life it's a beautiful story man I love hearing things like that people recovering from things cuz it just it makes you appreciate the fact that you are all healthy everytime anything goes wrong in your life it's an opportunity to appreciate what it's like when things go right and if you can get back to where you were you'll have a new perspective I do for sure oh are you fucking with that lion's mane stuff - yeah my Hoth you take it I was taking every day I made a bunch of capsules with lion's mane and cordyceps you made the capsules yourself yeah you couldn't even buy it on Amazon little capsule machine make a hundred capsules a little concoction they're nice so when I saw on your show Paul Stamets was talking about how the I think it was CTE you guys were talking about the lion's mane helps a fine no I'm Affairs it er if it just helps like the it find a way around blockages or whatever was regenerates neural tissue no tissue and I was like Daniel like hit hit him up with it right now that lion's mane stuff is miraculous I mean there's it's amazing that more people don't know about it and that more people are talking about it but anybody that's involved in contact sports any athlete that you know it's getting hit and they're getting their cage rattled a lot they should be taking that stuff all the time you know and CBD as well right yeah for sure I mean I just look at it like the business that we're in is really dangerous I'm like if you know that there's something that you know guys we get punchy right our guys lose their chin or have problems like performing on fight night or whatever like if you can if you could take CBD if you better for swelling you can take lines me to prepare the concussions and shit that we're getting constantly like I just think you're kind of stupid if you're not yeah actively trying to figure out a solution to all these problems have you ever fuck with kratom I never not really I know people they have I was uh I was hanging out with Simon racks yesterday and he was telling me like some awesome stories about people that were addicted to opiates mm-hmm they got off of it with kratom I think it's all Simon Rex aka Dirt Nasty yeah I I took eight great eight pills yesterday which most the time I was taking two and then I took four and then yesterday I took eight now I get it that stuff makes you high as fuck yeah when you take eight my whole body felt weird I was I was like pretending to be sober I was walking around to pretend to be sober but not like drunk not not like reaction-time like you like I almost knock something off the counter I caught it real quick it's like everything's normal like your body moves good but you're like oh you feel weird you feel like you're physically mentally it's it's very nice it's like yeah gives you a body buzz but it's uh it's great at alleviating anxiety like it makes you really chill it's weird it's just like puts you in this nice headspace we just like like everything's calm I think the idea is that it fills up these opium receptors and that's what uh what people that have had real problems with opiates that's why they like it because even if you are fucked up on it you're not fucked up like you fucked up like whoo I feel something so I'm crazies going on and I was taking eight and my buddy Chris Bell he's the guy who directed that a bigger stronger faster documentary he had a real problem with opiates he got a pretty serious hip injury how to get hip replacement surgery and was in massive pain and when he has a serious arthritis like genetic arthritis and when he got his hip replaced and got on pain pills he got hooked bad in the middle of making a documentary about prescription drugs well just crazy in the middle of it he got hooked himself just total random you know was synchronicity and he takes ten he takes ten of those he takes two more than I took yesterday for like four hours I was walking around like this oh but there's no real like side-effects in comparison to the other stuff no no real side-effects after that Last Man Standing tournament with Gloria had three fights on one night my I had like super bad chest I have this contusion of my chest is still there the years later the swelling is still there yeah swelling in my sternum and it would pinch off nerves running down my shoulder and then I think it actually pinched off the nerve root which is when I started doing the decompression with the chiropractor and so my left side started like getting like it was noticeably getting smaller like it was the muscle atrophies because you know knows that well I didn't know you might know it Joe you know everything is that the nerve root actually feeds the muscle and allows it to grow once that's fucked up then your muscle won't grow anymore it's when you atrophy and shit it's very difficult to get to the grow back to if you don't catch it quickly right and did you have a problem getting to grow back or did you catch it quick well I think when we started doing the decompression and all that stuff it worked I mean it grew back I think but the the pain that I was feeling from all the shit I kept I kept getting vicodin prescriptions vicodin Norco link oh and you're literally in pain so I would take them of the medicine but uh after like two months like I looked at my kitchen counter and there was just empty pill bottles like everywhere and I noticed that I was like really fucking aggressive and like short and like I just stopped right away when I when I realized that but I could totally see how that would be that could become an addictive thing for sure I was there first Manning you really need it you know it wasn't like I was like trying to get wrapped up was like I'm in pain and take a pill and then did you go to a doctor and get it looked at yeah I went to what did they say about your sternum they said that there is nothing wrong with it we went to the hospital twice I woke up an hour woke up like screaming and shaking from the pain and went to the doctor in the hospital and they did an x-ray and so there's nothing wrong with that and I'm like look at the swelling it looked like a tennis ball and they said that it was like in her cartilage or between the ribs or it had gotten some sort of contusion you know somebody gets like hit an elbow and they're had swollen up the man was doing that under the rib or under the sternum plates or some shit so there's no pressure I just started taking advil like it was going out of style and then that would make the swelling go down and then I wasn't in pain anymore and the problem that I was having with the vicodin was it's not an anti-inflammatory so did nothing for the for the actual cause of the pain and I was just eating fucking Viking like crazy so and then yeah but now I pretty much eat I take Advil every day regardless for my knees hurting or my toes are hurting or like just years old not supposed to fuck with that stuff every day and not good on it gut health right well it's just that'll help I mean in a kimchi helps too probiotics kombucha but it's just it ruins your gut health and it causes inflammation this is what my friend Cameron Haines who runs ultra marathons he was taking 800 milligrams a day sometimes twice a day yeah and because he was in pain all the time cuz he runs fucking dude runs a marathon every day on Saturday night this Saturday coming up he's running for 24 hours and his goal is 120 miles in 24 hours I mean he's a fucking maniac so this dude's always in pain and I had doctor - Rhonda Patrick on she was explaining about how non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen actually cause inflammation because they fuck up your gut bacteria and they fuck up your body's ability to process information and it causes pain so he lists and there's there's connections to stroke and all the sorts of other problems so he gets off of it and all his pain went away his pain was caused in part by the fact that he was taking this stuff for his pain which is a terrible ridiculous vicious cycle what's up for how long straight was he taken he was taking it for years for years yeah he well cuz he's been a runner forever he's been doing marathons and all cheer and 238 miles last year the you know the Moab 230 which is the same yeah well people is that even possible takes three days three fucking days what's really crazy I'm sorry you after the first day we woke up next day like oh yeah you know that 24 hours of running so there's a type of mindset that you have to have to be able to do something like that that's just superhuman you have to be able to just do every step left foot right foot left foot right foot agony and pain all your toenails are falling off everything's in the I've seen them post pictures of those nasty fucking feet all fucked up yeah what's crazy is a woman beat everybody by more than 10 hours a woman who I had our honor Nevers Courtney dole alter she beat everybody by 22 miles she was 22 miles ahead of the second place dude that's unbelievable she's a fucking animal she slept for one minute in three days one minute for a minute miss Armstrong 22 miles come on I don't think steroids help in that world I think in that world those people are just it's just mental I really really don't think it helps and they'll get paid forget a little bit they get sponsors and shit right cam doesn't get paid mean you have sponsors Under Armour sponsors them and right not really it's just because they're good animals I know every step I'd be like ching ching Chile thinking about what am I doing this for well it's also you're used to psychotic interactions with other people in short amount of time like you used to like 20 minutes great description chaos I mean dude that last man standing was one of my favorite events I've ever been to I fucking loved it I don't want you to ever do it again cuz I love you fight fucking four times in a night oh man I kind of want to do it nestlé's Raz there's something about doing that you know you're doing something like special and you know epic like that was that was my main The Last Man Standing tournament that was like my main focus after the after I knocked out Simon Marcus and then and I guess I felt beat after the first two fights going the third one like I'm pretty sure I wasn't gonna beat our two most to beat up but I was like just had this crazy buzz about knowing and I was doing something like special like this was really fucking cool look I like to I would love to do it again I think that's how those people feel when they run in those crazy ultra marathons right they know they're supposed to do something insane I mean a regular fight is insane two regular fights in a night is insane three regular fights in the night against world-class kick boxers and then the first fight you had to go four rounds because after three rounds it was a draw what in the fuck man I had to do that shit right now always wondered being like a tournament like that now you're making you move back to MMA because kickboxing is just not what it should be I think we both feel that yeah kickboxing is one of my favorite things to watch I'm a giant fan of it and for whatever reason it is just not caught on in America the same way boxing has or the same way MMA has no and I've spent my whole my whole I've been doing it since I was 15 I'm 34 so all of that time I've been thinking about the same question like I'm you know it is what it is yeah it's like you can't hold on to it anymore he's not for me the sport is gonna grow is gonna keep keep doing good and I hope that that continues but for me I need to keep keep progressing yeah that is a that is what it is I mean that's the best way to put it because there's no way we're gonna fix it but I don't understand you know I mean I really really don't understand I fucking love and kickboxing and when people tell me about how they love boxing I'm like that's great boxing is great I love boxing too kickboxing is way better than boxing that extra level of you know throwing in kicks and knees and and especially if you go to Muay Thai elbows and clinch it's just it's a Wilder crazier striking sport mhm and I just don't understand it I mean when I watch you fight or Kevin fight or you know Kevin Ross or Giorgio Petrosyan John Wayne Parra how the fuck would you not want to watch that but it's so exciting and then continuously like that they just don't they don't tune in it doesn't like I don't know what it is I just don't understand it's this belt or have real problems with their ratings when they air it I don't know exactly what the ratings are I know that they're they're average they're not super fantastic on any besides below what their average is for their MMA fights yeah yeah for sure man it's a bummer it's a real fucking bummer because for you for anybody who's a fan anybody who likes watching it like shit like that event in LA that last-man-standing holy fuck was that fun mm-hmm that was crazy yeah that was that was probably one of the best cake box humans so I mean that was the best kickboxing man I've ever been to yeah me too the whole energy in the forum just in general that layout of that was was badass dad yeah that forum is perfect for that I mean everybody knew it was a special night like it was that it was crazy you know they were doing this you know what is it like knowing that like how much time do you have in between your second and third fight and everything is fucked up and sore and you know you're about to go into another fight I think it's probably like 30 minutes 3040 minutes like maybe one more one other fight between you so just enough time for everything to start hurting yeah yeah yeah I I guess I was because of the money like I knew that each time I thought I was gonna get more money and that was like my focus in the 30 minutes like not wanting to go back out never crossed my mind you know versus if I think if I wasn't getting paid for it I'm like yeah it's cool yeah that was fine you know what I mean so that's what I was asking about those ultramarathons how they right I get paid for it or not because I don't think that would be my main focus you say that but I think that if you were there just your competitive spirit would kick in and you would go let me see what I could fucking do here give me another man I had a nice cigarette yeah mile 79 and you're like shit I'll have to do is 21 more miles I could do that do you think you'd like to fight in a tournament like old-school UFC one style oh you know being part of that was turning minute it was dope being part of like that's no monthly tournament right I always wanted to be like you know yeah it was with Goodwood again you know find some of the best fighters in the world three times the night and that's really what's gonna test you to me yeah yeah there's so many factors involved so many variables right like your opponent could get a quick first-round knockout right and you could go a three-round war you know and then you face each other in the next round it's just I get the Commission's not wanting to do it anymore I get it the only place that would let you do is probably one of them Native American casinos it's like come on in Bobby come on the Commission is the Commission a problem I think they would do it in California you think so they did with chlorine when I did it yeah but that's kickboxing I don't know if they would do that with MMA even though kickboxing it's wildly widely criticized though a lot of people think that was a bad idea right well I think I think the way they can do it with kickboxing is because of boxing the boxing rule says like you have up to 12 rounds or whatever so free kickboxing that's three fights right right right yeah I don't know how that works with him I may know that makes sense with kickboxing that makes sense because I think they probably would have a hard time saying like Oh Daniel can fight ten rounds of MMA tonight that's probably what's the most rounds of kickboxing you ever fought a night but other than that tournament like one single fight oh five five rounds when I was fighting weight I was always faster pretty always always like that right you why is that I think thumb that the rule set in Thailand is a base primarily around gambling it's like human cockfighting is what Muay Thai ISM in Thailand essentially it sounds negative but it's kind of that way everybody in the audience is gambling and they're betting yelling and motioning back and forth of treatment betting so like in Thailand it's a three minute round but it's two minute rest which i think is awesome mm-hmm is awesome but you ever find it yeah yeah I fought for the WBC world title over there and Wow what year was this Jamie they play the music yeah yeah I'm sure and I find a Raja dominance stadium in Thailand which is like one of them Wow I was a dumb nerd and lumpini are the two dance I fought over there the two minute rest is cool except but you kind of run out of like things to talk about like I quote snares leaks uh and I'm like looking at ring girls did you fight a Thai guy no I'm both times now first time I thought he got from Argentina at ROG dominant Stadium and the second time I fought karapet Karapetyan from Golden Glory gym mm-hmm yeah for the WBC world title now when you um fight over there in Thailand did they still expect Westerners to take it easy on that first round because the idea is during the first round most ties they go fairly light because their weight ready for the betting to get established yeah they don't want anyone you I think you don't want to come out too stronk isn't nobody'll bet on you or against the other person mmm I don't think they expect that from the foreigners though I think just as a whole they think to the foreigners suck and like they think that foreigners won't block leg kick so a lot of times you'll see like the tides come out and just wreck the fucking foreigner in the first round and again so yeah I don't think they're expecting the foreigners to participate I was loved to go back in time and watch Ramon Decker great when he first got there right and that was like the golden era of Muay Thai in like the 90s when when they didn't have the you know right now it's their first round they don't really fight the second or the third round they fight in the fourth round they they may or may not fight depending on who won know who's who who won the first two they take it off this time they do nothing really yeah I mean not nothing but almost nothing they're not really trying to win because they know they're gonna fight in a week right and then like in the golden era it was like when like those guys would come on just it was it's a prime time and everybody would fight every wrong and it was supposed to lose butter tells Ramon Decker fights anybody who doesn't know anything about Muay Thai go on YouTube right now and watch Ramon debtors and watch chaos hmm that dude he fought guys who was his size - that was what was interesting about him is like he was a small guy it wasn't like a big guy who was going over there to fight the Thais lap he was their size yeah and he felt like the top top top guys and like that and like their prime which is pretty rare now you see like Sanchez super famous but like symchay isn't is is like the celebrity guy who's fighting like the older heavier Thais like the top ties right now in Thai later at like 120 pounds I mean 15 pounds mm-hmm and they're like 16 years old there's like the top guys right then you build a name or you're a big enough name that the foreigners know about you the rest of the world and market you and then you fight you know yeah you go to America and he fight an American you go to wherever he's like Sancho boo Cal those guys he's fighting constantly and he seems to be fighting on the road a lot he'll go to these weird places and fight some dude who looks like he's in real trouble almost immediately right you know yeah well they're like oh we're gonna bring Sanjaya for this fight and like always gotta fight somebody yeah it's hard and then a lot of times the ties don't fight each other like it's very rare that you'll see outside of like a Thai Stadium you know you never you're hardly you're not gonna see Yahtzee cly fight boo cow or like a Thai vs. hide they run the Thais to kill the foreigners and then still all be on the same team well Sanchez got such an interesting style too because if you looked at him if you only saw like a silhouette and you saw him move around you'd go immediately all that Sancho you could tell like instantly yeah is constantly moving shuffling his feet switching back and forth real light on his feet he just moves different than everybody else he does like the old Webber on some Webber on was like the original martial art of they turned into him wait I if you watch like the old Tony Jon like on Bach mm-hmm like whatever and they run up on your leg and like drop an elbow on your head right it's like the LeBron stuff I'm like a lot of the techniques that Sancho does like the cartwheel kick or like that games it he plays Lloyd Salah is another one that's really similar to him just fun to watch you see when they admit let Lloyd Zillah fight in lion fight against a do with zero fights with zero fights the dude had zero Muay Thai fighters less like over 400 and he got up to the top and he had kicked this dude into another dimension but it was one of those things where you it was inevitable from the first minute of the first round you like this guy was an MMA fighter not a bad fighter but just doesn't belong in there with lured Zillah it was ridiculous yeah and when when I put it online that please don't ever do that again like what Conor McGregor's gonna fight Floyd marry with it yeah that's for a hundred million dollars bro yeah kind of different pretty sure life I didn't say like anywhere close to that pretty sure the guy got his head knocked off for yeah bucks and it wasn't the same that guy's not Conor McGregor either Yeah right I mean if Conor McGregor fraud lured Zilla an MMA fight or a Muay Thai fighter I go okay let's see what happens you know I mean I don't think is gonna win but that might be interesting but you know seeing those guys in the the real high-level guys and seeing like what they're able to do seeing them the way they move and it's a it's so important for especially for MMA guys that don't understand the levels of striking there's when guys are just striking they're just there's some elite upon elite upon elite levels mm-hmm you know I mean it's it's such a black bow versus a blue bow yeah I feel like a really badass blue bow and then you like oh the black boat you just come completely lost like it's not even close you're just getting dominated yeah you just get shut down you know or like you're a good high school wrestler and you go against the no world Cheerios yeah I haven't yeah that's mean one of the more unique things about combat sports is that there are these deep deep levels and you don't you know sometimes you need to see like a guy like khabib nurmagomedov it's perfect example you got to see him fight against guys who you know are badass and see him smush them just a real difference right yeah the real I was like where this guy's at because he's not doing anything it's donal he's doing jump 360 wheel kicks in the air that nobody else can do he's doing things that everybody else does he's just doing them at a level that no one else is doing it at like 10 times the level of like a lot of wrestles ups they could be have you ever trained with him never trailer you just he impressed me yeah watching who was the best wrestler American Top Team and you were there who would you think who do you think the best wrestler a trainer I would it I mean wasn't a fighter had to be brownie I mean brownies a dog just coach was he was just what's name my brownie was it brownie Mike Brown wouldn't where's he out of 82 no but where it was he college wrestling or I'm saying Mike brownie not a a fighter was a coach Mike Brown who was probably the best wrestler oh the coach was interesting my Brandon was just had his hands he was just movement and strength it's just a dog and he wasn't a fighter just coaching wrestling yeah but he he had a college career too though yeah where'd he go I think he was in Boston maybe or what was my brand new phone no somewhere so he's never had any MMA fights no brownie yes yeah how many fought for the USC for fucking what was that before UFC over that young be urea you know and if everybody CAW say a good career Oh Mike Brown your son yeah you're saying Browning his Mike Brown I was like who's is Browning fought for the UFC through my rolodex I'm disowning browning browning who's browning yeah yeah no Mike Brown's released no he's a he's a bad motherfucker in his day cool motherfucker two very good when I was down in Haiti like he's brother favorite person I've worked with yeah well he's a great coach now - he was in Kobe Covington's Corner this weekend and I told me after the fight he's like dude this kid's cardio is insane he's like it's insane he goes I think it might be like just a natural gift that he has I mean he trains really really hard but he said his cardio is just off the charts hmm yeah interesting it's funny how much attention he's like I don't know if he wasn't that good before but it seemed a he got a ton of fucking attention and soon started talking shit oh for sure I mean just the talk shit attempt yeah well the talking shit got him to the dance but beating Mya the way he beat Mya everybody had to open their eyes up and go huh but a lot of people had doubts they were like dos Anjos is a fucking straight-up assassin he's going in there again against they got fucked up Robbie Lawler got murk Neil Magny like how's he gonna beat this guy and he beat the shit out of him he literally beat him every round was crazy like he watching I mean maybe you could give the first round of dos Anjos and you know he was always a threat because he still got power but Colby's just on and it was like Nick Diaz style just pop pop constantly constant attack constant kicking them constant punching them I was very impressed very impressed so I can watch it and it's a very impressive man that the most impressive thing was the pace he put on them because dos Santos is known for his cardio and he had a real problem with that cardio when he was at 155 because he diminished his body so much and then he moves up to 170 and you're like well now he literally doubled his output if you look at the strikes per minute in the 155-pound division and then 170 it was double at 1/7 and still Kobe melted him just just stayed stayed on I've kept that heat on it was crazy it's impressive very impressive but now he's got tyrant so mad Tyra wants to fucking kill him that is that's a different person my tyrant hasn't soma because he hates him all the shit talking Kobe's been doing he did interviews with people he told them don't bring up Colby's name I don't want you to even bring up his name because he didn't want Kobe getting any attention but now it's too late you know now he's got all those white anyone's name other than his brother all the time on any show ever period ever ever gonna fight now yeah he should be happy that guy talks a lot of shit now because that's what's gonna make him money you're right I mean fuck yeah how do you feel about shit talking I was never a talking but because I never wanted to be that guy that talk shit and come back at home so I like when people talk shit cuz imma beat yo ass anyways but you know it works for some it doesn't like I said for me it wasn't I was never one of those guys but it has been one of those things that like you see every every couple years it's those one guy that stands out ya talkin shit and it's like I had works for him then you start to see everybody tried chuckle right well I think Connor did that for a lot of people but Kobe saying some hilarious shit I'm gonna take this belt bring it to Donald Trump fuckin it's fucking fun no man it's working Sheldon hey I was like it's obviously fun like just it's obviously bullshit but it's fucking works yeah exactly but she'll still the bus see the manager I could watch him talk about anything yes that's fucking lie really like what well he's a smart dude it's really good yeah as little as a Instagram videos a dozen his collar fucking great yeah they're excellent oh great I would take a class from jail on how to like talk shit do that shit yeah man when he was fighting Anderson Silva those those were the glory days of shit talking and MMA he opened up the door for everybody feeding that Nogueira brothers a carrot is a carrot they thought a bus was a donkey I didn't know that they had the internet there I swear I didn't know I thought it was on a private forum the Internet and that guy's balls he went over and did the ultimate fighter in Brazil I mean went over to Brazil stayed there for six weeks and did the Ultimate Fighter and coached alongside Wanderlei and vamping they got jumped by a Dida yeah and Vandal II got so goofy on the show that vandal II lost Brazilian fans because Wanderlei was coming after him and Chael was trying to be calm about it and chose like look you know like don't touch me don't come near me and you know vandal he comes near me grabs him takes him down he's like what it was so it was so interesting like watching him turn it all around and have people mad at Wanderlei I mean the Brazilians were mad at fabulet like you're making us look bad a perfect plays a perfect yeah I mean there's there's a time and a place for shit talking and this is the time and this is the place yeah it just seems like to make money now it'sit's such a wise move I mean it's sports entertainment at the end of the day yeah this is why anybody wants to say or think about it like I've I mean I've watched two guys that aren't that good at fight you know like the tough man contest if it's marketed right and I think they're right the bouncers and bartender like whatever like fits they entertain it's entertainment some of the best fights have been against guys who aren't some of the best fighters Butterbean I love that guy the best fights ever sure I'm gonna start like yeah fucking tough man contest promotion well even good guys who aren't world champions like when a Toro got he fought Micky Ward we knew that they were both perfectly matched and they were just gonna collide in the middle of the ring and and beat the fuck out of each other but there's some of the classic boxing matches classic pressure didn't have to be for the heavyweight championship no no no I mean there's some been some amazing fights in the UFC they're similar that like Gilbert Melendez vs. Diego Sanchez right that wasn't for a title it was one of the greatest fights I've ever seen that shit was crazy the whole classic style makes fights I mean I've always like got the dishes two fighters that don't really have too much on the line and talking shit about a fight - the height behind the fight is what makes place yeah yeah as long as you can actually still fight that's what makes it interesting with the guy like Connor or guy like Colby they can fucking fight they're talking a lot of shit but when Aiden when the when the bell rings they're backing it up I mean that we were talking about this earlier but that's what bugs me most about CM Punk was that he has the the WWE background you would think he would least be like great on the mic you don't I mean they're like maybe we can't back it up or fight over like he goes from my cocky and confident I'm the vodka champ or whatever that would be eats like huh you know I just believe in yourself kids thank you it's like really hard to listen it don't believe me it has no physical like no physique he isn't it's not like it's a it's kind of sad I just shit on CM Punk no listen you didn't shit on me so you were honest about him you were honest about what you saw I don't think that's shitting on him he's a very nice guy he's a very nice guy and he's a hard worker but he does not have athletic talent he's missing a lot and he's a showman and when he was in the WWE he was allowed to say I'm not fucking Mayer and I throw his arms up there and they had it scripted so that he was the man but you know when you're in there with a guy like Mike Jackson who had zero fear of him and just was so casual and just popping him in the face anytime he wanted to and literally could've stopped him any time if he just got angry and want to stop him he could have stopped him at any point in the fight and even though he beat him decisively the performance was a piss Dana white off so bad the way he was fighting that he called him a fucking idiot and he said he'll never fight in the UFC again and he won so like if Mike Jackson went out there and just starch CM Punk with a right hand left hook combination and that was the end of it they would say well CM Punk you give it a shot that's it it's over Mike who would you like to fight next and now it's like you know you're not even fighting in the UFC anymore because you should have you should have stopped him like what you were doing he tickled him yeah he fucking don't make a joke of the sport like it's already like a joke if this guy you never won things CM Punk's like a fucking joke I guess he is that's why they look but like don't make a joke of the sport like not you know yeah they may kind of just like poking fun at the fans I get where Dina's coming from I get where dreams come on Institute I just started him yeah it's the whole thing was it was very weird the whole thing was very weird what like right away when you see CM Punk Holdings holding his hands up and moving stiff and throwing kicks like oh Jesus like I don't like that being on pay-per-view I understand they're selling pay-per-view cards but pay-per-view in the UFC should be the elite fighters curtis blades versus alistair overeem should have been on that pay-per-view card that's what should have been they're not not what we got to see you know what we got to see was just yeah I don't like when it's like now like you're playing a trick on the fence you know any mean you're promoting this guy is it'd be something and it's like yeah sparring videos come out and it's like what the fuck is this sparring videos are crazy and it's awful it was like a guy who just showed that off are awful it's like you took a dude who's no wrestling background no nothing and this one won't you do this is a jab this is the right hand and this is when you throw a kick I want you to pivot your hips good in there this bar I mean he just he doesn't have the ability to move his body right there's a lot of guys you could take out there that are tracking field guys or football players and you could get them to fight better than him in a couple of weeks right easily because there are athletes they're athletes they would understand how to shift their weight throw a punch and yeah that the sparring videos that I saw was out and he was for his first fight but even then like he wasn't he signed for like two years before he had his first fight or something yes but there's no way that you're six years deep in the game idiot you still had that bad you know I mean he doesn't have any talent it's all it is it just doesn't have physical talent whatever for whatever reason whether it's his approach his intensity whether it's it's not as coaching so what Duke fucking Rufus you know yeah I mean well the house dude that he talks about Duke Rufus he and then one of the pre fights he said uh how do you see this fight he's like I'd really like a head kick Duke would love to see a head kick like I don't think that's gonna happen oh that's so crazy that is so that's such a crazy thing to say um you know Duke's a beautiful person he's a great guy in every every sense of the word he just is he's a great guy he did is best you know there's only so much you could do I know I mean I'm sure you would love working with Duke I'm sure he would love working with you if you and Duke work together I'm sure you guys would have a great old time because you're Joe fucking chillings right and he's Duke fucking River though you know let him know but you know what I mean I mean you have to have something to work with you know I mean if Duke just grabbed some dude from a gas station that has been drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his whole life and and had him in a fight in six months how much can you possibly know but I would rather see that fight against each other that's fine we go well a guy you can find at a gas station beer and say what's interesting is they both both guys fought Mickey golf first just weird did you see his Instagram Miki's yeah he didn't like his own pre-fight uh the analysis of how it was gonna go was really good yeah well you know that was a disaster when I saw Mickey fight and then I saw that he was gonna fight CM Punk I was like who said yes to this why the fuck would you say yes to this this is a hundred percent guaranteed brain damage there's no way you're gonna beat him there's not you don't have a goddamn chance in hell you have no chance and I was saying that people get mad at me - CM Punk fans getting mad at me I'm like look this is what I do my job is to analyze shit I look at I look at fighters I look at me I understand what I'm talking about man this is like I'm got a pitbull and I'm gonna put him in a cage with a puppy what do you thinks gonna happen the pitbulls gonna kill the puppy this is whether this is how it works this isn't like this isn't glut maybe that puppy's gonna grab them by the face no no no no listen to me I'm telling you guys this is how bad this matchup is this is a this is a Brazilian Jujitsu brown belt with a nasty back game well I mean long and fast you look at a matchup with the CM Punk just had Mike Jackson make him beep my checks in like under a minute right yeah smushed him took his back strangle him he's in he's up and I heard training with me for like three months now and the kids getting really good his striking is getting really really good he's fucking talented man really good and he talks a lot of shit - yeah he's good plus he's got hilarious walkout music when he comes out - Oh Mickey yes that's him there was he got here I called his phone it's like you know those people have those ring back songs and they're like fucking horrible yeah he answers I'm like dude turn that fucking shit off you change it or at least have it be hey Mickey you're so fine yeah and what is his music is on some trash it's just just elevator like something fucking change it Mickey when is he fighting again I don't think it has anything booked yet where uh he's he's calling shelled Shawn Shelby so he's working with you with his striking yep no no he's helped me on my ground game and who is he working with his ground game out here Oh Jason manly and uh Bamba fast Gonzalez where's that out of Palma trades of me and Jason manly is a the training that muscle Pharm that's cool so where is he is he staying in Burbank out there is he staying near you he's staying there me and Eagle Rock nice he's actually roommates with Eve Edwards no shit yeah oh that's yeah we got me up against little love Eve goodness love dude thing going yeah man he's great isn't he he's a great dude he's a great dude he's very good on the desk - it's interesting to see like former fighters on the desk like some dudes are lost and some dudes are smooth you know some dudes are very good at it he's I think he does great writes barely I think he's one of my favorite ones to watch yeah I tweeted about it up like years ago when you first started doing them like I really appreciate him doing it you know Mike Bisping is very good attitude yeah although he and Colby got out it was a little awkward they went after it after the after the fight like Bisbing can't not talk shit Riley now itself which I kinda I really appreciate that about him actually well he's he's a dog man his competitive drive is pretty intense you know Bisping is in my opinion like one of the best but he's like one of the best poster boys for just hard work mental toughness and determination yeah and also being that like British dude at the bar that alike have a beard tell you to go fuck yourself piss off you yeah yeah yeah good he's got problems with his other eye now too does he yeah he got some sort of a detachment in his other eyes good eye I thought they were gonna fix fixed one I thought it was like well they would got there he's got some sort of oil in it that protects it before he retires and then when he retires he's gonna get it operated on to fix it but now he has a new problem with his right eye he was seeing some flash or something that his right eye and he went to the doctor and found that's got a detachment there yeah he's like far I fucked this I'm done he was gonna have one more fight yeah and now he's like I'm done he did it all man yeah he won the ultimate fighter he won the title you know yeah and and now he's a good analyst - yeah he's got the desk cushy thing go on his podcast I think you're great - mm-hmm he's doing good that is a bad thing too right yeah he's always got something going on it's nice that guys do have those other options - like podcasts and different things now there's there's ways out you know especially looking like what jobs done Schaub is taking it to a whole nother level I mean he's as far as guys being able to get out of them out of the fight game and then make a living as a podcaster he's fucking doing stand-up now and headline in clubs and shit and traveling all over the country and he's good man he's fucking fun he's a funny dude yeah it's hilarious you know it's just nice that fighters have options cuz you know seeing a guy stick around when he shouldn't be doing it anymore it's one of the hardest things for sure and then he look like all the NFL guys or any pro sport most those guys are broke by the you know with him like four years of when they finish mm-hmm and yeah there's not a whole lot of other options for a lot of guys so I think it's good it's nice that we have other options yeah never share so would you sign them showed everybody the way I here job there's a way you know there's a way there's ways you know especially with the internet man there's just crazy ways I mean how much money think Mighty Mouse makes on his twitch stream let's say a decent amount I don't know much this is like the video game yeah dudes twitch stream and they don't even like the best gamers in the world and they make thousands and thousands at all pages on there all the time would you say he's planning something right now sugar Sean's in it too ah we're watch it but he had song rampage does that too I think so yeah he's a good be camera he's always talking about is he still active is he still gonna fight again yeah I was trying to get a fight with him not too long ago and I'm not sure what he's like 290 pounds right now yeah but I feel like yeah I figured that for that size I could do that I think you do know I could beat rampage I don't know if I'd go for like Brock Lesnar well anyway we targeted fight few because he doesn't he doesn't try to take you down right most likely he's gonna try to stand with you right yeah do you have a set schedule for you return to MMA I'm hopefully gonna get something around September August late August early September I think and you just decided that we're kickboxing is right now just doesn't have enough juice yeah I you know I want to keep progressing financially and you know I guess ed money motivates me a lot and if I've reached the ceiling of the sport so to speak and there's a live amazed right here right next door and yeah that makes it yeah you say you 34 yeah I mean how many more years you think you're gonna do it uh four five four five yeah I want to make big fights as much money as I can and set up for you know life after fighting I think you know you can't just quit right you got to find ways to market yourself the highest level to get as much attention as possible to the irrelevant and the space that you pass and I just don't think that kickboxing is is gonna get me there you know yeah man it's a bummer but I think you're right I think it's a smart if you're just dealing strictly financially I think it's a very smart move it's very unfortunate I really wish there was a solution I do not know what it would be though I mean everybody's tried Spike TV tried and they tried the paramount Network they tried with glory you know one thing and also with Bellator it you know maybe I'll come back maybe there's a big fight you know maybe Musashi's like you know what I think I want the Bose or kickboxing title I'll be right yeah let's do it right yeah but I would fight if they left me I would fight fucking kickboxing first win that fight and then come back out the same night in fighting my man really hell yeah I brought it up I brought a left to cooker meaning not too long ago what'd they say they just kinda looked at me looked at me when I said it'll to fire a red page a better way now what is mandalas deal is he back like what's going on with Wanderlei I don't know I just saw there's a opportunity when jail beat him you know his complaint was it you know he just took her battle laid on top of him yeah been kind of my complaint for a while so I figured but they don't want that fight no no why don't they want that fight well I think it vandal they already had his face surgery done one side only ones that was in place rampage is my buddy but he to see this is the one that way you want he said he wants the easy fight like Wanderlei well there's a lot of history between those two guys too yeah that makes sense if you don't know you know if you're gonna fight for him yeah he was a very there was an interesting story to write when he was fighting over in Pride and then he came over to the UFC just completely different human being yeah you know just in the rampage fights when rampage fought him over and prod and there also a lot of miles on him too he had to think of both things you know no just got me thinking about felony talking about uh you know fighting felony the fighter Crazy Horse Crazy Horse has now changed his name to felony ladies and gentlemen no longer referred to him as crazy yours you ever see that fight backstage swear swears up and down yeah beat him up like the sleep that was somebody else but didn't he k he says he ko'd Wanderlei said he sucker-punched him but didn't after he got choked out on the video that you see he fought later on that night and won by knockout I think yeah after being choked unconscious in the back and he said he knocked out Wanderlei or handily wins yes yes and xand only win no no happened before he fought in the locker room and he went out in one and then he says he knocked out Vandelay punched him and knocked him out van de leeuw went out and won a decision so van de Leeuw if he's telling the truth he Kayode Vandelay earlier that night this is van delay when you know that doesn't even look like the same person I know as no sane person yeah that was got the Mario Brothers yeah muscles he attacked this dude and he got caught in a triangle I forget who it was that did this to him but it was one of Carlson Gracie's black belts a Vegas how big is a felon Gary no you got a 55-pound maybe yeah he's out cold here right yeah out cold oh they're very nice to him well they say slows eyes open up it's like what I think like uh you did I saw a clip hitting your the guys to ask you uh what's the practical use of jujitsu you're like well the street if we got in a fight I would kill you that's like I think people don't realize that like without the ref to like stop the fight or like though even those guys like they stop them like okay I'll let him go he's already unconscious like that would kill you yeah it would be dead yeah you would dead if that guy doesn't want to let go of you just holds on till your brain doesn't work anymore yeah and that's a wrap and that's that yeah that's that's real yes that's my friend Erik trying to come up with some excuse to not work out that's why I said what's the practical use jujitsu another crazy horse fight these two guys in the basketball court I think I got a big fight then I take oh really really quick he attacked a guy oh yeah he fucked up son oh yeah oh he thinks he's a badass and he doesn't know how to fight oh look at this Oh Oh punch in the back of the head oh shit look at this that he's still trying to punch him hilarious it's taking that leg apart though right here [Applause] he's no playboy give motherfuckin ass in that position he's telling the truth here right all he has to do is yank that fucking thing up clockwise and that's a wrap pop pop that horrible pain of getting heel hook did not happen oh not the business especially that inside heel hook that is so nasty when it goes across the body the amount of torque on your knee it's just like no way your knee can hang in there it just rips apart mmm I'm good on new surgeries is that that porous yeah well he does he does outside and inside but the inside one is just the outside one you got a little bit more there's a little more movement like this right I mean you got a tap of that but the problem is when someone's got you in this way across the body and then they go like that man you got about an inch or two of just it's horrible - it sounds terrible you could hear that everything pulling apart snapping off the bone and people screaming Paul Harris would not let go either that was his thing he would just hang on to heel hooks it sounds so bad it sounds so bad I got a guy with a fucking Kawara there's Americana I'm not sure what the difference is but uh-huh it sounds like at this Americana this is the Camorra and it sounded like ripping a towel terry cloth towel if you pull it off part and the fibers start popping that's what it sounded like it's still hear it in my head t-tapp I mean after and yeah he's like oh it's cool it's cool like that's like fucking cool I didn't need to break your fucking arm you could have just tapped dickhead yeah I so I gotta hear this shit in my head all night I saw a video of a street fight there's another video where the dude gets a guy in an Alma Plata and he's pushed his arm up you see the art guy's arm just get out on a street fight yeah good groundwork though dude is nice on Alma Plata in a street fight it's always a plus right I mean the street fight game is changing you know dangerous super dangerous kid it was like on the playground it was like flying like Karate Kid dances shit you know now they're gonna be like rear naked choke and each other Oh little kids little kids grow up watching Bellator in the UFC and kickboxing they know what a leg kick is now they know all that shit they know how to grab the back of the head other kids are yelling Nene yeah they know what to do now oh is this it yeah this is it yeah this is awful the dude gets he brings that leg oh that guy that guy though the top has no understanding of what here it is Oh sir I'm just gonna here comes here comes here comes watch this get ready and here comes the noise it's awful man the sound oh there it is oh look at it just laying fucked up backwards on his arm oh don't move it Jesus Christ laying like he must have been drunk too cuz like he didn't pull his arm out he had no idea what he was doing listen yeah do you guys see though you don't know yours you smoke Daniel is that what that is cigarettes there these are empty it was something here come on man do you smoke cigarettes yes how often you smoke how many how many a day I tried to go half aback Jesus hanging out with this motherfucker it's okay this is part you just gotta get it in he's gotta go ahead just not have you ever tried to switch to vape or anything like that I've done man listen I've done well they chewed try to stop um everything I just I'm a individual you're an individual when you smoking when you're when you're the current WR champ that was okay damn that's so crazy he's swimming since I was like chewing and smoking some toes yeah 12 13 there's a lot of Thai fighters to smoke right Scott Bosque doesn't eat doesn't he always smoke there's not a lot of fireman a lot of fires I don't like put it out there and I spoke to Lee Bob last but a lot of fighters that you know at high level in the UFC smoke cigarettes I used to try to hide it like that we that used to be one thing you know hide it and then you always oh I can't believe your athlete you're smoking intellect all right they're here you talk then they go man are you an 80 year old blue singer fuck's going on with your voice man they give that hard living voice there's definitely a benefit and a level to like not hiding who you are like it was somebody about that day like it is nice than that I could say that I smoke weed and yeah be myself whatever it's a shit especially weed you know I mean there's a lot of people that have some dumb ideas about what we does to you you know and it's nice that guys like you were out about it so you could realize like thank you Joe really guys like you are out there to pro-athletes abut I'm a STONER I'm a comedian makes sense but pro athletes like seeing like that a guy like who takes care of his body smokes weeds not it's not ruining his career like the other thing is that people want to think that it's lazy piece yeah that's what bothers me most about the consitent like the misconception of it is like that you're not a productive person that you just sit around the house and highlight some day I got Sunday I sit around the house motherfucker yeah but every other day I'm working my ass off constantly you learn those days off though for sure for sure there's a photo in the green room from Ryan Loco shout out to Ryan yeah you uh smoking cigarettes in is that lab from Last Man Standing it's in between fights yeah yeah I think it well I don't know if it was last man standing or if it was it was the locker room one of the glory fights I don't know if it was between fights or not yeah there it is that's up in the green room right now it was like Jimi Hendrix and Elvis right we have the same the four picture yes yeah yeah I got a gang and new ones coming now I got uh Steven Tyler when he was a teenager got arrested for weed I got him I got a mug shot I got the real Jimi Hendrix mug shot not the not the photo that we had on before which was like his real mug shot label but the photo was like from one of them Jimi Hendrix Experience photos we got the real mugshot photo no Jimi Hendrix has some heroin and I'm trying to go to Toronto with that hair on there it is right there yeah when someone tried to tell me Jimi Hendrix didn't do heroin well tell that to the Toronto Police Department when they fucking arrested him for it there's a picture of me Mon Instagram I saw they did it was a Bruno Mars fucking Justin Bieber they're like two other rich celebrities wherever they were all smiling in their mug shot and it was like when you know you have bail money yes they just got Vince Vaughn yeah yeah they just busted him DUI yeah drinking and driving is a good I got buzzed I got a DUI when I was 20 22 on shrooms verbs and do drunk they tested you know patent they didn't give me for this rooms but they fucking helped me for the deal I would think that maybe the shrooms would help balance out the booze yeah the problem was I kept arguing with the guy and he's like trying to get me to blow on the street and I'm like oh yeah I think nothing happening like pretending to blow and then I take me downtown and I was like in and out of like falling asleep and I kept like waking up and they had like tup DUI the breathalyzer machine it looks kind of like this or whatever the actual big machine and I remember it like argument like what happens if I don't blow and he's like the new year you get suspended for six months I'm like and what if I blow and it's a DJ it's bad as he was suspended for a year like then I asked him that back and forth like 20 times I kept falling asleep that would make you want to not blow that's ridiculous to pitch so by the time you go to jail or you go to court anyway your suspensions almost up so I ended up I ended up getting off on that because it was a they pulled me over for turning the wrong way on a one-way street but I just showed that I wasn't I didn't do any field sobriety tests I'm not drink and drive I'm trying to back it up but if you do drinking I didn't do the field sobriety test so they didn't have any probable cause that I was actually drunk and when he didn't blow and they said well he was driving the wrong way to one my street doesn't go never been to that area before so website no technical blog below mmm yeah hmm Nevada DUI good for you okay driving a fucking motorcycle man you better be sober plus you're smoking cigarettes now pay attention what you doing I mean with uber and lyft and all this shit now yeah it's kind of pretty responsible to get a fucking DUI I bet it's dropped down significantly because of uber nerfed I really bet it has for sure thanks listen boys let's wrap this bitch up thanks for bringing me all this stuff Daniel much love and appreciate hey my pleasure dude and best of luck in your recovery it's a great story I love hearing it and just all the best man thank you Joe Sheila you know and Daniel Straus on Twitter and on Instagram Joe underscores chillin and my you know I had this
