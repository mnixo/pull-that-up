[Music] hello freak bitches [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I think you have the pedophiles getting controlling pet the pedophiles is a sweetest dog in the world seriously you've been asking for him to be on the show forever he's just gonna he'll do the rounds he'll go to you hi what are you doing in here everybody for years it's a guy had all series on my Instagram page of people doing the okay sorry of course including me back when I had earrings yeah and the other thing is we're at a point now where it's more easy to give the finger to someone than to say okay yeah geez you blur the finger out and nobody cares yeah but if you do that what is he doing knees touching his fingers you can't even do like you're holding a joint cuz that's like a white power joint like if you like doing that like a roach that's bad that's bad how do you do you have to use a roach clip it's a ploy by the roach clip industry she was drunk and I was just trying to avoid her I was trying to avoid her I was just trying to avoid her and she goes to me you think your fear factor yeah listen bro I feel what you're saying and I was only fucking around I was feeling some dead space where we're trying to recalibrate our reality due to your circumstances and your story being paradigm shifting I'm not that fucked listen I want to tell you bat man I'm giving you a shout-out I love you pretty Louise oh no gay stuff this is a late night podcast there's a lot of dudes that are listening to this in the shower bat Ruskin I didn't do this to be mean I just did this because that's my nature I am the scorpion you are the Frog this is how shit goes down have you ever watched a rodeo and felt sorry for the Bulls so originally taurine was extracted that way but it is an ingredient in bull semen okay so the taurine and Red Bull probably doesn't come from bull semen but taurine is in bull semen okay so Hitler was getting his Torrini and right from the tap the best way is to suck upon it do you get it from the tap when it is fresh the 700-pound more potent the furies just gets down there they they hold the ball back with straps and buckles it's checking in Hitler gets his sloppy Nazi mouth right over that fat oh and that is apparently the origin of that upper lip mustache catch all the succulent drops when he's choking on jizz flavor savor and that giant bull dick is pummeling the back of his throat and uh fills it up that when he comes out of his nose because a lot of the jizz comes out of his nose that's just enough mustache to catch the jizz so that's why he had that mustache a lot of people don't know the imagine if women had dicks and men had pussies and we were just really into big dicks to us just as possibly that's entirely possible isn't it entirely possible that all these futurists all these technological innovators they all see the same endgame but isn't it entirely possible I mean like I mean it's entirely possible I think it's entirely possible the Clintons are murderers I think it's entirely possible and people like John Anthony West and yourself and some other folks like Graham Hancock are proposing that it's entirely possible that there were many different eras of construction in Egypt and it's entirely possible and I think it's entirely possible that Lee Harvey Oswald well you can't be good at everything yeah that's a fact it's not possible if you had a magic wand and someone said you could do whatever you want to fix this what would you do you know like if you were the king of the world I said Edie what are we gonna do then let's say you become president you gotta become president well you think we're gonna shatter the guy shot all right president Bernie what do you do so fascinating yeah I've always thought that was fascinating it really is fascinating that's fascinating there's actually a documentary a fascinating documentary this stuff is so unbelievably fascinating it's like I look at things that are fascinating to me absolutely fascinating Roosevelt fascinating I'm fascinated by wolves I'm so fascinated by animals so fascinated that is a fascinating book Alaska's a fascinating place the mind is a fascinating solution that's fascinating it's a really fascinating man prison doesn't begin and end at the gate prisoners in mine it's locked in one world that's dead and dying or it's open to a world that's free and alive hold on this guy sounds like me a podcast well do you know the story for its harbor right the guy yes you know that's one of the really cool things this Dan Carlin thing on on the history the Mongols to the risk of repeating myself over and over again which I do all the time but when you eat marijuana its processed by your liver and it produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolite smell is a weird thing there it's really weird that we all accept that there's some invisible shit then we can take in with a hole in our face and what I say is the fart theory and the fart theory is if someone farted and you couldn't smell it you'd have no idea that there's something around you it's totally completely invisible but if someone farts you fucking smell it but if you didn't have a nose you'd be just sitting in someone's stench how do we not know that there are an infinite amount of things that we just can't detect I have a theory on that it's called the fart principle I have no understanding of how that principle could relate to this but I'm all ears this is why this is a bad example this is a bad example but it's not a bad one if you fart and you didn't have a nose no one would know if we didn't have a sense of smell if we didn't have a sense of smell we could still get along in this life I agree there was a way to visually see if food is individual elucidation there's all saying but what I what I'm saying is it's entirely possible that there's multiple dimensions or multiple things that we can't perceive that we haven't we don't have the senses for no I I believe pull this thing like right up fist from your face there we go I always do battle ropes to take a look at how well this microphone up to face a lot of fist from your face right this like a fist from your face pull this microphone like a fist from your face there we go grab this mic and keep it like a fist from your face that's a good reference good perfect one boom and we're live up to that microphone young lady especially the comics where they go when they get that sick grab that microphone I'm sorry about it universal basic income this is what this is all about yes yeah that's what my campaign for president is all about it's a Springfield Missouri Hope talking the microphone it's in Springfield Missouri I read The God Delusion in in preparation for this keep pull that microphone right up to your face just get it about a fist away from your face you have to move ok the microphone move for you psychedelics give me hope for real not joking it sounds ridiculous because people associate psychedelics with with non realistic things with hallucinations they they they don't look at it the way I look at it I'm wearing with okay do I try it or do I not or if you wanted to do something what I would recommend is um going to Peru and doing like an ayahuasca retreat and do one of those after you recommend it for me to do I asked I'm sitting at the table and time John I'm people are like well why are you down here you know I'm like oh well a good friend of mine had suggested to go and and I'd mentioned your name and they're like but Joe and this is before my first drink and I'm thinking what the hell I'm all the way in the Amazon you should go to Mars and and dimethyltryptamine which is the active ingredient ayahuasca if you've done that Alex have you ever done DMT no do you want to you've done regular DMT too right yes does the experience mirror taking synthetic five Meo DMT the vo rad psychedelic experiences I had a crazy dream last night that was I had DMT trip in my dream so if you just fed DMT synthesized to sheep it wouldn't be toxic but I'm gonna tell you about is your brain produces a chemical while you're sleeping but I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna be honest about it you actually the one that turned me on do at the the DMT the story of Moses and the burning bush to the acacia bush and the Keysha tree which is rich in DMT you know once I did I wanted to do it again and again and again they say you shouldn't do too much Mike laughs okay you know I don't think you should listen to the people say you shouldn't you know too much I think you should do it as much as you want that's what I agree with - yeah so my whole life since I was about my first memories were every night was a DMT trip so I basically I don't want this to sound arrogant it's not I've seen everything listen we all know about Gerry Epstein okay and I don't know about your little Oleta Express just google that and what is that Bill Clinton's like on 20 flights first of a cell oh that's right and then he was also flying to this this Middle Eastern country with his Sheikh that's a mitad pedophile with multi-million dollar checks at Bill Clinton on the plane and Bill Clinton is a known sexual predator okay so all this stuff's going on and so they start bringing up lawsuits against Donald Trump with jane doe's claiming he'd been with Epstein even though there's no proof in the law because they make you log even on private jets none of it was ever true so this is a place Bohemian Grove and the idea was that there all the elites would go there and they would engage in these occult rituals this is in America yeah there does seem to be amongst the American ruling elites that does seem to be a proclivity for ritual so Alex films these people worshipping Molech the our God there's there's a photo of it there this is real yeah I mean they really do have a giant owl and they really do burn some sort of a sacrifice in front of this owl this is real like this isn't like you hear things like that like well that's nonsense right because you know we went in separately because Alex got it into his head that maybe I was part of the Bohemian Grove oh you like deep deep inside yeah but I was like learning events and he was so he went in separately to me he won't far the undergrowth but when you see that Vinnie you have to go okay what is this it's been in the newspaper that the cell towers are being used for mind control that sounds like a schizophrenic the significance of the research he explained is that although the cellphone power is low electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless have an effect on mental behavior when transmitting at the proper frequency what is this article Jaime 96 about human-animal hybrids with pigs and cows yes you got to make you part cow so the cow keeps you doesn't reject it or part pick MIT MIT Technology Review estimates that about 20 pregnancies of pig human or sheep human chimeras have been established during the last 12 months in the u.s. total wuss in 2016 by hundred percent believe it China has made pig monkey hybrids Alex Jones says they're doing picking with you I bet he's right okay I guarantee he's right I've talked to hundreds of people now not on air but I'm gonna make a film on this who've taken ayahuasca and DMT I've not taken it and for obvious reasons and and it's unbelievable because I mean they a hundred percent in San Francisco is the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating and they've got like astronaut level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making intergalactic deals and Rick and Andrew have together developed a technology for releasing DMT into human volunteers in a very slow drip that will keep them in the DMT state if they wish for hours on end and and the intention the intention is to use this technology to explore and map the DMT realm there was the 34000 there was a lot of fuckin Nazi scientist brought over on YouTube it says Operation Paperclip was anywhere from like 1200 to 1500 cessation the total number of admitted congressional hearings in the 1970s Frank Church Committee in the 70s released it numbers thirty four thousand two hundred and seven that's why we grab those Nazis we were like if we don't get them the Russians I love it and the Germans actually some other signs was the Russians technology operations all of that was to beat back the Russians when the Russians tried to build their space shuttles half the size mm-hmm that was actually the German plan the defectors or those who come over from the other side who we learn from and they just disappear into Eman they disappear a sort of the CIA's version of witness protection but I mean it is fascinating they brought those people over here and that's where the the space program came from for the shirt not as a sick joke they already had the CIA that was OSS okay that CIA is OSS that's all on record okay I'm glad you questioned me OSS again office of special plans that was before the CIA and then the sort of like the Office of Strategic Services what is this right here you brain it up Jamie Jamie pull up some video of Al Jolson in blackface but since you brought up the alle magic pull up hermaphrodite find out that's true I need to know I much prefer yours is to what the fuck is this Jamie the Korean grandmother's are cell sex how do you pull these up so quick what what do you have on tab how strange is it that we put I cannot a

of having Tasers they should you have like Earth's they should have love necklaces with like little vials that are just like filled with AIDS blood and then everyone knows what that is and so if somebody's attacking like hey I got my AIDS blood we all know this we all knew this growing up who are the sluttiest girls [Laughter] this is a contradiction in terms he's like a really bright retort you know this retard Oh Martha bomber you know English people write things different world it's about WR o LD instead of wo rld yeah like Wong did you just make that up I always get I say world and

you're walking around with those fucking vampire blues you've got the fucking heavy heart you and you can't feel happy and you feel bad it there may be an action that you need to take that you're afraid to take that's the vampire I love my country a country boys good enough for me like we are as evolved as I need let's stop right here can you talk if you can listen to a chancer so my fuck is stupid I love my earth in the center of the universe love my earth I love my sticks and bows and arrows left I love burn tears I love my swing I love my slave I love my love burning witches anybody try to take my cutter poked away come to me I love my scroll I love carving I love walking I don't need to ride any horses I don't need domesticated enemies that's complicated everybody wants to domesticate horses got to come through me I love being a hunter-gatherer of having a lifespan I love being a single-cell organism good time down near the bottom of the ocean floor anybody wants to change her gonna come to me I love being a carbon molecule I love existing a Big Bang conditions hello family I love the protons but I want to change that and then I had to ask myself well where could that knowledge have come from and through Egypt we then start to find that Egypt itself looks back to an older time the ancient Egyptians didn't regard themselves as the beginning of their story they regarded themselves as quite a late point in their story and they look back to the time of the gods which they called Zep tepi the first time when there was a Golden Age and they speak and there are texts the air through building texts which speak of the gods living on Island a gigantic flood coming most of the gods are killed odd thing to happen to gods and then they come and settle in Egypt the survivors come and settle in Egypt and so Egypt is the product of an even far earlier civilization but but the history of Egypt goes back way way further than people think it does that's my view you have been at the front of the line for decades talking about these lost civilizations and I from reading your work I mean I think I've first read your work in the 90s you exposed me to a lot of these what were at the time controversial ideas that have now been substantiated by actual evidence particularly gobekli tepe and I mean the the the all the water erosion stuff on the Sphinx and I've since had dr. Robert Schoch on the podcast to talk about that as well but all this stuff was at one point very controversial and now far less yes there have been a great number of changes in the last 20 years which which have worked generally in favor of the arguments that I've that I've proposed as you know I had my own long-term relationship with cannabis I smoked cannabis for 24 years I overindulged I undoubtedly abused my relationship with cannabis I don't blame the cannabis for that it was me I was I I was crazy I was crazy I look crazy I mean it's very crazy to smoke it from 9:00 in the morning until 2 o'clock the next morning 7 days a week or rather vaporize it as I as I did and and I reached a point thanks to a of ayahuasca journeys in October 2011 where I made the decision that I wouldn't smoke cannabis next three years have come since then but I want to live in a society where I and fellow adults are free to choose either to use cannabis or not to use it because I want to spark up a joint right now do you want to dive in right now of course the gel you're like you're like the SIP and didn't sure you want yes that's bats is back are we seeing that is um you're going in for another baby hey look good that's it stop right there right get confused on the way back we will see so here it is Lebanon Joey is one of those guys like the first I think we have first Easter we invited to him him to him my dad got along really fun he gave my dad my dad marijuana hey fucking I was there yeah tell him what he was doing offered him offered him some popcorn yeah and then Joey just starts laughing mr.

there's that that's what a lot of the guys are into unfortunately just sets the bigotry can the community waterboard these around what fucked getting butt-fucked by waterboarding it's the new black so what you're saying is a 10% gay I'm open with it what does that mean does that mean you're 10% gay I came out on my podcast probably like six months ago you came out ten percent yes what's so funny having fun matters it does and that's why you should tell us about what happened in Thailand well it wasn't fun it was you enjoyed it no to completion everybody people hung out you know it's that's the cops come plug it buildings on fire bodies everywhere what happened people hung out and then you go upstairs and then it's a little different you're getting a little like whoa looks a little different in there that the bone structure is interesting but I see some other people dancing and then there's this one club that you go in it's like I guess the best one up there and it's just they're having a party it's fun the girls look like girls but you can tell like maybe some are guys I guess but it was one of these ladyboy bars and we're hanging out there having fun and they'll you know they they will touch you they're very forward they will touch your leg but they look like girls they smell like girls they look like girls they've had the treatments and you're sitting there and you're alone by yourself you're in you're in Bangkok you're working on hangover too they touch and it's normal to get aroused and it was interesting and I knew I was sixteen hours away timezone from America and I know comedians have gone down to Brazil or Thailand there's old history of it so I didn't really pursue it there but I thought about it and then maybe I came back on another night I go you know people thought I was witness you said maybe no you came back right well I was there for like two weeks and rylann twice and maybe I came back well now you're making this story confusing okay well what one world came back another night I said maybe I will come back yes always you said that's the reason why I stopped you so I want this to be finished at that point uh probably three percent gay and they stopped getting picked on as a kid like Brody you walk like a girl do you understand Jimmy think you're only up in Tarzana I got picked on a lot are you saying that someone can make you homosexual by if they picked on you enough three percent would be a hundred no three percent wouldn't make it a hundred but if somebody as a child you're in third grade and there's a group of girls or even guys you go oh look at Brody oh he walks he looks like he's gay you walk like a gay gay kid you're always smiling and it was like it was a nice kid and then I guess because I have a tilted pelvis I oft weird when it got picked on for that so I always felt like wow I guess I think I'm gay maybe I'm guess I'm gay I don't know you know if you found what is that transgender woman this is the picture that she's with what's Brian come on man what the Internet you can't do that you're gonna ruin everything for everybody I will go on record saying no I did not never have don't want to perform oral on a man can I go on record saying that I got you but what would happen well that didn't happen okay okay what didn't happen also is kissing kissing didn't I don't wanna kiss a man let's be clear there was no kissing no kissing no racecar driving no meteorite impact many other things didn't tell you make it unromantic we're so close to getting him up to 25% 25% I'm gonna be honest with you at that moment okay at the moment where that guy is sucking on your dick in person all the time I think you're a 40% gay Oh for that moment what I'm offering you is a fluctuating scale of gayness I don't believe those Brian what do you think when you come in the guy's mouth what are we up to I think oh just say I did that I'm just assuming um he's obviously definitely 25 I don't like your numbers from that's a shocker you've never brought that number up to me I cannot believe that Joe said 40 40 % because I love you so we're now at 35 percent gay our goal is 86 we got at least 20 minutes left in this podcast we can do this Brody you're not thinking about a guy you think she looks like a girl megusta hound smell feel last section I'm sorry about that when you release the hounds is there any feeling of regret I didn't have any I'll be honest it is a subject that does make me uncomfortable for just a couple reasons the other reasons that it is so public and so what speaking of which Dallas buyers club I don't want to just that move it bring it up because it has a lot of your people in it but it's a great fucking white people Texans aren't you from Texas I've been to Texas what are they my people I know you really do so well in Texas the last movie Chris Farley ever did was dirty work and after it right after the dirty work right before he passed away he hosted silent life so normal

enough I was put off all those barriers for you buddy you really did you it was like you knew you knew well do you remember the episode where you guys wrestled and you're on the ground rolling around were you thinking that like this is the hottest scene under I still I still jerk off to it yeah I'm just kidding no but listen well I didn't get to the hole where he took me he took me to buy a couch Chris probably showed up on a set of Newsradio one day to visit Andy yeah sure he did he had the complexion of wet cardboard I've never seen a man look more unhealthy dude I went to a strip club with

could do without any man over the age of 12 who wears their baseball cap backwards so you know long before I met him I'd always hear that good at that bit be like so the night we're at the show he's up there doing it bit and and you know he's like another person I could do without Kevin you're exempt from this guys over the age of 12 where their baseball cap backwards and rock like my eyes lit up and rocks next to me and Rocco's he knows who you are even though like we'd work together on the movie okay you you bring up a good point comedic hate is a different kind of hate yeah communicate rest in peace I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something you just hear what would you tell buddies what what do you talk about you like just the way you talk but what he would go after you man it's like you just want to step back and watch I remember telling his joke in a phone book comes flying on the stage put trees through a fucking phone book at me I'm talking all you heard was and you sit back it hits the floor I say what and Patrice says read it it's better material in it than what you're saying man our bill used to get so fucking mad beautiful thing about Bill Barbara would be snap at bill bill is the guy like it's not funny none of this funny your lovin if you build like where's the punchline in it there's no punch line he is so fucking man those are the guys who win all these who's that not Bill Bixby what the hell's the name of that guy the the guy with that he's been riding a bicycle out here forever solar panels and not Bill Bixby Ed Begley Jr I'm bad with the names they'll never be another revolution know other than you know is doing it right as that guy out there and the Carolinas the black water guy who whatever whatever the fuck it's called Bill Bixby guy my whole day was spent fighting in my head even if I wasn't fighting I'd be fighting in my head when I was when I was like I had girlfriends we did sleepover and kicks in the middle of the night like oh like my whole body would jolt like a kick because I was having a fighting dream so terrified I was constantly terrified that's the name of good Bruce Springsteen album make make my last beer when I threw kicks in the night what no Joe you fucking lunatic somebody gets in my face that might cause me to get one lunatic I need a little bit of protein you had to beat the fuck out of people for like three decades before you could like chill smoke a little weed have you heard that study about like you know how they tried to figure out like if everybody they always say like anybody can be President of the United States right like anybody everybody in America has the same opportunities but what they found is that some people have one opportunity and other people have many opportunities and that's the difference so are you saying the world isn't fair why ugly people are complaining so much they won't take the time to develop a fucking personality right some jobs do what the rest of us have to do like I don't get mad at Brad Pitt you know having me fucking because he's fucking beautiful I'm a fucking bald redheaded male I know where I am in the pecking order and some of these fucking people who are complaining right now who are mad that beautiful people get treated differently I understand racially speaking but you're not gonna do the beautiful thing so we have this mixed message going on which is like I'm angry me to treat me equal simultaneously to I'm going to objectify myself in the most hardcore way more than in any time in history attack the results and its really but for me as a female who understands both those sides a little bit I kind of trips me out a lot one like there's a supermodel like this is like an impossible standard of beauty to try and live up to yeah yeah yeah that's why she's on the cover of a magazine she's that level beautiful and you're gonna try and sit there and tell me that that was learned but at a certain point you know like you've had Jordan Peterson on here many times it's like biological signaling it's like well I play a side at least and also that oh that's that one side is super short-lived that's what I try to tell my girls I'm like you listen if you're you know you're pretty girls it's great but if that's the card you're playing your cards done like by the time you're 30 35 it's done it's over and you know unless you're like 40 and you marry a seven-year-old I don't know or whatever get into milf porn is that such a thing yeah yeah but even that it's like they got to put a filter on and like all that stuff I mean come on we're like if you really look at their agenda when they say the future is feminine that's not inclusive and they're and they're all about I'll make this more inclusive it's like no let us in so we can take it over and then we'll push you down that's so-called progressives extreme left is think the way we think say what we say or we will fucking destroy you your platform restricts speech our platform promotes speech unless people violate our rules and in a specific direction in any direction but uncle I don't want to say his name the guy who calls for death gets a suspension the guy who insinuates that gets a permanent ban but Tim you're you're misinterpreting what I'm saying and I feel like you're doing it deliberately it's not about one particular thing it's about a pattern and practice of violating you have a pattern and practice of banning only one faction of people recently published an article where they looked at 22 high-profile bandings from 2015 and found 21 of them were only on one side of the cultural debate but I don't look at the political spectrum of people when I'm looking at their to write you you have a bias they are you're biased and you're you're targeting specific individuals because your rules support this perspective no I don't agree with that it's it's it's partly a consequence of of the Rio of the rise of the new rise again of say Marxist doctrine I would say it's part of post-modernism maybe it's post-modernism more than anything else because the post modernist that's a philosophical community let's say believe that the entire point of human categorization is power and the dialogue between people is only a power dialog and that there's no real reality outside of interpretation and that basically what we do is exchange interpretive viewpoints to ratchet up our dominance and status and that's that and there's no biology as an ideology and the idea of the objective world is an ideology and science is an ideology and it's all interpretation all the way down like Turtles all the way down what do you mean by it's all about power okay in what way well you imagine that that there are group of people who are competing in the world for resources I suppose and that it's a zero-sum game and it's every group against every other group and the reason that we engage in dialogue isn't to establish the truth or move towards some some closer approximation of reality but to structure this social interaction so that our group comes up on top and you know one of the things I tried to learn when I was taking apart what happened in our wits and trying to put myself in the position of a nosh wits camp guard which by the way you can do with use your imagination a bit I wouldn't call it exactly the world's most pleasant meditative experience but you can call up parts of yourself that would be capable of taking someone who just got off a transport train and having them carry a hundred pound sack of wet salt from one side of the camp compound to the other and back you can conjure that part of yourself up if you want and that'll teach you something about what you're like people don't do it because it's too frightening but I know perfectly well that I could do that sort of thing and so once I learned that I could do that sort of thing and maybe that I could even enjoy it I thought okay fine I get it I'm gonna see if I can figure out how to live so that if that opportunity was presented to me I wouldn't take it and I think that's the lesson that people need to learn from the 20th century it's like that's what human beings did okay well we're all human okay so how is it that we should live so that we don't do that again well part of that is to try to say the truth no matter what because the alternative is worse and it is worse but I'm doing it as an aid to humility it's like well I don't know how to start improving my life someone might say that and I would say well you're not aiming low enough there's something you could do that you are regarding is trivial that that you could do that you would do that would result in an actual improvement but it's not a big enough improvement for you so you won't lower yourself enough to take the opportunity incremental steps and I don't mean don't aim and I don't mean don't aim up but you have to accept the fact that you can set yourself a goal that you can attain and there's not going to be much glory in it to begin because if you're not in very good shape the goal that you could date could attain tomorrow isn't very glorious but it's a hell of a lot better than nothing and it beats the hell out of bitterness and it's way better than blaming someone else it's way less dangerous and you could do it it's like so I had this idea a long time ago because the world is a pretty dreadful place I thought well what would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they knew they should do you know because the question is how much are we contributing to the fact that life is a as an existential catastrophe and a tragedy how much is our own corruption contributing to that that's a really worthwhile question things you leave undone because you're angry you're resentful you're lazy you have inertia well you consult your conscience and it says well you know that place over there could use a little work it's the same as working on yourself and so you clean that up because you can and then things are a little clearer around you and you're a little better off because you've practiced a bit and and so you're little stronger and then something else manifests itself and says well maybe you could like take a crack at fixing me up do so you decide to do that and then that gets a little bit more pristine you know and soon and it's it's humble because you're not exceeding your domain of competence you know it's like don't be fixing up the economy eighteen year old you don't know anything about the economy it's a massive complex machine beyond anyone's understanding and you mess with it at your peril so and can you even clean up your own room no well you should think about that you should think about that because if you can't even clean up your own room who the hell are you to give advice to the world like people think well there's seven billion of us and each of us is just this separate dust mote like floating in the cosmos and what the hell difference does it make what you do anyways it's like that is not how we're connected it's like you're the center of a network and you know well you know way more people than this but let's say typically you know without your gonna know a thousand people in your life well enough to have an impact on them okay and each of those thousand people is going to know a thousand people so you're one step from a million and two steps from a billion and we are Network technically that that's how human interactions work and so when you do something that you shouldn't do it's worse than you think and when you do something that you should do it's better than you think and so you think well this is why I've been telling people clean up your room that's like well your room is actually network too it's not that easy to clean up your room to set it so you want your room to be set up so that when you walk in there it tells you to be better than you generally are and so maybe all you have is this little rat hole of a room and some rundown place in the world it's like fix it up there's more there than you think see what happens if you fix it up and you'll fix yourself up simultaneously because you'll have to get disciplined in order to fix up the room then you have a fixed up room and you'll be a more fixed up person it's like you think that nothing will happen as a consequence of that it's like all hell will break loose as a consequence of that okay but you seem a little oddly defensive about something that's scientific no I have to say I'm good with this but you you are cuz you're kind of defending it no you can say well if Y does matter you need to know why uh-huh why they say no I'm saying why does matter and energy curve the fabric of space and time you can ask that okay why and I don't have an answer if I can say well that's all I'm asking well nope what about - what I'm telling you is okay you don't need to got you to the point all right we had to walk to that point where you're why got unanswered I understand that but before we got to that point I answered otherwise that I'm not disputing that good good there's different kinds of medicine attributed to different kinds of animals your medicine Fox Medicine has been very powerful for me is that what is the one that makes your penis or is that Tiger medicine no that did no that's squaw medicine a squaw me so what do you mean by like bear medicine and well Fox medicine is very important I've had a couple of very powerful encounters with foxes Fox medicine and Native American spirituality makes you invisible in other words I am invisible to the powers-that-be do you work for the government cuz this is what's going on here no no I'm just kidding yeah I know you saying crazy stuff now you're saying crazy stuff is about foxes being invisible though and so if somebody thought that you were just Meishan agent they would say oh here's the evidence he says all this brilliant shit and he starts talking about foxes being invisible no I didn't say foxes invisible makes a man mean but this is like one of the coolest things that's happened to me in in in 30 years that was cooler than Fox magic yeah yeah in the head Fox magic how did you fucks magic song okay here's here's a funny thing when you're worried about the end of the world you're worried about the collapse of civilization and in the meanwhile people see you smoking cigarettes and they go if you want to stay healthy and happy why are you poisoning yourself deal with it you save 15% D and deal with it bitch thanks to honor comm oh wow nuclear reactors and everything thank you that's on it oh and nit maker of alpha boy there's there's a thing that's changed there was an article in The Times about this and you might have even been mentioned in it there's a a playful space of conspiracy theories mmm-hmm that it's taking me a long time to understand my daughter is 14 and she talks about you know her father did a show called bullshit and she talks about how she loves conspiracy theories and this is from Paul McCartney's dead - we didn't land on the moon - all those things but she sees it which is so hard for me to understand she sees it is not impacting reality but is a playful internal intellectual exercise that's that isn't crazy do that that's the craziest thing about all conspiracy theories like people that are not on that side there's a conspiracy theories aside and then there's the people wait on the other side those motherfuckers are totally into man we live in a computer that is hilarious that's not logical that's illogical well the reason why they think does cuz someday there's going to be a program but there's going to be a though eight you're ready true it may be true maybe we do live in a right but dude there's no evidence well don't they have an explanation no exactly that's what every what you just said right now what you just said knows what everyone's natural reaction because anything someone says anything about space you automatically think someone figured it out you don't know the guys name you don't know the name of the experiment you didn't look into it yourself you just think when someone tells you how far is the Earth from the Sun so 93 million miles away like you just right you you who everybody relies on someone figured that out and someone double-checked it dude it's math science it's math but no one really knows but you figure it out you try to figure it out I'm so obsessed with those details I don't know why but in general its history science education energy everything has always been controlled by the government since day one radio has been used as propaganda since the day it was invented radio TV and the movies you have always been about propaganda there was a war on drugs we started war on drugs turns out we're bringing it in then there's a war on terrorism turns out we created al-qaeda did you understand why I'm crazy I want to know the truth and when you know the truth it's just like fuck you just want to tell as many people as possible where this look George Bush a singer gets busted Nash on national TV with the iran-contra situation he becomes president after that and then he's running all his shit and all those drugs in his arms through Arkansas with an unknown governor who Bill Clinton who's letting it happen and then he becomes president after George Bush as the detective I don't know the truth I wasn't there I don't know what the relationship is like I'm like I'm like that's a that's a fucking that's some gangster shit going on right there and they're just playing with the public and other the dumb motherfuckers who believed that there's you know there's Republican Democrat battle going on you know that's it's it's fascinating and frustrating at the same and very scary that man we're living with people there that just follow the official story and or whatever they say that's the truth and all the other shit that's not that this that's crazy you know that's scary that kind of mentality is what I'm scared of you said when do you think you started losing it I think I was you know as soon as I found out when I was 11 that everybody wasn't Catholic that was that's when I started losing my I'm like everybody's not Catholic I thought everybody was Catholic there's other religions then how do we know we're right there's a bunch of it's a Jew oh shit there's more Jews and catkin Catholics how do we know we have the right religion I'm like okay you saw yes that's when I started going that's so funny people that question authority are usually looked at as crazy his father Prescott Bush started the CIA his father Prescott Bush financed the Nazis through Union Bank that's not a conspiracy theory the sugar Association they didn't want it to be labeled as for what it really was a an addictive toxin they wanted to keep it it ain't that bad in moderation and ain't that bad it makes things taste sweet it's about love flippin I think the globalists liked it I think we need villains and they can probably help him out and fund him well I mean they like the shit he's doing they they need a distraction anything happens we don't really bomb they're testing missiles boom for two weeks we're gonna be all over North Korea a couple months and then it's gonna be gone watch North this is like the new Ebola remember that was Ebola Ebola distraction distraction North Korea is perfect to distract you know when you're talking about your movie hold on you know you're talking about that Fox catch a movie you're like you've said it a couple times on your podcast where you're like once you've said once you saw that they left Gary Goodridge out you were like I can't trust this movie I can't put the whole movies I can't trust it may be real it may not be real but I need some proof I got you that's exactly how I feel about okay no no that space the government the government so incoming government agency whatever it's a government agency I look at it like Foxcatcher you've lied enough where I'm like I need some irrefutable evidence otherwise why do I have to believe it sumit a real you get it but SpaceX's in the government no they're subsidized by the gun that no subsidize they do they got like four billion dollars so they tell them the fake space no one's trust in NASA no more so they're panning it over a that's that's getting let's do the side thing and everyone's all into space now hmm that's nothing way to look at it oh yeah and of course AG bra also known as Eddie Bravo it's your bra that's what they taught when we were in Brazil that's the call me a G hey it was Joe Moran are those the first giant tournament that there was in LA Joel Moreira was he was the main promoter and in my division those 45 guys were all blue belts in my division he's you have to sit there and listen to him call

then someone say dude I think he's saying your name no way guys are telling a story it's hilarya and he's like she came up to me and started mad dog of me and I was like what the fuck you lookin at I paid for all that shit and you didn't say none of that you just said I was like that I had that look on my face but I didn't say shit and if you don't question did you actually say that like no I was lying I was thinking you would have made it seem like you this bad motherfucker in this story saying fuck you shit you said that no no you and where you came from bitch do you actually say no once you travel to a thousand cities you realize they're all this an illusion it's really you walking through the airport and you see the destination the be-all-end-all some dudes feet on a fucking bad-ass be look that's that's the goal yeah and then when you get there you think you realize wait a minute they're cutting off they framed off like the people trying to sell your fucking a crocodile I went to Thailand I go I'm gonna go to deserted fucking island on Thailand and everyone said yeah you can't go where you need to fucking take a cab three hours jumped in a cab three hours and I'm going and we finally get to go where the islands oh you want to go to Ireland yeah yeah I'm thinking I don't give a fuck how much of costs just go it's cheaper if you go on a big ferry to this island or you could take a speedboat or go fucking speedboat let's go boom I'm videotaping everything I want to go on this fucking iron that I see the airport I see them all the tournament I don't give a fuck you get there boom and there's 200 other people there yeah and there's like snack bars and shit the secret is your son we were in Denver and I was doing stand-up and Eddy and Tate and Brian and Duncan I just as a goof we decided to go in this wig store we came up with the idea of having a fake band and everyone decided that we were gonna play a band called ten-foot screws we got ten-foot screws backstage and they're playing a big show at the Kahala the hall the dome next to the oka six three two no for locals so people were like oh shit there's a concert tonight I didn't know about this I got up on stage and said who wants these tickets to the show tomorrow backstage they were going nuts and you're some crazy man wearing a wig for a pair that doesn't exist yes so when the concert let out people had a walk by backstage so we had the door open and dudes are walking bike on where's that bad so we grabbed one dude he just wanted to hang out with the bed so we're gonna have to get on your knees okay you're gonna have to pray for us pray with us like an oaf and sometimes pray before they go huh thank you Jesus and you're replete thank you Jesus and you said for this dig about the psychic Lord Jesus Jesus you are my Savior thank you for everything have you since the fight all the time okay the guard oh you weren't here for the guard talk Eddie Bravo has the weirdest sense of humor man he used to say he was half yeah you're said something else Japanese and half estimate like famous one Mexican errs yeah I used to say that when I was a teenager just because I was an idiot and I wanted to see who would believe it and I'm like wow they have people believe anything kangaroo that's what it is that's my guess it looks exactly the same it's got a tail hops around on two legs Tyrande that's a fuckin they found a giant kangaroo and when they figured it out they go dude it's a kangaroo fuck bonsly he does a sick Kodiak a nasara' couple noises that's the abdominal snowman maybe that's what book Bigfoot's about maybe Bigfoot was about dude let's let's create this mythical monster and have people afraid they don't want people to move in the woods the thing about that's not good for the NWO right the New World Order they want people to go into cities so they way reason for believing a Bigfoot I've ever heard that's so funny Bigfoot's been around forever though dude they talked about it in the CIA's been around forever someone did come up to me and say hey you heard that conspiracy theory where there's no forests UFOs are coming back right now everybody's talking everything ever bigger than stronger than ever that should tell you something that's what we're getting we're getting like some some some bleed over from another dimension and that's what UFOs are does Bob Lazar have a twitter wouldn't that be cool to have longer shows it's a very ominous feeling because it's there are no at first of all everything is one color it's like a dark pewter color and there are no right angles anywhere it's as if somebody took I've said this before somebody took up a model out of and fashioned it out of wax and then he did it just for a short time so everything melted everything looks like it's fused together everything has a radius of curvature where two items meet it's it's a really weird looking thing but did you ask any questions about what the fuck no there's no ask question now I will tell you that I won't get into specifics but there are there are people inside the United States government that are taking this serious and I've been I've went down to DC twice to talk to folks you know behind closed doors to go because they want to hear the story and I've got a lot of you got to be joking yeah I mean this this seriously happened and and I'm like yeah it did happen and it is real you know what are you doing about it so what kind of people are you talking to high-level government officials is what I'll say the fourth one that I saw I was on my motorcycle leaving town to go at Kingston Ontario where he lived there and I was driving out of the farm gate and and I saw there's a power line that runs on the opposite farm there across the road and I saw this winking red light just moving slowly along the top of the power pylons and I thought well you know helicopters did do that kind of work where they were they string power lines but they don't really do it at night and it goes along like this and I'm watching it and I stop the bike you know on I'm on and then it stops and makes a right angle turn it comes right at me I I put on the wig wags on the bike and it stops above me and it turns on a light and I'm going it where's the rotor whop where's the where's the wash where's it come on the helicopter at 3,000 feet you can hear it this thing's like 3 400 feet above me shines it slide light on me and I turned the lights on the bike on and and then turned them off and then it winked the light off and it just drifted out over the field what people don't know is that Hudson County New Jersey northern New Jersey is the number one place in the country where they have the most UFO sightings really northern New Jersey look it up Jamie if you get a minute please not to be rude you don't have any access ok so I have to ask you does Tom talk about UFOs all the time but you know he's not in the band yeah I know what's your response to that you don't know what I know right well you know you know though I can't I don't know I can't tell you some of the shit that I know these UFOs fold space-time like this and so it looks like to them they're going in a straight line so if you're in the ship you see that but if you're on the ground you see that ok that's why you see them blink off and on a lot of those videos they're on they looks like they're jumping it's just because of this so they're having space time and I'll walk over they can't walk over there for a second so much wondrous good but you know always do that he always did were used to get loaded and just look out the bus window for what and I used to do it with him as like I don't know it's kind of a bonding experience it's like uh if you wanted to show me bow and arrows whatever we're on tour together if I were in like you know check it out so with Tom that was his thing like fucking let's get high and look for UFOs so he would you know we just sit there and like stare out the bus window look at UFOs were like he would even go as far as when we're on tour like let's go and fucking look for Bigfoot you know and he would assemble a crew and they would go do it but nothing has changed he's still the other day I talked to him he's like I'm on the way to the fucking white house bro and I don't ask any questions I drag as you should be yeah but you are afraid of aliens though right you have like a path mapped out in your house how to get out if the aliens show up now no that's the rumor man that's what I heard I heard you have a plan because I know you like to use game plans Japanese get that now so if they come I can slice the human being that I've hit that had produced the highest amount of force that I have her witness in my life is human with your free and I'm not saying that is the truth I never seen a human being physically capable of hitting something with that much force than you Oh that's why when you turn and you make that spin right I don't care who you are you Francis and gandu you you hit that shit on their face you gonna be dead you know that not that but you're gonna be knocked out man did you ever light up someone with that particular yo of me when I was 19 from a taekwondo tournament making a guy fly through the air yeah are you serious yeah oh my god is he okay now he's yet I don't know here it is right here are you kidding me man oh yeah Casey no no that was that was perfect and he just sailed through the air you got to pick your knee up yeah but no see it's not bad but you have a inherent flaw and your technique that probably has never never explained to you for 49 million it's pretty good it's not right just by that don't throw the kick it to your knees up high lift your knee up way high past your waist and then throw the kick yes knee up first and then don't look over your stomach look over your shoulder yeah but knee first here hold on oh damn even though even in the earth fucking Chuck Norrises blush not mad at Jose form at all no dude I'd love to see our actual Taekwondo master drink Alan and Rogan I would just stare at their asses and then they had these little microphones right so with yeah I don't know but fast there was like it was five guys four or five guys and they start fighting then the guy that I knocked out constantly because he will wake up right and everything went good and it went good and but then I start realizing wait a minute this these guys are gonna come back up all the time you know this is gonna come to an end I gotta get the hell out of here so he's knocking them down so you're hitting them they're falling down everyone that's coming at you you're not now but you realizing you got to get out of here I had to get out of there they looked at me and they all step back strike a wolf they can't see I mean visitors right but behind me is the whole police force outside because there were windows so they is they throw me in jail and because apparently one of those monsters was a cop and yeah and I knocked him out of course also but he never told me that he was a cop but I wouldn't have done that anyway we're there and this is also this is actually a funny story because before this all happened I'm talking to my wife and I'm already tanked right and she says why are you laughing where you have so much fun it's oh honey I'm drunk I'm having a lot of fun she's know you're there with two Swedish blonde girls huh I said I don't worry about you know me if I'm drunk you know I don't care about anything especially not that I just want to have fun so after two days they allowed me to give my first phone call and I'm calling my wife and she's freaking out I saw honey you gotta be okay relax relax I said I got some good and some bad news so you want to hear first she's the good news I said I didn't fuck two Swedish girls because he looks at his reason role she calling names and he goes come come on rude who the fuck this kid and I like me coach he's like that's your name he's like I'm not saying that because my whole full name is Kumari Deen komaru Dean kymaro Dean he's like I'm not gonna say that like a commodity and Kumar Mart I'm gonna call you Marty so enough for him to bring it out I thought it was silly but you know these fans fans wanna they cuz ban is a representative of the trolls like most of the trolls look like Ben Askren if I can give you any of that's hilarious if you look at him from a skill set Ben's not even worth waking up before like 10:00 a.m. in the morning but I don't like this dude man before my alarm goes off I'm already awake to break his fucking face man I want to break his fucking ribcage and I don't want to knock him out early on I don't I just want to torture that guy man if I get the chance to torch him 14 minutes and 50 seconds before I stop him that's what I'm gonna do man you know I just I don't like to dude and I met him a long time ago he's a fucking prick man I don't like him me there's not too many people that I genuinely dislike he's one of them how did that seem come to play where you were with Hicks and Gracie Oh cuz I cuz I was I studied Aikido when I was in college but because my interest in that for years when we went to Rio Rio and I had been working on the script of that movie and stuff and I was like I was really interested in this idea that banner is is desperate for control right that he desperately desperately needs to control his heartrate his breathing that it's a massive liability in his mind if he can't control his emotions and his adrenaline and I was like well who in the world and I had seen the videos of Hicks I'd never met him or any of them but I'd seen the videos of him doing the amazing stuff with his stomach yeah the you know yeah and the breathing fire and I was like and I just was like we have to end and everyone was like who's that I was like I was like Philistines you're all Philistines like I was like and I was like find me Hicks and Gracie and ask him if he'll do a scene with me in the movie being the guy who's training bannered to like calm himself and he was there and he did he did it with us and I was like I was like so that's his that's a very essential thing which sometimes sleep through people's fingers and and the priorities in the daily you know in the payments and so I put you in a role where I feel like if you tell me in the past what's the courage what's the opposite of courage I want to say cower nests because either you tough enough to to challenge and to fight or chew or in then you coward and you chickened out so that's in the past was like the opposite of courage it's very hard to measure this in those days and I believe the opposite of courage today is conformity you know as people get conformed oh I I don't like my wife the way I used to like but I'm never gonna divorce because I'm afraid to lose my house or the situation is so established so I'm gonna keep so I don't like this job but I'm gonna keep here because better than his so in other hands if you if you get caught on that kind of compromise to to maintain because you you afraid to risk let's keep you like one step behind from you follow your heart follow the ambition if you 18 years old you don't think twice and if I say yeah let's go to Australia you think okay let's go poom but when you feel to say Australia what I gonna do there maybe so it's different you know [Laughter] yes so that's kind of pretty much where keep you from be at your best because if you willing to sacrifice if you willing to to broke new new challenges if you will eat you you in the stage of liveness and an excitement and unpredictability who make you feel like you in heaven why writer I write letters to everyone that's close to me before before you yeah and every time I come back a life and a fight I Burnham oh wow so literally I'm training that the three months that I'm training for a fight I'm literally training not to die and if you knew there's a possibly you were gonna die in this certain area most people would avoid it but we have to do we I have to walk there in my own will and the stress level for me I mean I wish I could just take it lighter and say it's a sport I mean every time I fought after I fought winning lose I always felt like shit nice over I'm alive because I was willing to die in the fight you know you know you were on death's door and recover from it and then put yourself back and risk yep I mean yeah saying it like that it there's no there's no justifying that other than I was in this sport that that I really wanted to to be in and stay in and after the disease I wanted to go back to and m'as the that was the landscape and so you viewed it you thought okay this is not ideal but you asked the question what am I really you know having knowing my health history right with cancer with all the all that I went through is going back to my sport and taking EPO a risk to that to that you know to my to my disease or to my health and I and the answer to that obviously my answer to myself was no Jo without a shadow of a doubt none whatsoever death is not the end you don't think so I know I know - how do you know because I've been dead right yes I've been big what what about that experience cemented in your head when I was like I said it was the most peaceful and and I don't feel like there's the most peace most restful most I was I woke up laughing I was yeah yeah I was overjoyed yeah you still think about it now see cuz I'm what happened to me was I woke up in the hospital and had emergency heart surgery like 98 so it was like I was like oh I'm done smoking what happened was I went to bed it was time you know tired I'm not feeling good went to sleep woke up in Cedars like after surgery you know it was my extreme fortune to live in a neighborhood that was the the closest hospital with cedars-sinai and there was it was you know also my Irish luck that uh the best heart surgeon in the world who dr. William Toronto was whose chief of heart surgery over there I think even of all surgery saw my case and told somebody else and you can't do that I have to do that and what I have in there now is the st. Jude's heart valve it's a titanium heart valve I got sick like a watch man well anyone here hold up get real sensitive on this mug right here oh my god oh shit but then my brother says this thing probably defined my life my brother goes he died screaming and I go what what and he goes he he died screaming and I was like Doug what I mean is that a figure of speech he goes no he literally he died screaming and you could see my brother was haunted by it and my father wasn't like a well I wouldn't say he was a butch man or strong man but he wasn't a soft man money stretch the imagination and I never heard him get real loud or anything like that and the notion of my father dying screaming changed my life because I was like even a good man in this world he played a game he played straight you play a pot of rules you do everything he's supposed to you and I screaming and at that point I was like there's no point in not trying to accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've got chase it all down chasing wimzie's what I've been doing for the last few years but chase it all and do it all cuz we're all gonna die screaming and as I was laying there I was like oh my god I got a lifetime like that's that's what it was nothing more nothing fucking less and I did some shit in it and now it's gonna stop and people are gonna go on without you and that's not terrible like I thought I'd be fucking desperate to live and instead I had that weird like sent I understood what my mother said for the first time because I was lying there I was like oh my god like I made it to the end like this is it this is the finish line and it had been something that I was terrified of ever getting to but then one really kind of faced with it I was like oh like I'm done like I'm not scared that I'm done I'm actually kind of relieved than I'm done and like you know fucking like I didn't get killed and I wasn't home invaded a shark didn't eat me all the things that like I've been terrified of my entire life like I don't have to think about anymore I made it to the end and it it's kind of okay at Olive Garden we strive to bring you great food at great prices you love our all-time classics and you'll love our new time favorites but don't just take our word for it take it from real life customers who eat at Olive Garden every day I went to the of God last night and had

awesome Olive Garden all-you-can-eat pasta and everything cost me $40 they're perfected this shit go to the off garden when you hear your family sorry for example one time I had talked to a friend about it I said you know I heard something about some xenu's shit she pulled me into celebrity Center so fast into a secured room and she handed me my ass she said don't you ever say that word outside a secured room I'm writing a knowledge report on you she said I'm writing reported I you never say that word out loud in a room that's not secured okay and never seen again so she wrote a report on the knowledge report she wrote a knowledge report on me I got sent to what's called ethics which is like the Justice Department of celebrities of Scientology and they said they brought me into another secured room because they have to get somebody who knows this information and they said never ever say that would say this and never confirm it never deny it never give that information out ever that just never discuss it just say I've never heard of it you sound crazy when I do this oh no I think was the first season where he had just left I think because I did it pretty much probably if I had to pick a season I would have been that would have been that one I did because he still had Carvey and he still had you know Hartman and Victoria Jackson like the whole kind of group I hated to do it without cue cards because my father didn't want to use ku cards so I'd like to memorize all that stuff plus block plus plus the skits I didn't even make him to the show so I like I had to memorize like skits that didn't even end up yeah is that dad yeah you know I like I said I had a good memory and he didn't want me reading you know because it you can see it you can see when people are reading oh yeah me doing that soon Wow so new cue card but also that means the other actors don't you card for them either yeah of course not you know oh Christ they had look yeah no I'm sure my father made a lot of friends looking in like you know that weekend well that's fucked up but how can he dictate whether or not the other actors get cue cards I don't know good isn't because he could apparently he could so the Webster story so so I'm you know at one of these network junkets where you go to promote your show and stuff and all the other actors and casts are there from the shows and this little man black kid this tall was just cute as could be man it's like I put him on my knee and I started just playing with him and bounce him around and he was giggling and laughing and having a good time

it again track two and they just make it up as they go okay and then when it's time to mix they'll put a little of track doing a little up track sex and start moving those channels in a way that you would never think to play the guitar for example Edie started doing that on a couple of tracks alright original solos running with the devil did it okay these are thematic solos most beetle solos thematic yes into the solo and ain't talking about I did it you know these are thematic solos when he started going weather like this he'd record six different versions of the solos okay and then just start move the channel like here turn this one on turn this one off turn this one hundred this and then he'd have to go learn the solo Wow so you'll see his hand move from down here to up here and down there it became a gymnastic effort more elbow and shoulder to get his hand from the far end of the fretboard all the way up to the pickup and back to duplicate that lava Xabi Wow approach to making solos if the freakiest thing was I saw how it changed my inner world meaning friends and family who saw my step grandfather who was a world war two that very closed down classic Eisenhower Republican type of guy smart you know I mean had literally zero interest in me as a kid I mean negative zero interest and and one day I'm sitting there at Christmas and now grandpa wants to talk to me about the economics of my success whoa and it's like like that got through to him because some guy at work or somebody at the church brought me up and it was like oh that's my grandson you know nothing about childhood you know childhood tears did anything but that you know I saw where it warped the gravity in my family and then you get the friend like you know you're different just like yeah I'm different of course I'm different you know I mean you know I mean it's like you got a million dollars in my pocket you know I could buy you know yeah I mean you know I one day walked into Beverly Hills and paid cash for a Ferrari and let's just dumb stuff like that's kind of Awesome yeah people don't like the idea of that I think it's funny right it's amazing you bought a Ferrari with money that you had on you fucking crazy and it was the classic story I walk in that you know the guy didn't know who I was it's like so how are you gonna pay for this and I was like cash like he was the biggest person on the planet and he had the demons you know saying and but he's fun to look at because you see him in a club and you see you see some girls you like cars like BMWs and crazy he'd take the girls out and go get a BMW we were talking about the power of women and how you know never you no matter how much money you make and stuff and their women are always kind of a rush you know and and and and Mike Tyson said to tonica's man I've had it all I've had I've had money I've had Fame but if got anything better than pussy he's keeping it for himself that's a man who wants his house and it was five or six limos and then why we get out the limo I said I come to my's getting out the card I said hey you don't see it land standing over there Mike Tyson in the lane in his front yard like hangover stocks the only man whose house I went over there was a lion in the front yard loose Wow he was on the steps like this with a heavyweight belt [Laughter] [Music] who's like no man no it's that a cat it's a lady that's fucking real Mike Tyson gonna land a man or a female monster the main lying in his front yard loose it was walking but it was off the leash man he was not in the cage he was in the yard oh my god they came out of started wrestling with him oh my god damn he how big was the lion it was big man it was a lion he was wrestling with a hangover they grabbed him and it's not a testament with him in all this Jesus and everybody was in the limits until the lion could come up to a limousine and bust a window open to come in there I'm sorry easy he could just go like this boof and come right in there let's have lunch so everybody was in the car you couldn't back out because it was all like five limos everybody's in the car horrified thinking that Mike is getting ready to be eaten but it's lying but that doesn't happen is he plays with him and takes him in the back that comes back out now is that you know what I'm never gonna being around another man in life that's gonna do it you I'm saying cuz to me he was it Mike Tyson another line team you ever if I may be working in Vegas no he's just the same lines yeah when his front yard so I'm in prison I'm talking to my car dealer at the time when he has a he has some cars to belong to a friend of mine that suppose a friend of ours and he's discussing the fee doesn't pay for these cars I'm a sell these cars to someone and get some horses horses lions tigers I got exactly laughter you do can you give me some tigers yeah oh man how cool that baby because I had a bunch of fans because man that man you be in the after Martin or Ferrari that would be cool right yeah give me some consonant then when I came home I had those Cubs right there waiting for me so you raised them as Cubs yeah that's that's how you work because I would see footage of you like fucking smacking them around and jumping on one of your Tigers and I was like holy shit and I had within their bag that their mother the mother their baby now this is a crazy picture you and your underwear with a tiger on a chain that is that is one of the that's like there that's you a peak crazy yeah and thing yeah think about my friends that might you can get some awesome animals and I remember that American team was saying all war you never fought the best Maya didn't fight the best I thought Americans had the best team yeah but one guy is like taking plans in his manager don't like taking plans either so I'm like who's that and they told me was Mike Tyson custom model so me and my trainer we left Canada and we drove all the way up there and while we were up there I arranged the Roddick was up there and they said Oh raisin really came to inspire with us and so okay I'll spar with you I'm here for four days so first time Tyson actually met me you know he was nice guy really nice guy too Mina's room showed me some old flicks that I've never seen before of all time fighters it would tell me about each fighter like he studied them and then you know this is where he got his old stuff is his style of fighting from and first day in the first day in the gym Bell went he came across and he was trying to kill me like you know I did my Muhammad Ali thing obviously stayed away from his power but the first day was really hectic and then the second day was lactic and that got better as it went along and the last day is I got actually the better of him the last day and I remember customers saying Mike you gotta meet him someday don't you do that and not always echoed in my mind that will we ever fight will we ever fight cuz cus D'Amato said that we're gonna fight won and it did happen wow that is crazy man god that's crazy go back then to the other big neck Tyson when I first had him he was a hundred ninety pounds not the bum also 12 years old okay that's what he was but that's what he was I mean that's what God made so crazy so I go down and I put the first fight nobody's seen Tyson nobody's ever seen Tyson but 12 years old zero face okay now you go too far you like more than us no I'm not lying okay he's 12 years old it's gonna be 13 soon but he's technically he's 12 years old okay oh come on I said I'd make you feel better I'll put down 17 thank you now you tell the truth I think that 17 he bit a chunk out of your fucking ear right like what what were you thinking at that time Biden back I'm serious I was getting ready to bite the daylights out of him a week after that I talked to Mike we were wee-wees at the all-star basketball game in New York ed and I looked up and everybody was screaming I wonder what they're screaming about telling me to watch out I'm like watch out for Lou I looked up Oh Mike he had the big bad coat and he like this he had a big bear skin coat oh you know yeah big fur coat that big fur coat and the stuff like that he went do numbers shake hand and a week after matter of fact is room with next door to my no we can't we came out we we come out at the same time you look he look he asked me is it all good yeah so we get on the elevator whoa and we come down with the door open everybody was shocked so they were shot wonder why we wasn't fight right he's just you to an elevator that's just you to an elevator yeah and so at the sharp are and they said man and we thought they don't beat and I told the guys man I said you know how much my life got paid in that plane how much money can you say we go pay for free do you work out anymore no I'm a cue away from that stuff we don't even like oh that's tough you know spin class right now let's reactivate to my ego oh really yeah oh wow when we get ripped off they react that's the thing about like extreme winners extreme winners that ego is hard in fact lose like lose everything what if you like go jogging can you go jogging no I do my treadmill work and stuff okay treadmill that's it but if I thought the thing that I'm special if I get a glance a glimmer of that thing thing ain't whoa yeah you better than no I saw a video you hit in the back recently was a couple years ago you still hit the bag still throw some bombs do partly for the camera yeah that's what you're doing but I'm like damn you could still move you still have it in you right oh no it's in your body half it being to do this it feel weird but what I was gonna get to when if you were standing front of that heavy bag and you start rattling off combinations and people you start thinking like oh shit I'm actually Mike Tyson like I was that guy I am that guy who went through that I am youngest heavyweight champion of all time I am that guy to destroy Tyrell Biggs I am that guy that knocked out Larry Holmes I'm that guy okay guy I look at that guy for money if giving me a platform to help me forget about that guy Wow so it's so strange to hang out and talk to him party he's so iconic that whenever you're around in part there's like 10% of you that has to go holy shit it's Mike Tyson's no matter what else you're saying ten percent of your brain is going holy shit that's Mike Tyson you know I've been thinking about this podcast a lot ladies and gentlemen and one of the things I've been thinking about is I appreciate the fuck out of everybody listening and I we do try our best to make this as interesting as possible and as smooth and professional as possible but I gotta admit that I've been too stressed out about this I've been taking it too seriously I mean taking it seriously in a good way whereas we improve the sound we got a real mixer we're gonna I mean we're sitting on couches and shit and we're gonna get better cameras there's a part of it that's really fun but there's a part of it that wasn't fun and I don't think that should exist I don't think I should ever get too serious about this this is for people who are working who are just being distracted that just want something because they're doing mindless shit this is for people that are driving in their cars and you know want something Melissa - this is for people on the train this is for people at the gym whatever the fuck it's for you guys alright we've done this for a hundred episodes now do some levels you know a good time red band and I have we've more than surpassed our expectations I never had any going into it I don't think you did either no never thought it would be like this I thought this was actually gonna last a month and if if we take it too seriously you stopped being yourself and it starts being like this professional thing that you're trying real hard to do and I think I think I've fallen prey to that listen you guys have been cool as fuck we you been with us some of you from the very beginning and that's that's ridiculous I can't believe you stuck out this long we can't believe how many people enjoy the show we love doing it and there's nothing more I can say and should just be a weekly fun thing like it or not you know for for anybody who's like minded or anybody who's interested in some sort of a distraction from someone who's not like-minded and I don't necessary makes more apple juice get some apple juice in your system fella okay fine mother for hours look fine listen I'll be honest with you I'm kind of retarded what I pull up just type in Alex Jones of YouTube all the main stuffs put up on top I'm D compartmentalize okay place will be studied for years so with so the aliens are already here AI is alien the kind of Meera's are alien and I also think as I do implants I think it's a brain surgery program for microchips and so I'm here and my Carol's like David I'm sick of these people and you've already done so much for the government you're not gonna be and you know I want you out of this so this is like you know seven eight years old you're not hearing about the country you're hearing about the cyborgs so I'm saying no no no I believe it happened stop saying I said it didn't happen and stop saying that I'm saying no kids died cuz I want to talk about human-animal hybrids when I had the globalist 15 years ago 20 years ago try to buy me off ten million a year you know whatever by the way it's cheers here cheers brother anyway Jesus Christ so Joe that's what I'm telling you is were you at the kitchen table when you were eight hearing about cyborgs listen here's the old right here you've got a total schizophrenic that thinks the Sun is following them around town and thinks their dog is watching them and works for the aliens you've got someone over here someone over here that believes everything they see on Fox News yes okay yes now questioning is good science is good trying to figure out what's real yes and all of us get freaked out the nature of the world no one knows what the universe is we don't have all the answers so it kind of people can't handle that bigness they can't hand that question especially low IQ so they have to differentiate and create a model that allows them to put it in boxes so they can make it that makes sense because they can't handle it yes I know listen you got mad at you all this stuff I know you're even better at saying it and you sit there cuz you can't handle it and you shake they're gonna go it's not that I can't handle it it's this two factors one I don't have an anytime I don't have enough time to go into it as much as you do you ask why hips out I got mad at you that's it right there you every time I bring up a fucking subject you know all about it I don't know all about shit you're a smart guy you you saw the governor of Virginia say we keep babies alive after they're born and kill him right well I didn't see them come but I am very what you go finding posts about this but it says that he did it's been taken out of context Snopes huffington post is that Snopes it's mostly false Oh Huffington Snopes ed so what you're saying is a lot of this censorship 1 million the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired because sometimes they deformed you don't see it sometimes they deform comfortable and show but but if you kill them right on the spot they're like why are we wasting this 7 pounds of meat we consider the baby dead the mother decided it didn't live if she decides we resuscitate and it lives but it didn't resuscitate its flesh it's a legal ease it's passed into a special ward with doctors that make a few million a year and a little flesh ball is kept alive and comfortable until all the orders come in the planes land and they take the organs and they take this blood and they take the ski enjoy you see how we work now you know freaking out with this voice no no but see is the southern lovin voice the left cell Oh compassion right we can't hurt anyone's feelings we're helping a rest Falun Gong and sell their organ but we're Google I'm stuck to me you're right and this is the real research that I have heard that up that I have talked to army generals commanding generals major generals general generals CIA everybody and then they create this synthesis you have to know the darker elements of the criminal networks that are inside our government are actually running Mexico as a laboratory test because they know Americans are Taylor these are done ho and they're tough and they're ready to fight not you know I'm part Native American well like six percent Comanche and you know Texas and just that little bit makes me wild you know and so they can get them because they're powerful they're smart they're neat they're cool but genetically they go into groupthink really really fast and so Native Americans you can mind-control really fast hmm why's that so there's not just one type of intelligence yeah for sure yeah well there's there's I mean there's tests that you can run in terms of mathematics but there's no real tests you can run in terms of psychic connectivity they've proven that DNA is a transceiver and so my skill is that's why I'm usually kind of like almost autistic is I'm just being constantly like everything that's going on but tend of actually focus in I can like figure out the exact enemy operation that's why they're really pissed the reason the reason the global is to leave you want that you want to get the secret no but I'm but I'm saying boy Hitler secret hold on a second she could 305 you kind of stop you what are you saying that he's like crashing economies and would when I was a kid watching PBS and maybe they were lying maybe he's great George Soros was an international currency speculators who overthrew governments you you know you not so you know I'm gonna make you regret wearing this fucking shirt hey listen high school we used to chug each other out that's like an EMT go on check me out all right no no no no no no no Eddie don't chuck him unconscious no no please try let's go he can't do you know you think I'm afraid of this let's know I definitely don't think you're afraid of this which is why I don't want him to do it you know pussies show me I have a sweater choke me out Alex please please high school I know you did you told me grab each other and you fall down and hit your heads we're gonna give to this next and I respect you I want you guys to yell at each other for three minutes why go pee I gotta pee - okay don't talk to yourself just hope we'll do in shit shit I'll go first you know of course of course go pee man go pee don't you have to go we're gonna send someone else Alex you really think do you really think there's people out there I'm gonna piss now you hurt that piece of shit fucking KKK guy fucking governor say we're gonna keep the line after they're fucking born because they wanna fucking take their organs it's incredible he's a KKK guy it's incredible fuck it's so incredible that he's in a picture with a guy a KKK out there in blackface they elected him because he's black males they had that shit and when he messed up and said we keep them allowed to get their fucking organs they used that to deactivate him why do you think for attorneys have you screw sheep and all this and you know give guys blowjobs that's whatever join them because they want a sermon when you get choked out you like go somewhere and I've got a little dream and then you come back like DMT so like what kind of shit they didn't tell it let me say you killed for this stuff Joe this is not the only thing they want me off here there's one I finally figured this out because I never touch aliens I kind of knew the whole thing already you'd be the biggest documentary in history it only costs like a million dollars okay let's take a 50 thousand ton big ship and to have it circumnavigate the planet and you will be there what GPU no no no I'm not gonna be there no we're gonna get someone to represent me there I gotta be you gotta pee again I know are you questions you're not a sex addict demon demon person thank you so you go back thousands years Merlin you know the archetype of order or these magicians or these these wizards are taking drugs in these temples and interfacing with these Palen tears these crystal balls which aren't Lee crystal balls it's their psychic focus of an international connection while they're on drugs looking in the glass to then be able to see the future and understand what's happening to give them temporal power over this planet true or false and the mayans smoked penis blood they did they did what they did was you just being silly no that's themselves had thoughts they took they took long lives of leather Jaguar leather and hatch it had it had nails on it and an end or head like spiky things a glass and they would put it in their genitals no the most skilled he's a priest the high priest when they were sacrificing people for hours taking a listener Jensen would would like not try to cut his testicles off but only the most skilled would sit there and draw them through they would smoke the blood lower three ounces our ancestors the lowered seriously the lower priests would then put out to their ancestors we put it on sacred leaves and then they would smoke the general blood yeah of the high priest and then consciousness in the universe is an interdimensional space craft beyond the that looks like a comet for my research and it has it has its head as its Corona consciousness consciousness he carries evil in the tail and the consciousness has a location no there is this giant consciousness of God okay swimming in a giant system of survival of Fitness that God has created to test God's self okay it looks like a comment so you've got God's conscience and all the good things the knowledge going forward but God knows that everybody has to be tested so the tail goes out and at the end of the tail is basically evil that's what Christ says get behind me Satan and it's always trying to test God and infiltrate up into it to sabotage [Music] consciousness in the universe is an interdimensional spacecraft beyond that that looks like a comet from my research and it has it has its head as its Corona that's consciousness consciousness he carries evil in the tail as the consciousness as a location no there is this giant consciousness is God okay swimming in a giant system of survival of Fitness that God has created to test God's self okay it looks like a comment so you've got God's conscience and all the good things the knowledge going forward but God knows that everybody has to be tested so the tail goes out and at the end of the tail is basically evil that's why Christ says get behind these treatment and it's always trying to test God and infiltrate up into it to sabotage I have like dreams they're like 20 years long like you know about DMT where I'm a farmer and like it's like five hundred years ago and I'm just like planning things and eating food and like put my kids to sleep and like you know cutting trees down I'm like walking around I have dreams Robbie's like normal and just being a normal person the side effect they believe in see Joe's done it that's what the people say see stars yeah that's what it was suffering said oh Hollywood stars because they'd seen the stars like each star is like a whole data bank and I remember like some do choking me like you guys are like somebody's like pawn a knife out and you see that knife point like sure and like at that point you I see everything from only those minutes when everything's clears I have emotions but then you see like let the wars and the the attacks and the submarines of the spacecraft and like it's like when you dial into that it's like total wars at one time like I remember this one time I they choked me out and also I was like a black knight with a sword goes word and like attacks me on this horse and then like you know it's and then I was like in England thousands of years ago and I had this wife these kids and it was a whole lifetime like taking care of them and like growing food and like a kid starved to death died and it was like just those moments were like whole lives dead kids everything was what I'm saying like you down into all those ancestors and it was like my kids and kids starving to death and like people attacking us so you think all that information from your ancestors somehow or another encoded somewhere encoded Joe so you want to talk about what's that real controllers of the greys are it looks like Sora have you ever had a significant head injury what happened to you somebody piledrive to you what happened how old were you there's about 13 13

when people have Henner juries especially it seems like yeah you know stuff just got better last year where the guy comes in with tattoos a big beard and was in the police report the guy had like a footlong cock and he goes do a cervix exam what kind of police reported this and the nurse said sir I don't see a vagina and it was in the report the man had a footlong dick and I remember sitting
