still sexual because of society because of that's why women think of women as being sexual so like women will make out with women yeah and partly with women and part of it is because they think that guys like it but also part of it because in our society it has been deemed that women are more sexual they're more sex objects they use them to sell watches and cars and shit like that it's like it's more natural and accepted so I think a gay guy would have way less problems fucking a straight girl than a straight guy would have fucking a gay guy you know I mean okay so if you said to a gay guy fuck a girl he'd probably do it quicker than a hetero guy would fuck another guy in the ass even though he'd fuck he's going me on last the hetero guy was in prison listen it's a different ballgame coz guys guys will say I'm not gay but just meant it but my cooking something yeah that's a that's a strange thing isn't it how much humans adapt they adapt so much that straight people become gay while they're in jail to default a child I'll become the best master man from the planet and I'll fucking get artwork I saw a shank that someone made out of toilet paper why they don't know exactly how the dude did this but he somehow or another created a shank and use something hardened to toilet like a pipe a mesh a shank do the weirdest thing ever I mean just you think about human ingenuity and one of the things about prison is these guys are forced to adapt and survive and you know and kind of use their ingenuity moves their creativity and create things that knowing that's why they developed tattoo needles with you know at a genetic pens and yeah ink and they they'll burn things and use that the the melt them down yeah yeah yeah they'll like make ink they make their own ink at a burning plastic and burning paper and then they figure out how to make some sort of a machine with a battery and like it's really kind of amazing some of the things that people have done in jail but this was one of the weirdest man the guy made a weapon out of toilet paper let me attack someone with it or don't I found it I think they found it but they don't know they don't know what the fuck this guy did to make the toilet paper hard but you know he had made it to the point where it was like plaster oh fuck it was like you like he had developed a shank an actual shank out of toilet paper man that's one place I never end up in prison man I would not survive it's a dark fucking world man I know a dude who just got out this guy war machine yeah wool machine just got out like a few days ago riders from tweeting it yeah yeah if that asking me role-playing yeah he got a shit on Twitter wasn't a pretty experience it's not it's horrible and that's just that's just small-time shit that's just doing a year you know you watch those lockdown shows is it when I was in Jersey for Strikeforce I remember driving back to the airport I'm not sure if it was Newark or JFK or whatever but on the way to the airport actually we you drove you drive past a prison yard and in Australia like in Melbourne we have one prison we're bow in prison now which is in the country it's like out of Melbourne we used to have one right in the heart of the city but now it's out so I'm not used to seeing prisoners and like we drove past a prison yard and like as you're driving past the fucking fence to the prisoners right there with prisoners walking around in fucking orange uniforms and even I was in the cab I sort of shit myself just not used to seeing that being from Australia I'm like prisoners right there right near the road I can see them walking around the prisoners are a big big big sign the numbers of people in prisons a big sign that this society is a mess yeah that's that's if you ever wanted like some real hardcore evidence as to how much of a mess our society is our prison numbers a huge more people were in print more black banner in prison right now than were ever slaves really yeah I believe so I think that's true though and you know just the sheer numbers there's millions of people there's more people in jail in America than all of China and that's incredible when you see what China has over a billion people there's way more people in jail here we have more people in jail in several countries like if you add up a bunch of different countries in a row we have more put more people in jail than them fuck that is amazing well they make money off of it that's the sickest part about our jail system is that we have progress mr. Jones beta a very crammed and they're building more of them all the time and they're arresting people and more and more silly shit all the time well what's the the one in San Fran San Quentin yeah so we did a tour in San Francisco a few days ago and the tour guide pointed out San Quentin and he said it looks like there might be a possibility it's gonna be sold soon San Quentin prison the the land is gonna be the prisons gonna close down they'll relocate a prison somewhere else and tear it all down and build like San Quentin estate for the houses on it San Quentin is at the moment he sends a really good chance that happened who the fuck would want to live over all that gay rape dude it is in Melbourne the same pinch Ridge jail so I was trying to think of before was in Coburg which is in Melbourne in ER northern suburbs which has become quite a trendy spot at the moment used to be just the big ethnic spot still is but now a trendy spot and that's where Pendred prison was located and years ago they tore down pen trees and now it's apartments don't they remember if poltergeists build those houses over the Indian burial grounds and then the ghosts of the Indians came and fucked everybody no I would buy just one man if you ever get to Melbourne I'll take you to the Old Melbourne jail which is still spelled gaol the old way when ned kelly our most famous most famous yeah jailed the old english spelling is gaol GA oh yeah so old Mel's little girl yeah it's pronounced pronounced jail though based misspelling Gul yeah no miss so gay ole yeah but pronounced to jail but it's the old spelling the Old English ninety-four jail and Old Melbourne jail is where Ned Kelly who's our most famous criminal of all time you know some movies on him hills the dude the wall like a fucking chopper reads the most popular at the moment he's like the you know he's away the last ten years or so since Eric Bana did the movie that was a great movie a fantastic fucking Eric Bana rocks man yeah it was a bona fide celebrity now in Australia he's gonna I like that a comedian who does the impressions of them Harding the fuck out yeah yeah yeah do all the weather and that yeah well you know the whole criminal thing in in Melbourne at the moment is really being glorified especially our mobsters because there's this underbelly TV series which i think is hit America on one of the networks but underbelly is into like its fourth season or so now and it's a started off being about the the Melbourne underworld the Italian mobs and the you know the Ozzy sort of mobs that were warring with each other over the last 15 years there's only a few of them left now they ended up mostly killing each other off but just newspapers are full of it and underbelly series is rated so high in Australia there's that so the fascination with mobsters yeah they become like celebrities exactly then it becomes more popular yep yeah there's their Mob Wives he have you ever seen so my boss I'm setting my blinds those fucking monsters oh yeah yeah it's just so crazy there's one the fat one who's by herself and her husband left her you know their divorce but she's like a big star and she's always screaming and when there's busts on TV she's smoking cigarettes and crying and screaming like oh this monster these women end up with these guys you know those chicks the go to prison they fuck the fuck guys in prison I like have relationships with dudes in prison like how does a woman get to that point they love the strong like this what what it's what it represents you know they like going into a restaurant everybody respects some they like the fact that people pick up the tab because there there's afraid of these people yeah there's there's something about it it's like you know I mean it goes back to the Godfather movies it goes back to the John Gotti thing in New York it's like there's this weird sort of a romantic thing of knowing someone that's in the Mafia this people of weed finishes man I'm watching that's this organized crime thing is a deep thing yeah I grew up in Boston and right it was Whitey Bulger that guy who just got busted he was on the run for like 16 years but he ran the Irish mob and you know there was trained with a lot of whitey Bulger's hitmen did you ever used to have that Boston accent yeah I had that for really yeah that's cool exit man those pretty DS I love it it's cool whenever I see a movie studio stunt guy and you want to be look like a douche bag it's a great accent I love the sound of attack you fucking cat myself on TV when I was 19 yeah I was in the Bay State Game two taekwondo tournament now I heard myself on TV and it was so bad I immediately got rid the accent I figured out how to get it out yeah I had had it I had it was pretty deep we've been working really hard and I was like oh my god I listen to myself I was like what the fuck yeah it's sort of like a mix between American and British and something else it's really strange yeah but I love it I like movies where they have the Boston accent but it's fucking hot accent to try to replicate yeah its people fuck it up all the time yeah it's it's a tricky one it's an ancient it's a fun accent it's like it's a good accent to have if you hear if you're if you drink in and around a bunch of guys have Boston accents I guarantee you they're gonna be funnier that that's probably the funniest group of humans per capita is Boston men you know it's a hard life up there man women are ugly it's cold as fuck women are ugly in Boston monsters really monsters women it's like I said it's not their fault six assists hot women was he doubled the Texans are the not just Americans too it takes is you got you're only dealing with City Texas there's a different there's a different Texas oh it really is a Chainsaw Massacre Texas oh and you got to go out into the will you got to go to Jasper where they dragged black people behind trucks oh yeah really yeah there's math Texas okay I'll rephrase yeah let's Texas lovely oh yeah oh yeah and Houston Houston is amazing Austin is one of my favorite cities of all to Austin apparently everyone I've talked to it's like one of the most best cities in America yeah it's in crappy to go there but there's you know there's outside of that the problem is you drive outside of that a half an hour and you're you're in fucking Roscoe peak Coltrane culture really yeah yeah yeah gets its squirrely Texas is real squirrely and they got the real conservative laws and they they you know they can fuck you up over reefer or anything where guy was telling me that make my deal or we can shoot fuckers someone comes into your house you not only can shoot someone comes in your house you could shoot someone who's trying to repossess your car what yeah they've had people who shot people who they thought were trying to steal their car shot him with a rifle turns out was a repo guy turned out that he was vindicated and God never did any time at all really yeah shot a guy with a fucking deer hunting rifle that was just trying to do his job and repossess a car yeah yeah yeah you're a car thief you know that's how they look at it it's like some true even though the repo guys doing is legal you know the bank is repossessing its property and hired this guy to do it what the shooters doing is legal to because you didn't represent yourself as a repo man and even if you did even if you did he might be able to shoot you so it's not true that if you shoot an intruder you have to kill them no it's not sure no okay to shoot them you don't have to even shoot I mean there's no law like it's like a deer someone send me I just got it you shoot them you're gonna make sure you kill them otherwise I can sue you for shooting them well I bet they could yeah I bet they could sue not necessarily whether they would win or they could probably take you through the system yeah but if you did shoot them and kill them it wouldn't know then they can't sue you obviously know that but it wouldn't be a you wouldn't be cha-cha man slow down you know people have gotten in trouble in Texas for shooting their wife and boyfriend and gotten away with it really yeah it's like there's a crime of passion you come home some guys banging your wife and you fucking shoot them you know you can get away with that there's there's some tricky shit that you can get away with in Texas you know I don't know if it's a concealed-carry state I don't know if it is I don't know if you're loud till I'm go Wild West style and havin all fuckin holster booster is in some places you're not allowed to do that but you are allowed to carry it out in the open yeah so if you have like a handgun you just allowed to hold it out in the open as you walk towards the supermarket like what the fuck man you'd imagine you know you're going to the supermarket some dude is just walking but it's gone out in the open because that's how the law is you know the law states that what this thing coming to America America is great indeed what did you think of I'm Lucy whole Norway thing that just went down with this one guy I'm just getting all the information I opened up I didn't camp a children's camp something held a huge amount of children I mean I don't know how many it's gonna be all told because there's a lot of injuries and some of these kids are gonna die but it's over 80 kids I believe I know is one of those countries that flies them to the right on any never hears shit from Norway nothing bad ever comes out of nowhere well my buddy Doug Stanhope just filmed his last DVD there in Oslo where this always happen and there's one guy some crazy and all they're saying is he's very religious and you know and an anti Muslim I believe but that's who knows who knows how much they even know about what the fuck the real situation is it's you know it's the dust is still settling what a horrible horrible people to do this is it just the thing is just being fucking pure evil just your fucking evil you know who knows man you know did you ever see though the man who shot there was a woman who was a congressman oh shut the place where they hit or whatever yes she lived Gifford and then you know he killed a bunch of people else on the scene that guy had a bunch of videos that he had put on YouTube and written some things and it was just he was obviously his brain wasn't working right he had like is like he would make these you say these things are just like would they would call word salad just throw a bunch of words together it didn't make any sense like there was obviously a disconnect he was functioning in correct and look the human mind is a very complicated instrument and sometimes it's fucked up sometimes it's it's off just like some people get cancer and some people get diseases some people's brains don't work some people have some fucking TV show with this guy had a fetish for vomit he was caught off the Greek word for vomit I should've asked Irene but as a fetish of his and the only way he could get hard was when chicks vomited so he would pay prostitutes to spew on him and vomit and if he went to a restaurant and he saw someone chuck he would go and scoop the chuck up and put it in a plastic bag and they took the camera inside this giant freezer that he'd stored all these bags of vomit from over the years and he had each one of the bags like documented so he was grabbing a bag off the off they were frozen frozen scene grab it right he's like oh yeah Taco Bell 1992 she fucking blew chunks on the floor like a fucking get turned on just thinking about it and then in a midnight midnight fucking finish four people fucking chucking up and gills spewing on him the only way he could get an erection if a hooker or a friend of his would you pay them to stick their fingers down their throat and chuck up on him once yeah like you explain that like also these dudes dudes that they're called feeders and they feed those fat chicks the little skinny if you've seen that feeders there's nothing not a TV show I saw a show again have you got feasting uh some crazy shit on TV here these little skinny fucking dudes it looks like they're 45 to 50 kilos in weight and has their what is that in pounds um okay yes a hundred and ten hundred twenty pounds right they have these wives or girlfriends who are fucking behemoths like 300 pound in manual Yarbrough looking fucking women who lie in bed all day and immobilize because they're so huge they can't really fucking move and then little man feed and the little men feed them they're called feeders and they get off sexually I'm feeding these women and just constantly fucking FEMEN them and given these women fucking fat I can't say I'm surprised I am surprised I would have been surprised if you told me that twenty years ago if you told me that before I knew about the internet I'd be like but really I would say that doesn't even make any sense why would somebody it may be one person's into that be something on the show online community of this I've it's not apparently it's like I wants that popular fiend but it's like a theme there's like a fader community and fucking skinny dudes are fading these cheeks just feeding them constantly singing by the bedside fucking someone has to violence when those people become a mobile and they can't even leave the house do you think well that's the perfect time to go on a diet yeah you can't even move would it take to starve someone like that to death if you just gave them water they have so much fat yes they precious the fat wouldn't like it for a while more than a normal push so you would die and starvation still even if you were that I would because his stomach would stop shrinking is that what would happen if you give them water rots this thing hydrated yeah if you just gave them water nobody stopped you I don't know that's what I'm saying it's not efficient I don't think you can just like use it as an alternative fuel supply using food for energy because they just fucking lying there yeah we need some just to pump blood and breathe air they need they need some energy I don't think it's possible I mean I think I mean I know it's not possible I know you would starve to death even if you're a big fat fuck but I wonder how many days you would last and one of you would last like if you have like a lean guy you know you get like a fucking cow Kingsbridge super Anthony lean guy and you put him in a room with some Jabba the Hutt look and stop them both who would die for this who would die first that's interesting you would think the fat guy would have at least a little bit more energy how's the little guy fuck the fat chick how does it even fun the pussy the probably doesn't probably doesn't just get probably just fucking tosses off he did somebody likes him you know there's some people out there that are just happy than anybody likes him it'll take anybody how did she what they're broken it's probably doesn't there was a woman who died who was like grafted into a couch she was slowly her skin was starting to graft itself to the couch and when they cut her out of the house they'd have cut a hole in the wall to pull her out of the house and when they cut her out they had to cut her out with the couch oh fuck yeah then she died of complications that's crazy man yeah well you know what there's like I said there's a broad spectrum people can go off the fucking diggety diggety deep end many different ways this other dude on this show had had an obsession that he wanted to return to the womb oh whoa and his wife was pregnant and he was jealous of his unborn child for being in his wife's womb and he said that his thing was he had an obsession with needing to return to the womb can imagine that poor woman have to deal with that bitch bitch of a man and that's the one who's fathering your children mm-hmm some fucking freak weird fetishes yeah climb back inside I guess on your fucking uterus yeah so he doesn't have to deal with it anymore would it be a baby's tummy and be safe back in the little house of the pretty to believe it crazy assholes well we we live in extreme times and you and I travel in the most extreme circles you know if you really think about it the Cagefighting commentary and kickboxing commentary flying all over the world and being around all these savages and and yet we're still shocked by the level of human behavior out there and it wasn't that strange that like don't get shocked by the violent knockouts I seen the crazy cuts in the blood and I see but did you think that when you were in that fight with that dude that dude was coming out you just think like wow I'm just so used to conflict and so used to fights that it's like it's even though you're not getting in them you probably were way more calm than in there yeah average dude very calm you're so used to being around fights just she'd mind it's just it's that so why is in your face oh okay Betty you sing it at the highest level at the lowest level you just sing it so just it's almost programmed into you H Dean that's gotta step it up dude HDNet SCOTUS

believe so yeah well you know they bought the UFC for like 2 million mm-hmm but if you bought k1 for even 10 million bucks man dude Mark Cuban could turn k1 into a monster fuck you take the same level of talent the real high-end guys they have now in k1 max man and the the k1 Grand Prix the Heavyweight Grand Prix and put those on in Vegas and make a big fuckin deal out of it make me the prisoner
