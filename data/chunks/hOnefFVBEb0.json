three-two-one yes we live not yet pause hold YouTube some sort of a struggle yeah we're live okay how are you you're a wheeler Walker jr. fantasy um I may be I will be you will you never heard of him before I hadn't I confess mmm that's okay um so first of all thank you thanks for doing this appreciate it yeah no problem what is it like I mean I guess this is the best way to get this started what is it like being a person that grew up in the Westboro Baptist Church for personally outside for me I when I think of that I think of like this crazy hateful angry environment filled with like really mean people that say horrible things about gay people and all sorts other folks that I meet you and you're super nice seems so normal that is the conundrum so I mean a lot of the things the words that you just used to describe the church that's definitely not how I experienced it growing up for the most part um I mean my family outside of when they're not on the picket line there I mean incredibly kind and gentle and and compassionate and I think the biggest misconception about the church is that they're motivated by hatred mmm and in their eyes it's the definition of loving what we really thought we were doing what we were doing was loving our neighbor so in the first time that phrase appears in the Bible it's in the context of when you see your neighbor sinning you have to rebuke him not just like watch him wander off on this way to hell so that was how we saw we thought we were warning people and giving them the only hopeful message that could save them from eternity in hell was there ever any dissent amongst the the people that were in the church about like how the message is being distributed like if you're holding up a sign that says God hates fags and a gay guy was being buried at a funeral and you guys were there protesting with those signs I presenter anyone inside the organization that was like hey this is not the way to do it these people are suffering and mourning not really I mean once once my grandfather it was if he was the one who kind of developed that strategy he thought so you know this the examples are for funerals if somebody if they're burying somebody so a soldier say or a gay person it's an example of the curses of God so God says if you obey me I'll bless you and if you disobey me I'll curse you so why soldiers so several times in the scriptures it's this connection between the sins of the nation and the punishments so for instance in the book of Judges it says they chose new gods then was war in their gates and then in the books of the kings that says they there fell down many slain because the war was of God and then in the book of Hosea it says they have deeply corrupted themselves therefore I will remember their iniquity and I will visit their sins though they bring up their children yet will I believe them there shall not be a man left so it's these these threatenings these warnings from God that if you disobey me I'm going to curse you so we would go to these soldiers the soldiers funerals to warn the living to say that if if you don't want to be likewise punished you have to repent you have to change your ways and obey God now people that are also hardcore Christians that also follow the Word of God very closely but still would see like what you guys were doing at these funerals holding up these signs protesting where a soldier who supposedly gave his life for our freedom right supposedly they're over there fighting so that we could be safe here and then you guys are out there with these signs like there had to be a lot of people that have like-minded views in Christianity but still were furiously people yeah absolutely and and from our perspective we thought that they were substituting their righteousness for the righteousness of God so they were upset that we were out there giving this message that was 100% biblical and our from our point of view and they God calls that compassion when he sends his servants with his message so we thought even though they call themselves Christians they're ignoring these you know vast swathes of the Bible that that support what we were saying and how we were saying it so I mean there was definitely a lot of a lot of pushback from people on all sides but and especially from other Christians but we just thought they're not really Christian because they're not like this like we understand it so you guys were pretty much solidified in your opinion it was a consensus it was like everybody thought you were doing the right thing right so I mean so that when the soldiers funerals when those protesting it was in June of 2005 that we started protesting soldier's funeral how was it brought up so my grandfather had been it was 2005 so the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan you know he'd been you see these things on the news and he was the funerals like what was going on at the funerals and he said these aren't funerals these are patriotic pep rallies and they're saying all these things about God Bless America well God isn't blessing America God is cursing America so we have to go and and give a different message um so that's how it came up initially but so I went to my first soldiers funeral protest and then the following month in July of 2005 and before I went so you know every time we would go to these things I was protesting from the time I was five years old so when you go out on the you know to these protests a lot of times there would be media there they have people asking questions and I wasn't sure how I would answer that if somebody asked me why are you at this funeral I didn't I wasn't sure how I would answer it so like I felt very when I found out I was going I thought I thought I need to I need to understand this so I went to my mother and she brings forth those verses that I just quoted to you and several others we sat down as a family as we did every night you know to read the Bible and to talk about world events and you know the church's interpretation of these events in light of their understanding of the Scriptures so you know she goes through and explains this you know very carefully and because her answers came from the Bible I was that was my foundation was that the Bible is the infallible Word of God and that it's true no matter what any human thinks and that we have a duty to obey it 100% no matter no matter what I think or feel otherwise I have to bring my thoughts and opinions in line with this so even though I had a lot of trepidation at the beginning about going to those funerals I very quickly acclimated to it you know as you do when in an environment like that where everything depends on you falling into line now what was it like when you first did it like what was the reaction to other people well you know other people's reaction to you mm-hmm so that very first one it was in Omaha Nebraska and it was incredibly tense so there was a bunch of cops we always every time we would go to protest somewhere we would contact the police to make sure that there would be a police presence was because people were tempted to and did you know would come after us physically and try to assault us and and again this happened with some regularity so from the very earliest days of the protesting we you know my mom and her generation had made this decision to who I should say many of them are lawyers so they would you know write letters from you know as attorneys saying we're going to be coming we're going to be protesting in your city people this is what we do you know we hold signs on public sidewalks we are not violent we so explaining what approach what our protest looked like and then and then saying if you want to avoid you know these kind of like violence that often happens would be there so this first one how old are you in 2005 I was 19 so you were a kid you know but a grown kid and you know you're with your parents and this is the first time you're protesting a veteran what was that experience like so I'm standing across the support standing across the street from the church like I said it was very solemn very quiet there were which is not it was not normal really for protest a lot of times we would be out there you know singing and chanting and and making it was a big public display but this was like I said incredibly tense nobody was really talking nobody was really moving and you know the family was you know pulled up in a and I think I was in a limousine across the street and the family got out and looked around and saw us and did they know you guys were going to be there beforehand mm-hmm because we always would publicize that we would send out news releases so they were aware that we were going to be there and there were a bunch of I think there were Marines like in dress blues standing there and they looked incredibly angry and and upset but like I said I was it was like it felt like at any moment if something happened like that the whole situation could explode but again let's with the cops having the cops standing there and so it was um it was it was it was pretty it was really tense what kind of things are they saying to you guys they weren't saying anything like none of this which they're what I was trying to say it's really unusual for protests like that we a lot of times we would be exchanging you know we would we would course would be yelling about Bible verses and hatred of God and you know they would be talking about love and tolerance and how we're wrong and not Christian and but at this one it was it was very quiet it wasn't always like it so pretty quickly you know once again once we became acclimated to do the protest and also there a have you heard of the Patriot Guard riders it was a group of motorcyclists who decided to and they formed like in across the country so in every state there was a group of these motorcyclists who when they found out we were going to be protesting somewhere they would go and you know rev their engines so that our words and songs and such wouldn't be heard by the family and and they would we know hold American flags and try to block you know it's always it's putting a buffer between us and the family and so when when that started to happen it became almost like a game sometimes and in hindsight I this makes me cringe and and but but it became like this game of trying to like show that we were going to get our message across no matter what any human being wanted because we knew we were so sure that this was what God wanted Wow what made you leave a lot of things it started my very first sort of conscious doubts came from conversations on Twitter so Wow yeah something good got done through Twitter yeah lots of good things I also met my husband there oh there you go while I was still at the church oh come out it's an atheist I I don't know that he would use that word to describe himself I was just talking to him about this and I was like when people the problem with the word is when people when you say atheist people think jerk and like so else all so many people do so many people think it's like oh you sure absolutely certain that there is no God and so it's it's a word that I hesitate to use to describe myself - but but I'm not a not a believer I wanna say I'm not a believer because I I love people I believe in people and that there is so much hope and for people and that we can I don't know anyway so so conversations that you had on Twitter did what do you like what what doors they open in your mind right so I got on Twitter and it was like an extension of the picket line right so go out there with these picket signs and you know people would come up to us and ask us questions and so it was this it was a constant a constant conversation and so I got on Twitter to take that you know - to the Internet to reach more people and so one of the first things I did when I got on Twitter was to attack this Jewish man named David Abbott ball who ran a blog called Julius he was listed as the second most influential Jew on Twitter on this was number one um I actually can't remember not memorably not part of my story um you can check it it's the jTA's list if you want to children but anyway so he's listed as number two and so he responded initially with you know sarcasm and and hostility um but pretty quickly he sort of changed tactics and started instead of like mocking me although he still did do that some - he's asking questions about our picket signs and I started asking him questions about Jewish theology because I I wanted to better know how to counter it you know to run the scriptures I I was sure that they were wrong Jews killed Jesus and and they reject him as the Messiah and so all of these things um so um right so we're having this back and forth and this goes on for about during that year I actually met him twice I protested him twice once so you went to his functions or was he giving speeches like yeah so in Long Beach actually at the Jewish accessable they had this Jewish cultural festival the great name yeah it's great he's great um so he right so I he was going to be there uh and you know I went and I was protesting him and he came out to the picket line and it was it was one of those like very rowdy pickets there was a bunch of counter protesters like and they were it was I had enough guys dresses like the Easter Bunny and Jesus and you know it actually got pretty violent I was actually sued got violent well yeah and the cops this mayor told you we called the cops like the cops were just and they're watching people like actively assaulting that's like hitting us and so we're like walking around trying to you know to not be hit because we're not gonna hit back we were there like I said the church is very against violence like they're not going to be violent to people or defend themselves just just too so I was actually really glad when David came out because he became like a buffer between me and the rest of the counter protesters because they everybody could tell that he was he was wearing his delicious shirt and whatever anyway so so the conversation continued there and then also at another protest six or seven months later um and then I was not long after that second protest were talking again and he was asking about one of our signs that said death penalty for fags and you know of course I'm reiterating why the church believes that he was in the Book of Leviticus God calls for the death penalty for gay gays and and then in Romans 1 in the New Testament it's reiterated says they that commit such things are worthy of death so and so but I'm telling David these things and he says um it's like yeah but didn't Jesus say let he who is without sin cast the first stone and I said what we always said to that which was we're not casting stones were preaching words and he said yeah but you're advocating that the government cast stones and I remember you know this is all through Twitter so I I see this message and I kind of gassed and I was like I had never connect that Jesus there of course he was talking about the death penalty specifically about the death penalty and we were advocating it and so I wasn't sure how to respond but he David kept kept going he said and and what about this member of your church who had a child out of wedlock and I said what what about it like that this is another point you know people it was you know common knowledge people knew about this and what though this interface and we would say the standard of God isn't sinlessness it's repentance so she doesn't deserve that punishment because she repented she stopped you know she wasn't having premarital sex anymore and she knows that it's wrong and she changed her mind and she changed her conduct which is what repentance is and he said yeah but she would have been killed if you had instituted the death penalty for that sin and it was the first time again that I connected that if you kill somebody as soon as they sinned they you lose the opportunity to repent and be forgiven and so again so I'm just sort of staring at my phone and you know in Topeka Kansas he's in Jerusalem and I really quickly ended the conversation I don't even remember quite how but it was just sort of this like I hadn't I didn't know how to handle this because like I said the church is full of lawyers they're very intelligent and their arguments and their theology for the most part is very well-constructed and super consistent and so for there to be this you know this this hypocrisy this contradiction I didn't like my brain was felt like I was exploding so I went to a couple people in the church including my mother and the response was feel free to stop me at any time by the way I feel like I'm Filipino um so she she reiterated the same verses that I had told David that that supported our position but she didn't address the contradiction and when I seemed unsatisfied with it she said I was getting wrapped around an axle and just sort of you know pushed it aside and the response was so just to shut me down and then to move on to the next thing which is it's a very human thing right when somebody puts something in your face that that is this contradiction that you're not ready to deal with it that you can't it's you you you know I mean you realize you kind of sort of push it aside and try not to so the way that I dealt with it was to stop holding the sign because I knew that if somebody asked me about it I I couldn't defend it because I didn't I didn't believe it but there was nothing else I could do at that point and but the importance of that conversation this is obviously just one small contradiction one small inconsistency and a vast you know we still I still believe that everybody outside the church was basically is that completely wrong and and evil and or delusional and that the church was basically right except this one point did anybody ever feel that it was bad to use slurs like to use some sort of insulting term for gay people instead of saying God hates gay people so at the very beginning they did use the word gays you wanted to change it well so my grandfather would say that gay is a misnomer these people aren't happy they're committing suicide and they're they're evil and abominable and they have no peace Scott has taken their their peace they're not happy so gay is a misnomer and so the word the word fag they say like Amos in the Book of Amos there's a it's translated firebrand there so my grandfather would say the word fag is an elegant metaphor and it's gays you know but of fags are a bundle of sticks right used for kindling so gays are they burn in their lust one toward another and they fuel the fires of hell and the fires of God's wrath so it's an elegant metaphor grandpa Crimson say um do you know the original metaphor was really supposed to be you mean from the Bible no the word faggot oh no actually fagot means a bundle of woods a bundle of wood and they would use that expression to describe a woman because a bundle of wood is burdensome like carrying around a bundle of wood is very burdensome so when they would call a woman a faggot they were saying that she was burdensome so when they would call a man a faggot they would say that he is burdensome like a woman like a bundle of wood like a non manly man they can't get work done you know those along those lines and then it became used by people erroneously saying that it was about burning them and that they would burn gay people because they would burn faggots of wood that's not really the case it sounds cool yeah I actually had never heard that before yeah yeah if you see if you can find that Jamie Google that the original term faggot meant burden but bundle of wood and burdensome like a bundle of wood cuz I mean think about like carrying a bundle of wood especially if you didn't have a truck it's huge pain in the ass that's kind of what the source of it was Wow you know I had no I had no yeah people use it wrong and the real problem is the people that use it wrong or like gay activists they try to say how horrible that word is because it was used to represent how gay people were burnt but there's never been like a time in history where like there's a whole series of gay people that were like burnt you know it's just like they drowned witches and things were done like real specifically but it's never been like a thing what we got here the word faggot has been used in English since the late 16th centuries a abusive term for women particularly old women referenced to homosexual sexuality may derive from this there was it have to be so weird the way you got it oh okay yeah gorillas go blah blah blah so there it is an alternative possibilities that the word connected with the practice of fagging in British private schools in which younger boys performed potentially sexual duties for older boys although the word faggot was never used in this context hmm wrong but the big one means the bundle of wood the bundle of sticks what's that Jamie what he got something awkward to be carried Israel yes exactly burdensome so that's where it comes from really didn't have anything to do with burning people but like they will they'll repeat it like to make a big point like a big dramatic point but it's you know it's melodramatic you would think I would know this given our respective histories but I literally have never heard this in my life yeah it's an important distinction for why people use that term because it's really just that they're annoying I mean it's really just you know they just think of some non manly man who can't get things done he's probably crying all the time these burdens them my experience of gay people since we left there's obviously much more maybe reflective of reality has not been that what has it been like an impossibly wonderful don't overcompensate because you're getting out of this bad environment I'll take it down to Santa Monica Boulevard some of the gayest spots on earth you'll see dudes with cutoff shorts and you'll change your tune what are they doing well I mean I'm not trying to like to paint everybody with one brush and now I have I've been amazing as soon as you start being attracted to men something happens now I'm different than everyone I mean like they're just people right looks just sure so I mean right after we left like at first I thought we have to hide from the past forever my sister and I should say left together how old you guys so I was 26 I was almost 27 and did you have a long conversation before he did it many maybes about four months but between when I first talked to her about leaving so what was the first initial conversation and how did you gather up the courage to even sort of breach the subject it was really terrifying and awful because I mean I remember from the time I was very young there's this passage in Deuteronomy that my mom would quote and it's about you know somebody if you are you know friend it's somebody close to you your relative somebody comes up to you and says let us go and serve other gods like somebody secretly says to you those things you have to stone them and you the one that they came to you're supposed to be the first one to and my hammies not stoning people what would they do though if it said it in the Bible and someone said hey we've got a we have to serve this golden cow so they we also have the New Testament it talks about rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are gone so we also have to obey the law of man we have to obey the law of so and weren't so we're not supposed to be um just so law of man supersedes law of God we're supposed to be obedient to the laws of men but also I mean there this is kind of a complicated a little bit theology where it's sort of undid a lot of the mosaic code that we didn't actually have to follow those things but honestly I don't know I think it's the whole I think it's like the death penalty for fags thing so like if they still believe that that punishment is is applicable then then we should be trying to convince the government lobbying the government to like with those signs right so um so that I was you know my sister if I went to her and said these things to her she could easily have turned around them and told my parents not as a it's a culture of tattletales not out of bad intention but because they believe that they're trying to help you right they don't want you to go down a bad path so so we know when I was it was the first thought of leading on Jewish July force and I was with my sister at the time and when it first occurred to me that I might that I might have to leave the church that the church might be wrong I thought I had to leave like that second because if it even occurred to me that meant I didn't belong there and that God was gonna punish me and that I I just felt like immediately so much guilt and like I was a betrayer but was all your social life connected still to the church yeah and was this where you had you already known your husband by then I had yes he corrupted you he was definitely part of it so but like it wasn't like that it's like the beginning like so so he was just another person on Twitter at first and it was just it was like friendly conversation and this went over the you know over the course of several months I don't know eight eight or eight months or so seven or eight months and then it was never and there was never anything you know about feelings or you know relationships are all that stuff is totally for pictures no nothing like that like not even like not even anything like nothing like it's just that mine didn't work that way and that there is there can be no relationship like that with outsiders but Outsiders Outsiders yeah so you know and your I actually thought I was never going to get married because most of the people in church about you 80 percenters other people in the church there's only 80 people or so anyway were my immediate and extended family so no there's no way I'm getting I'm just not gonna get me she just accepted that it was it wasn't it wasn't like an like an easy thing at first but it was just it was just the facts on the ground you know I got so the facts on the ground were you had to date someone inside the church there was only 80 people in the church they're all your family you can't date your family fuck yeah Wow I mean I I should say there were a couple of people my age and they can't they had just joined the church like you know that but I had no like I had no interest in any of them no she won Pickens and not and but yeah it's it's it was kind of strange but I so I actually had a dream about meeting so I should say also my husband at the time I didn't know he was totally anonymous on Twitter like I said it's just his words I didn't know what it looked like I didn't know you know his name or where he lived or anything about him except except these words um and he was he was just curious and kind and and that sort of and he loved people and so he would sort of always be pushing pushing the conversation back to his like I'm giving it much like I've told you all those verses about protesting funerals and why we have to go and do this and the importance of it and why we have to thank God for these tragedies because God is sovereign and he's in control so I'm I'm talking about the scripturally like the justifying all these things and he kept pushing it back to because he's not super well versed in the Bible um so he didn't know how to I just like I see that the Bible says these things but what about the family like I just cannot imagine going and doing these things to two people and so this is all happening like on as I'm so I'm also still having conversations on Twitter with so many other people so it's like Twitter became this like empathy machine for me like so it's not just like on a picket line where people are butting heads and you know arguing and debating and yelling and it's I'm yes having these it can be kind of aggressive conversations but I'm also like photos of their cats and them you know exchanging you know joking with their friends and so I'm seeing a side of people and sort of being immersed in this community in a way that I had never been before and so it was really it's like I'm trying to say like when you say why did you leave like there's it took it was so much sort of happening you know around this time so when by the time this like pile up of things you know and I'm processing it as I'm going through this I'm also talking to my sister and and she was the only and other people in the church but she was the only person if I ever had a doubt or a question or like if I thought we're doing something wrong here she was the only person who would say yeah you're right that doesn't make sense that I should say my sister is creative and artistic and had like a little bit of reputation for being kind of rebellious not as like submissive as money and our other sister so it was this dynamic of you know between the two of us where she was the only person I could fully articulate my thoughts and feelings to um and so when I first thought of leaving and I turn around and I thought I literally it was we were painting at a friend's house painting the walls and I I turned around to set my paintbrush down I thought I had to go and leave that second and I turned around and tell my sister and I thought I can't leave without talking to her so the next day I she came home from work over the you know lunch hour and we would always like go up to my room and we were talking about all these doubts we were having and I was crying and I put my head in her lap and and I couldn't even start like articulating the idea of leaving was too much like it's it's terrifying and it's just seemed like impossible and I said um what if we weren't here and she said what do you mean and I said what if we were somewhere else and so that starts this conversation where you know I cannot let go of all the things that I thought that the church was doing wrong that are where our theology was wrong where we were applying it wrong I mean in a way that that was destructive and unscriptural and she kept pushing the conversation back to we're never going to see our family again we're going to lose everyone and everything that's ever been important to us there is no hope outside this church all the things that we had learned about Outsiders that you know that they were evil and they could never truly love each other or care about care about one another they're really just enabling one another on the path to hell so and so this this back and forth you know goes on for about four months before we finally actually left and it was as bad or worse --is and I could have imagined but to get back to the well let's get to that bad or worse you could have ever imagined so oh so you left how did you leave uh we were talking to my parents and you know and it was another another issue had come up and I I couldn't we couldn't it was a battle that we weren't gonna fight again we can I should say in those four months I kept trying to to articulate these doubts in a way that the church would accept like trying to convince them not being as oh but as time went on I became more and more open about about these questions and doubts um and I just I couldn't we couldn't fight it anymore I just looked at grace and I said we have to go and because we and I should say also we had already been packing like we had we had started packing our things about a little over a month before that and we had started like taking boxes to our friend's house and with the understanding he's actually our he was our high school English teacher um that we had kept up with on Twitter and he you know I basically told him you know if something changes if the church changes and these things get better then we'll take a lot of stuff back and just pretend like none of this ever happened and he was just you know understanding and compassionate and and really supportive but so we had done all this stuff already but we actually had to go and pack the rest of our things so we walked out of our parents bedroom and went and started packing and you know people started coming my brother and some of the elders and my aunt my cousin you know people I we were very close like our whole my whole life revolved around the church and so to look these people in the face and say that you know this the you know the us them mentality it the bonds that are created in environments like that are incredibly strong at least they were in our church and again most of these people are also my family um so it was it was awful and I'm sure you know crying and packing and trying to explain to them why why we're leaving and I can hardly talk you know be just just I was so overwhelmed but um actually had to go back the next day with a u-haul to get the rest of our stuff more our parents help this pack it's not it's not one of those like there are some or groups like that where they don't want you elite they'll they'll try to stop you from leaving like I heard him a Scientology the Miscavige yeah I can't breastfeed wrong wrong yeah he was talking about like fizz like actual obstacles to you leaving like physically like they're not gonna you can't get out of the gate right nothing like that you know my they always would say this is a volunteer army and if you don't want to be here then you don't belong here so it's just the it's the threat of losing everything and every law nation mm-hmm yeah being ostracized by and sort of expelled into this world that you believe and have always believed is as evil and without hope and doomed so how did you do it how did think you've got all your stuff packed people coming in there saying yeah I mean like they're they're they're trying to convince us but once they understand that we're not being convinced that that you know they they walked away so I mean aren't that night our dad dropped us off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ yeah like it's it's so immediate that you become this you become other you become an outsider like in the next morning when he went back I rang the doorbell I rang the doorbell it's your own house and I had lived in that house from the day I was born whoa so you felt like you had to ring doorbell this is not my world anymore yeah Wow grace was like why don't you ring the doorbell and I was like there's there's no other there's there is nothing else like it this is not our home this is not so we go and you know we're packing all of our things it was just it was awful just a I had been in those four months I had been so terrified of because I know knowing what was coming like just imagine you're going to lose everyone in your life that they're just you're just going to like you're not going to like how your parents met and fell in love or like your grandparents and family recipes and photos and memories and what did the houseless I'm like taking photos and voice recordings and just all the time like an every it was just it's overwhelming it's but did was there also like a feeling of relief was there also a feeling of like we actually did it I'm actually doing it it's actually happening I'm gonna get away from this I know this isn't real I know this isn't right did you understand that it was a cult so I was really against and I still don't attend not to use that word I mean it's it's a fine shorthand I guess for some there are aspects of the church that are not cult ish for sure like what like what I just sub saying like there's no they're not trying to get your money they're not trying to like though not some charismatic leader trying to have sex with everybody's wives and children or whatever it's nothing like that it's but there are definitely aspects that are occult ish the fact that you can't there is no such thing as agreeing to disagree like that's and the the penalty for disagreeing is so high like so there are things like that that that are definitely quote like but um but I was definitely I was not in that in that moment I was not okay with using that that term for sure right it was definitely a it was it took a lot of time and well it's a derogatory term but what it represents is an ideology that a group subscribes to doesn't necessarily have to have all the negative ramifications of an ideology for it to fit into the category of a cult right yeah and I totally understand that now which is why like you know if somebody says it I I sometimes will will say there are things that aren't cult-like and explain what I think is not but I'm also I don't do it every single time I underst and that it's that it's a so you get all your stuff after you ring the doorbell you're gone and then how do you like enter into the world did you have a job back then or did you have a job with the church there's the job with the church looking for the law firm so Jesus home job family life just just everything all at once and then also of course you're going into a world that I had just spent my entire life you know protesting and run and just so crazy when I look back now at videos which I couldn't do for a long time but more they there's tons of videos and interviews and documentaries that you know where I'm answering all these questions and I it's it's crazy were you there when Louis through can do the documentary yeah did you talk to him while he was there yeah both times he was the first time it was but he was really super nice um you know he came and we were like making egg rolls together and like going bowling and jumping on the trampoline and and yeah he would come to pick it then it was really funny because like that so he came for three weeks like but three weeks like a month like one month he came for a week and the next month came for another week and then came again so the first time like I didn't know anything about him or who he was really I mean I knew who's from the BBC obviously in that but I hadn't seen any of his stuff and then before he came the next time I was supposed to be studying for a test or something I was in college and I was procrastinating so I look on YouTube and find this documentary that he did do you know the one though white supremacy then he's Louie in the Nazis yeah so I watched that entire documentary and I was like ah like I know what his angle is like it's them oh these poor kids they were raised in this they don't know any better and at the time I was kind of indignant because I was like I am a thinking person you know like I at all my life growing up like it was never just like I explained about the soldiers funerals like I never just just went along with something like I wanted to understand why I needed to understand that it was scriptural and from the Bible and so if you could show me that then but like I'm a I'm a curious person so but I just had never obviously questioned like the the most foundational premises of our belief system which is the Bible is the infallible Word of God and Westboro Baptist Church are the only ones who have who can understand it correctly mmm I just I just never I never really got got past that because if it was in the Bible and it made sense to me then I was fine so anyway so I was kind of indignant when I saw what Louie was trying to do like we're just poor children and and so and I went told my family and so then everybody you know everybody knew about it this you know what he was doing and I remember telling him something about how he was it was insidious what he was doing because he was not being honest he was being really friendly but not being honest about what he really thought about us uh anyway What did he say to that well he said actually he actually addressed it specifically in the second documentary he said you've been saying this but but I've never pretended to agree with you I've never I've been pretty pretty honest about it um and I'm an atheist I don't believe that what you're doing is right I don't believe the Bible is the Word of God da da da um and so I of course I mean he's right he was exactly right um but I definitely couldn't see it at the time um well you leave you get out and then what do you do do you get a job so I thought immediately so I I my degrees in finance so I went through Business School all these people saying you know start saving for retirement immediately did enough so and you know we believe that the doom of the world was eminent oh I never really did that um so end-of-days type stuff yeah yeah so you were thinking that because of all the sin one day there's going to be reckoning and all the Christians are going to vanish yep destruction is imminent was one of our sirens you guys will watch that movie was terrible two terrible movies with Kirk Cameron about the apocalypse goddamn left behind no oh they're so good you should watch them is that they were terrible oh they are terrible but they're so good they're so bad that they become like oh my god what the fuck is this Jeremy Kirk Cameron No I want to meet that dude mmm no I it's really funny as you listen to Sam Sam Harris's podcast yes so this episode with Lawrence Wright he said something like Lawrence Wright said said something like author of going clear the book on Scientology yes yes he said um he talked about Freud the narcissism of small differences it was like oh my god yes like we other Christians like where some of our biggest targets oh it would be like the smallest things like for instance there was like one church that we had some kind of like very little affiliation with in the early days of the picketing and then there women started to cut their hair those bitch women are not allowed to cut their hair you're not allowed to cut your hair at all we weren't allowed to cut our hair at all you know oh my god that's hilarious because of a Bible verse you know what is the Bible verse a oh it's 1st Corinthians 11:14 I think actually it says a woman's hair is her glory it says don't you know doesn't nature itself teach you that it's the shame for a man to have long hair but a woman's hair is her glory and it's given to her for a covering so hmm it it says a long hair right so my grandmother interpreted that to mean uncut which again like I I did not we didn't believe in interpretation of the church like the fact that he was adding something into the Bible that wasn't there before cuz I was thinking I was long hair without rhyme still cut in yeah but but it's like if long hair is good the nun cuts better so he had his rules Oh what about clothes like how do you reconcile the fact you're not supposed to wear two different types of cloth so that so their church sees this as a distinction between the ceremonial law of Moses and the moral law ceremonial laws like mixed fabrics and keeping kosher is it like penalty by death of mixed fabrics I actually can't remember but but we just have them preposterous like that we didn't worry about it though because we thought these passages in the New Testament said you don't have to follow with those ceremonial laws so we didn't worry about it but did you guys spend any time researching the actual history of the New Testament like how it was constructed so not I mean some yes but not really because in our means God is sovereign right so the Church believes our predestination so God controls everything and everyone so God controlled the construction of the New Testament as well exactly right even though it was done by men it was God's will to have it be so it was all God's Word yep exactly how convenient mm-hmm you just don't have to you don't have to ask those questions but what about the fact that is like Constantine wasn't even a Christian until his deathbed is that because God didn't want it to be that way it's just it does it's irrelevant it's a nice sweet loophole if you just say that's God's will God knew the entire time don't worry about it but it's much man wrote it yeah what they did him cuz God let him do it but then the question is which version right which is another question like I I sort of instinctively avoided it it's like atheist would ask this question like why the King James Version yeah and you know you can't really answer because a grant said so like Brian that's not did we actually say that my grandfather was the fount like pastor first pastor the only pastor for the you know founded the West Rob his church I don't think we did but I think everybody kind of knows okay good so what I would know yeah I just wrap off yeah I was Gramps Fred Phelps writes yes exactly um anyway I just wanted to close that loop um so it's just but like what was the what was the thought process behind like just accepting that kind of stuff like did your grandfather ever bring up the even older versions of the Bible that they were finding like who was his thoughts on like the Dead Sea Scrolls and things along those lines just didn't address it because it just didn't matter because right again it's all God's Word anyway it's God's will it's God's Word so it's so fascinating when someone's so rigid with their belief system it's like this is it and this is and as long as you believe that it's all God's wills like all it's God's will seriously but the New Testament was written by Constantine a bunch of bishops and other God's will and God let him do it right okay and not just let him do it but caused him caused him forced it had it happen yep he knows what he's doing yep absolutely every every word of our conversation George would think that this how does God allow all the you know sodomy and all the crazy shit going on why is God allow that so this is why I'm not anymore oh you're confused you like what though well so there's this passage in Romans nine well it's not it's not the only reason I should say but but I have really I have real trouble with this and I think it's it's still hard for me to say I think this is evil but I think this is evil there's this passage in in Romans 9 that talks about it gives us analogy of God as Potter and humans as clay in his hands and it uses the example of Jacob and Esau who in the Bible Jacob and Esau were twins and says while they were yet in the womb before either of them had done good or evil God loved Jacob and hated Esau and it's what paints this picture of God you know says what if God willing to show his wrath and make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath made for destruction so it says God created some people as vessels of mercy people that he loves and others as vessels of Wrath made for destruction so made for the express purpose of destroying them of torturing them in hell for eternity so and then so he Paul who's writing he he paints this picture God making you do all of the things that you do and then blessing some and cursing others and he says well you're going to ask me then why does God yet find fault for who's resisted as well right so God's making you do it why is he punishing you for it right if God's making do a horrible thing you resist his will you can't resist his will right and so he makes you do it and then he punishes you for it and the answer is you don't get to ask that question ah says nay but o man who art thou that replies against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus he just wanted to ask that question and to me why this is I've asked like for I spent a long time talking to Christians and you know people of mostly Christians because it's obviously it's New Testament so and but also talking to Jewish people about the Old Testament and found so many of the like interpretations so many of the our beliefs are not they're not fully supported by by the Bible and that there are so many different ways of interpreting so many of our the more destructive of our beliefs but that one I have not found any explanation for that passage that's anything that makes any kind of sense that's consistent with the text and and not evil and I just I didn't I thought I couldn't ask that question for so long when I was at the church right I thought I just had to accept this this is the truth and nothing that I feel or think matters against it um but now I I can't not think of course and not ask the questions yeah it's got to be so straight it's all so strange when you read the pastor's in the Bible and they're thou and thigh and you go WOW like what a weird like you're reading something in a style of communicating and thinking that we don't even use anymore like how strange is that like how stray like if you had a conversation with a rational person and they've they started talking and thou and thy you'd be like what do you why are you using those words like what's going on here are you okay I got you a crazy person but as long as you're quoting some ancient stuff you're allowed to do it like and it just it sort of highlights how bizarre scripture really is and how bizarre these ideological imperatives these ideological like pathways that are just completely rigid and carved in stone you have to follow them but then you're listening you're like you don't know what even talks like this anymore like this is such a strange and they didn't even talk like that then when they wrote it because you're dealing with something that was in ancient Hebrew and then it was translated to Latin as translated a Greek and by the time it gets to English like boy what a terrible game of telephone you know that the grapevine right so it's just these were questions that I never thought I could ask were that again that it didn't matter because if God or you know foreordained all of it right then it wasn't relevant but there's also I mean like there is so and this I was talking to Sam Harris about this this morning he like there's so many things in the Bible that I find so much good there also and unlike the language is something that like yeah I know it sounds so weird to people but to a lot of people but like King James like I grew up like again.i my mother was reading us to us every every night and so these words there's actually a passage it says I found that like talking to God I found thy words and I did eat them and they were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart right so it was this thing where I loved it I loved I loved these ideas I thought I thought it was the truth and I thought it was like the definition of goodness because God did it and God said it and but even now like there's this one passage that I I really love it says by longed-for bearing as a prince persuaded and a soft tone break at the bone that lasts like that's that's it's a soft tongue break at the bone that that phrase I love the imagery I love the like because you know I did this TED talk a few months ago and and you know it was kind of about this like modern political discourse this this tribalism this is becoming this you know these calcified you know positions and failures of empathy and and like people think that because you know they're so sure that they're right that their position is the right position they're willing to talk to the other side in ways that each other just it's just it's terrible it's the way that I did at the church it's the Roylott it's you know that dismissive condescending you know just a hostile aggressive right there the enemy yeah and that's like it that's also cult-like when people don't respond to it like they respond it's soul yeah complimentary behavior right it's like somebody approaches you a certain way you tend to respond in kind so if somebody comes to you in kindness and compassion you tend to respond you know in that that way also and when you are angry and aggressive and hostile like it just elicits the same reaction people get defensive right and but that that verse I love that verse that's a beautiful verse well there's obviously some wisdom from what those people were writing down and trying to translate what that wisdom was and there's some really fascinating passages to me it's always been most fascinating as a time capsule like when I read it a Michael regardless of who translated this regard this is still a thousand-year-old book that the very least in terms of you know or 2,000 years old like that alone is really amazing you're reading the thoughts and the ideas of how someone was perceiving the world 2,000 years ago or roughly you know it's there's something to it where you're it also solidifies in my mind how briefly human beings have been conscious of their time here on earth 2,000 years ago is not very long I mean it seems like an incredibly long time for personal lives to be a hundred but in terms of the the age of the the human race itself which I think they just back dated again they found a new discovery where they pushed back the oldest known human being by over a thousand a hundred thousand years yesterday some new discovery some new bones mm-hmm so now they know modern human beings have been around for at least three hundred thousand years it's probably gonna go back even further than that they don't even know but um but that's so cool like I was gonna say I could actually think Robert knows oldest Homo Sapien species discovered in Morocco yeah was a sigh time okay yeah add a hundred thousand years to the history of modern human fossils these bones are from early anatomically modern humans our own species Homo sapiens with a mixture of modern and primitive traits an international team of anthropologists paleontologists and evolutionary scientists report a pair of papers published in Wednesday in the journal medicine journal Nature evolutionary what was was evolution talk like back at home um we didn't believe it - how old what about dinosaurs yeah young Earth Creationism one of the elders said something like God brought baby dinos on the ark really yeah I I didn't make it yeah they drown I don't know we don't we just it is not a we just anytime there was any conflict or apparent conflict between the Bible and evidence you know physical evidence yeah we just played the Bible like because it works yeah the Bible mm-hmm Wow um but what you're saying about like ancient was in like yeah there was this so my husband um he got super into paleo a few years ago and he read John Durant's book the paleo manifesto and he made me read one chapter of it it was called Moses the microbiologist and Rob wolf I was since I'm Rob wolf mentioned it on your podcast or whatever that was a few weeks ago or whatever um it's so fascinating to like when you read Leviticus like without the context uh you know the time and the time they were living in um like it a lot of it just seemed like I'm whenever we read be reading this at home you know as a family like there's just so much of it this seemed like incredibly tedious and like what are we supposed to be getting out of this like I don't even running so I read this chapter and it was so like incredible talking about like Jewish the the the rules about washing your hands which is like of course the the simplest and most effective form of you know hygiene and prevent you know preventing pathogens and and infectious disease anyway it's like super fascinating like how how many of those laws make sense like what you were allowed to eat and what you weren't allowed to eat because more because of not eating pigs there's all sorts of parasites that carry right and then not eating like cats because cats eat like rodents also carry anyway but it's like it's super there's so much detail in there and it was it's incredibly fascinating so like there's when you think about like just the history of humanity and how this book has shaped people's lives for so long it's it's it's really uh it's really it's really fascinating well it is an amazing piece of historical literature you know I mean it's amazing that so many people have not to use the term but use it as gospel I mean it's the right term right and Pat it's just I always feel strange whenever I read it whenever I read it I feel strangely thinking about all the momentum and all the history that has been all altered by these words and by the application of these words and your own history when your own life was essentially guided by the application of the interpretation of these words that were thousands of years old I mean that is bizarre but then what's even more bizarre to me is that Twitter's what snaps you out of it is that interacting with people through online was this open forum exchange of ideas and especially in Twitter where it's this 140 character limit yeah that's it it really bugs me that Twitter gets such a bad rap yeah saved your life you should have a t-shirt this is Twitter saved my life I think I might actually do that actually I went to Twitter actually a year ago I'm going next week to um I didn't drain their trust and Safety Council oh really yeah that's always sounds so Orwellian today and I found out some of the people that are on it and they're they're full of shit there's a lot of BS social justice warrior nonsense going on in that I'm Nigel I'm definitely not on the censorship or you know trying to like stop people like shadow banning people I think I so I don't I just don't know enough about all them right like it's a problem I'm but obviously like I'm definitely on the side of I want people to be able to control their experiences on Twitter of course like so I mean you should be able to like um let's definitely be able to block people music doing all that stuff that's all wrong good right that's what I mean like so you should control your experience but like trying to stop people from cuz like obviously if somebody's when it's when it's criminal when people are threatening and violence and threats of violence and I think that of course should be illegal it's illegal sure shouldn't be allowed on the platform but I agree and harassment if you're harassing people or trying to get people to harass people like you soliciting harassment right others like hey let's go go after Hagen she doesn't believe in the gods word anymore let's go get her right like those kind of organ using the platform for any sort of a fucked up way like that yeah yeah but I'm obviously women much more on the side of like the importance of the marketplace of ideas Indiana so everything mm-hmm absolutely because people so many people we come to these we come to bad ideas in so many different ways sometimes we argue ourselves there sometimes influenced by other people but the way out of it isn't a pretend or to push it out of the public sphere it's to engage it to shed light on it and to publicly argue against it so that other people who might be tempted or starting to go down that path will understand in other words we need to have people who can articulate and defend good principles and to argue against bad ones so that the good ones will rise to the top absolutely I mean that's everything that's human discourse in general that's one of the main problems with really rigid ideologies there's no room for that and then you just like it's God's Word and this is it you just have to trust it and there's baby dinosaurs on the ark and just going to go okay and because of that that that like I have a friend who is Mormon and she was Mormon for a long time and then she they just sort of like drifted away they decided it was kind of silly and then they read into the church and they started like a look how did this get started and they they just decided maybe we should spend some time away and so they eventually left and one of the things she said that was really fascinating she said um I'm really susceptible to like like someone who's a bullshit artist so like she's like I'm easily influenced like too much so she's like growing up in this fundamental environment this fundamentalist you know where you don't question anything and just go along with the word she goes it leaves me really vulnerable to like being influenced and I was like wow that is fascinating she's like I'm really gullible like wow yeah it's like hurt her structure of how she her questioning muscles were like wobbly and weak and atrophy they just didn't have any pep to them that's exactly the word I used also about the decision-making because if somebody else was always making the decisions you never have to like the answer is already there free you don't have to figure it out for yourself so on both of those fronts like when after my sister and I left it was this sort of like more or less constant you know processing and asking these questions so like I would have these so for instance like back to gay people after we left right so I got it this guy wrote an open letter like he'd been somebody that I had sparred with on Twitter quite a bit and threatened to pick it but never actually did he wrote an open letter after my sister and I published this statement essentially just this short explanation that you know we had left and that we regretted hurting people and that we were trying to find a better way to live basically just because we'd been so public at the church wage it seemed like we had to it seemed like and also that's complicated but anyway so we did this he writes his open letter in response and invited us to church over it um Hollywood United Methodist Church ah uh and he this he was gay he is gay um he's a gay churchgoer yes yeah and has he recognized reconcile all the anti-gay stuff I was going to say so you you said um you know earlier they get you just the accepting like whatever you find in the Bible see therefore you have to accept it and just go along with it no matter you know what evidence or whatever seems to contradict it or whatever I was going to say like I encountered people for the first time including um I'm actually not sure how he reconciled I think it has to do with the love of Jesus and and you know grace and you know just that's the Old Testament and whatever I'm not exactly doesn't New Testament represent it does it does I'm sexuality right yeah so I I don't really know just lalala not the thing well so that's what I was going to say like I remember encountering for the first time Christians who were willing to say like yeah I know the Bible says that but I I think that applied at a different time or I just don't believe that well I know I know more than one that has a an Old Testament Bible quote tattoo mm-hmm like hey you got to read the whole book man God I'm really into what you saying like no you're not right I'm not even listening but like that like I think that's it's it's honest right like just to be able to to say like yes I I think this is good and to but to have the wherewithal to say like yeah this this is good and this is wrong there's a Bible verse actually that says hate the evil and love the good hmm and I love that I mean and I don't wanna say hate like I'm talking about I'm not never it's never about for me is about people it's about ideas like I think there are a lot of bad ideas and so I try to well anyways there are a lot of bad ideas and there's a lot of people that get defined by bad ideas and I think in that in that way the Bible is a lot like people in that you can take a really good person who does something stupid does something wrong doesn't do bad and it doesn't mean they're a bad part you can't say like you are this time you ran this red light and hit that car or you are this time or you whatever it whatever you did that you shouldn't have done the meet who have done impulsively or what for whatever reason that doesn't necessarily define you it's a moment in your life but we love to find moments like that and say that's you Tiger Woods that is you you are bad I don't like you now I hate you like no matter what you do in the future you will be defined by this moment that you got drunk and drove a car or whatever the fuck it is it's it's so frustrating and you know now like if we the tendency now on did you read Jon Ronson's book yes you did I hear it yeah the so you've been publicly shamed yes like that that tendency that we love it too well and my family like this this it's it's it was incredibly judgmental like even within the church and became even more so towards the end of you know before my sister and I left we're like everything we this is the way that my sister and I started talking about it after we left was like it's like everything that looks bad is bad and everything that looks good is also bad like it wants you if you can if you identify a person as some kind of troublemaker or you know you can just read into the worst intentions and motives when it's it's just as likely that it's it isn't that like to generalize the worst oh sorry it's getting under your jaw and so some of the sounds I'm sorry that's okay I kind of talked a little bit soft to sometimes um but you just don't want to generalize the worst about people and and make it make that their entire identity right and there's a tendency to do that with people that are also there they're terrified of scrutiny coming their way so what they do is they cast it all out on others instead of looking internally instead of looking at their own actions and ability like to find a Fault in a person and then that is their main phone because and you see people doing that is why tabloid journalism is so fascinating go to the supermarket and you know you know Matt Lauer's doing cocaine oh look at that you know it's like right there in front of you whether or not it's real who knows but it's like oh I want to see how he got caught what did he do wrong when this person do is doing drugs or whatever whatever anybody's doing she's leaving him for her oh she's a lesbian and there's all this stuff that we love when someone is someone did something bad then everybody's watching it we love it because we all know that there's some creepy shit that we've done that if somebody found it and then everybody started talking about you'd be horrified so when you see someone getting caught publicly shamed and then this giant pile on it's very attractive to us in some weird way and almost cathartic and almost a relief that it's not us you know but it's so dangerous right because it is when when you make it when the penalty for speaking up and possibly miss stepping and he's very sly and I don't it the whole idea of like microaggressions like I like fundamentally like it's this like and I understand like I'm not saying like I think it's really important like I haven't said this so many times like how we talk to people like it matters how you talk to people but if we're always looking for for a fence we're going to find it right and so but so the problem is like when you know people say something maybe not quite in exactly the right way or they like the way that we punish people when we make a penalty so high you know for so just to go back to John's Jon Ronson's book the Justine Sacco you know she tasteless joke on Twitter to her 170 followers or whatever and then it blows up and her entire life is over yeah people don't know the story what you remember the joke uh yeah I'm going to South Africa hope I don't get AIDS just kidding I'm white yeah exactly and that turned her life inside out right and I don't mean to say like I'm not saying like I'm just saying that there has to be more to get biblical I get grace like there's yes there's this a just writer that I love actually and she says that a the language of public discourse has lost the house she put it it's public discourse has lost the language of generosity like and that I think that's really it's really terrible but like so when you make the cost of mis speaking or or of of maybe not saying things in exactly the right way like we make that cost so high what it does is it pushes out moderates and what you end up with people on both you know two ends of these extremes and now the only ones talking and then it just it just again reinforces this this you know calcification and us them and you know tribalism and and it's it's it's dangerous I think you're a hundred percent right I also think there's something that's going on where when you see someone do something really stupid like Kathy Griffin hold it up ahead of Donald Trump I think we realize that in our worst day with our worst thought process worse circumstances that could easily be us in the worst if you grew up in a fucked up way or you have some imbalance in your personal life or maybe have some chemical imbalance or you're depressed or and then you make a poor judgment call or you get reinforced by other people around you that are fools as well the next thing you know you're doing something dumb and that is that's why we like watching people balance and do handstands on top of buildings because we know that we've taken risks we know we've done something stupid you can identify those aspects of human behavior in other folks and when they're doing something particularly terrible there's a certain amount of relief that it's not you and there's a certain amount of fascination of how will this play out and it's certainly how is this person going to recover from this all that stuff is very very intoxicating to us as these tribal animals that live together and understand how valuable it is to have the love and support of your peers and then that hate is so dangerous the oestrus a ostracizing of the person from the group the alienation of them from the social community the the knowledge that they have that people are talking about them all the time in an evil way Kathy Griffin she's on American she needs not burn in hell and all this that is going to be just eating away at her and we know it and it's one of the reasons why we like to concentrate on it there's a certain amount of weird sort of voyeurism that's involved in any any sort of a public misstep that people have and then the pile on by and a lot of people are just very very unhappy with their lives and so when someone else does something screwed up that they can take away some of the focus of their own missteps and focus it on this person and and throw rocks and there's also just the sense of of I mean righteousness yeah right the self righteousness the and this is why there's a you see Sarah Silverman's new Netflix pension I haven't seen yet uh so she gets to a point and she's talking about like going out to a picket a Westborough picket and Wow and I actually had seen she talked about this on Bill Maher a few years ago to and I just remember like I I knew her as this like I didn't really know her anything specific except for her her comedy she seemed kind of just kind of loud and and a little I don't know she would say things that would always make me cringe like just very like like very blunt and you listen to her calmly while you're in the church a little like not a lot of Snicket no like they're they're really like they're constantly they call themselves they're the Watchers right so they are looking around the landscape and seeing like how the Word of God applies to all these people they have to in order to comment on what's going on I have to know what's going on so what people are saying and and the trends and and and things um so so yeah so I when I saw her on Bill Maher I expected her to be I don't know like a hostile and and whatever about the church when she started talking about them what she said what she said was I'll at least on the special the way she put it was I am them like she went out was was talking to members of my family and you know she said we have to see them as human and she was like kind to them on the picket lines like told it she said I told the duty joke or whatever you know tried and the picutre I guess one of my cousins or something like snickered you know when she when she makes this joke we have to see them as human and then maybe they'll start to see us as human and the way she put it on the on the Netflix special was I I am then like I am the product of my experiences and so are they and they are the only way you can you know change those things to add to those experiences like to introduce like David did on Twitter with me and my husband like introduce these ideas in ways that that people can actually hear them and be moved by them yeah we love to categorize people into these rigid boxes that are unchangeable and that you are this person you always be this person you are my enemy and you think this and you think that and you're a dirty liberal and you're a disgusting Republican and we have these weird ideological boxes that we love to shove people into that's a perfect example that I mean if they were little kids and they grew up in that church and they're seven years old do we really believe that they would have the wherewithal on the understanding of the the full spectrum of human behavior to say that this is wrong and that we shouldn't be protesting at this gay person's funeral and we shouldn't be holding up these signs and say God hates fags because God hates fags are not like you are you right grandpa like who would have the mind what's incredibly brave is that you deep into your 20s have this revelation and then have the courage to escape and so I want to get back to that like what was your job like what was the first job you got uh so I didn't get a job immediately I thought I had to I thought I have to be responsible like of course I'm with my sister like we had some money say just we lived at home we didn't have a lot of expenses like we used our money to travel across the country picketing but we still we still had some money that's hilarious get out there piss people off oh it was it was I thought I was the greatest like I thought like it was always exciting like are you going on this ticket trip yeah I'm going to Los Angeles all my god so it was just like a part of life yeah you guys used to pick it Scientology lit oh that's a lair yeah and we're doing it in Clearwater wants to a super boring like there was nobody out there you got a rank the pickets by like I don't know george w bush's second inauguration was like insane Oh was it and there's like Scientologists oh yeah that was like post 9/11 must yeah really rough - yeah hold up those signs especially we had a sign that said thank God for 9/11 oh god damn it and it was like we were stationed like at the intersection of these three streets and they were blocked off for the parade so like he finishes his inauguration speech and it's like huge crowd of people like hundreds of that whatever happens of people like flood down the sand and they're stuck in this in this intersection waiting to go right past us on this sidewalk and so there was like this uh they're seeing this like thank God for 9/11 and it was right after the tsunami - so my mom had a son was holding the thank God for the tsunamis or whatever and like so people are just enraged by the time they actually got to us so like we're standing like right at the edge of these barricades like so on the other side is the parade route and so like you know people are like jumping like some guy jumped on my back like I'm one another like stealing signs and like jumped on your back yeah like I'm late but I was like leaning over the barricade so he couldn't steal my sign sorry I'm not getting with him like and so like one of my cousin's actually like gave his signs to another church member and then was like standing on top of a trash can like going come on you guys like just just don't worry about them they're not worth it they're not worth it like my cousin who was you know just because it was so it got so physical like you know people and like the cops I'm saying you guys aren't worth it he was trying to yeah projection he was one of them yeah exactly oh wow yeah so damage that one got pretty yeah pretty good pretty dicey I'd get violent like the guy who jumped on your back like what did he do so he I will I'm holding my signs and I'm like like I've talked myself into this barricade so like there's nothing else he can do right so he and I was like I should also say there were cops just on the other side of the barricade just like like every five feet there was a cop I think there was said there's like maybe fourteen thousand cops in DC that exercise first nitration after 9/11 so anyway but so I mean the and the cops were mostly just standing there like I look over the guy gets off and like my brother is standing next to me who's 7 or 8 years he would have been like early 20s and um this I see the and he jumped over the barricade because the way people were coming after us and this cop like pulls out a you know club - and making us get back over the barrack jump back over on the other side like with these people who were and not really doing anything but it it what did you expect the cops to risk their lives even though you're obviously provoking people I mean you're obviously putting your self in a situation where you're saying something incredibly insulting and just devastating to all these people that lost friends or loved ones on 9/11 or in the tsunami or or have family members that are gay I mean did you guys really expect the cops are going to take the beating for you or the cops are going to get involved for sure we thought that it was like it's their job right they didn't he would never do what you did then right like what if what if someone passed some sort of a law saying listen do you guys know what you're in for we have no desire to help you there would be no police presence would you still protest well we did that and that some of the some cops did respond that way did they say there will be no police presence whatsoever yeah and some where was that I can't remember it but it had more than what was it once yeah for sure and like sometimes the cops would we'd say we're going to come to protest this you know something and and they would say you know you can come but you can't hold that sign or you can't do tell you step on the flag or whatever sometimes they tell us advance sometimes they wait till we got to step on the flag yeah like we desecrating the flag was a big we saw it as an idol and I'm you know the American flag is an idol actually my mom got arrested I had a we were in Nebraska and my little brother they were protesting a soldier's funeral and we were like far away from the church but there was a group of people on the other side of the street and they were all holding American flags all the way from from the road all the way up this you know the long entry to the to the church we were quite far away and my brother was nine years old at the time and he did what he always did which was you know put down lay the American flag on the ground and stand on top of it and hold a picket sign and within like a couple of minutes like nine cops showed up and started talking about arresting my mother for flag mutilation and contributing to the delinquency of a minor and so before they do the arrest you know again my mom and my uncle were both there and they are both lawyers and my uncle's like you know Johnson versus Texas the Supreme Court said in that case that you can even you can mutilate not only can you mutilate a flag you can even burn it and and that's perfectly lawful and one of the cops was like we're not in Texas we're in Nebraska so like this is obviously a Supreme Court case so it's and he's Supreme Court has jurisdiction all over the country so in other words I guess what I'm saying is like the the way that sometimes the they did sometimes there were really good cops who did their job more super professional and didn't let their beliefs about our religious beliefs or their what they thought about our message get in the way of them doing their job but sometimes they did sometimes they would threaten to arrest you know my parents if they brought children they would take their children away from them you know things like that but but we absolutely expected them to do their jobs like that that was and this is this recording yeah I mean I know you're not justifying it but it's from the point of view of something like me someone like me I I would say don't bring any cops there no if you if you start that kind of shit at a funeral or for a soldier and a bunch of people come by and beat your ass well then don't do that again because you're pissing people off and you're hurting their feelings and you're dealing with someone who's already emotionally scarred those cops need to be out there stopping robberies and you know breaking and entering into people's houses and carjackings and that's what they're supposed to be doing they're not supposed to be like helping out people who are intentionally provoking and emotionally disturbing people right but I mean so obviously from the triggers perspective it's like this it's these are sincerely held religious beliefs in the First Amendment like what good is the First Amendment like this obviously this stuff but it's not a First Amendment issue like the cause the that's no one in an official position is saying you cannot speak well so compare that to like the campus what's going on on these campuses right we're right so you think that the cops shouldn't be there to protect those people there they're provoking people and making them angry well it's a different sort of a scenario I think the cops should definitely be there to prevent violence on campus for several reasons one reason because I think you're dealing with very young very impressionable people who make very poor choices and feel justified because they're around a bunch of people that also have like-minded ideas a lot of peer pressure a lot of diffusion of responsibility that comes from these mass groups of people that are acting and the mob mentality that comes along with that I think it's very very important to protect them from themselves and it's a hot-button issue I think protesting at a soldier's funeral is just gross I agree with you yeah I mean I know you do yeah I know you do I mean but I'm just saying like I don't think the cops have a responsibility to save you from being gross yeah I just I don't know I mean obviously this was a Supreme Court case it became did you know that that it this there was a case where we were sued by the the church yeah I do remember that hat and how that play out it it went off first they they want a ten point nine million dollar verdict against us at the trial court and then it was reversed at the appeals court and the Supreme Court said eight to one they have it's the constitutional right for them to do this this is their religious beliefs they have a right they were especially because I mean sometimes I will say like I described to you that very first picket soldier's funeral picket that I went to like that was very close quarters you know and we were right up on top of them like if we had chosen to sing or what you know that they would have heard us but in a lot of instances we were way far far away like in that Indian stance that went to Supreme Court they were more than a thousand feet away there was like a hill that the family didn't see church members you know things like that it there was uh so I mean they have a right to do it who has a right well the church I want okay they have a right to decide right to do it to say horrible things about someone who just died or who someone who lost a son or a daughter in war yeah I think obviously I I don't I think it's terrible that they do do it that was actually one of the things you know before my sister and I left that was one of the I wasn't going to hold a sign that I didn't believe was true and I wasn't gonna go to any more funeral protests right but do you think that the police should I mean they're you they're operating on tax dollars and it's a limited amount of research that's I mean we're taxpayers right I mean sure you are but do you think the SEC resources should go down in the little wing town right I know I know I'm but do you think that really that the cops that's the an intelligent and adequate and fair use of resources to go and protect a bunch of troublemakers so it depends on what how you how do you feel about the first amendment like it's it's it's the principle of the thing rather than the applications like this is just one application like so so who's to decide whether or not it's right that's the whole idea so who what we have not entrusted our government to decide what opinions are acceptable and what aren't so they they don't they're they don't get to have like so if it seems like you're organizing this so if you're organizing this sort of antagonistic display where you know you're gonna hurt some feelings in a very dangerous time right don't you think you should hire your own security like why should the police have to be there to secure you because because this it's the law like that they are supposed to you know protect like the again what what good are so First Amendment rights right the to be able to to say it's it doesn't protect popular speech right because popular speech does need protection unpopular speech needs protection so it's just again it's there but the police are really there to enforce laws well I don't go punch somebody right but they're just assuming something is gonna go bad okay so for instance like go just back to the campus thing for a second right you have these people who have announced we're going to go protest this person we're not gonna let them speak even though they've been granted permission by the you know everybody like that they're going they should be able to speak right we're not gonna let them speak because we don't like their message so if the cops know that that's going to happen like so so what happens like I'm just trying to don't do anything about it they let them shut it down but I'm saying I I think that's wrong I think they should be able they should go and like so this is what I think the cop Chiklis veto is what it's called right I think in like that the cops can't say well obviously this is still back to like it's not if the cops say well you can't speak because you're likely to cause a riot or people to you know some some kind of disturbance like they're not allowed to do that based on like if it's just this is religious opinion and we weren't saying we want you to hurt us we're not trying to provoke you to hurt us we're trying to deliver this message that we think is the truth of God right so it wasn't there's a difference between like deliberately provoking and inciting violence like deliberately inciting violence and what we were doing which was you know trying to proclaim this message that we thought was the truth our goal wasn't violence like we didn't want violence that's why we contacted the cops right we're going to attack them and and we didn't want to be attacked we just wanted to be able to exercise our rights without fear of without fear of violence that's that the principles of our democracy right um so I see what you're saying and I think that it's it's it gets a little weird when we're talking about people giving speeches on campus and then having other people shut down those speeches because I think that the people who are protesting have as much right especially if it's in their school they have as much right to voice their concern for this message as the person does distribute that message and if the police come along and say we're going to shut down the distribution of this message most the time they do it when things are out of hand so an excellent tool for someone who's trying to silence people is to make sure that things get out of hand I mean why so that having the cops present right and and letting both sides have their voices without the ability to resort to violence so this is the whole idea like we would in these letters that would go out to the cops was that the idea of having a buffer zone like a like yes we're going we want to proclaim our message we want you to be out there to like we loved and honestly we love to encounter protesters are there because it just brought more attention to our message yes I understand that but I just think that you shouldn't obviously it's not you anymore but I just do not think that anybody especially from an offensive group like that should be able to allocate resources that are public use by police well so we we make the decision today like we didn't make the decision to right for them to like they decide like okay well is this likely going to like so they can either be proactive and set the buffer zone or be reactive like we're calling the cops because we're getting punished or whatever and because like they're going to go out no matter what it was a we when even when they would say we're not going to protect you where we would go right I mean there were obviously there were rare situations where so for instance like when Gabby Giffords was shot in Arizona we had a couple of an FBI agent actually and a guy from the local police department come and say like you shouldn't go in because there's a nine-year-old girl who had been killed yeah and the church said they were going to protest her funeral oh Jesus and so they said I don't think we can protect you like this it's too volatile to and so in that case we didn't act we actually didn't go that's kind of a chickenshit response actually I think I was gonna say like so it's hope the the thing is so I was there and during this conversation my hurt my mom was explaining that we were going to go um it actually had more to do with logistics like we couldn't get there like plane tickets and whatever like we just couldn't get there so it was like okay like that's fine like I hear you but I'm so reasonable it's so fascinating to talk to you because you're such an intelligent reasonable person it's almost impossible for me to imagine until I see like the little bit of resistance to the idea of this being a First Amendment issue and the police there then you kind of go back to the church I could see it boil up inside of you well it's just like we were talking about this a little bit ago I mean just the whole the importance of discourse in the marketplace of ideas this is one yeah like like again I just think it's so important and I think it's important you know because obviously my own personal experience makes me such a believer in well you've got a journey through free speech then most people never experience free speech that you don't even agree with anymore right yeah which is even more crazy so let's go back to your first job what was it what was the first job um I worked at a very briefly like so I should say my sister and I we were in it was a couple months before I actually got a job um we spent the first month with um a cousin of mine who had left the church a few years earlier she lived really close she had left as well yeah so you guys knew some people had made it out right but like the thing is it there's there's so many my sister calls them mine folks right so like the thing about people who leave is that they are demonized more than anybody else even more than gays or Jews or any other outsider its ex members who get the worst you hear the worst things about them because they knew the truth and they rejected it right so I was when it when I thought of leaving like the last thing on my mind that I could go to an ex-member I thought you can't trust them they're people like so it's just this whole there's intensely negative instinctive reactions to those things but obviously I overcame it and I reached out to her a few weeks before we left and she was amazing like within I hadn't talked to her in three and a half years and had said all kinds of terrible things you know about her after she left but um but she was wonderful and she said like within like 30 seconds of like when I when she understood that I was you know planning to leave I want you to come live with me and oh it was it was amazing and so kind and so I've lived there for about a month my sister was still in school so she was we were traveling back to can the Topeka sorry it's like so it's a half an hour from my cousin's house you know four days a week while she was still in school and so we were constantly running into our family driving by the pickets because they pick it every day in Topeka several times a day and like at the grocery store and on campus and so it was just we needed to get away so we ended up going to Deadwood South Dakota um my brother had been a fan of the TV show and and it just seemed like a nice quiet like place so how many people went with you is you your sister and your brother mmm no it's just just you and your sister my sister yeah did anybody else join you after a while I have a brother who left about a year and a half after my sister and I did and I have another brother who left about eight years before I did Wow mm-hmm so another seven there's 11 kids so seven are still at home and four of us are out do you talk to them yeah the people are out yeah what about the people that are in no they won't have anything to do with us Wow it's just like I talked to your mom no no they I what the thing is like so back to Twitter like that's how I know what they are what they're up to like us I see vote like they post photos like I'm watching my little brothers grow up on their photos on Twitter and you know see what my parents want is then it's awful I mean it's it's I'm glad I'm so glad to be living now and not you know before social media where I can actually see these things and and know what they're up to and a little bit about how they're you want to reach out I do you do yeah I mean I do on on Twitter you know this is great about Twitter sometimes like I had they blocked me on my main account blocked not all of them but a lot of them your mom block you uh she actually created she she got kicked off of Twitter at one point so she had to cram into it yeah so she didn't block me on her new account yet um but she blocked you in a roller count yeah wow that's deep yeah yeah mom blocks you on Twitter that's it's a big thing right when you look and you see that you're blocked what is that what is that lump in your throat like just what you'd imagine like I can't believe like it's so hard to think back to like I was incredibly close with my mom and I I love her and I miss her like I used to make coffee for her every morning and like we would go on walks together and was last time you spoke to her um well actually I I saw her to pick it a little over a year ago she didn't she didn't say anything to me she didn't even talk to you no she she couldn't like a baby that came from her body loved you and raised you she can't like it's there it's it's so like when I think about like when I was at the church and this is one of the hardest things to articulate I mean to that the feeling of like when somebody leaves like there is no interaction so some people would ask like well what if you saw her at such a place you know wherever that the grocery store whatever like what would you say they would ask me this while I was still at the church and it's so it's like I don't man compared to it's like it's like dividing by zero like the situation does not exist like there's nothing there the idea of trying to talk to her it is impossible right and it's so crazy that's the cult yeah exactly yeah it's that like in Jehovah's Witnesses they call it a disfellowshipping right yeah they all have it excommunication Scientology has it they all have it yeah it's one of the ways they control people the fear of alien and the herd becoming like them yeah exactly so they'll talk to gay people they'll talk to people with rainbow shirts on they'll talk to ex-soldiers they'll talk to those people they won't talk to you right that's insane but this is donate your mana an acid when I head over um one of the like great things about Twitter and and I just the Internet in general is that it's a thing we're so like they obviously like my little brothers for instance like they are you know hearing all this bad stuff about you know my sister and me anybody who leaves they'll hear bad things about us but the good thing about the Internet is that they can go on they can go to my Twitter account and see what I'm actually saying so I'm still I go through these phases where like I I I will tweet and then I get like I can't I just like the the fear of judgment I guess for my family and I just I just choose to focus on other things and not post things on Twitter but like I still follow them on this other account that I created that's not blocked right and it's just WBC accounts so like and I see like things that they say and like doctrines that I now believe are unscriptural and so like I will tweet them you know verses like that I what this contradicts you like and try to like basically doing what I was doing four of them now against them like just in this right in these instances and and so there is some engagement a little bit with my family on Twitter because especially because of any like anything that I do publicly so maybe something about this I don't know but like when my TED talk came out there was a couple of articles and like people were tweeting it a lot and and so my uncle and my aunt both were tweeting tweeting me and tweeting about me and so I was you know we're having this repartee I guess like just you know going back and forth about these these Bible verses and and debating and so all of that stuff is it's it's I hope well at some point hopefully we'll have will have some effect and in some ways it already has so like the day that I left there was a we're gonna get to that job sometime soon worried Bobby the day you left the day that I left my one of my cousin's you know came into my bedroom while I was crying and pack I was asking like just very calmly like this is my best my best friend she was a year older than me is a year old and me and she's asked me why we're leaving and I'm describing a lot of things and one of the I described specifically two signs one of them was the death penalty for fags and another one was fags can repent and she sent me a message the next morning and like I was describing verses that I thought you know contradicted those two signs and the following morning she sent me a message a text message super early in the morning just like just joining me out basically like that that I know that did Leviticus and Romans 1 like the that death penalty like there's no didn't you have no argument like so so what's your really your problem and so and then for a while after I left like those signs were like everywhere like she's holding my cousin changes her profile picture on Twitter to her holding those two signs like screaming into the camera and like one of the elders like making a snow angel with those two signs and it's like so that she's like doubling down on this right and so this goes on it's like during this time like I'm talking about it in like giving a few interviews like talking about it they're like on Twitter a little bit like reiterating the verses that contradict them and then like after more than two years like I wake up one morning and I check you know I'm checking their twitters and there was a blog post and they said about that fags can't repent sign and I was like oh my god it's like open the blog post and it's a for the first time ever they had publicly disavowed a sign and using the same Bible verses that I had been and I know that's like a very small point with you in the grand scheme of things right but that's that's reason that's critical reasoning mm-hmm but but like so this is this is bigger right so like to knowing this is like what do you do the story behind it I don't I don't it was after my my brother left so I don't really know you know it no but that nobody who's left since then I also I have to actually of my cousins have left since then also but none of them have any understanding of like of of what happened so I don't know and I'm not I'm not trying to take credit I should also say like well doesn't matter it doesn't matter like it just matters is that it's deciding just possible yeah this idea gets into their head that what they're doing it's this is not in any way the teachings of Christ right I mean like the thing is like some of it is some of it some of it is yeah but like there's the key not the God hates fags stuff well like so it's so crazy because like this is something that I didn't realize until after we left also but like we thought remember I told you about love thy neighbor like they have a sign love thy neighbor equals rebuke right because that's in Leviticus 19 that's how it describes you know love's warning your neighbor when you see them sending so they don't got you know have an affinity to repent um but the one time like so in the New Testament Jesus is talking with this guy and the guy says like how do i inherit eternal life and he says well jesus is what is what does the scripture say and he says to love God and to love your neighbor and he says you're right he says and who is my neighbor and Jesus tells the story of the Good Samaritan so it's like this ancient do you know the story um how does it go it's um so this man says this man falls among thieves and they beat him hat and they leave him happen you know half dead to beat him till he's half dead or whatever and you know steal his clothes and and leave him there and it says a priest goes and sees the man and he crosses the street and walks by on the other side and then a Levite who's also like dealing with the things of God right he got does exact same thing crosses and and goes on goes on his way doesn't help him and then the Samaritan stops and binds up his wounds and puts him on his own puts him on his own beast and takes him to an inn and gives the innkeeper money to take care of him and says anything that you spend more than this I'm going to I'll pay you back when I when I come again so he's like actually practically taking care of him so Jesus says and who do you think which of these was neighbor to the man who felt fell among thieves and he said he who has mercy on him so in other words what I'm saying is like we reduced loving our neighbor to preaching to picketing to putting words on signs and going out and publishing them that's what we thought loving our neighbor was but the one time the example that Jesus gives is not preaching like they didn't go like that the Samaritan didn't go and say like this happened to you because you're a sinner repent he went and helped them right and so like where was that on our picket signs where was that in your practice yeah like why didn't exactly exactly like why why didn't we why didn't we make that an issue for ourselves like a primary part of our theology and why didn't we encourage others to do it too anyway so again this is something that I didn't realize until after I was talking to a couple of Christian friends of mine who who pointed that out and I was like I cannot believe I missed that like all those years like what and what's crazy is like the in the story the priest and the Levite are the people who are like dealing with the things of God right so they're presumably preaching it's not enough like that's not actually that's not the fulfillment of that yeah so anyway there's like so many of these things that I just couldn't see when I was at the church because again you're you're in this it's it's kind of an echo chamber like clearly we had access to the outside world and we're having these discussions but the problem with that discussion is that in a lot of cases people just didn't understand what our theology actually was how we actually thought which is why you know David Abbott ball making this you know Jewish as like the fact that this was an ongoing conversation that he really got into the nuances of our theology and could really understand where I was coming from to be able to make the point in a way that I could understand and that's I mean I'm kind of in a position to do that with my family now anybody any of us who leaves and who understands you know ken can try to push back in a way that's a lot more effective than people who just don't understand where they're coming from so you get this job yes I got a dead one my sister and I got a dead one and we were only gonna be there for a month and and then we're gonna go back and grace was gonna go to school and I was gonna get a job and then I was in Deadwood for a couple of weeks and I was like I could I the idea of going back to Kansas and like being back in the shadow of the church and like seeing our family all the time and like seeing them and not like it's it's constantly being faced if faced with rejection were the people that we love the most and like the idea of going back to that environment like my cousin was wonderful and I love her dearly like I just couldn't go back there so like the day before we're supposed to leave Deadwood grace decided to try out for a play there and and agreed to stay with me so he changed like all of her classes to be online and anyway so we're and we're staying with jehovah's witnesses which we didn't know that when we booked it it was an urban be my first or first air B&B it's like beautiful old house in the Black Hills and um so yeah like we thought at first when they realized like what was happening like who we were we started having these conversations and then we find out they're Jehovah's Witnesses and they thought at first that we might be disfellowshipped witnesses before they realized that was we were at the church anyway so it was just like this is insane conversations about um you know doctrine and theology and interpretation and it was just so mind-blowing to see that there were other ways of understanding these texts that are consistent with the text but totally different than we understood anyway the husband Dustin is Co owns a marketing company in Deadwood so I took a job there part-time Wow so what is your process or what's the journey from leaving the church going to Deadwood and then becoming sort of a self-proclaimed atheist like how do you how do you completely remove yourself from the shackles of ideology or did you know so it's mm-hmm it's um it's definitely a I didn't want to do I don't think it's possible it's not like a switch flips you're just everything that you knew is gone you're obviously very rational yeah so it was like each each time we'd be presented with a situation that that so like gay people or Jewish people or these like Jehovah's Witnesses it was obviously I had the instinctive responses to their ideas and so but each time I would feel you know feel something it would the I would just like ask myself these questions you know what am I feeling why am I feeling it is this just instinctive what is the evidence like does what make sense like it's sort of like having two it should - to try to reconstruct like actually look at the evidence again like starting from scratch basically in a lot of ways so so each time we're presented with these situations like you know it's because obviously there's all these like so for instance gay people like that actually didn't take that long to change like because I I had met a lot of gay people like well I was at the church and and they after we left and you know we're talking to them and I'm like you know I I thought I was doing the right thing and and and I'm sorry like I didn't I didn't intend to hurt to hurt you or to say hurtful things about you like I thought I thought it was the truth and now I don't know what the truth is I don't know I don't know what I believe I don't know I don't know what I'm doing and like people I mean they responded to that I mean like they were really understanding and empathetic in a way that I never imagined people would be like given how I know if you've seen like I guess it's really hard for me still to to go back and watch some of those videos because it's so it's I know exactly where I was coming from at the time but it's so like the arrogance and the condescension and the certainty that we were right and now of course knowing like all the reasons why I don't believe those things it's very strange strange I Namek but anyway it's like the fact that people were understanding in spite of that long history of all those things that I had said and done at the church um was was was overwhelming and and and wonderful um but anyway so like being I was basically my sister and I were basically putting ourselves over and over um we were hadn't been in Deadwood for very long when I got a message from David it was on my on my birthday and I I told him that we had left and you know he he saw I'd stopped tweeting but he knew something was up cuz I'd stop tweeting several months earlier and so he invited us to come to the delicious festival which was a few weeks later it's like the end of February or something beginning of March and I had protests at the delicious festival like three years earlier and all the like negative associations and feelings about Jewish people but realizing I don't know anything about Jewish people like we've been protesting the synagogue in in Topeka like all my life but I haven't I don't really know what like other than you know just generally Jews killed Jesus and reject him as the savior so therefore they're like without hope but I didn't know really much about Jewish theology I didn't know anything about Jewish people like I'd never really spent time with them so so I wanted to go to the festival my sister and I did because we wanted to we wanted to meet Jewish people and like do this whole it's this examining process like what do we believe in why and what and and we got so much like light and sort of wisdom from other people like learning what they believed and why you know so and then David said yeah but you have to you have to speak at the festival and I was like no no this is not happening like I can't I cannot imagine facing these people that I have spent so many years like I thought I just it just seemed impossible and it terrified me to be coming face to face with people and and I hadn't even been out of the church the three months yet so it was it was really scary um but my sister was like we're going like she she knew that we needed to have this experience of love like of learning about Jewish people and if the cost was we have to talk about it fine and she don't also said later she knew I would do most of the talking so like okay fine but so we went and we we spoke there and then I thought okay that's great now we're gonna like we need to figure out like grace and I kept saying we want to do good like that that had been the motivating principle of our life was to do good and now we realize we did so much damage and and so anyway so we were trying to find a way like we didn't know what to do like how do you move forward from there and so we just we didn't know so we were kind of drifting that whole first year we we basically I think a month was the longest we spent anywhere we were you know went to visit ex members of the church you know who were across the country my dad's family who we never knew growing up because they ever part of the church so I mean like we had seen them like they would come visit for a few hours sometimes or maybe they're allowed to visit even though they're for a while but then several years before we left they cut off all contact with his family there also it had been very limited already but then so you haven't spoken to your dad either mm-hmm so you spoke to his family yeah his parents and his his brother how they feel about all this my my grandmother I called her um about a month little of our month after we left one of my first nights in Deadwood and I told her we had left and she just immediately started crying and she said I've been waiting for this for 30 years like she had my older brother had one of my older brothers had left since since my dad had joined the church is what she was saying you know she my dad's parents are so there's they're amazing people like his dad is it was career airforce he retired from the from the Air Force and they're they're wonderful people and oh we could see of them was well they're divorced and remarried they're they're going to hell they're a bad influence and like it what's it's it's insane to me now to think like my grandmother has been without her son like her son for decades and how painful that that must be like I've only been it's been four and a half years since I left and what am I going to be doing and in 30 years like how am I what is what is the and I don't know it's a crazy journey you've been on for just four and a half years it's really insane really like when did it solidify in your head that you were gonna like identify or like speak out as a non-believer this morning I don't mean like so I was I was actually talking to the same about this a few months ago like because like there's there's there's part of me that like I mean when I said when a lot of a lot of people hear jerk when they hear atheist right and I don't use that word for myself atheist I don't either and and and this because like it entails like it seems to bring in like this idea that you're so certain you're certain there's no God you mock people who are religious you don't like them in all this and I don't feel that like and I also feel like I am I'm open to evidence you know like I haven't like decided there is no God it's like I just I just don't see the evidence and so I I don't believe and if there is evidence like I want to know like I and again I talk to religious people all the time and I think about theology a lot I just I can't not like it also becomes there's a there's a group mentality involved in atheism and there's one of the reasons why I was reluctant to identify as an atheist is that so many people were asking me to identify as an atheist like would you give a shit why do you want me to come out I told you I'm not religious like but especially especially the idea that there cannot be a God like or there cannot be any sort of a higher power and that after you die it just ends how do you know right exactly and that's exactly where I am it's not a knowing for certain that there is no God it's a I just don't believe there's so little we know about human life yeah forget about the idea of possibility of afterlife or the possibility of what consciousness is there possibility of what this concept that we call a soul is what it what is that or forget about psychedelic experiences and what do they represent and what what what do they represent when they're coming from what essentially is human neural chemistry there's the most potent ones are chemicals that exist in the brain they're endogenous in the human body and what what are those experiences and how why are they so akin to religious experiences and why why do people even believe now especially these scholars in Jerusalem have connected the burning bush of Moses with the acacia bush which is a bush that's rich in psychedelic chemicals and they think that it's entirely possible that Moses had a psychedelic experience in which he came back with all the laws that human beings are supposed to be living as proclaimed by the Great Spirit of the universe or whatever the hell he encountered like who who knows who knows but this idea that people love to say you know God is dead there is no God like that's just as silly as saying there is one right and this is why like the like the whole process since we left like it wasn't uh like I mean first of all like the idea of choosing another belief system like I would like learn all this stuff about Jehovah's Witnesses know like like okay yeah that's mostly internally consistent like I think there's a lot of I I never was like tempted to join them or whatever and I should say actually they're not they're not witnesses anymore like they're not if since the other left ik a little over couple years ago oh they left too huh yeah Wow do you think that you guys leaving and having these intimate conversations with them in their home might have had something to do with that I I'm we're still really good friends with them like there's some of my best friends um I don't I don't think that was that direct of a thing it was a part of the whole journey yeah I mean I think so like we would have these long conversations and actually I was the craziest thing when I found out like that that they had left like it was it was Dustin tool or other names Laura it was her birthday and they don't jobs don't celebrate birthdays it's like I was talking on the phone and I didn't even know it was her birthday it's like I was we were talking on the phone for like over an hour and I was like telling her about this all these things that I'd been thinking about and like and then at the end of the conversation she was like she's like wow it's my birthday today and I'm celebrating it and I just like was shocked I didn't say anything for a couple seconds like I obviously like knowing what that and it was different it wasn't as like as much for them you know like it wasn't the same level of but like I know the disorientation and the loss and like all that it's complicated it's like you don't want to be like oh my gosh I'm so glad you're out of this because they I think they believe some things that are really kind of nuts but but so I was just like very cautious like like I don't know what happened but just know that I I mean I always like loved and cared about them and and you know like but I was so eager to have these comers like to understand what had happened with them and it's kind of just just following the like how much internal inconsistency like when you're saying earlier about the the whole idea about the Bible being in foul board of God and like oh that's a neat trick there's no way you can argue around that this is why like it's I think internal inconsistency like in the doctrines themselves like that's seems to be a really important way to get to to get in to get through that like like a seed of doubt yeah because that's its you have it's finding that inconsistency in these two beliefs that allows you to maybe question the bigger things the bigger principles and anyway just I think it's important to ask the questions no matter what you believe it's important to question and to always be looking and examining for new evidence because like you talk about this a lot but like confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance like these these things that keep us locked into these belief systems and impervious to change or not even impervious but like like resistant to it yeah we want to be like open and and so this is I mean I still try to do this and this is why like do you do you ever want to like grab your mom and go you gotta listen to me for an hour just let's talk I would if she I would love to talk to her if she would listen to me but she she just won't even look at you know like if you knocked on the door rang your doorbell uh that that's happened a couple times not me my sister and like they close the curtain the window and turn off the lights inside to have that happen once Wow um yeah they they they want and this is why it's possible she might hear this yeah she would listen to this I think it's I think it's possible I mean I think I think somebody at the church will listen to it for sure I mean so this is the thing like when people leave like everything that we say any of us who leave that we say undo publicly the church pays very close attention to it like when I was at the church I did the same thing and partly it's a like needing to know like what they're saying so that you can have a good explanation counter it effectively damn yeah you're scoring pork points mm-hmm and but so this is why another reason why it became evident that I couldn't hide forever like if I hiding following the rules you know pretending like none of this happened like not causing any waves for the church but like that doesn't change anything like the only thing that helps is is talking about it like and and you know because here's the other thing like even if I like privately in in letters like yours things that I sent to my parents or other church members like they're not going to I mean make the probably not going to share those with my siblings and if they do it's going to be with a whole bunch of you know words against me at the same time so like it's it's only by talking publicly can you use you know that's how they can actually see who you really are and what you really think and what you've really gone through without the filter of look at what these tours are doing right things like that like it's it's uh do you think your kids or your your brothers and sisters are gonna hear this I think some of them definitely might definitely might do you have hope that they'll eventually bolt I I do I hope that they not not because of any I hope they can hear the reasoning and see see the consequences of what they're doing for other people and that a lot of it I mean is unscriptural and so even even by their own understanding like they there there are things that contradict them I hope that they change their minds at the very least I hope that the church continues to to moderate to not be so a lot of their new signs are things like another one of the big things for me was impact or II prayer right which is this idea of this word imprecatory it's like racket ory mm-hmm so the word praying for curses for your enemies right Oh God right so we did this pray to curse against your enemies Oh often yeah wow that seems incredibly non-christian right but there's a like David King David oh yeah so use Old Testament though right it is that's true we'll see this is the thing so like you know we Suisse took that as an example for us so he prayed for his enemies for their children to be fatherless and for their wives to be widows and so he's right know praying for God to do all these you know bad things to it is that the Romans he was praying against the Romans no is it David uh Philistines okay um and Saul I guess but um but so this is an example right pray against his enemies so after we left I sent is contacted my uses my dad and talked about this problem so like David also had a lot of wives but we don't take his example as that men should have many wise and what about that and why it was because it contradicts what Jesus and the Apostle Paul said about marriage right one man one woman for life right so he's a new way right so and Jesus and Paul both also said they talked about loving your enemies bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you so you're supposed to be praying for the good of your enemies right and so it's a contradiction right and so anyway it's another like a long time like there's been like a bunch of sermons like so now my grandfather passed away three years ago and so now there's eight elders and there are the eight pastors and my dad is one of them so there's been a series of sermons on imprecatory prayer since then and they're like it seems like it seems so confused because like on the one hand they're still kind of justifying it but also it just seems like you're trying to reconcile things that aren't reconcilable right so so but a lot of the then so they stopped I should say there used to be a flyer that went out every like Friday and that used to say like thank God for 15 dead soldiers we pray for 15,000 more and so it would list all the soldiers who had died that that week and with enough like after like eight months you know my dad gave a sermon about imprecatory prayer like at the time when I first you know said that you know there was he put out of video news explaining like why imprecatory prayer is the thing and it's supported by the Bible eight months past he gives a sermon about loving your enemies within a couple weeks that flyer was changed and now it doesn't say that we pray for 15,000 more I haven't seen that what's the first part is the first part still thank God so they say because God is sovereign you have to thank him for everything so the fact that these are still thank God for 15 Dead Souls yeah so the second part what I'm just trying to say is like there there has been some moderation mm-hmm and a lot of the new signs are things like be reconciled to God and Christ our hope things like that like that are not God hates fags like those are I think that's I think that's improvement at the very least even though there are obviously these these harsh things as well so there's some adjustment and some consideration um so you don't talk to your dad anymore either right no one no um is that Wow is there anything that you think that you can do other than continuing to speak and continuing to to do what you're doing that's going to reach them so I mean I I'm almost finished writing a book I'm nearing that is it a book to them it's it is both for them and also for for other people there's part of this it's kind of what I was getting at yeah it's like you're writing a book like letters to my mom and dad so it's not it's not it's not written quite that way not as I actually did consider doing it that way but eventually ended up like right now it's based on each chapters based on a relationship that sort of brings us like the starts with my mother and then my grandfather and sort of like coming into this ideology and then the process of all the like the mental machination zuv leaving and like how my mind changed over time and then what's happened since we left like and I hope that by you know for my family I hope that by articulating these things in in a way it's like obviously we're sitting here in even if we talked for like however many hours like there's only so much that it's not the same as having it written in a way that's hopefully very clear and and and and just honest to the experience like in as much detail and and clarity with as much detail and cleared as possible like I think that that's I hope that that will will be effective and at least showing them that there's a different way there are other ways of of understanding these things and so I do hope that um I guess I also hope like in my TED talk I I have I have I feel really like hesitant about like trying to teach anybody anything at this point you know what I mean like because I spent my whole life telling other people how to live and now to be like well you guys know I got this like now I got this like you know like it's just the idea of like insinuating even in any way that I have something to tell people about anything like I I'm I really don't like that idea at all and the only reason I did the Jon Ronson actually is the one who reached out to me about about doing X he it was a thing that he was curating an event that he was curating curating and and so I wrote the first draft of the talk and and the curators you know came back after it was like well it's like this is how can we avoid the mistakes that you made and so like I went back and like took examples from David and my husband the way that people on Twitter engaged me that actually helped helps change things but so so it's not explicit in that way in the book but I hope that just by talking about this and telling the stories like I when I read accounts of people who have gone through similar situations it it's so helpful to me like to realize like my family like yes they man up their their activities are kind of their extreme and like they manifest themselves in very strange ways to most people but they're very common very human flaws and if if anything that if I talk about this in a way that helps other people see it in their own lives or that you know will resonate with people who have gone through similar things like that's I think that's I want to do that I want to do as much good with these experiences as I can because just because I that's how my parents raised me honestly right but their argument of course would be you know you were so right and so convinced when you were with the church now you're so right and so convinced now that you're outside the church how do you know you're right now so the latter it's not the same it's not the same at all like I'm not I do not walk through the world with the sense of with that sense of certainty and and in my position and righteousness of my position I am asking questions and I'm I'm trying to explain what why I believe differently now than I did I'm still asking the questions that like I never stopped like you know what I mean it's it's such a fundamentally different way of of engaging the world I do know what you mean but if I was on their side and I was trying to pick holes in your statement which is what they seemed to do right if they're listening to the things you say they're listening to things you say so they can counter them with some sort of a Bible quote or some sort of a more articulate opinion right if I was listening I would say you were so convinced when you with us now you're so convinced but now you don't even have God yes how could you be right so the thing is you're deluded the Satan's serpent scales are covering your eyes so this actually thought yeah this is another another one of the paradoxes that I realized before I left so there's this verse and again this is one that my mom Mike would quote all the time growing up and with such urgency like she needed us to understand this and and the verses the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and who can know it right so so I thought the heart was good home is what the heart is no I thought I thought heart is like people being sweet and so the human heart is inherently and according to the church is inherently deceitful right oh okay but the problem is they also talk about the heart as being like that's how we know that the Bible is true has forgotten God puts an unction on our hearts it deceives a little heart yes exactly so you're at the end of the day it's always our own hearts like it's our hearts that say okay well I'm going to follow the Bible no matter no matter what or in other words at the end of the day each one of us is always making a decision it's just that for them they they think that outsourcing it and saying that oh no it's the Bible it's like well you're the it's your I tried to articulate son son when I did Sam's same harris-stowe a couple years ago like but it's that I read it actually in his book like that's what helps me like it's it's your own moral impulses that are authenticating the truth of the Bible right so at the end of the day it's still you it's still your judgment your the judgment of your own deceitful heart so again from their perspective so I guess what I'm saying now it's like I'm not when I when I talk to my family when I'm addressing them like it's it's with these questions like I know how you understand these verses but what about these things that contradict them right I'm not saying you're wrong I'm saying I can't see how you're right because of these verses like how do you do this right you understand this and what about verses that contradict other verses in the Bible that's the church doesn't believe in that that is that those contradictions exist so when you talk about those contradictions which are pretty clear what what do they say well so the Lord works in mysterious ways tonight kids right there's there's always that like if you think there's for instance like back to the like free will be there sorry the predestination thing that God designing people to go to hell and then holding them responsible right so there's this this is a contradiction right this the idea that you are responsible right your man's responsibility and God's sovereignty they don't go together right such an awesome quote can you say that quote again man's sorry there was man's responsibility and God's sovereignty they do not go together right but the quote in the Bible I like it the way it's phrased um which the neighbor no man who art thou that repliest against God yeah okay yeah uh shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus yeah so yeah so it's that those ideas are inherently they're inconsistent right there are they're contradictions and so Gramps I remember one day in church she did she call grant grant yeah sounds like such a cute name is grace such a evil dude no I'm sure he's not he could be so she is your grandpa honey and and like it's so funny clicking he can be funny Oh hilarious really yeah was he a sweet guy just like very sweet he would sing the song from the 40's and call us my great big beautiful doll like that's a huge key Melisande Love Bug and so you miss him yeah we sat you you didn't get to see him before he died cuz you left I can't talk about that you can't I can't not less for me to start crying I won't oh sorry that's okay um but but yeah he's fun the legal reason oh no he is that that's just that deep after all the stuff you talked about yeah like you can't talk to your dad you can't talk to your mom but something about your grandpa yeah he's special yeah I'll tell you later okay okay but in the eyes of most people he was the booming voice yeah of hate for sure and I totally understand it it's not so fascinating though that you could see someone in an intimate way you love them they're family you get to see all the positive aspects of them and yet you get to see this venom that he spews out to all the world and then that also represents you guys and your family and your ideology and you're behind this powerful leader he's the founder of all this right so essentially he's the man who created the the very bars that imprison your family right now I know and it's it's so and this is one of the things you know after after I left like thinking about like how did we get here you know how do we end up in this place it's an understanding of psychology or a lack of the problem with any sort of ideology rigid ideologies that are backed up by a deity is that there can be no questioning and as soon as there can be no questioning you're talking about human language you're talking about something that came obviously from the words of human beings they wrote those words down they put them somewhere and now you're reinforcing this ideology anyone with even a basic understanding of how easily influenced people are and about our alpha male chimpanzee history or lower primate history we know that we're incredibly susceptible to influence and incredibly susceptible to the whims of the group mindset and that this is imperative for survival these tribal instincts that we have imperative for survival the reason why we made it to 2017 and that these play against us in the informs of ideology and these very rigidly reinforced behavior patterns I mean that is what that's what and when the problem because a theism versus the people who were deists or people who are Christian or Muslim or whatever the fuck it is it has nothing to do with that honestly it's just about mind and about humans and about our inherent tendency to give in to these these predetermined patterns of behavior to give us comfort in these patterns that yeah there is so much comfort in certainty yeah yeah I mean it's it could be really frustrating all these sometimes all the rules and that like I said very rigid but but well after when I left the uncertainty was just this enormous weight like I had no idea like what enormous weight on you yeah all of a sudden yeah cuz like again well one first of all like one of the things that makes doing things like this hard or like speaking publicly at all now that it's not like me like with God on my side or whatever is the idea like now I'm standing on my own two feet like it's it's my own ideas in like who the hell am I you know just that the sense of like self doubt and uncertainty and and like it's it's just it's it's it can be crippling sometimes but but you just you have to keep going and keep asking the question like this is one of the things like you said I mean the whole another reason I don't like to call myself an atheist or or to call myself anything actually Sam sorry I cannot stop talking about Sam Harris but he had this uh this video what he was saying we shouldn't call ourselves atheists or secularists or humanists we can acknowledge those anything we should just be good decent people living in the world and and challenging bad ideas wherever we find them like that's it's not about the I mean we want an identity like sure crave identity and and belonging in this like the beat in group like what you're talking about grams like how how much goodness I got to see in him didn't like people in the outside never saw it's because of that you know the in-group out-group mentality like the the bond like i said earlier that bonds that are forged they're it's so it's so enticing but but it comes at a huge cost and I didn't see that cost for a long time so now this is another reason I don't I just don't like those labels it's not about the identity it's just about trying to find the best way we can to live in the world and do as much good as we can I think they're bumps in the road and the evolution of culture I think that's what they are I just think we haven't figured out how dangerous they are and that we fall prey to them but they're also the reason why we got here in the first place because we did figure out these ways to bond together we did figure out these ways to identify with each other in this very extreme a very personal way and if it wasn't for those things who knows if we would have ever made it this far who knows but they've also they've also been able to people have been able to rationalize horrific acts through the use of this us versus them you know the our group versus the other it's a very strange aspect of what I believe is the adolescent nature of human social and cultural evolution which is where we're at right now we've come so far we think but really we haven't we haven't really been around that long I mean they're talking about this and this modern human being they found three hundred thousand years ago god that's a blip blip so it's a blink of an eye in terms of the history of the world never mind the history of the universe and I think that it's it's very dangerous when someone tells you they know it's very dangerous because you don't know and see like well if they know I'll just listen to them and that's what we've been doing forever it's and I think people are recognizing more and more now that that is that's not safe it's dangerous and it's an impediment to progress personal progress progress as a community we have just as insane instinct to join teams to the point where people they identify with certain patches of dirt I'm a taxon like oh you're a Texan so this is all ok you know hey I'm from New York oh you from New York all that well I get you now great I understand you you're in this nice little category you get to operate on these predetermined patterns now you know you've you don't even have to have your own beliefs you just adopt a conglomeration of beliefs that fit whatever category you fall into with your left-wing progressive or right-wing conservative so it's weird we're really weird we're really weird monkey this is where we're so strange and we're also aware how weird we are that's why I was going to say like that is the that's where I feel so much and why I feel so much hope right because like the more awareness we have like that the better we can go about trying to sort of shore those things up yeah like see the pitfalls and then try to find ways around them but it takes people like you that incredibly courageous that break out of that pattern and and and and just paddle out into the what the waters of discomfort because that's what people have a really hard time doing people have a really hard time changing they have a really hard time taking chances they were really hard time doing new things and you did all of it at once and one big burst and you separated from your tribe it was like so important to you these separated from your tribe that's so hard yeah yeah for sure but it it's this is one of those things where like I mean I was talking to David after I left before the delicious festival we were sitting in the home of this rabbi that I had protested the earlier and and your rabbi as a whore was the sign my sister held and like oh I like living with this robot right actually that's why I'm staying with here one here you stay with a rabbi ya rabbi his wife in there therefore come oh how is the rabbi a whore that you they you pay them and they make you feel good like they tell you what you want to hear because you know that makes them a whore yeah that case is a comedian a whore - I must be a whore Yeah right probably yeah they're coming or against us whoredom that's prostitution but David all people give massages whores I wouldn't go there what they're making you feel good you pay them well it's lying to you it's like oh okay and so chiropractors would be whores is that how it would work I guess um but uh David was like um it's like you are your parents children like I'm just like sitting there bawling and and because I I felt like such a betrayer this is like and right after we left and and he said I said what do you mean he said well they're the ones who taught you to stand up for what you believe in no matter what it cost you and so I I know I love that idea like that there's still so much from home that I have held on to and that still guides me it's just that I obviously had to it's just the things that I now think are destructive and hurtful and just not true not not consistent with reality but that that gave me a lot of like a lot of hope Brian well you you definitely seek comfort and ancient wisdom and quotes who me yeah yeah well it's hard like here's the thing like it's so I remember I was there's a New Yorker article that came out at the end of 2015 and so I was doing interviews with the writer Adrienne Chen who's amazing and he's an amazing writer just just generally not that just that article but like and so we're having these conversations like like we I think we spent three days together in Kansas talking likes maybe six hours at a time and then on the phone like three and four our conversations regularly like it was so much like trying to really get across all of these all of this time to really understand exactly how my mind changed in all the details margin whatever like and at one point like I know we're talking and and he asked me a question it was about the soldiers funeral I think and I just immediately started like quoting all these verses and like it's like whoa you just went into this mode I can tell this is just like this like switching into this like food like it like it had been at the church like it's just not possible like even though I think that I don't believe the Bible is the infallible Word of God but like I spent so much time like reading it and learning it and and memorizing you know chapters at a time with my family and all this stuff so it's like it's right there it's always like and there like I said there is so much good in it so it's like I I don't know it's just I know what you're saying is that that it's comforting when you said it's uh it sounds so foreign to hear the King James were like to me it was just sorry it's comforting yeah yeah yeah and it's familiar and it's and it's it's a part it's a part of my home and my upbringing that I that I can keep as a person outside of it looking at it when someone starts spouting out biblical phrases and terms and and using these parables and using these stories and passages in the Bible to justify things and then equating like certain aspects of modern thinking behavior to those things to me it's almost like I'm looking at mathematics that I don't totally understand it's like I see what you're doing you put you're plugging this equation in to achieve a desired result and this result is a peace of mind peace of mind is what you're looking to attain and you're looking to attain justification for your lifestyle and actions and you can do so with this quote which is essentially like you're plugging in some sort of theoretical physics I mean it's a weird stretch of what I'm saying what I'm saying is just like the feeling of it the feeling of it is like oh I don't like this well then you use this oh and then is that okay and makes this so it's all these little tools in order to operate the mind on a more harmonious frequency for your own personal satisfaction and your feeling of happiness and peace like you can feel comfort in the fact that you have quoted the Bible verses that explain your behavior correctly you've made the noises continue the right order yeah and whether or not those noises make sense at all and then when in doubt you throw in like some weird principle like that God has a plan for everything so fuck your doubts look now you just stick that right in there though okay good right that's like dark matter you know where's all the massive dark matter okay okay you know I'm saying no it's like it's an odd sort of a thing because that it's the desire sources the uncertainty and the lack of knowledge like you don't understand something I don't understand it's okay I don't have to understand it because somebody else understands it also you're using tools it's also like you're using these these phrases and these tools and these passages to achieve desired results internally as well as externally you're using them to comfort yourself but you're also using them to prove your point against these others and that's a big part of what's going on with this whole tribalism cult-like behavior it's justifying your own patterns of thinking by demonizing and marginalizing other patterns of thinking yes okay so this is something that I I missed this for a long time - but like so my grandfather like I think I said earlier maybe that Christians were some of the biggest targets of the church but so much time like the minor differences yes exactly but I mean even like major differences like the hatred of God and you know like and you know people going to hell for eternity and and and why and all these things like like we we spent so much time Gramps would instead of saying we are the only ones who have it right Westboro Baptist Church is the only true church in the entire world and I'm 100% certain of that it was a different strategy it was attacking every other version of Christianity every other understanding of of the Bible and so and it's like by default it's like well you know exactly why all these people are wrong Methodists and Catholics and whatever like and you can articulate chapter and verse why they're all wrong and therefore the end like it becomes clear like we are right and we are the only ones who are right and everybody else is so it's just this it's it's so frustrating yeah so frustrating it's well I hate to use the word but it just it lacks enlightenment because it's dealing with conflict and it's dealing with finger-pointing it's dealing with insults like just the term fags God hates fags just using that like that in itself it's just like a giant red flag showing the errors of your thinking in order to even sit down and draw this poster like T like this is this is not God's approach if there is a God of the Bible I mean if there is a God that's in charge of this whole thing and he's filled with love and he has a plan for us all mm-hmm do you ever super emotionally talking about this stuff - yeah I yeah yeah see you're all worked up sorry no no don't apologize it's important look I mean it's amazing how well you keep it together without contact with your mom and your dad and your brothers and sisters and it's been four years how long for a half yeah yeah um well I totally lost my train of thought there what so true you said something well I was talking about just that the the insults and that's in fact yeah it's like the way like I always you know we would say people don't it's not the method that's the problem it's the message it doesn't matter how we say the message people are still going to hate it like if you see if you say you know God created most people to go to hell and we're we're among the only ones going to heaven and sorry suckers you know like people hate that message right people hate the idea that you have to like follow this set of rules you can't just live the way you want to live you have to obey these ideas as we understand them like people don't like that message they don't want you telling them what to do so that's we would always make that argument and then of course you know after when I was thinking about leaving it was like of course it matters how you talk to people of course it does and even the Bible talks about it so like you know in the New Testament Paul talks about you know to the Jews I became as a Jew into the Greeks as a Greek and you know to the week I became as weak like if the idea is like you understand your audience and who you're talking to and you're actually trying to reach them you're not just self righteously you know proclaiming this thing and saying get on board or you're doomed like it's it's there's there was no we had and we sometimes could have those arguments one-on-one but like you know when we go out to these protests were saying these things and it's so provocative and inflammatory and we knew it and we just did it anyway because we thought it was justified as long as it was true and it didn't matter how we said it or when we said it or to whom we said it was a grieving widow or a you know a child whose father had just died or parents whose children had just died it's just it's it's insane to me now I can't I have a hard time like so so much of my his love my past like I know why I believed what I believed but sometimes that when I see these these contradictions I think what was I thinking when we were reading these verses and I don't I can't think of what they could be thinking now except that it's just that cognitive dissonance that is just just just going past in chugs oh yeah that sounds good but like not seeing it mean though there's another verse that talks about him a deceived heart has turned to Messiah he can't even say is there not a lie in my right hand like that's that's the feeling that I have sorry back to the you know quoting hol is it great great yeah but anyway it's just this is why I think we I think you're uniquely qualified to sort of translate those like I that's then that's the thing like I that's that's why I keep I mean I want to keep asking the questions it's not just about you know I think my family feels they feel attacked I'm sure when I talk about this and why I don't believe it and you know when I send these messages on Twitter and I remember what that felt like you know hearing people at people that I had loved speak against these doctrines and values that I held so so dear but I it's not because I'm trying to hurt them or or embarrass them or humiliate them it's because I I want to help them see right and if I'm wrong about something then like I want to know that too so it's just it's always this like openness to to change into into I don't know finding a better way one of the things you did that's incredibly brave is not just leave but when you change your thinking and change you have to admit that you'd fucked up big time you have to admit that your entire life has been essentially about propagating a lie there was a I honestly that you know weird al' yankovic yeah that is a song and I remember listening to as a kid which sorry it was everything you know is wrong up up is down black is white and short is long I remember like in this process of like you know before we left like remembering that and being like I can have a just out of a weird al' song but yeah that's totally what it just just coming to terms with like how how how wrong and how could this have been for my entire life and how can I possibly face this like in my own mind let alone to all of these people I I did it in front of the into like in front of the whole world you know anybody who'd seen like all the documentaries all the times that I had so publicly defended all these ideas and now realizing like how can I possibly face them right and if you were ever running for office that's the first thing Megan Phelps in 2003 and the horrible thing she was saying that's what they do right yeah yeah well I think your your ability to say that you you don't agree with what you used to do and you are a different person now it's so important for people to hear it's one of the most important things I think you're saying because people feel so imprisoned by their past it's a huge problem with human beings that you we repeat sort of the same patterns of behavior because even if they're wrong there's comfort and there's comfort and going back to those cigarettes yeah there's comfort in binge eating again it's comfort in gambling this guy know this I know this crazy rush of trying to find crack I'm going for it I mean there's a lot of weirdness in human behavior patterns and what you've done is not just have real intellectual courage to just actually challenge your own personal thought processes and ideas and look deep into these scriptures that you've been following your whole life and find these contradictions and explore these contradiction contradictions and try to debate them but also just to just come out and say like I was making just big mistakes I think it's really hard to say I mean a lot of things but but two things just for people in general like I messed up yeah and I don't know yeah and like we have to be able to I mean I think to be able to they're so and honestly like this is another thing like there's so much freedom in that in both of those ideas like I said earlier like certainty there's so much comfort in certainty like you don't have to wonder you don't have to doubt you don't have to question you can just go on your way and know that what you're doing is general right I'm sure like there's so much comfort there but but in my experience it's a false certainty it's a false comfort because you're you're you're going along if you're not if you're not examining if you're not like taking in new evidence if you're not like saying I don't know it's like I don't have to have all the answers wrong I can just say like I'm doing my best this is where I'm at now like I'm sure I'm going to like find something I'm trying to find something else that I'm that I've got wrong now going to keep trying to get I'm going to keep trying to get better like you don't want to become this static you know you want to be able to to grow and learn and understand and do better in as many ways as you can you're wrestling constantly with a dangerous and volatile factor that's uncertainty yep and that is people try to avoid that sucker as much as they can like I don't want that right just like learning to be comfortable they're like I exist here and I exist in this uncertain space because it's honest yes I don't know I don't have to know right I can keep trying to understand and and you know so it's that's why one of the most the weakest things you can ever see in a person is a person talking about something in a way where like like you ask them a question about something and they don't really know and they try to pretend they do start to pontificate yeah well you see it instead of saying I don't know is that true instead or instead of being like open to the possibility of anything being outside of the realm of their understanding they double down they double down on their ignorance or they avoid it at all cost you see literally see like the little the ban in the machinery the ego just but put yanking on the gears frantically you can see it we all recognize it it's one of the more fascinating things to me about religion in general is that there we have this incredible desire to become a part of a group I mean everybody does we find comfort in these groups but we also can see them the gears spinning when someone does agree with something order someone does say something that resonates or so when someone says something that's contradictory we see the gear spinning we recognize that this is all some sort of a weird cognitive dance that we're doing to try to make make sense out of this temporary existence on a planet hurling through infinity it's insane yeah it's big but it's human and it's it's the human of today you know it's the human where we find ourselves existing and communicating that clearly is on some sort of path some sort of weird path of progress and of innovation and of understanding that we're in the middle of we're in the middle of this storm of understanding and it's happening like clearly in your own life and you're living it out in front of the whole world yeah note yeah maybe it's going to wrap it up we did all right 2 hours and 45 minutes please man up yeah just flew by yeah um you're a brave person and I think you it's really important what you're doing it's massive really is it super hard to do I'm sure I think and the fact that Twitter is what started all on Twitter so much I just I cannot you you're saying earlier about like oh there's only 140 characters like like Joe just Twitter but here's the thing like it's so crazy like Twitter like the fact that it's only 140 characters like nothing taught me how to be more like I'm very verbose I talk a lot but like in writing and I do the same thing in writing but like on Twitter like it taught me to like distill my ideas and become concise and like know and it stopped me from using that was one of the things one of the ways that I stopped like insulting people instinctively because like we did it so much like we would write these elaborate insults like responding to emails and stuff like nice an email you can write as much as you want but like on Twitter like so it's two things like once only hundred forty characters if I it's like throwing a you idiot like there's it just there's no space for it but also like when I did do that like there's this immediate feedback loop that you get so like you can watch the conversation derail in real time yeah and then you realize like okay no I just need to not like cuz instead of like addressing the arguments like then you're saying like you know you like you don't know me they were seen although answer and like it just it it stops anyway it stops the conversation like you want it to be about the the points or tours like I learned so much about communication from Twitter and I just loved it so much like it's just a tool like it depends on how we use it I use it a lot and I learn a lot of things on it I mean I'm constantly being sent articles and that's where I found out about the 300,000 year old human and I mean every day someone sends me something and I retweet it just it's not that we got connected yeah there you go so there you go more Twitter um your book is coming out when I don't know yet I don't know in the last draft uh and I I'm not even gonna tell you the name right now because I really want a different name okay I don't tell me yeah I'm not gonna tell you sorry what did you say Jim oh okay um if people want to see more of your stuff I know you have a TED talk that's out there right my Twitter account is just Meghan Phelps um yeah that's it well yeah there's gonna be the book but uh well when the book comes out come back on again we'll do it again alright and we'll tweet out your book and let everybody know anything I really enjoy this conversation thank you thank you very much thank thank you for being so brave too huge what you've done is huge and for a lot of people listening to thanks all right thanks everybody see you tomorrow on five [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh
