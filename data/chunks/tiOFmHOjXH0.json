videos boom it would live ladies and gentlemen Charlamagne tha God my man Andrew Schultz yes being here thank you my god I've been a fan of yours for a while you I think you're the last great radio host and you will be the last famous radios because I think radio a flying thing you're the last great one you're the you're the one who made a famous from radio who fuck out yeah in this era I mean yeah I think radio is like one of those uh one of those rare lanes where it's really not a lot of people who prosper in it yeah you know I mean like I don't think about especially in the black radio space I mean you've got the Tom joiners the Doug banks to Wendy Williams yeah you know so it's rare in that Lane but I think I think you've got people that have established good careers and ya know but has a great question when it was the last one he's the last one person to become famous from radio Bobby bones Bobby bones oh that's nice I don't know who that is I'm sure he's great even nationally syndicated radio but he's on the country stage he just want America wanna dance with the Stars oh okay yeah I'm not I don't give somebody only no Bobby B as you talk about him really yeah yeah he's got two national New York Times best-selling book season that's one of those things though it's like comedians like you know you talk about a comic that everybody loves and people like I never heard of em like amongst comics she's expected yeah Bobby host on Idol now okay yeah then we were on the same age so I would have to give it I would have to put him in that fine you and Bob you're a gracious man yeah in my opinion you're the Last Samurai guys like you I just want to snatch you up and bring you over to podcast like get the fuck out of there get out of that censored bossman world no it's interesting with podcast together the brilliant idiot you know we you know pod track right yeah sure sure like we just cracked five track The Breakfast Club he's number 20 on Padre okay so you put that online as well yeah we put it out of the park that's it cuz I feel like with radio that's what it is like people still listening to terrestrial radio black you have to go where the people are so you have the podcast you to have the YouTube following like you can't wait for people just to come to radio ever I wish you could swear though so that's the proper thing he city they release all the interviews they do on Breakfast Club and those things explode yeah you can they have all the curse exactly that's where most people globally yeah would watch and listen I mean right yeah that's what separates this radio this era of radio from other eras of radio like Howard Stern didn't have YouTube you know saying if I was third at YouTube wouldn't be no question he'd still be the motherfucking guy me even though he is the guy right but he'd still be like super super the guy in this air ride he's in that paywall which is very strange a serious paywall that's the strangest pay well yeah yeah he took the check but then you get financial independence man act why is the pre-chat let's be realistic he's already financially independent so why didn't do it he just the numbers they're thrown at him yeah that was a difference three hundred million right well I think that was just initially it I think he makes like a hundred million every year something crazy so three hundred was flat and then another 100 and then what stars I got the differs between like your kids beings creating like your great great great grandkids be history right yeah but serious stock in seriousness means like blockbuster stock yeah I remember when Netflix used to have those DVDs that you would get like front of the fucking surrett Mafia the box you have to send them back now I was so funny I was home this weekend I was in Moscow in South Carolina and like there was a Black Panther DVD from the library and my mom's house I'm like what it's like Panthers in the original Black Panthers or I was like yo she was true from back in the day okay that's an original black who got the Black Panther DVD that they checked out from the library and have not bought it back yet you didn't bring it back to the library yeah now you don't have to like what are they really gonna do why are we mad the Black Panther from the library cuz you didn't wanted it and it was there and you were at the library I'm still trying to understand why you called library what is it library I don't fucking know my name graduate god Barry it's like library yeah it's one of those words yeah you know but everyone even like George Bush when he was president would say expecially yeah exactly yeah yeah I think a lot of it have to do a reason because I still say straight street strong okay yeah screech screech bro specifically everybody knows then it's fun that's the point if you had a person say I can wrap them right it's a way to dick well it's like dialects like my grandparents were from Sicily and they would talk in dialects and even people that knew Italian would know what the fuck they're saying yeah like just like people that knew pure Italian it's some weird like Pig Latin type shit yeah you know I mean my mom Scott it's like if you listen to real Scottish people talk you don't understand what the fuck they're talking oh that with that accent so stirred the way they roll their words together thick and then they get them drunk oh it's impossible were you from Joe I was born in New Jersey and I grew up mostly in Boston but most really all over the country a lot of sovereign sensibilities like before we started the podcast he was talking about all the hunting hunting that you I didn't get in until 2012 Wow why because I was thinking about being a vegetarian I was like I I was watching these animal rights videos like he to videos and I was like I don't want to participate in this factory farming shit it just it's fucked up you watch these pigs slammed into these cages together and cows and chickens I was like this is inhumane right decided to glad I thought killing them yourself I decided one of two things either I was gonna I was gonna try hunting and either I was gonna become a vegetarian or husband gonna become a hunter and so I became a hunter I did it I killed a deer I ate it I was like this is perfect I love this make sense well you saw that it was inhumane for the animal to be dying no no I want to kill them factory farming farming not that there look every animal dies they don't live forever become angels they live in the wild when you hunt you dip your feet into the wild you go out there and you're fair chase you'll find them you track them you stay downwind you get in a good position you kill them and then you eat them right and it's a different animal again when you're eating that like I eat an elk steak I know note that it's delicious yeah I know that I was there can I see a picture I'm still trying to imagine what it is because I understand dear and I understand moose a giant deer it's that those antlers elders on like an 800 pound animal how tall is it it's huge they're big like six feet Oh taller yeah yeah elk and mushrooms moose is crazy I said the first time I saw a moose it was like that scene in Jurassic Park or Jeff Goldblum looks out the Jeep and yeah dinosaurs like you can't believe how big a moose it yeah I don't think I've seen a moose in person I'll top of an elk to double the size of an oh yeah yeah we need to go hunting man you want to go I'm being camping and hunting where it's one or the other well you could do both okay well you be drawn dude well you could camp or you could hunt rather and then stay in a nice Lodge that's the move yeah but also you know I kind of want to do like the full outdoor yeah because sometimes I watch those shows on like Nat Geo or something like that and it's they're just living off the land and they gotta like make up or make a yurt you know you make it out of snow yeah don't do that don't do that no but what if like two days like a cool you want you what you want it's like a real tent with a real sleeping bag stay warm and you're healthy and you're not worried about fucking freezing to death or anything weird like that yeah and make sure you have water filter so you could drink out of a stream if you really want to do that yeah yeah you should try letting in New York like nobody's ever done that like you can hunt rats think about all the big-ass rats in New York I'm not gonna lie you'll probably get a lot of attention from back in the day you could go 200 25th Street and like Spanish Harlem and you could buy pigeons people were like catching pigeons and they were selling them and trying to front like they were exotic pigeons bullshit I swear to God you know pigeons were brought over here for food that's what squab is what the fuck is quite squab is like a like a bougie restaurant item and it's actually young pigeons really yeah that's what that's what squab is yeah I didn't know that all pigeons all pigeons you see in the United States or all brought in from somewhere else for food and then they released and become feral they're like the wild hogs of the bird world what a young rats called better youthful food it's a good question do who uses young rats for food I don't know but there's a concept that rats documentary no this is just the dogs that hunt rats in New York oh yes I don't believe that shit what do you mean you don't believe that they're really guys sending their dogs out to go get rats oh they are for what there's so many souls yeah I guess I mean they're not gonna fix it there's no way to fix it but like Jack Russell Terriers they fuck rats up they're designed to fuck rats up but there's got to be people who live up north in New York who have the same desire to hunt they just go down south so why not go right they hunt deer New York has a lot of deer new jersey yeah Jersey always got a lot yeah I live in Jersey that's one of the reasons I love joy because I I'm from Sauk Atlanta so I'm used to seeing deer isn't possums and just yeah different types of wildlife running through the streets that's why I like living in Jersey yeah Jersey is an unusual pledgers he has more black bears per capita than any state in the United States I don't know if that's a fact but I believe you cuz I've seen it myself yeah they're everywhere you seen bears on your property not on my property but when I used to us they were my aunt in the Poconos the Bears used to come in her backyard cuz it was like a scream in the backyard and it would like coming in and just grab fish out of the screen they killed a kid one bear killed the kid a couple years ago from the college's what good college it was it the one near New Brunswick what was it Rutgers you never seen a video in Jersey at a walking bear debate I would walk on two feet through people's backyard like there it is look at it the video the bear walking around oh yeah okay that's a Bigfoot yeah that's it you know who believes in Bigfoot yeah you have a believer in the studio right now who believes in Bigfoot do you really yeah 100% but you know why I believe in Bigfoot because of shit like mooses species like a moose yeah some point in life somebody was trying to explain that to somebody like me get the fuck out of here right now when he's trying to explain it to me look at the size of that god yeah that's insane those legs work they'll fuck you up - there's the those are the rare deer species that will fucking massive death yeah they used to dealing with wolves if they think you're a threat they just run up on you and stomp you to death why don't you believe in Bigfoot well I actually did a television show where I went hunting for them no no no I did a show called Joe Rogan questions everything we spent a whole week in the Pacific Northwest talking to Bigfoot hunters yeah we camped out there me and Duncan Trussell went into Duncan scientists and interviewed all these different archaeologists all these different people that didn't believe and did believe it wasn't real animal at one point in time yes I don't think it exists now I think it existed it's just a primate in the fucking woods yeah okay you don't think it exists oh I thought you believed that it exists now I did up to a certain point but I was like in this era with all of the cameras and everything else somebody would have caught one okay yeah yeah I don't believe it existed at some point but I don't believe it exists I mean let me tell you something Charlemagne has this amazing power to manifest shit okay so I see how it could lend itself when you believe something so much it becomes real right right I could see how it manifests itself into things like Bigfoot like you believe in things I mean sasquatches well then it's not a far-fetched idea literally just a primate in the woods I'm the same when you were young and you believed that you were team wolf yeah like he believed that his ears actually changed shape no they did I was gonna turn into this werewolf at lunchtime and I was saying this for like a week straight and we was all sitting at the table and I was just sitting like it's gonna happen actually around two points all the kids at the table saw and jumped up and ran so he fucked up my concentration so if I hadn't kept that concentration going I probably would have turned full-fledged werewolf in that moment maybe levitated posture I've done that before really oh yeah I said I grew up double witness I used to leave the kingdom Oh and I would walk outside of the Kingdom Hall and I would like jump in the air and be looking down at the kingdom all and not stay up there for a while and then I would come down he's not doing bits right he really believes this shit I'm just telling you what happened in my life I don't know if you believe it you believe it if you don't you don't memories a strange thing ah you think it's one of those like you recreate the past well memories a strange thing like you you couldn't believe something and know something to be true when it didn't actually happen mmm you can absolutely do that I mean isn't what what you have people have memories in their head that never happened you have memories that people positioned in your head they proven that you can talk someone into a memory you could change someone's memory as always particular dangers for kids when you know there's a whole case where they were talking kids into saying that their teachers molested them yeah and all example like lost their careers lost their lives turned out was all hot percent made up but those kids believed it they believed when they were telling them that they were molested they believed it yeah that's got anyway what does that call when you give that information to the police what does it go when they like interrogate you interrogations call me borshu yeah they can worship yeah well there's a whole articles reading the other day about why people make false confessions why do they just get talked into believe in the day or something scared the devil you can't especially a young kid from the hood and you like 15 16 years old like yeah you went to jail for 28 if you don't tell us what we need to know you don't fucking know no better yeah that they put you under duress they put you in a room they sit you across from a position of authority in this person questions you make you start you start talking you start saying things that aren't true you've seen beyond skits great detail you gonna get 20 years and get butt-fucked foot 15 of them so the first five I mean they let you kind of settle in for the first five yeah you get nice and tight you might go in on a criminal monster when I was young I used to have a red tractor trailer it was a red plastic trailer with a farmer on top of it and like when those hard plastic trailers that farmer used to get off that trailer and fuck with me and I took it in the yard when they put kerosene on it and set it on fire and in my mind I remember hearing that farm farmer scream my mom would even tell you to start how I like to always talk about how this fucking farmer used to come off with his tractor and fucking me and she saw me set it on fire and I thought I was crazy until years later I met Tiffany Haddish and she said she had experiences where her teddy bears used to come to life and fuck with her so I'm just saying mmm I'm just saying shit happens all this really happening and I haven't heard this story happen at night when's it happen oh I don't remember a caramel I don't remember like the details of when it was at night or during the day that's one of those things they're trying to figure out with UFO abductions okay you know almost all those UFO abductions happen while people are sleeping and they think what's happened is your brain is releasing endogenous psychedelic chemicals and it's forcing you to have these hallucinations and that you really do believe you're taken aboard these UFOs and gone what if someone's watching you with a camera nothing actually happens questions people swear by it have you ever had one of those dreams where it feels as if someone's holding you down that hag hags riding you really call it a sleep paralysis but growing up in South Carolina it would say the hag was riding you okay what I saw is that you would either put us either put a straw broom at your door or you would take salt and spring salted your dog because when the Hagins did you room you got to pick up every kernel of salt so why the time he picks up every kernel thought his fucking date what does a hag hag was like these little old women that they say would come ride people in the middle of the night I think I've seen them before but it really looks like just a shadowy figure and it's the same feeling you get definitely like still your body is frozen I can't with your eyes are open yes but you feel like you're talking but nobody hear you that's what they say that's the Hagrid what do they say that is like what does scienter alysus yeah the blood is not flowing in your body looks like when you're sitting on the toilet too long and your fucking leg your legs go yeah yeah I think it's a psychological thing thank you your your brain is just not sending signals to your body but you want to move and you just don't dude I gotta move but I can't ya know that's frightening I had that before and I've had that before and I had when I woke up it was just you seen the movie signs yeah yeah so it was this creature that looked like he was from the movie science but it was purple in black and it was standing over me and I couldn't move and so I was making noises trying to get it to go away and if the Sun came up it just faded away now that I don't know if it was a dream or an actual visit from extraterrestrial it could be the thing about extraterrestrials you believe in it well you know I believe in this well you believe in everything the reality and toys that can harass you as a child there's there's no evidence but the numbers of humans I mean the numbers of planets rather that could support humans they're they're pretty well just what we've documented so far it's pretty interesting just what they know about the thousands of plans to discover there's hundreds that could possibly support human life and then there's hundreds of billions of galaxies right the idea that we're the only one not only that neil degrasse tyson to explain this to me is a mindfuck and a half that the universe is so big that not only is there another you out there that has done everything exactly as you've done to every pause mm-hmm like that pause every pause down to the second yeah an infinite number yeah yeah you're talking about is it called the infinite in an infinite universes there's this exact conversation happening yet people look exactly like that because infinity implies and the even in variations there's one when you get up right now and you have to take a piss right run out of the room or Charlemagne's there you're there I'm there there's one when you get a bag that we don't believe you that you saw Bigfoot or something you know that kind of shit yeah this the idea that when you think of infinity right we think about its being really big it's not it's impossible yeah to put in your head yeah the infinite infinite universes like the size of the universe 14 billion light-years apart infinite numbers of those not only that they think that inside every galaxy is a supermassive black hole and inside that black hole may be another universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies with hundreds of billions of black holes inside each one of those hundreds of billions of galaxies hundreds of billions of black holes that it's fractal and that it's impossible for you to even conceive yeah I think it's very so you're saying just based on the numbers there has to be something only life in this book think well the only life in the universe I'm just saying like hmm whether or not it's reached us it well yeah I don't think it's reached us and if it has reached us it's like they have to find a way to bend time right time is the biggest issue no I'm gonna tell you what the problem like we're earthlings right yeah and if you look at how diverse the earth is like there's different species of shit in the woods different races of shit in the water different species of shit in the jungle different species of shit in the sky why wouldn't the earth be I mean the universe be just as diverse yeah and we're assuming shorter we're assuming we're the smartest life form in the universe no no I'm not at all and sure it is all I'm saying is life has an end right what is the the oldest species on the earth right now where the turtles lived like 200 as I'm sure like then what so let's say it's 200-300 years right let's say that's the max now we have 300 years to travel millions of light-years away to get to another galaxy to see other planets to see if they have some shit and they have the same for us so let's say there is another species did somehow found a way to take your the consciousness that they have and put it in a robot that can then last for thousands of years then they would have the opportunity to come here but we're limited by time right you will die before you get we're like we can go to Mars we can't come back think we really I think we're basing that off our intelligence there might be a species in this universe that can fly to earth the way we fly to LA but that's what I'm saying they would happen at any time not necessarily what they could do is fold time or fold it whatever you don't even create that wormhole thing where you're going where instead of it's not linear it's whatever it's in some really time event horizon they talked about how they did that remember that movie yeah but and there's another one too at Matthew McConaughey oh yeah yeah interstellar yeah where they get into like space-time space-time is really interesting right it's like the faster you go the less you age Yeah right like so somebody's in a plane colliders into someone here on the earth right so some is flying around the earth and a plane versus us sitting on earth they will age for actually less right so if you just increase their speed and decrease ours when that or keep ours are the same they will let's say not age at all compared to us aging like 30 years even crazier Brian Cox I want to see his cosmos exhibit I mean that's the the physicist oh he's a physicist okay from CERN from the Large Hadron Collider yeah yeah yeah podcasts and shows he said that if you were born and right next to you like your mother and you both put on a watch at the moment you were born and then you checked that watch 30 years later if you have a perfect watch it was never out of time your watch would have a different time than her watch because you have gone through time differently than she has fraction I don't say that fractionally because the amount of that how fast you travel mm-hmm it you you you experience time in a different way the path you take in life the different terrain you travel over the earth all those factors play in to how much time has passed let's say you live on the top of a mountain and she lives at the bottom you're actually traveling at a faster rate right because it's no different than like let's say there's a ball on a tether right and you're just swinging it around in a circle right the ball at the end is actually going faster than your hand in the middle swinging around right so since you're going faster actually aging slower and we're talking about fractions of seconds yeah but over the course of time it proves that everyone experiences time to slightly different rate which proves Einstein's theory that if you travel very fast in the spaceship and then come back you would look at your brother who was your age and now he's a hundred years old and you know thirty so I think I figured it out how we can time travel or not time travel but I think I figured out all right now so we're trying to create ok and again I don't know shit but this is just me like you know this is brilliant idiot shit right here ok so what we have to do is go faster than the speed of light in order time travel I don't know how to do that just yet but what I think we can do is we're trying to use like rockets to propel us at a certain mile per hour to get close to the speed of light fuck the fuck the Rockets why don't we use light as wind and create a sail that harness light and that sail will naturally take us the same speed or as close as we possibly could get to the speed of light they did in a movie called sunshine I'm a fucking genius science fiction movie I'm talking to Bob Lazar tonight that was the guy I was telling you I wanted to bring you to dinner I'm going to his well if you want to go he's a guy who worked at area 51 and I didn't even know if we talked about tomorrow yeah bring it up Oh area 51 is real but this guy literally worked on what he says are alien spacecrafts spacecraft that sail on sunshine could be the next big thing bro you should work for now Jamie this is public school education get you a job at Trump space for that's it I don't want to do any other man I just want to throw the ideas out there and I think I got it in mail this is a legit space for shirt from trumps from Trump Tower Tim Dillard Bobby this yo shouts at Tim I love Tim what the real fucking space force this is the logo that's all it do you got from Target that was fucking goofy shit you had a friend who works on alien spacecraft oh I don't know podcast tomorrow and he worked at area 51 is he allowed to talk about that shit what are getting is because he's been talking about it for decades really yeah and they've tried to discredit him there's a he's very controversial a lot of people think he's full of shit but the more II there's a recent documentary by Jeremy Corbyn the more you look at the documentary he knows too many things he knows too many things that that prove that he absolutely worked at area 51 he got arrested for bringing people to a lookout peak to look over where the area where they would launch these spaceships and he's got video of these things flying through the air doing all these maneuvers that no conventional spacecraft could do in 1980 whatever the fuck was were you gonna arrest it they must have some type of like like like NDA with extraterrestrials but they don't talk about yeah I feel like the US government is just governments in general throughout the world have some type of NDA yes we'll kill you I don't know how pain is the same when Leonardo DiCaprio uses on his girlfriend he's got the greatest Indian history thinking but now holy shit no one gives a fuck about India yo so we had to pay people and they don't care they'll come out and talk about it later they had a lot Lisa Ann on the on the podcast right I just parked a horn star yeah go flagrant to right and Lisa Ann came on and she was talking about NDA's and how stupid women are for obeying them and I was like what are you talking about and she's like what do they have to lose they don't have any money exactly so she's like you have a bunch of fucking heels in your apartment you think that Leonardo DiCaprio is gonna take your heels you could break any fucking NDA but for whatever reason they get scared you pay a woman half a million dollars tell her to keep her mouth closed she breaks the NDA in an da says she has to pay you back exactly we don't know money forever what money everyone is Bill O'Reilly he had to pay a lady thirty two million dollars I mean there's no pussy worth it I need to see what she looks like can we look at this one I need to see some wild wild shit oh there's no picture of this woman I don't I need to see thirty two million dollars on blast but either love to I would love to see what she looks like 32 million he agreed to it he must have did something he didn't want nobody be even remotely here's gonna pecked they'll get Peck 100% get is it's not even about what actually happened is about what the person said they did to you that can ruin your reputation she's got pics she's got video something's going it guaranteed DNA she's got his shit under her thumb nail like guarantee that a guy like Bill has to keep a certain like I guess you know standard about himself right you have to look at him a certain way in order to listen to what do you think yes in order to take his his information you know correctly I guess seriously yeah yeah so he could lose all that equity in his audience he's out there doing wild fantasy actually didn't help them he's gone anyway is it over for Bill well he's not on fox news anymore he's podcast it was their number one guy and they were like not worth it yeah really got canceled yeah came over in a big way yeah and I think he does do some type of broadcasting now but nobody cares well he that out a book and the book was number one New York Times bestseller he doesn't box yeah it doesn't history books yes you know like I don't even think he writes him I think he just puts his name I wonder about a guy like bill doe because think about it like you started your own platform you know I'm saying and people really care about your voice do people ever really care about Bill that's the thing people do now but check it right so it's like sometimes you become a mouthpiece for a network or for an ideology they believe in and this is the difference this is how you find out if people really fuck with you the second you leave that network it's like when people leave your SPN and you never hear about them is like oh you thought you were bigger than ESPN Deportes they just want you to say strike wall that's it yeah so I think we learned that bill really didn't have all that cachet that we thought we had yeah that's why I like yes PN is a good analogy that's why you got to get people I skip bayless props yes you got to give the Mel Hill props they can go other places they'll care about what they have to say even if it's just in tweets right I don't even know what Bill O'Reilly's twitter handle is I imagine something around like bill or I'm sure it is but you know I see him he's never known for like Oh Bill O'Reilly said this on social media when the last time you heard Bill O'Reilly say so might not even be I made some news yeah he may might not even be on stuff bro yeah he's podcasting from his like apartment or something like dude is there's no background nothing really yeah it's bad he's not even wearing like suits shirt bro we gotta look him up we got to see the girl he fucked at him and see how they're living right thank you guys like that they say we'll just lay low for a couple years and then someone will scoop you up again now there's only one Fox and when Fox lets you go yeah if you're one of those guys those neocon guys like you don't really have any place else to go and he's too old to really understand the landscape of like how to navigate this new internet space you got plenty of conservative voices who don't have to be platforms right the Candace on Tommy Lauren's bitch Perot I don't look at them Wow no makeup he's wearing a nurse's outfit underneath that's on for sure guarantee that's dad or shirt for real did that shit take his wardrobes go no this is not good those are nose watch the film fold no spin news nobody lo Riley comic know we need to get some news on Twitter there are no charges you are presumed innocent in this file tree this is not what the left wants what is this about what's rant about if April night people maybe weekly report scroll down how many people were watching that how many people have him on Twitter how many how many followers do you know your father was he had in that video had 500 maybe 1000 views can you look at him right there in that video right now go down now scroll down do you think he's doing the orange thing to reflect reverse on he's bringing him an white look at that that's 100% the orange thing perhaps he looks like turmeric yeah but he don't look anything like you look some real life that's like an Instagram ho wait a minute update your picture son 500,000 views yeah definitely watching it but now he's in the vacuum but it's those crazy old white people that live in Kansas yeah but they don't happy Witter a man a win is a win yeah I'm saying if you got 580 thousand people I can watch when you put up a video and you can still get paid for it I'm cool with that's true you know say I think we put too much emphasis on like whatever mainstream it is no there's no such thing as manage people there's not just one scream anymore right Nass over that's why and shots a Brendan Schaub that's why we wanted you guys to connect because I feel like you guys represent the most I think you will are both the most influential people in media right and you represent put that kind of pressure on me pour it no because I think you guys represent and I think the illusion was before I went on before I went on ever the first time the illusion was that these things operated in separate spheres right that there are these different vacuums like the Charlemagne world right and then the rogen world and then I went on I found all these people that knew me from our podcasts they also listened to yours right so it turned out in that moment as a oh shit it's not as fractured as people think now cuz everybody's aware people always been hitting me for years like yeah you gotta go on Joe Rogan you gotta go juggling you gotta go on Joe Rogan so it's just clearly that the worlds collide it's all its interconnected especially this internet wave that were all right now the Internet wave people are craving this type of information they're craving the type of interviews you guys are doing and talking to the people you guys are talking to right and I don't know for me this is really cool just to see well they like people like the fact that everybody could do everybody show it's not like like Jimmy Kimmel never does like the Seth Meyers show but you know I mean it's like yeah everything is not that world is very disconnected yeah whereas this world the internet world is like like for the comics and podcasts like there's no competition everybody helps everybody everybody supports it oh you love everybody I mean that's one thing I've always noticed about your platform like you've always bought on up-and-coming comedians who just needed that extra push to put people to know who the fuck they are you know that's important that's why yam is paddling yesterday genuinely funny foursome is insane like you can only take a story that's that in that tragic and turn it into a sitcom she was talking she's talking about her ex-husband who shot her in the tendon in the head shot her in the titty shot in the back of the head shot edited he got her pregnant it was fucking her when she was 12 got her pregnant when she was 14 with two kids by the time she was 16 she had an abortion when she was 16 with with his third kid she called him up to try to get him to apologize to her he wouldn't apologize to her so she forgave him and she said it released like this huge weight off of her shoulder she was talking about it like you can't believe her story she's laughing about of course not yeah that whole forgiveness thing we talk about that all the time I'm not with that whole like I forgive you and it makes me feel better I'm fine not fucking with you I'm fine saying fuck this guy fuck this person like I can't forgive you when I thought uh you know the Emmanuel movie just came out you know the shooting that happened in child in South Carolina and like all of the family members forgave Dylan roof and I'm like there's one dude in there that's like fuck him you killed my mom yes yeah like that's a perfectly fine emotion you yeah you go talk to your therapist about it you allow yourself to feel like yes fuck him why do we feel like we got to forgive you know anyways comes off our shoulders thank you for her it was like she was carrying around our whole life you know I think for her it just helped her and she nude he was a piece of shit when she was talking him she said to him like you were fucking me when I was 12 years old and he literally said this to her your mind your body wasn't 12 that's what he said to her and she's just like so she decided after that like I'm not gonna invest my energy in this I'm gonna let it go yeah let it go said she just doesn't fuck with him doesn't talk with him she doesn't she doesn't carry around the hate that was a it was poisoning her yeah I get it and I understand the power forgiveness there's a reason why it exists right the reason why is you know it's still here for thousands of years this idea of hey let's forgive so that we could feel better right I think I think I think usually things get weeded out if they don't work well it's hard to forgive someone that doesn't feel bad about what they did it's one thing if you like man I fucked up I'm sorry please forgive me yeah like I get it you're a person human beings make mistakes I forgive you yeah but someone is like you were you were no you know you weren't 12 with your mind your body he's talking about fucking you when you were 12 years old I have an 11 year old daughter the idea of a grown man fucking her no we gotta go huntin finally yeah yeah you might fuck him up and then after you fuck him up you be like you know what it's all good so maybe forgiveness is like misconstrued maybe you're not actually forgiving the person and letting them offer what they did but you maybe were just removing them from your consciousness people forgive when they not gonna do shit huge punches you in the face you Mike by the way that's probably when I would get to that point of forgiveness when you want to do something to somebody so bad but when you get the opportunity you don't yeah and you realize it's that not that important to you then at that moment I might be like you know what god bless ya I wish in the back when you guys have like surpassed people in your career that were pieces of shit to you as you were coming up did did the anger that you had towards them totally leave your body no absolutely hold on to that I need you and by the way god bless you yeah but the facts it affects yeah you did fire me right no Boogedy from he does yeah yeah they told him that if he if he fired me and whatever he bought in didn't work they was gonna send him back to st. Louis yeah moved from st. Louis to do betta PD in Philly and so he fired me what he bought in didn't work right and they kept their word and they sent him copies probably best informed though yeah but everything worked out for everybody he's living a great life in st. Louis I'm living a great life life have you seen that a Jordan what is it yeah what was it was he wouldn't stop talking about journalists bro he remembered every single thing and allyce's he's Bernard Hopkins remember remember no not as a fighter he needed to be the villain he needed to be real for the motivation y'all don't use that y'all don't have people that shit in on y'all and like you know when I surpass them and not for me and what I surpass them it goes away it's weird I mean I'm not saying it goes away but I have to remind you you told me I wasn't gonna make you he'll tell you that when I was when I was starting out as a comic and I was you know it's rough in New York motherfuckers dickheads too used to carry a list of people who are pieces in my wallet all the people I was gonna say fuck you to when I passed them and as I would start to pass them I felt zero I felt your anger I almost start to feel bad yeah shit you're still in the same place that's why you were dick tamika's right I was all you had to be addictive well that's the type of person that is a dick to someone who's coming up the person who's like it's famine mentality yes you think there's not enough yes so you try to keep people away get away get away where's the people that don't have famine mentality like come on come on come on let's do it money for everybody yeah yeah everybody I don't have anger like if you like I've been five four times from radio you know what I'm saying is I'm not angry to people that fired me but the people who told me things like like it was a guy named DJ Cavs and shot the psychic liner who told me I wouldn't went out my first time I got fired he told I would never work in radio again because I was an asshole yeah and then you know Boogedy told me this is why you'll never make it in radio so those two individuals just need to be reminded people need to know that they may go would you like to know the person that cut Michael Jordan from the basketball team yeah wouldn't you like to know the person that didn't hire Oprah the newscaster back there would you like to know want to know I've had other executives in radio you know like smooth oh my god doc one is doc one has told me that one person in particular he would never hire because they fired me and couldn't give him a reason why when he asked him why it was like I just did I just I didn't didn't like what he was doing so he was like I never hired a person so that's why certain people need to be told in reminding about like a strike it's great that you know the difference is also that you get hired for these jobs and you can get fired by these assholes yes and there's always that weird power play between producers and executives it happens with television shows and networks and it happens with radio it happens it's this a power play yeah the thing about comedies it's like you know you just work at a different club there's no real the only mean there's a little weird struggle between you and the other comedians but there's no where real struggle between you and the club once you go in there you sell out you kill your friend everybody they don't give a fuck 100 percent here's your money bro they fucking care and it doesn't matter how much of a diva you are everybody knows this story in comedy Eddie Griffin you know Eddie Griffin schreiter anywhere knows the best writer in common I don't know he has a writer oh did he get a writer oh he's had it forever right no right or mean like the thing he pronounces shit wrong writer go manatees great so but apparently his rider which means like the shit that's in the green room yeah any means a brand new pair of Air Force Ones for every show a lot of people do that what yeah yeah a lot of people have like sneaker riders wait a minute yeah it fucking up cuz I haven't asked for anything but water you would think sneaker the most important thing in stand-up right there are more than just 80s yeah some guys have it where they want a fresh pair size 11s whatever they were right there so they get to the plate the number want to wear them at all until right when they get on stage that's it yeah what's in your Ryder I was like Jack Daniels wine meat um water simple sugar-free Red Bull what kind of meat you're not specific with the meat know like like meat plates like roast beef and shit like that so I don't eat garbage right now nothing nuts macadamia nuts and pistachios normal shit red M&Ms the only really saying about stand-up is the beauty of Independence though right yeah that's why that's why everybody who gives me to run to the stand of things afterwards cuz the comedy club still accepted sorry they were saying did you see that tweet I thought maybe was I would or something like that he was like oh Jay will be doing stand-up in three months dude do you watch those videos no why do you why do we love it I love it I'll tell you loot or the world there's a lot of BS out there he does videos on Twitter take that shit they instigate doesn't know he thinks Twitter is bad Thanks he's holding his reading glasses in his hand I mean he's going blind he's 71 years old you just see the the the DME sent that dude amazing with all the movies but you understand that what strategic right he sent that on monday monday was the 25th anniversary of the fucking Bronco chase so you think that he didn't just want to be in the news like that was all I was I was a strategic move I don't think he's smart I think what's going on it's he reacting to someone fucking with him and he doesn't he doesn't know how to just let shit slide so somebody makes a parody video where he's doing his Twitter hello Twitter world and then someone's got how police in the background and who DMS that person who made that video I'm gonna cut you I don't think he said I'm gonna cut yeah yeah yeah I just now a strategic man I think he knew it was the 25th anniversary of the Bronco chase and OJ's only relevant is the fact that he got away with murder so he has to remind us of that fact all the time in order for us to give a fuck did you ever see the videos he did when he was doing rap when he was dressing up like King in Miami yeah he dressed like a rapper yeah no no yet Jamie yeah we can't we can't play around off of youtube real quick that stuff was fake that Dan was a mister they actually like broke it down instantly he made in a fake account with like it was the real OJ he just made the L a capital I donkey today for no fucking reason and I'm back I'm glad I'm glad he's not that stupid donkey today the segment I doing The Breakfast Club I give somebody the credit they deserve it being stupid I'm like yeah you can't be that stupid that thirsty for attention Oh Jay so it's kind of it's kind of a relief that he's not that thirsty this is Oh Jay when he was doing rap music right no no we can't and now he is yeah we can't play the music but he had girls out there dancing around their underwear and the Oh Jay was rapping didn't you have like a crown on or something there is dressed up in like white face and all sorts of things there's naked girls in it oh god you don't think oh they been riding a wave of killing these two people for too long well crazy bitches will still fuck him bro he's insane I don't understand this this at this part of women at all like the women that like meet people in jail and then they like get married to them and oh yeah look what is this about it's about the jail dick when they come home some of those guys never get to give him that jail dick they're in jail forever and then get no conjugal visits and they still want to marry him but they're why are attracted to killers so they want killers they want killers and specifically they want killers that kill women what yeah that's a thing with some women with really fucked up women they they're attracted to men who kill women okay happen the girls want to get choked [Applause] do you think do you think all the choking and like you know how like some girls have a great fantasies do you think that's all because men have just become such pussies they want to see if they have the ability to even do it no I think some girls have this primal need to know that you can kill them no this turns them on right protect them is that Caleb yeah for sure but they want to know you could kill them not that you're going to kill them or catch someone else trying to get them that's that hand on your neck yeah Tokyu they want to be like close to the door of you doing something vile to them while you're fucking them so it feels good why you got control over their life you really have like you're holding their net you control right no so why do we you know these dudes that like jerk off with like a belt on their neck and check that we call them weirdos it's just women yeah but that's different this that's auto-erotic asphyxiation it is but I think the choking is you're doing it man is doing it to you it's not just that you're running out of oxygen because someone's squeezing the blood out of your brain right but it's also that someone's doing it to you while your mother-fucking do you guys go for the whole choke cuz what I do is I like put my hand there and then I kind of just tense my forearm but I don't really squeeze the fingers cuz I want you know cuz like that she won't let me do that she wants the whole choke no she doesn't like that oh she doesn't like that yeah she knows you could do it well it's not just that it's like she sees you choke people out regularly she knows you're capable but the kind of girl that wants you to choke her like that I think you should leave that one alone dude my wife like the lucho give me we've got no did all of that stuff was kind of like subsided but she's like a lot of choking you know even together 22 years yeah you want to play but I think it's really because they see men as pathetic now they see men as babies and the more pathetic and like cooked up a guy is they're like okay choke me slapped me around show me that you have some testosterone show me you have some sort of strain gotta go give ol Jason pussy oh my god you choked him Richard Ramirez to have girls visiting him Manson that was married when he died Manson had charm he must've had something no he must have had fame fame has always been in a trap was he famous in the beginning when he was getting people to do all that wild shit he was man bit Manson right well he wasn't famous but he was a cult leader so right so he was the leader of a small group so he was infamous infamous amongst that group of people yeah you gotta at least turn a couple people to turn it into a cult like eventually it becomes part of it but if you look at social media you realize that any really shit right it ain't really shit to have a following you know I'm saying 500 followers on social media is pathetic right but 500 in real life yo huge him you're the man Jim Jones especially in 67 yeah you get 10 people - you get 10 people to kill yourself 67 oh man some people can't get 10 people - a comedy that's what I'm saying you would have met and no like you got a fax um like there's no organization everything has to happen in real life yeah what would I want beach like death no he must have the speech when he made everybody drink the kool-aid bro let me tell you something that's involved he had that must have been they know they were drinking that it wasn't even kool-aid you know cool they took a bad rap it was some like cheap Costco brand with kool-aid existed even back then I think who late existed so they went with the generic dude it's like they didn't have enough money for all cool they should try to get at Big Papi no resorts that said that was an assassination attempt well the people are dying at these resorts their lists and all these Americans that are being poisoned one lady got beaten to death and raped she didn't get beaten to death but like beaten half to that she survived but like her whole head was just big swollen mass of blood and injuries yeah everything worked at the worked at this resort she saw him wearing at least he was wearing an outfit clubbed her over the head and did all kinds of crazy shit her and left her for dead did I read a story today as a group of high school kids and went to the dr of celebrating graduation or whatever all of them ended up in the hospital and nobody knows why this is happening nine people have died at these resorts that nobody knows what a lot of them are dying from pulmonary edema and heart failure that it's like some blood issue and they're drinking things from the minibar and minibar okay yes what what is the number of people died over there now seven nine nine nine nine it's happening in the resorts the safe spots yeah it's happening in the real fuck yeah the odd awful we got to go to dr what do what we don't know what that's hunting right there wait let's get into it this is a this is let's get to the bottom of it want to do some nature shit Joe you wanna go do some matrix it let's go hunt some rapists in the dr I wonder what's happening I don't think it's right as people die from drinking if they said drinking at these mini bars and drinking at these bars and like they've been testing the alcohol and it's like fake alcohol or some shit like that I don't know what the fuck is going on I just know nine people have died yeah I'm not going no yeah I'm not going yeah you can't take this all it takes you know it takes us nine people going to fuck up your whole tourist economy you would think yeah but we live in this arrow people like oh shit let's go over there and see if we can survive the dr like it's become like a fucking game um yeah well yeah well this one anybody dies of a cocaine overdose everybody wants a shit oh right wait you want the good shit yeah what the should they do coke no never ever done it you ever do coke a fakes enough cold ones I smoked it in a blunt with some wheat okay I can the day but I fakes nifty like thanks it was like the lines were on the table and I just wanted to make you people out of the round feel comfortable almost like on some training days you think I going to cover copper motherfucking you just do like this black just say what they're doing coast to Ric Flair whoo I've had T that mata de cocoa tea what is that he made out of coca leaves yeah any of those yeah apparently the leaves if you just chew more actually good for you they're phytonutrients it's like copper it's like a cup of coffee okay like but it's healthy it's actually good for you like those high those high altitude herders they put a big wad of that shit in their mouth they chew on it and then it releases into their bloodstream and it's actually healthy it's not bad for you it's when they process it and turn it into cocaine that it's bad that's when it gets what I've had is coca leaves in a tea form so you just take the leaves and it's like in a tea bag and you drink the tea it just makes you kind of like hyper and you talk too much I'm not allowing I've smoked that cocaine with that weed by accident that was the best high I've ever had in my mother fuck really yes I used to always say I would do it again by accident if it was by accent hoppers I think I'm too old for that shit now but back then my god I remember that high like it was yeah why what a feeling like he said if you just feel like very alive like you feel aware like everything just seems bright even when it's dark out and it's just like you feel like you're actually on top of something right it's just like you just feel mad hyper but when you crash you cry over when you crash try Holly yeah MDMA I'm doing a yeah yeah yeah same sure it was nice though you like it or no I love the feeling when I was on it I did not like the next day I couldn't read I was trying to read a magazine and I couldn't read it I just can't I couldn't follow it yeah my brain was so dried out just shut down just it was just dead and then I went on stage that night and ate shit yeah cuz you the synapses are fire Oh slow and sloppy my delivery was off fuck though cuz you say they shit I thought literally I was like oh I can't wait to hear this started reaching in your fucking pants so I've been go to Burning Man last few years right really yeah last three years I see bro dude it's not even really like it for me Lisa I haven't even really been fucking there no no dude you don't you're not showering you're all fucking hopped up on drugs and checked in I think like the fuck communities exist but I don't want to sell it it's it's weird to like sell it but it's a really cool experience you would probably really love it but um and I tried Molly and it was you know people say like when you try drugs it gives you this heightened version of reality that you can't come to naturally right and then you have a new perspective because of it some people say about like acid or mushrooms and these types of things um it was weird be used for the first time my life I felt past emotionally fill full it was like excess does that make sense you don't you kill on stage and you walk off and you just want to like help people yeah cuz you filled up the void and then you have a little extra right yeah Somali put me there and I was like oh this is how people who feel no void operate like I was just calling my parents I was calling my best friends and tell them I love them and I'm gonna take care of your kids if anything happens like what oh yeah maybe they gave you the courage to do things you want to do but for whatever reason you choose not to write because you know before I'm busy trying to fill the void mm-hmm right be it through laughs or through content whatever we're doing and here I had the excess and it was an interesting experience to make me go okay I can probably hit this maybe without the drug I can do things in my life exercise or rather to gratitude 100% yeah Oh dr. Wayne WI say that you won't try find your true purpose your true purpose in life is service to others right so I think most people that are public servants and like give their lives to other people like I think they that's the ultimate high but it's so crazy it's like you don't get to notice that until you're there like it's so easy to sell if you tell people hey you should be grateful and then you'll feel better but if they're not able to feel the sensation of gratitude you're explaining to them you're explaining Chinese to someone who doesn't even know what the fuck the languages yeah right like we're all in this like unique situation where we've probably experienced that we probably you know it tried to find ways to give back etc and then we felt really good because of it more like I should keep doing this this is a really good feeling but imagine someone who's like barely surviving yeah but they still have something to give they just don't realize it like you you might have ten dollars in your bank account but guess what it's a homeless person on the street that has zero you give them a dollar you might feel great and then we take that dollar and he's so appreciative like thank you thank you like that'll make you it immediately feel better yeah really just helping people without any you know you have no ulterior motive or it's a great feeling well I thought about that with karma right like we always look at calm and we think that calm is what you put out is what you're supposed to get back no karma is just in action and you're supposed to do those things just because it's the right thing to do yeah period I think also karma involves you feeling the way you feel about yourself because when you do shitty things you feel you have a bad self-image you live in your karma that's what people don't get it's not like here's a dollar for a homeless guy five minutes later I should get ten dollars it's not an investment karma right it's no I feel better when I'm acting right like it's simple as that I can't run from yourself like no you go to sleep every night you look in the mirror like and when you jack off you know what you think about new jack I'm like you know you and I think a lot of people don't understand that concept like it won't change like I can't do people dirty because I know I did somebody there I can't do something because I carry that because I know I did something fast you know and even when somebody does something fried of me I rap I gotta go through my files in my mind I do something fucked up to this person that I'd do something that caused them the right this way no I didn't that's their problem and that's the competitive advantage of sociopaths is they don't carry the negative karma sure right they have the interaction we the three of us would walk around afterwards like man I should have fucking done that what the fuck was wrong with me I feel like a piece of shit they just go yeah all right that happened I don't believe it no that's why they if they're effective in business that's why they're effective in politics that's why you see these personality types succeed with the ability to just destroy thousands of lives you would just say but I think eventually it catches up to all of them I think it does emotion just suppressing shit so much but eventually I think that's just I think that she just explodes and then it causes them to go crazy if they don't fucking get killed there are people though that don't experience any emotions the way we experience no empathy yeah there's they're broken there's something wrong with the synapses yeah like that for a long time yeah yeah yeah yeah I said when I when I started going to therapy is when I started like piecing things together but I I made myself cold just because of how to protect yourself yeah and how I felt like the world and the business was treating me yeah at a certain point yeah me I I was purposely making myself code and I thought that was the way that I had to be you fucking around read books like the 48 laws of power when you're young and you know you study all of these people who got to a certain point they all had like this this justjust coldness about them like this ruthlessness like I'll step on anybody to get the way I need to be but then you realize these motherfuckers are miserable that's the same dude so you're on the island right lanai yeah right and were you hanging out with anybody Island folk song yeah so there's this a comic named little Duvall he's at Lee's I really think he's one of the people who understands life better than anybody on this play my guy and it was he's a good buddy of ours he's fucking and brilliant and he says dude for the smile bitch song there you go joe-joe when I'm telling stander comes out to that side no shell stick easy man let's move on this pious last time we were talking about how is he was gonna do it man oh but um he's one of these guys I promise you his understanding of life is unparalleled unparalleled to anybody I've ever said and you see a song like smile bitch and we see it maybe on surface value but everything he does has a purpose and he's aware of the purpose right he's aware the energy puts out the ecosystem and how it affects the ecosystem and he was telling me how he likes to go to the islands I visit him in Bahamas and he likes to be in the moms I was like why do you like to pair he goes because people understand what life is here I go what he talked about he goes they don't get caught up in a bullshit that we caught it get caught up in the states right and like in the States everybody here thinks they're gonna be a millionaire everybody yes we've got a lottery a reality show some viral video and you go to the island and they understand that they're gonna live and die there and then they start to realize hey I got to just maximize happiness in life try to get some chicken tenders on the island when we're Bahamas it takes fifty 50 minutes an hour for fucking five chicken tenders I'm like why fuck has it taken so long and he looked at me he goes why should they hurry it's real Buddhists like it's a lot of it is a lot he doesn't he doesn't know that but philosophy is like he's he's aware of Buddhist you don't even know you called my nothing who's Buddha's he be like I ain't I didn't go to school no Buddha but he knows instinctively he have no formal education comes from nothing and the way that he's found a way to understand humanity it says competitive advantage in industry then he just truly understands made fast we've complicated this year dude we had like capitalism as complicated things you know the cultures that we scribed to be a part of have complicated things the truth didn't matter is life is about treating people good being a public servant and dying the crazy thing he goes he goes I love my life and this is what's hard to understand because I love hanging out old people I'm like why here's because they understand life I know what do you mean because you you'll eventually get to a certain point where you realize you're gonna die and all these things that you want to accomplish that you thought you had to accomplish and all this shit that you thought you had to get done in order value yourself as is meaningless it was just distraction until we get there you that's the concept by being hard to swallow yeah because you have to let go of ego right you have to go you have to go ok I'm ok as I am and I'm ok having a good conversation with somebody or good interaction today or just fucking sitting on the beach and looking at the Stars right these are cool things that's just as valuable as having a YouTube clip hit a million or something like that these these things aren't any different in the grand scope grand scope of things right yeah I believe in the law of attraction right your thoughts become things so that's why I thought for me to graph the concept of okay Wendy you're gonna die because in my mind I want to die with him ninety a hundred years old but you know you read certain things and he like no you have to embrace it you have to tell yourself every day you're gonna die because then you'll live your life like every day is your last yeah I that's a hard concept you know Ct Fletcher I've heard that name so he said the hour looking back - yeah he had a heart transplant last year and he came on the podcast a year after his heart transplant and you've never seen a guy more loving and open and friendly and thankful and tells everybody loves him he's hugging everybody and just genuinely grateful because he was at death's door like legitimately intest doors heart was failing him his father's hearted failed them his brothers his like he's got congenital heart disease in his family and he knew that his heart was going he had had heart attacks he'd had surgery and they transplanted his fucking heart and a put a woman's heart inside of him - well I also fucked with him that's what he's like Wow no but it means just like just that's one the one that fit yeah you know there was like this is matches you and we're ready to do it BAM so now here here he is a year later but that guy has like this renewed lease on life and he just glows like a like a like a religious figure as he got close yeah it's very concept for a movie like somebody who was a male chauvinist all his life and shitting on women and then had to get a woman's heart yeah hole jealous for no reason yeah pretty crazy but it is interesting it's like that's what now we're getting to the fucked up thing right like this idea there is no good and bad things just are etc right but like but there's good and bad in how the the energy that you put out how it affects people you do a bad thing and it hurts a bunch of people's lives yes that's you're really you're changing how those people are going to interact with all the people they experience as well yes and there's a ripple effect with the ecosystem right but like let's say you look at like you early we're talking about like bears mm-hmm right or maybe I was watching a clip of your show but you're talking to and Duncan and you're like bears really just attacked baby animals that's what they maybe do whatever they can but the moat they eat most most of the baby deer the dog they just eat they're like animal pedophiles right they're just killing fucking kids right that's what they do coca-cola sponsor is an animal pedophile just eating baby seals frame so that in our culture would be a piece of shit what if there was a group of people that just killed kids right right we would call the pieces of shit that would be a bad thing right right but that's just you've acknowledged within the you know the ecosystem of that of those animals it's necessary yeah right the Bears need to how do we know though how do we know that is not fucking groups of animal rights activist animals in the woods we don't know these animals are really talking about a really disgusting no no you know the shark's fin soup yo Charlotte you know the shark's fin soup no city cut they just cut the fins off the shark and then they let the shark sink to the bottom of the ocean and die and die right it just sinks of the bay can't swim it just sinks to the bottom and there's somebody tweeting about how horrible it is but I bet there's a bunch of fish that are pulling up on that shark like oh look what we got here yeah don't just stand there when they see you know they get the fuck on right fuckin humans with them guns again oh yeah like I think animals are way smarter than we give them credit for well they have instincts no more than things some some do some animals are smart you know what's interesting moose are some of the dumbest the dumbest fuck but do because you know why so big cuz who's gonna take them out yeah there's so big all they have to do is stomp stomp wolves that's all they have to do wolves try to come after them and then they just came on if I wasn't moves I'd be dumb too though cuz I'll be looking at y'all like y'all dumb y'all really out here with us yeah and they just muffled oh God you don't have the nerve to try me from Game of Thrones what that what's that guy's name yeah thorn board you don't know is IQ but I can't imagine it's incredible mmm you think yeah six nine 300 pounds y'all got a figure shit out it might not have to but some dudes choose to this giant dudes that are smart as fuck small cocks that's what level people would like to think that's what I have to think you have to to make yourself feel better six nine always say that about Shaq someone saying that about oh he's got a little dick compared to who compared to a bear I read current stuff is book current stuff and said she had sex relationship ahead superhead she said it's not little it's just regular so like his dick pile look big on me is a really big for you shed Chris Rock joke about the background he's like I don't have a big dick but I got a small background need to come through with the time-warner remote that should be that boring company what did that call it Joe the boring complain I'm not a flame thrower yeah that's what shocked me yeah disappoint a woman I guess what I'm saying is like like with Ct Fletcher right he need to see death in order to like have this amazing revelation about life and maybe the fucked-up things that happen in the world right maybe if there is some sort of design to all this maybe the fucked-up things that happen in the world allow us to have a little bit of empathy and joy for being able to be here but you got to give a fuck about life first of all because I can think about all the near-death experiences I had whether it was somebody pulling a gun on me whether it was you know me being drunk his shit and wrecking my mom's white loom in the caravan and literally the only reason I survived is because I didn't have a seatbelt on because I was so drunk that impact didn't kill me I didn't think about stuff like that until decades later it happened in the moment it was just like all right whatever I got into a wreck oh I got a gun put on me but when you're old in you you know I got three daughters and I look at my wife and I look at people that love and care about me and I really appreciate in value life now I start thinking about gonna see like what the fuck was I think right I think it was shit about life back then but I can get an anxiety attack thinking about those past moments because those primers would have caused so much not to happen yeah if I did I yeah it's got a care you got a care and you have to have something to care for and that's one of the things that really changes when you have children oh absolutely just change your pelson have best thing to me he said not only did it change how much I love he was it changed my capacity for love it teaches you how to love yeah you might not even know what real love is until you have children and you realize like man just like my heart walking around outside my body yeah and you feel a different level of love a different level of empathy like like I remember my daughter had to track me like two three years ago and she was learning the long jump and you know he was like the first time she ever did the long jump so it was literally I wasn't gonna meet with like practice right and so she goes to do the jump and I just I go oh my god that was horrible and she just burst out into tears and I'm like what the fuck did I just - what did I say my wife is like it was just what's your problem and then other parents are coming like oh it'll be fine you did perfectly guys I shut the fuck up she didn't do good but I didn't understand that my word meant everything like everything so I just took all her confidence out of her and just that one snap of a finger like Thanos and that should even thinking about that shit now hurts my heart but I've never made that mistake again now I'm the father that that that overly tells her how great she is and and I know how to explain her if she does something that I necessarily don't think is great I know how to explain it to her in a way where she can do better and she's very receptive to this yeah change it changes who you are you how many kids three ok sell all daughters 200 you was a hole in a past life let me go I'm telling you this is Tara I have a joke about about how much it changed the way I feel about life is that when my daughter was little there was two bananas and one of them was brown and fucked-up and old and one of them was perfect and I looked at those who bananas and I know my daughter loves bananas so she probably want that nice banana so I ate that fucked-up banana with mashed potato textured banana I was thinking about this and not another person in this world I would do that for because I love my wife my wife is an amazing person but it was just me and my wife I'd be like ooh I guess that bitch is getting a shitty you would jump in front of a bus for her different things so like this people say I would die for you they don't mean it most of the time unless they're a soldier who's willing to dive on a fucking grenade yes but if I could die and I knew that my kids would be happy and healthy uh-oh if but if I lived they would die I would die I flew out I flew out I flew out here I left I left New York 5:30 this morning simply because I was opposed to fly out last night but my daughter had a tract dinner which I forgot about and it was literally like a tract dinner it's in a fucking gym and they're serving chicken tenders and lasagna and pizza and listening to Oldtown rolled ten different times everybody gets to participate participation trophies but I stayed just to be there change my flag right there just a flower this morning cuz I needed to be there for that track day yeah that's the you don't do that for people that you don't absolutely love in a door so here's a question you both have these kids and you need to balance loving them so much and telling them the most amazing people in the entire world and not making them horrible human beings well more than that not making them weak weak you have to give them adversity or they'll never know what to do with I think sports is that the key to that make them do not know it's difficult well I know what you're saying about participation trophies but get him involved in something competitive where they have to struggle so they'll learn what it's like to lose they'll learn what what life is like in a kind of controlled environment and then you can still nurture them and love yeah the difference between people participate in sports and people don't as you learn what losing is and some people that never learn what losing is and they just are terrified of it but they're not teaching these kids how to lose in some in school schools but I mean like competitive things like get your kids involved in martial arts get your kids involved in these things that are just it's very clear the binary one or zero either you win or you lose those those are important you learn you learn like what struggle is if you have a race right track meets a perfect example someone fucking won yeah someone did not win that's it you know like who you got across the line and I'm second fuck yeah I gotta be first house what can I be first I gotta figure out a run fast run fast that's it well you guys ever will you guys ever be openly disappointed in them will you show them that they let you down the only time I'm that way with my kids when they're mean to each other I tell them I go this is unnecessary I know why why you're feeling this way I know why you're mad at each other but you can't be shitty to your sister you can't do that it's a bad thing you got to learn how to take a deep breath and think about the consequence of what you're saying and every time you do do something shitty learn from it yeah you know it's like it's a learning experience I think for me I'm just like that when I when I think that they're being ungrateful but my daughter my oldest daughter ten my second oldest is three but so she doesn't really understand the concept other daughters nine one so but my tenure is have lived a very privileged life and sometimes you see that bougie shit come out listen little things like like I love this island called Anguilla I not I mean and we vacation like two three times a year like these long 10-day vacations just like a koala chain using Grenada and hurry my knees my knees comes with me all the time and it is talking like the food is so much better if in a single-wide fucking trailer like that is the only thing that like pisses me off this lack of gratitude but that's perspective issue though right never there they're wealthy they're never gonna understand what it's like to do so how do you instill that in us impossible you know it's not anyways I'm a mess man all of my favorite people have fucked up child yes but I don't want my kids ever my mom told me we're here to make our children's lives better like my mom actually showed me like my great-great-grandfather's taxes he had to pay one year and I was like a quarter like it was something light but back then that was a lot of money so she was just saying that to me ever to tell me that every generation is supposed to be better cuz I got this thing sometimes well I feel guilty about doing so well because I don't have no fucking skillset like I didn't go to college you know what I'm saying like I'm not I don't feel special like why am i in the position that I'm in my mother was a school teacher with 30-plus years most she ever made was $30,000 in cycle Anna I get that for a fucking appearance so it's like that shit will make you feel bad sometimes like you'll feel a sense of guilt so she was just showing me that to say hey every generation is supposed to be better than the next generation so our kids are supposed to be way better than us yeah but don't you want to prepare them for that life like you look at any one of these movies or even stories about a a king that took power and then the son that he has son he has always some spoiled little bitch who ruins the kingdom well that's the thing find me a great man is the son of a great man find me a man find me a great man who's the son of a great man because a great man always has these weak little sons and it's like how do you it like maybe you do need to create adversity for your kid maybe do need to be a dick a little bit and maybe it's selfish to be sweet to your kid all the time because you're not preparing them for the world when you're not there I think you prepared him for the world when you let them find their own way yes meaning like you got to cut a cord yeah I don't want my I don't want my daughter to get in the media you know if they choose to cool you know my daughter likes to write now so she wants to be an author fine I'm not I'm not really an author who wrote a couple books you know I'm saying write what it goes right then that gives them that integrity and that purpose and everything else that they're looking for yeah I think when you hand him things yeah that's when the Eagle yes they have to work for what I see in the communities that I live in is I always like the rich kids that have nannies that take them everywhere and they don't see their parents very much because their parents work all the time and their parents vacation without the kids they like to go places without the kids all the time there's you see a lot of that those kids are getting fucked up and you see them as they get older they're more and more vacant more and more weird more and more detached yes you know but the kids that around the family all the time they do things with the family then they get a richer experience it's it's neglect and it's the parents that are like super driven and they're never home they're working 16 hours a day and that's why they live in this fucking giant mansion and drive around in the Bentley like though those kids get fucked up and they wound up getting on drugs and empty and looking for something to fill them up imagine your parents sent you to boarding school I have a buddy mine - Bryan Callen his parents sent her to fucking boarding school in the United States and they didn't even live in the United States they sent him to another country Jesus where where's Bryan from I love Bryan Bryan is from all over the world his dad was a banker an international banker air quotes mm-hmm and traveled everywhere and was involved in some weird gun boring shit weapon deals we could talk later but he was involved in UFOs and weapon the weird shit and then sent his kit was fucking 13 years old sent him to the United States go to boarding school and Bryan's his day still little show because of it yeah dude imagine your parents send you away feel like we're 13 it's yours I can often imagine if you was at boarding school and got fucking molested or something you would really hate like saying something funny that hasn't been yeah you got to get that funny diddle then something fucked up happened really yeah if you're fucked up if you're funny something fucked up anything yes yeah yeah I mean sometimes some pain some strong note you have to learn it you have to learn it why would you need funny it's like it's but that's why it's so rare to see and people always say this about women but like even attractive dudes like have you ever seen like a male model that was funny right let's say about girls carrot top unless you're fat your stories suck real talk it's true dude unless you have to earn pussy like lesbians are hilarious yes tragic is fucked yeah sorry yes stank she's not fat no meshes no no but she had a tragedy the tragedy is y'all say it being a fan of the tragedy yes shit that's why miss Patterson larious because you never want your kid to become Miss Pat but you love miss patty yeah you love me spent only because like that when you go through that kind of trauma when you come out on the other side you're really unstoppable yeah especially when you deal with what's going on in here which is the toughest part right now I think that's what comedy does comedy is therapy for a lot of people there before a lot of people it gives you an escape well that's why she was able to accept what that guy did to her and forgive him because she just she's past it yeah she's on the other side yeah she's gotten through on the other side and it forces you to deal with the reality of the world like I think comics better than most people deal with the reality of the world and often it's because we've went through some kind of real shit right so we go oh yeah these things happen so I can let my mind even operate in it when you exist in like a really privileged life emotionally and even mentally when you exist in that space you don't want to imagine that there are people starving you don't want to imagine their people hungry or that their parents are abused their kids you don't even want to go there because you don't have to when you grew up in it like yeah that's what the life is where's the fun right my dad can hit me for it for shit my mom when you travel you can appreciate where you're going where's your daughter's like again I went to South Africa in December it was like the hundredth year of Mandela could have been his hundredth birthday or something like that and so I took my daughter my ten-year-old daughter so like a few months later she had a project in school where she had to do a project about Nelson Mandela in South Africa and so she had printed this picture of the Nelson Mandela statue in from Mandela Square and had it as the cover and I'm like where's the picture of you next to the statue and she's like I don't want to use that you don't want to use the picture of you standing next to the actual statue in Nelson Mandela Square that's the point of these experiences because you're able to do things like that I had to explain that to her yet the teacher had a flex to her yeah and she was like I don't even need to use this as a cover for my book oh I think she's embarrassed you don't think she didn't want the other kids to do well like yeah yo would you guys you guys got you got some money and you got kids would you guys pay to get your kid into a good school oh like that lady didn't know no fucking chance absolutely I'm gonna earn that shit yeah you gotta earn that shit you can't do that because they're not gonna enjoy it and they're not gonna direct gonna work hard yeah those some of those people paid a half a million dollars right so good only in Bachelor to get a shitty shitty kid yeah into some school that they didn't deserve yeah and the kids not gonna have no passion for what they know when you know I'm saying that just they're like they gotta fuck is just like having a regular piece of paper like I want I want my kids to do things that they really want to do that's how you change the world you change the world when you're doing things that you that you're wanted but what's funny I thought is that those kids that went to the school like did fine at them so yes the school is just a big fucking hustle it's like if they didn't earn it based on grades they should fail right the fuck out of the school it's becoming a hustle just because of the way the world is working yeah Jamie went to school for audio engineering he's not a goddamn thing he learned in school he could use today really yeah I mean for the most part I got to touch some stuff I could never have touch before but I mean it was like 2005 maybe YouTube didn't exist and there wasn't the plethora of knowledge out there that 12 year olds are teaching you how to record audio right whereas I had to learn from the guy that was recording Eminem and jay-z you know these guys dr. Dre right like they can't really do much with that job either besides teach it now either so that's why I'd like to go back to Joel's point when you said I'm gonna last and radio the reason I'm probably the last and radio is because I'm the guy that's tearing people away from real when kids come on community but y'all wanna get in the radio I'm like fool what type of different ways to be heard you can go on YouTube and if you want to be a VJ on TV you can start doing your own video countdowns on YouTube like why do you need TV or radio that's your middle man gone yeah I had to be on a radio radio you had to be on TV we didn't have that shit growing up you know I'm even experiencing that with commentary for the UFC because I love doing commentary for the UFC but you know what I love you better I do these fight companions yes when you want you get in here with your hand when you start smoking weed and talking shit and we watch the fights on the screen we have the best time it's way more fun than being there live do you think that's the future of all live events right so you could watch the NBA Finals and instead of listening to the guys you know Marv Albert or whoever do it you could choose your guys that you watch the commentary with Oh fight companion for basketball football you know I was doing that with Snoop Dogg he had he had the Tuesday night contender series Anoop dog and Urijah Faber we're doing commentary and snoop would just have a constant blunt lit and he was drinking Tanqueray and getting hammered hi and talking crazy shit that was an option for the commentary you should be options noop cast it should write it should be every single one sleep got tired of doing it though stop doing it he'll Snoopy I thought I'd get around Dana White ah I think he just got tired of you know having to be there every Tuesday well that's the beautiful things we show the NBA did this during the finals this year they tried an alternative stream using the ESPN app right so the thing about this is you're doing it with the ESPN guys yeah correct right so it's like what would be great is do it with like the funniest commentary guys that you like in your life right here them just the reason why people tune into your thing I guarantee they probably mute the TV right the people who are watching they listen to both I think that's what people probably do so you never let the good commentator is commentating anything that I'm saying Berkeley Kimmy's Memphis Shaq should be actually commentating during the NBA and it would be incredible during the game it would be incredible yeah I'm talking shit to each other matter of fact put them on a little screen in the bottom so we can actually look at them visually what they're doing I don't know I just think do that with the UFC they have the best guys doing like Daniel Cormier does it's great Dominick Cruz Paul Felder you know they have good fighters Michael Bisping that do commentator now Cormier is the best oh yeah he's great he's hilarious yeah Ben used to fight fuck cage the heavyweight champion he's a light heavyweight champion and then he vacated this title and no he's the heavyweight champion yeah he does commentator we do it all the time together yeah you guys are right together because you guys get fuck but we're also good friends okay so we're always talking shit and we're laughing about things whether it's a judge was a nice lady but a terrible judge yeah but this like when when Rose namajunas won the title you start screaming out the ground it's not like you guys turn into fans yeah well we are I mean neither one of us are real professionals right but we do it for 11 and it's weird that's my worst nightmare like to be out some way and fucking get into a argument with an MMA fighter so when you got folded up when keeping it real goes wrong in the hole other sides of it in ears here's a good one but but the thing is you can wear our ear cards I don't have any cauliflower here I have a little bit on this year but I wear ear guards it changes the way you hear things what you don't want that Calvo ear ossification eye ears stick out already too much oh they would stick out do not look at a bat yeah you'd have a big old knots in your yeah I can't so there's no other signs of what a guy could be an MMA no not real what about hands what about knuckles no I mean you could tell not tell you know it's no you don't know see that's why it's got to be nice to people fucking Andy Ruiz the new way you look at his body you would think no fucking away and you look at Anthony Joshua sculpted out of marble Ben thought he was trash bro yeah not that guy never he never had in him he is literally Ivan Drago literally he's the UK Ivan Drago he looks the part ladies love him he never had that skill in the ring I told no Breakfast Club I don't think that's true he got dropped by Klitschko and he came back to knock me let's go it was an old-ass man dude and he's Ukraine he's got Chernobyl in a man show yeah that's nuclear poisoning a shit he was very old he was trying to win an election for like this you know crazy cunt she's got a lot of things going on his life the real fight Anthony on t Wilder Tyson Fury 2 closest thing we've we've had in the heavyweight division Tolly I said after that I said a couple of fight so I think he is the head movement the foot movement at his size and weight I'll leave is doing that 212 pounds his head was last fight was very ugly like on amazing on violent aside guys but Ali did that with George Foreman you see there's a difference the guy that he was fighting like that guy did it with Deonte in Deonte he did it but he also got dropped and almost murdered he died every time I look at 12th round when Deonte connected and then walked back game over and the fact that he just rose up and then outboxed him for the rest of the round but although she has a therapy that's although she has a therapy and meditation hit him and knocked him out he was in that place is still this fall that was ko is a weird man it's like sometimes the a punch does not look like much and it drops you and puts you away and sometimes you get fucking flatline like and it looks like you're over what I mean I was amazed that the ref even gave him a cat thought it was gonna call him out yeah I thought I thought the ref was gonna wave their hands yeah meanwhile this motherfucker rises up and doesn't even look wobbly unbelievable by the way Anthony Joshua can't beat Tyson Fury he can't beat the ante watch you can't beat Luis Ortiz well well I don't Luis is all - here's a good 90 years old yeah the word is and I get this from a reliable sources inside the fight community you know that Anthony Joshua got dropped in training camp he's right before the fight bad yeah my god in Philly right I don't know yeah but bad yeah the point where he was ko'd essentially and that's why his dad went after the promoter after the fight was you see his dad screaming at the promoter ring apparently he was just not he's not prepared to fight and yet he was looking bad in the locker room know worried about a panic attack yeah I thought he had a panic attack before the fight and if you remember you know it took him a while to come to the ring like they even played and I was told that when if you noticed when he was walking out they was rubbing his back and he was rubbing his head I heard he had a panic attack well if you've been ko like within a week you it takes months to get your shit back together again the whole world is like shaky - you equilibriums off so he was in there and then when he dropped him he's like Jesus Christ here I go again time no but you know when he talks to a drop yet he's like good we got let's get this motherfucker out of here and then he went right at him and then boom he got clipped and then it was over there's a there was a the biggest what is the biggest upset heavyweight history is theis Douglas versatile Yeah right guess who got dropped in training camp Tyson did did he Yeah right I forget the guys name but his sparring partner I'm in training campus video of a huge kom he took a knee but still it's like robbed dropped your body shut down for a second and it takes time to recover for that shame at the meeting the night before he was fuckin a bunch of Japanese women would Bobby Brown in a hotel room and doing drugs by the fire Bobby said Mike told him I'd be right back hey Bobby was like no you gotta fight tonight he's like yeah yeah I'll be right back I'm gonna knock this guy not be right back he still got up and he still dropped Buster Douglas that's even crazier nah did you ever watched it 34 30 know about Buster Douglas no taste they had to 3430 and me I didn't realize how much he dominated Mike Tyson oh yeah it would like round full round yes punishing Mike Tyson yeah I remember that when I was just at Douglas is like one of the most talented guys yet just didn't have the kind of drive and discipline that you needed to be a champion but when his mom died mother dad his mom it was mom man that's what gave him all the drugs and he was hooking off the jab on Tyson yeah Wow yeah like in a beautiful way yes his skill was incredible I wasn't afraid it was a world beater yeah he was a world beater yeah fun no motivation no no no we feel fucked him up after that he's basically done no he was done yeah but now he's infamous in SMS beating Tyson when it would have meant something to beat Mike I found out about it after the fact I didn't watch the fight live I had a gig that night when I thought in real-time and then I watched it later and I still was waiting for Tyson to get up and beat him I didn't believe you didn't believe it I remember I remember watching that fight in in my mind I guess I wasn't really paying attention I was just like this is longer than most Tyson fight you can have a dinner reservation on a Tyson back yeah I'm like it then when you finally got shit Mike just lost not only do we grow watching Mike fuck people up we grew up trying to beat him on Mike Tyson punch ass say that shit was impossible yeah so is this like dad I was an unbelievable moment I didn't feel like that we were even Joshua well there's certain times with people lose you can't believe they're lost like for me it was Roy Jones when Tarver knocks him out dude I was just like what one fucking boy Jones they stopped to this day man unreal if you watch in the second round it's a really interesting thing that happens they both they both throw ho and Tarver just gets there yeah and well Tarver is actually a South Pole right so I think it's his is kind of like a looping lesson but they exchange and Tarver just his first Roy timed it and this what happens I think when fighters get a little bit older they lose a fraction of a second and that fraction of a second earlier in Roy's career he's checking them and then he's moving out of the way well I think the real watch.watch Alex do you see it yeah look at some exchange ready it's and yeah boom at one point changes everything everything well you know what thar was coach said that Tarver beat him in basketball yes and then when he saw that he beat him better who was his coach McGirt buddy yeah yeah I think final that's true dude we had we had Roy on on on floor two and I asked him I was like we ever worried about like getting knocked out and like you know losing something leaving something in the ring and he takes a second he goes I'll be honest with you man I didn't come and ring with much sense to begin with so I wasn't really worried about losing it competitive nature to Roy last year last year Roy was hitting me because he really wanted to fight I really want to fight him Rose like I got the sponsors that can put some money I think was like thirty million dollars I made the call for and Michael was like nah it is like now we good or net like Roy would fuck Michael B Jordan uh don't let Creed fool you don't let fucking kill Magan black you still run up on one of them old boxes right now muscle memory will get you nothing why does someone even be close so that's horrific and these know what happens it's like some guys start they surf bite fighting or they start to an MMA they start doing a little Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or something like that right yeah and they put a couple chokes in in like a safe controlled environment and you get that like delusional yeah confidence and that's why sparring so important do you remember the first time you guys sparred sure I'm not the first time number two laughs well you doing since you're a kid right now okay I mean the first time I sparred before I went in the ring I was like uh I got this it's just combos whatever I'm was fucking for dude frightening when the punch were coming back yeah I'm just a shell I just stopped yeah miss bought since the last time I spot a spot with Shawn Porter really yeah yeah this was nothing he was actually throwing punches yeah cuz I was mad but this you don't mean knock your ass out bro and this is one of them this guy's head movers is impeccable I mean people try to attack him on the street and then every single time Joe Joe Joe it's on fucking really it is look at him going forward this is the PR move that's not a PR move you sweatin hmm that's it is in Brooklyn you gotta be focused cuz there's people yelling in there yo shoulder me gotta make up can I get a drop from the audience and it know I'm right-handed I'll just trying to throw him off a little bit really yeah you did it on purpose did you know feet movement do you train in boxing are we just doing this for a goof no I just wanted the going in I was like fuck it this shot water I'm a boxing fan I'm like you know what the worst can happen you get knocked the fun where's can have it as this mean yeah you're right that could be terrible he's become significant left footed yeah he's not we not even really and we went three rounds Wow now is about to die at the end it'll three rounds he's bold a few times I stand my fucking late I mean I hit the punching bag Callens bars all the time and doesn't probably one yeah Brian no no Brian Kenner Oh DJ Khaled one person is not doing any cardio it's DJ calories after a Ruiz one Khaled getting out of a car with all the big guys the day after the title Khaled Khaled Khaled been working out on snapchat for a whole union didn't lose a motherfucking pound nice guy and got a Weight Watchers deal god bless Amer Weight Watchers I mean we are just a white plate there's plus-size models right there doing that now like Nike and their Nike store has like a big mannequin like a fat mannequin but they do they don't have plus-size models for men Joe there is nothing that enrages me more than fat models there is nothing that enrages me more than fat fuck ok ok let me just say something as a comic we want attention we don't feel like we deserve it so we make you laugh so there's an even exchange I get my attention you get some joy okay an actor they want attention they're not willing to write the script but they'll memorize some line so do a little bit of effort to get the attention a regular model at least she's willing to lose weight so that she can be looked at but these fat bitches are just like look at me look at using the word in 2019 what the fuck that's that's that's the plus-size model mannequin great you guys the only thing I don't like and rate you that they're like just stare at me I'm gonna eat bread all day no but you should stare at me the only thing that bothers me about that is that's out of context because that's the oversized mannequin in workout clothes right he's going to lose the weight yeah she's trying to lose matter so okay so I needed some context if this is workout gear like overweight women who want to go lose weight cool right other than that why are you wearing workout gear cuz she's trying to lose weight that's the only reason you'd be wearing that she would she'd be even bigger if she didn't work out she like Hallett imagine calleb didn't DJ khaled needs to eat a salad [Laughter] you gotta have a DJ Khaled level of annoyance to succeed in life dog to you yes you do so much but it's so much she's in your fucking shirt there's no way you didn't know you could button your shirt he's the epitome of not being afraid to ask for things but it looks like french toast Jesus every time I look at him it's french toast and he has no is the butter and the maple syrup says

2:00 a.m. on weekends at W edr in Miami if I'm not mistaken needs to be Friday and Saturday night and then I was like 15 years ago great so radio is a lot like comedy in a way right and that like there's like a sort of a fellowship of radio people you respect people who did it yeah it's so it's so few and far between that actually I guess make it so to speak that you know who those players are right I'm saying so yeah in a way yeah and there's so few like national ones like who's like nationally known radio guys Elvis Duran there's maybe a dozen um you Elvis Bobby Tom Joyner Tom's retiring this year what about Steve Steve national TV no CIBC those and I respect Steve and I respect Ryan Seacrest not really count those guys they didn't start in radio million grassroots didn't start in radio was the awesome radio guy they I have no that was a radio guy law I did his radio show in the nineties okay so you might didn't even know you might have a do he does great guys five jobs right grab from American Idol right because radio day does it in the more any does that secretary radio what is that like hey Delores you're the one who won you know like that kind of shit by the way Ryan is never off ya know like we work for the same company were fired I've seen Ryan walk out the bathroom like he's walking on stage to introduce the next guest on American Idol like he's always on know that was a perfect example where like you're gay rumors trumped you're me to rumors what happened remember when he caught the me too and like a girl said that he me to it or whatever and girly worked with something like that and then everybody was like the gay guy he's he's not okay what is he what is he what do you call it all right Ryan is one of those people you have some he is a handsome those fucking teeth but you don't think about sex with him so what is he right with the letters would a sexually so sexual oh it's awesome oh he's like oh you don't fuck dude or chicks okay I see what it is he's always can you imagine him choking a girl no no absolutely not I can imagine she's beating him to death when you hear something about him like no nothing like he has that kind of personality which is actually worked in a lot of people's favor yeah what's great for top-40 radio yeah it's great for secretaries that call in yes you're the seventh caller congratulations would you think about the finals of Game of Thrones did it disappoint you [Applause] shit arrived in the UH that frequency he is so good at being like authentic in the most in authentic situations explain like like hosting the show is why like American Got Talent all that kind of stuff you got to be like really excited about somebody like that's really inauthentic but he kind of comes across as believable like sincere yeah she does it matter meaning like this his reactions in those moments matter that's a pretty man listen he's America's host he is yes America's holes man he's a host some dead in that song that's for sure but say what put him on gecoo Clark does he do the new year's countdown now to a lot of jobs man listen they was probably it was probably dicks corpse corpse up for like 10 years before they finally said Ryan just do it yourself i when he had a stroke and he would still do it not think dick been dead bro wait he had a stroke he was doing out the side of his mouth like to face he was struggling he was definitely struggling to talk yes it was so bad yeah like they went from he would do it but then it was just like they would pop in on him in like some studio and he'd be like sitting there struggling they're talking like why do they keep will and Dick Clark out with New Year's Eve like you're actually depressing people before the ball drops yeah and then they had Kathy Griffin and Anderson Cooper that was a great combination no dude she and rages man just like the fat model no I like Kathy cuz Kathy don't give a shit I like Kathy were the same reason I like I used to like John Roos I mean I say youth because she's dead but I my own legend but they don't they both didn't give a shit they were cut from the same cloth mmm I don't know if they're cut from the same cloth I think so man I think so I have to love Anderson and Kathy Griffin together I never heard anybody say that look at that chemistry oh yeah we got Cathy on breakfast club now said she cut Trump's head she cut Trump's fucking head oh that was that was a strange thing that was what was strange about it is the fact that she didn't think she was gonna suffer any consequences from that I think people forget that Donald Trump even though he is the ex executive producer of Celebrity Apprentice and he was a reality star he's the President of the United States of America its rules about threatening heads of state yeah yeah you just can't do things like that like what it's hard it's almost like a fucking Flavor Flav became president it would be hard for you to look at him as anything other than Flavor Flav yeah but you better respect his position those goddamn minutes come knock on you fucking door if flavor becomes president well Donald's the first guy who was famous like other than Ronald Reagan I guess Ronald Reagan was famous as an actor apparently yeah be famous famous I don't know how that he was famous famous you know he was in big movies and I knew he was the Governor of California you know there's it's a weird one right I mean just having a famous person in a popularity contest is strange yes has you got a built-in advantage yes all of them it is a popularity contract all of them gonna be moving for well someone could some people might say Obama was the first celebrity president he became a celebrity though oh you don't think he was one before going in - no I have to Lulu I think there is now not Trump is on a different level yeah right now those commercials bro he says come fat rap songs named after him name is on buildings all across the world yeah aunt giant Trump letters he was a bread truck yeah he might not have been the first Trump with the first brand yeah then run for president Regan might have been the first star Trump was the first brand but he was definitely a bigger star than Reagan I think easily bragging is before our time it's hard to understand what it was like when he was a movie star yeah I don't know it's called Betty White and after that he's still alive still kicking live Megan do we have do you like do you have these people's numbers general I don't have her number okay haven't seen Betty and you become famous you get on rolodex here's Keanu Reeves baby wipes some famous people where I text him and I call him just like this so strange like I feel like that mmm Steven Tyler's a weird one from Aerosmith yeah yeah next each other in mine alright that's the most surreal feeling of sisters Wow it's weird I never get used to it no it's humbling though yeah but that's why I always say I don't I don't do shit I got no way I'd talk we would have real talent right up to growing up Dennis Pryor - some people like about you is that you recognize that in yourself yeah you know you're not you're not oblivious to that you're not delusional people listen they want to know that you know you can't play musical instruments a or do something crazy well don't they want to feel like reflected like often often at times I think that your audience resonates to you like that it's like you are asking a lot of times the questions that they would love to ask the you know people yeah when I when I listen to you I hear somebody who's still a fan I'm curious I'm curious yeah I have a curiosity about things yeah and and I'm not afraid I don't know shit I don't have yeah I don't I just got some experiences I'm not a expert at nothing everybody that I sit across from his way smarter than me yeah and I'm fine with that let's have a conversation I want to learn that's good that's not that's what that's probably why you're successful it's the way to think world people be like oh I can't believe you would say dude you would ask Elizabeth Warren about her Native American answer did you see that bro Rachael's by now - but did you see the interview with him and Elizabeth Warren yes we pulled her out on the Native American shit but you know here's the weird thing about her it's like I don't necessarily think she told the truth in that interview and know how she get away with it when she said that the Boston Globe did an investigation they said that she didn't she didn't in any way profit off of that or have an advantage she got here she got hired for it from Harvard and she wrote Native American on a resume like they hired her based on her ethnicity yeah yeah she's a liar yeah that's a lie yeah which is fine listen I don't have no problem with my politicians lying they do it all the time but I want you to acknowledge your line hold yourself accountable like none of this shit is disqualified it's not the 80s anymore it's not the 90s where shit like that ruins you just be honest like look I'm American I've cheated before I've taken shortcuts I fucking used to put the cheat code in Mike Tyson all the time just to get Mike Tyson to skip everybody else that's what we're based on yeah so if she did that at some point her life was it a horrible thing to do absolutely make it a table for her make our terrible present forever no I buy what she was saying though that she was told that she was Native American because many people were and then they find out when they get a DNA test it's not did not happen to you didn't help you yeah well hasn't been disproven yet but yeah what are you Native American yeah I was like growing up around the time I was going to college my guy the work of my dad found out that he he had filed the paperwork to his college ten years after the fact and got a bunch of money back and so my dad's like well we're Native American that's what we've been told our whole time so we're trying to prove it all right it's birth certificate and whatnot and it's really hard to because they didn't keep a lot of information back then right so I put it on a application got into Ohio State that way cottham and it was real weird when I was in like the minority home they just liked on the orientation day there was like they gave me a letter to say show but this like from a hard-working charity kid did it in good faith I had no idea and it was the first time just like when I sent in my application and it was like what's your race I was like I just found out I'm a Native American I guess so I'm gonna put that and no one check no one asked that's hilarious that people know just ya know I didn't know I was doing anything wrong the wild thing about that is like that that conversation is like people ask me why I said that I'm like I'm just too dumb to know that that wasn't a question I wasn't supposed to ask you were supposed to ask that was that when a conversation the idea that you're not as ridiculous that's a huge thing we need to find out how she reacts to the fact that she told a lie the rest of her family is the did that fuck up the whole lineage right this whole whole family's thought tearing shit down off the wall like oh my god we're not made of America how many dreamcatchers were in the garbage that weekend holy shit just feather sticking out a hefty bag what she learns that then the whole family after realized that we're not Native American I had to fuck up some family you had to fuck up some tradition too oh my lord there's a lot of people that were shaking their head after that one Josie actually got the DNA tests ok can we talk about how fucked up Ticketmaster is real quick yeah you I just figured I just put my mind together on this thing yeah as a taxi sent me oh my god take it my fat model I take it master we're gonna take them all down okay so take a master you know the place where you buy tickets look I had no clue about this Ticketmaster thing I'm just starting to do some theatres and shit on the tour so I'm starting look at like what they charge to do like the processing and servicing right you buy it's like a thirty or forty dollar ticket I looked at yours forty our tickets $16 in servicing for a service charge yeah is it per ticket per fucking ticket forty percent are they gonna pay for shit in a venue like no I don't that's the venue cost that you also got to pay yeah it's just to process the ticket and if you want to pick up a we'll call another three dollars it's unfathomable right so I'm starting to think I'm going okay so cook for the first time in my life I'm like okay I'm I'm selling some tickets everything's good and I'm just getting peace of the door so I'm happy right and my boy who's like this genius fucking kid Oh Jay Nigerian all these Nigerians are geniuses and he comes up to me he's like okay but what about the processing fee for tikka miser how much are you getting off of that I go what it was like what percentage you getting off that I got nothing he was wait but you're bringing all the ticket sales why aren't you getting a piece of that's 40% of your ticket price and I'm like well I don't know and he goes and what about the data from the tickets being sold are you getting that I go no he goes hold on so they're fucking you and getting paid to fuck you I go what do you mean he goes the game is data now any business is successful right now is all about data acquisition right any business and data is not how many followers we have on Instagram because they could take your account away in a second how many subs do you get on YouTube because they could throttle your search we could see happen all the time it's direct connect to fan right and what Ticketmaster has done is they're your ticketing site they get your email they get your data set they get all your fans they know exactly who your fans are and they email them and tell them when you're coming into town or when somebody else that they might like that like you exactly and then they're getting paid an absorbing amount they're fucking over the fans on it so I'm like I'm talking to him and he's like yo we got to just create another one of these we got to create another system that gives all that data to the comic why does the middleman even there we could create a way cheaper ticketing service that gives every one of those emails to a comic and it's like comics used to do back in the days by putting the comment cards on the tables and you collect them afterwards you could have an email list for every time you go to Idaho an email list for every time you go to New Jersey and email list for all these different prices but most authors do and Kevin Hart Kevin Hart that's how Kevin Hart came up Kevin Hart was going into all of these comedy clubs and he was getting everybody's motherfucking email people wonder why whenever Kevin would launch on these social media sites he'd get all of these crazy followers immediately it's because of that road work he put in in those comedy clubs anybody before anybody I think louis c.k did that as well we had this massive email and now you have direct connection with your fans yeah and that's what your fans want your fans don't want Ticketmaster telling them that Led Zeppelin's coming through they want to know when Brogan's comes through but you know Pearl Jam tried to fight them back in the day what they have they have exclusive deals with certain venues they are top to bottom yeah they own so they own Live Nation and Live Nation owns a venue so they're completely vertically integrated so if you want to play at the garden or whatever the hook it is right yeah so you go we're gonna process your tickets the only way you do is perform here is you do it with our promotion company which is like the nation and you're gonna have to use our ticket processing fee and and our venue they actually own the venue's now but here's the thing there's a handful you guys that get to play those venues now I think with podcasts now shows our 300 people there's gonna be thousands of comics that have 300 fans and the venue where we perform is not imperative that it's this specific one it could be a comedy club it could be a hall it could be some conference center it could be anything it could be Airbnb but aren't you only going to your math than when you're doing these bigger venues well sometimes now that they're Live Nation they own some certain clubs I work with Live Nation so now all your shit is that so same stand-up yeah really yeah why not just do the podcast live every fucking way different man it's insane yeah I like podcasts like this where it's just people talking yeah yeah you do it differently when you're playing for an audience it's performed for them and it becomes just weird ideas an issue it just is not a it's not the same it's not a real conversation like I think the intimacy of podcasts one of the things that people like about as I listen in their ear right there got a little ear plug it's like you're talking to them yeah like you're right there when you're doing it live it becomes a different thing there's a rabbit it's a bad thing yeah but it's a different thing but stand-up is way better way it's just way more fun well I'm saying is what are we doing with this right it's like like you shouldn't you should have a direct connect all your fans I should have Direct Connect all my fans right we should be able to even the venue should have that as well why why do we why are we giving away all the data yeah to a company that's really not I know my agents gonna call me right after this thing's gonna be like why the fuck we have to fuck up so you want their email you want your audience's email a bit and that's what the audience wants and I don't want my audience to get charged 16 bucks every time they buy a ticket where does that money go like it costs $16 a ticket 40% of the ticket price why not just create an email and when you're at these venues just put it up on the jumbotron and be like yo email me after the email me at the show I mean that's yeah that's one more step or we could just create the ticket process in the charges on way letter less scuse me and and already starts aggregating the emails and then if you want to get real crazy with the view of a boy of yours that like let's say my buddy Akash right there do a podcast with it's like hey Akash you're about to go on tour yeah why don't you just use my data set man they're gonna know you from doing a podcast with me maybe you could they'll want to see you it's like we get to empower each other through that shit am I making sense or it makes sense the thing is specifically about data about the email listen about they get that if you show up in these different places they get the email address because that's how people get their tickets what you get that you get the option of saying because they'll ask you they'll say you can Ticketmaster reply to you or can Ticketmaster send you the latest updates and news and yeah you can click no yeah like I and I could that's Ticketmaster but you would click yes if it was us and there was somebody who you are invested in going to see you just don't want to take a master promoting random offense depends would you send me your email address and might sell it absolutely yeah even if you just click no like you do want updates from Ticketmaster you're not saying is it okay if this company just starts selling my email address because that's what they do that's what they do yeah bro they own us anyway but they don't have to I'm saying now like everybody that's coming out to your shows is coming out from this podcast they're not coming up cuz at Ticketmaster and if you use a different email service or ticketing service they would come out with that one there was a Sam Harris podcast where he talked about this where they had on this expert they were discussing how data is it's like a commodity that no one knew was a commodity and we signed off on it before we realized it these people that don't provide any service are getting that data and it's worth billions of billions of dollars which is essentially what Facebook is it's Facebook but is so shaping the way we communicate with each other because the things that attract people are conflict right so the things that get you to engage are conflict right so that's the stuff that shows up in your email yeah they for your Facebook for you they find out what's gonna annoy you yeah and that's the shit that the show okay Wow Oh Jay has 800 thousand 500 two fucking days overnight instantly on Twitter which nobody grows on Twitter anymore no but at least at least Twitter at least at least Facebook they're not charging right my issue with if Ticketmaster was like hey here's a free service we just want to get your data okay alright boom cool Facebook gets jobs you wouldn't are you gonna fuck me in my ass and make me pay you mmm I think Facebook gets charger they just not show their ads yeah yeah but they also like think about it they're they've stolen a lot of that data from people yeah a lot of ways for that is a charge could you sign up for something but you didn't know you were signing up for that I know I was giving you all it is what's weird to me man is fucking when you're talking about something and then those ads show up in your Google feed bro we were just talking about coolers brah and I looked at my Google news feed and there's ads for coolers like how does my phone know I was talking about cool that's why I said they want us you know what else is crazy Haley's getting your car and you look down at your phone and it says 32 minutes to wherever the fuck you're going that happens to me all the time you knows where you're gonna go it knows your phone it'll be like thirty two minutes to to whatever gym I go to art that now he used to tell me forty minutes to work in the morning now it says forty minutes to Starbucks bro I'm like I drink Starbucks every morning and there's a Starbucks by my job in the building but that's way it tells me how going I'm going every morning i watch one video of Robbie Williams you know that like English singer hmm it was a YouTube video with him and Tyson Fury one I just clicked it was two minutes long every other ad on Instagram is Robbie Williams life so it's not good the targeting isn't perfect yeah I'm not gonna buy those tickets but my point is it's Gary one YouTube video and then a completely different platform yeah and this is all within the last decade they figured out how to do this yeah even if we unplug with still plugged in if we were all to delete everything that we have on social media right now they got us all ready bro that's why I don't like all that snapchat shit with the face filters and all that I did you see what they did to him what'd they do to you I think this was not made a complete deep fake with they take they basically took all the recordings of me talking and mainly say words that I've never said before it was it talked about me sponsoring a hockey team made of entirely of chimpanzees and a bunch of other crazy shit that I might actually say but it said it I've never said those things is my voice with artificial intelligence they've all the sounds that my mouth makes and they use it with all the right inflections and they create these sentences Jay Pharoah is out of a job they just passed the legislation about that about deep fake yeah the congresswoman from Brooklyn I can remember her name she just passed the legislation about defects they also did video of the Mona Lisa talking bro they got the Mona Lisa they took the painting of the Mona Lisa and started now she's like opening her mouth and saying things they get with Abraham Lincoln and how can you believe anything you can also shemitah anymore yeah it's gonna be in a few years you're not you'll be able to now you don't know what straw was naturally and nobody cares about the truth from the lies more in a tea that's better maybe now we could say fucked up shit and beg from be fake what are you talking about definitely deep think well it's you're already getting porn with actresses they're taking actresses face and putting them on porn stars and you can't tell oh yeah oh you can fuck everyone yeah and now they're gonna be able to do that with virtual reality so you're gonna do our porn yeah they have that yeah vr porn and they put something on your dick so it feels like yeah they could put a little one of them little things that jerks you off oh it's cool you like your palm yeah I just started fucking listening in the audible books because I'm old go I like flipping the page write a book I just don't listen to audible only because of of time purposes and it's like it's like listening the long-form podcast I'm like you know what fucking I'm still getting the information and I feel like at this age I retain information more by hearing it right so I'm not about to go start fucking virtual reality pussy so here's the shit that's not porn but could be interesting have you seen the one about the basketball games what okay so they put a few cameras so you can sit front row but in VR oh I don't think I will mind that that's the best looking around you're seeing all the people that are actually there in your front row at the game last month I went the UM hates the bathroom I went to Disney I went to Disney and I went to that fucking that avatar avatar twice yeah me too that shit was incredible and you know I got anxiety right so I'm on it and I'm like holy shit until you just remember I'm not even moving right and then it's just like it settles everything for you and then you can just enjoy the actual experience and that helped me I mean I was telling my therapist about it cuz that helps me when I when I'm dealing my anxiety because it's like you know breathing exercises things that get you back to centre even though you're falling and you can feel the the the dragon breathing on you instance like when you realize you're really not moving it just brings you right back to centre then you're okay then you're fine you can't do that on a roller coaster no yes it's real but if they have a roller coaster with virtual reality look if you wearing virtual reality goggles and they put you on a row of Muenster yeah but I can enjoy I can enjoy the what you mean like they put these goggles on okay and then while you're on this rollercoaster you're experiencing things that aren't really there but you explained like you like going through wormholes and you're traveling now you're seeing things happen and I'd have a heart attack that's not something I want to experience I'm glad you talked about anxiety I'm glad you talked about the way you do because I think you've opened it up for a lot of people I think you've get you've made it a subject that's okay to talk about for someone like you mm-hmm like a cool guy it was a smart dude who is successful and talks openly about anxiety and about how it's affected you that's I think that's a you're doing a very big service for that I didn't even know what anxiety was until 2010 because growing up in the environment that I grew up and I just thought all those feelings were normal I thought all those feelings of paranoia you know being anxious all the time like you know and I used to smoke weed so you know you smoke weed and you have a panic attack you just blame it on the weed yeah I remember driving the Burger King one time with two of my homeboys one of them is dead now his name is Terrell rest in peace I'm out my man Zeke and I was high as hell and my steering wheel needed like steering fluid so it was shaking so it was shaking my legs and I'm bugging out just driving the Burger King a two mile ride I'm like yo what do y'all got a drive we're all gonna die right now take the wheel right now I'm gonna crash this motherfucking car tripping the fuck out and they looking at me like no don't let this motherfucker smoke no more but I had nothing to do with the weed it was read probably accentuated though no definitely did because when I have to you know when I find out what anxiety was in 2010 and I didn't stop going to get you know corner therapy ants are like two years ago cuz back in 2010 when I when I got diagnosed with my first panic attack that somebody the doctor was saying hey this is a panic attack I had just gotten fired from radio for the fourth motherfucking time and I was back at home living with my mom and like 31 years old with two-year-old daughter and you know collecting unemployment checks so when I'm having this panic attack and I go to the doctor and he's like yeah your heart is fine you got a perfectly fine heart and you're healthy you got an athlete's heart he was like yo are you stressed about anything I'm like fuck yeah you know so in my mind all I got to do is get me another job get back in position and everything will be okay yeah but when you get back in position and you know you've made more money you've ever made in your life and you got book status selling and TV shows and all of this other shit you still having no same panic attacks you like what the fuck is going on pressure that's it that's exactly what it is pressure you think you're gonna lose everything it's also you experience pressure that most people will never experience because you experience pressure at this this public scale it's not just pressure it's pressure with people's eyes on you and expectations and criticisms and all these different things that the average person is not gonna experience that for millions of people and you do and it's just like it's always on if you're one of those crazy fucks it reads comments good luck at first I used to enjoy cuz I was the guy who came up on YouTube looking at all these WorldStarHipHop conspiracy theories about people and you'd be like oh my god mother fucker sacrifices hamsters and that's how he got successful you think all that shit is cool until you get old and you start seeing things about you and you you laugh at it at first right until you realize like I not he really starting to say some wild shit what was the craziest one that you heard about you I mean for me you know what it is when they tried to meet to the fuck you try to get him out of here you know that's that was that was the most that was the wildest one to me because I was always the president I say Livia truth so nobody can use your truth against you alright so it's not like they brought up anything that I hadn't spoken about numerous times before I written about in my books they just decided to attack oh yeah it can happen it can it so that for me that was like hi this is going too far but then it's like you really can't do anything about it that's the other thing like there's there's no way to fight it once the two phases out of the tube there's no way to put the toothpaste back in the tube yeah so only thing you could do is just either let it consume you and probably ruin you just because you took it all in you just keep it the fuck moving like you how you have to be confident enough to know what's the truth and what's not the true yeah and so now you don't read any comments anymore I don't go on Twitter at all Twitter is too toxic that's it oh yeah we're in verbally abusive relationships with our fucking smartphones yeah I agree yeah it's not it's definitely not healthy you know we were talking about it yesterday me and Duncan Trussell we were saying that it's like your diet like your diet if you take in junk food all the time but eat a bunch of shitty things that are unhealthy it's not good for your body well your mental diet is important too if you're always taking in these toxic arguments and yeah I mean half a Twitter is just people screaming at each other they're just yelling and insulting each other and trying to find ways in this person's being shitty or wrong or negative and it's like that's not real life no the real life that we experience that were designed experiences like this people interacting with it reasonably it's one of the reasons why I think people like podcast so much especially good podcast where people have real conversations is because you go oh okay this is this is this is Vitas resonates with me yeah whereas Twitter does not resonate with Twitter just gets you anxious yes you upset yes conversations where people are actually being nice to each other in person look I don't do podcast over Skype I don't like it I don't want to see you yes I want you to be in the room and I want everyone to know we're gonna be okay you know when you when you have these conversations and people listen to them like just one on one like this or two on one but this this kind of like what we're doing now yeah this makes sense to people yeah that's one of the reasons when I when I'm out and about and you know like I'm at the airport and somebody comes up to me and talked to me I speak to him yeah cuz I feel like that interaction was supposed to happen right yes you know what I mean normal Twitter Instagram I ain't posed to be talking to you on this shit yeah we're not supposed to be human beings are not wired to be that wired no everybody should not have that kind of access to you know so it's just like we got is we got to take back to see the facade fall apart when you respond to one of their tweets like something big fuck you Charlemagne you ain't shit and then you come back why in the bag I'm just playing bro I'm a fan I didn't really know what he said he's always that they're just react could I in my mind if people if you like somebody right you see them you're gonna go up to them and speak to them I just try to gauge things on how I would do it right for example I was on a plane with Steve Nash this morning okay Steve Nash I'm like my she's like oh she wipes my boy he's like oh shit that Steve Nash and I'm like oh shit that Steve I didn't speak this deep did you say hello no nothing no okay I didn't feel it you're not respected right no he's a great player I feel John Stockton that's a little we have to say hi to say what some people you have to say hi to Rachel Dolezal Seattle absolutely where was she shoes I saw her with uh I think she had at least one kid maybe in other words she's just at the airport we're online no TSA PreCheck sexual now she's bought yet you bisexual biracial she's oh no she's not biracial transracial she is black that's both transracial I know but what I'm saying is she's bi so she's straight and gay what the thing yeah but I said hello said what's up amazing forehead one of the best forehead you'll ever see in the game my one order that's what I would even order you want to get the selfie no I saw Jessi Smollett pics room oh my goodness in Lafayette bakery what do you think is gonna happen with them nothing it's amazingly go I think Chicago is coming after all no you think so no didn't they say that they were an item for the money for the money there's no such thing as canceled coaching no more canceled coaches absolute bullshit o oj simpson proved it you know like when Bill Cosby comes home he'll be on the road doing motherfucking stand-up or Kelly's still out his selling shows like Charlie Sheen is still out here flourishing like Charlie Sheen ducked at all wait a minute not all he did get that some say the greatest endorsement deal Magic Johnson ever sign I'm saying we're not gonna act like his career didn't flush bro it looks great take this AIDS you go against a movie theater I was in my car the day they announced on the radio that Magic Johnson had HIV and I was shitting my pants I was like oh my god this is like the beginning of a zombie movie we're all gonna get it if Magic Johnson with all his money and all his fame if he's got it I'm gonna get it we're all gonna get it I was terrified just all I remember in my car driving yeah and then I hear it on the radio Mike holy shit holy shit this is insane thirty years later he looks great he looks amazing it's great he's on TV telling us why he left the motherfucking Lakers a night of the Lakers not once did somebody say yo you imagine got HIV that's all I was thinking about every time see because he looks incredible he does look incredible look incredible yeah it's not even positive and tests anymore wait what yeah I heard that yeah if you give him a test for HIV comes up negative because apparently these protease inhibitors and all these different things that they take - huh - the different medications you don't even test positive for HIV anymore by the way listen it was this older white dude and I forgot what TV show I was on the set of but he was explaining to me uh-huh the whole situation with magic and he was like the reason that they chose magic was because they wanted to erase a lot of these stigmas people thought that HIV and AIDS was a gay disease and they needed like a alpha male I guess the to have it to kind of erase that stigma and to let people know that you can live with it like HIV nights they gave it to him whoa this would he told telling you somebody told me what they said to me was magic I got caught up in some type of scandal underaged right yeah I'm a foot in before the scandal was came out because the person that he was wit was like some allegedly some bigwigs child or something like that and so they said this is what you're gonna do so we don't ruin you mr. Joe before you take this in he believes in Sasquatch believe Sasquatch was real that just started right now on this podcast if I asked him yesterday he did 100% I'm not saying I believe that magic theory I'm just repeating what I was oh that is a common rumor that's out there I've heard that I've heard that rumors right that he doesn't actually have it but that it was either that or but we just got done saying how you read rumors about you that are ridiculous and you go what the fuck and then you realize oh this is what happens people just make shit up and then people repeat the shit that people make up cuz I can't fathom that he beat aids bro aids was bodying people back in the day like mercury Freddie gone yeah who else easy-easy e my downstairs neighbor yes downstairs neighbor no no I had it down for 30 look at him yeah book Charlie Sheen for 350 bucks book him where I cameo oh oh a cameo sunglasses on like what is happening here what is what is he doing yeah this is that he aged very quickly it's like see he seemed to be fine when he was doing two and a Half Men when he stopped doing that show he gauged like a hundred years old he had HIV we don't know how its effects - I forgot exactly everybody everybody's not Magic Johnson here okay I'm saying that by the way that is why I say magic is like the greatest NBA player of all time what because of that he played 13 seasons in the NBA went to nine NBA Finals won five of them one in college came in won his rookie year and went one-on-one with HIV and fucking one destroyed he destroyed the stigma of HIV definitely did anybody that catches HIV right now the first thing you're gonna say to yourself is give me a magic stuff I can live through anything at Magic matey yeah he's okay and by the way what's worse herpes all over your dick for life not that it comes back and forth but it's always there the open blisters forever forever or having HIV definitely their herpes it's worse cuz HIV they could basically cure it mady's are pees on your dick forever meaning those blisters don't go away you can't even fuck it'll hurt no way nobody's saying that you get it dude a type of like real hardcore herpes they never go away they're just always they have one that doesn't go away now hypothetically would you ever see the Damon Wayans bit about magic when magic came back to the NBA no no nobody wanted to block him oh yeah but Dennis Rodman Dennis robbers like fuck y'all spit in your mouth and accelerate a goatman he's one of the greatest of all time enough credit is we had that we had to actually delete a Damon Wayans joke from The Breakfast Club because I used to play like you know you know you have that plays the loop yeah I had to delete it wants to meet - times up Erica can you say it I mean I'll say it yeah yeah Damon way Damon Wayans was on The Breakfast Club and he was talking about the Bill Cosby situation he just goes yo man have you seen the women that are accusing Bill Cosby they're all under a pible Damon Wayans that there's like you know I mean for the fences always have she doesn't give a fuck man to bite what we do so that's it for somebody else where's Dennis Rodman said I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate your symptoms bro think about what Karl Malone think about Karl Malone everybody right now Karl Malone will get so much flak for this what do you say but in the 90s what he said made sense Oh none of us really knew what hiv/aids walleteer everybody said would you say Oh about playing basketball with him like what if I hit him in he starts bleeding and he gives me like but that was when a lot of people were thinking sure how could you be mad at him for not knowing for being angry about mosquitoes remember that yes I do what about mosquitoes I mean yeah that's reasonable though right I think works with Ebola and they can give you earlier or some shit or malaria why can't they give you some HIV wrote reason to be we've to be is somebody said you can't get it in your mouth I thought that's what propaganda like you can't get it in your mouth when someone comes in your mouth did you just put it up all the mosquitoes are carriers of yellow fever dengue fever Japanese Emperor and sinful itis encephalitis there's no evidence of mosquitoes can transmit HIV studies with HIV have shown clearly the virus disappears the mosquito after about one to two days yeah but what if that shit bites you and then bites you bro look at that last line I've never heard it described like that the time required for them to skeeto to digest a blood meal Jesus Christ the only one talk about vampires like that the blood meal so that means if they get someone who's got HIV and then they get to you within one to two days doesn't that seem like it would get you well that's all I'm saying it's it's a reasonable thing to ask these are reasonable things now I have to worry about you like that I'm married well the real fear is pandemic diseases how about the game yes fucking we're talking about you're on the beach and influence and dude with the Charlie Sheen's next to yous bitten spitting in your mouth yeah just some tiger blood no Charlie had a moment a moment moment when he should know sound - I don't believe you winnin bro dude you know I don't matter the difference between magic and Charlie I don't think Charlie was ever cool to anybody because we Alan wanted we wanted to be magic at some point in our lives everybody want to be Magic Johnson's live show know what fixed at those Russell Peters fixed that what Russell Peters fixed it because he went with him so what what happened was Charlie was trying to do it by himself and really didn't have anything to say and people get bored after a while they would boo him and like he was like oh fuck you I have your money and he's like a bunch of dumb shit cuz he tried to do this live tour but he didn't plan it out right so then we did is he brought Russell Peters with him so Russell who's the best at work in the crack life he could just make something out of nothing right so Russell just got him to talk and then Russell would start talking shit and making fun and someone would say something Russell incorporate that and Russell treated it like a comedy show and turned it into something that was actually good I see him live Russell's there so it's gonna be good because Russell's the right Russell's gonna handle it and turn into funny Charlie just did a podcast yeah yeah hi Cass back then and nobody cared about podcast it was early have some stories oh dude oh yeah those crack stories in the doors be willing to tell him though oh he's telling you I've already got AIDS what's worse well you remember when he was on television he was talking about just smoking rocks yeah so all this and the people like what yeah what are you saying but did that excite people in 2019 like we've seen all the crackheads no back then it was the right window of time yeah it was like him coming through and just being unapologetic about doing drugs and and you don't pay huggers to fuck you you pay him illegally if you kind of shit him saying it was unapologetic and that's why it resonated and that's also why no one could get him with like a me-too thing it's like but he gonna say course he'll tell you what he did first of all no woman is gonna say he slept at home you're sure yeah maybe he did that to protect himself if you just got AIDS real quick says every time the girl leaves the house oh by the way positive oh she's really nice to them they like him they don't want to fuck him throw him under the bus some some guys are likely old like that Drake no I don't know about Drake Derek Jeter Oh Gina was giving out gift bags baby yeah you know saying can you imagine the number one that came out he was giving signed baseballs yeah think about how many guys have gotten a signed baseball from their girlfriends as a gift think about what was going through their heads when they read the post that moment and there's this sign Derek Jeter baseball dude no other girls might have but he was just nice to me he's a gentleman but what you gotta earn that gift back Oh Joe what Joe saying is very true to that's why I always it like when I see dudes still treating women like shit in 2019 like get fucking him and kicking him out the room oh my god I'm not answering the phone for after foot I'm like you're wily you should be treating her with the utmost respect and being extremely nice cuz you just never know uber she's your friend oh yeah she should be yeah she should be your friend like I don't understand why guys like I say this long time laughs they were calling women bitches summer bitches bitches I like it in a positive way like check this bad bitch out yes that's okay some of them are just old school bitches though there's some bitches where it's like you're saying in a derogatory way like you could say it in a positive way you're laughing about it or you could say it in derogatory way yeah sometimes I'll say in a derogatory way as a man yeah 20 19 no what about twat I'm W that ever what about cunt now I've never used cunt he got in trouble for using the word cunt I did in trouble yeah trouble you get but you got outraged yeah yeah I'm gonna ask you this first of all I think what you're doing with YouTube is genius it's brilliant you're the first comic to really capitalize on using you to you know Netflix do you want to give you a special look fuck I don't need you let me do this it'll get more views and it has and it's been amazing it's been beautiful to watch but are you experience of the popularity increase are you experiencing some pushback on some of your material because you go hard well the weirdest thing no it's like we've curated an expectation for it mmm so the people that are going there are waiting for it it's not people who like got free tickets right a funny bones website I know what you do think they're there for it they go there and watch you talk about eating ass to eat an ass I was just talking about this one on a pot on the other day but like you're just talking about how privileged you have to be to eat ass because think about all the third world countries but they can't even eat food we're so full in a minute Republic you can't have a fucking cocktail or it up without almost dying you think they're eating ass in American we're so full we got so many choices that we choose to eat ass dude for fun yeah but bro I'm telling you they're not it's pretty pretty amazing they're all leaning into it and I think that people have had enough with the PC shit so they'd really like to see the fact that this is out there and I mean we're posting you know I'll tell you one thing the Joe Rogan effect we used to do a million views a week on my youtube channel I came on here two million now doubled that's crazy double I'll see what happens now why maybe we'll see it was nothing Charlamagne effect in there well we do a pocket I mean but the channel exists because of the Charlamagne effect my channel we're putting the brilliant idiots about videos idiots videos out every week on the channel like without him that channel doesn't exist I mean like you two guys I swear to god have the biggest influence on the market and it's like he gave me this opportunity to have all these people view and I was able to put the stuff out and luckily they liked it but the same thing happened here we just doubled up again I mean it's crazy that it's all dependent upon generosity and being a fan cuz that's what I do I mean when I'm talking to a scientist or talking to you yeah I'm a fan yeah I'm interested I'm curious and it's not like you're putting on some fuck shit right now say like Andrews funny he's been funny for the exact years so now everybody else is actually realizing what we all knew already yeah and the limitations of like those platforms putting you on like Netflix or HBO or something like that that doesn't exist anymore and it's not you you're not playing your whole game like you know that you go you go getting those systems and they teach you out just to shoot three-pointers yeah you know saying instead of like fucking cultivating your whole game that's why you know ruining it I love Britney it is I tried not to promote movies I know it sounds crazy right Nobuko this is interesting good and the reason I do is because I love our audience I love that group of people who come to listen to us every week they know that we just out here saying some wild shit not even on purpose just because we're we're trying to get ideas out and we're just talking through things it's when you bring those Outsiders in who here you don't know any context to nothing take that little piece out of context give it to the rest of the world now the rest of the world is outraged we and that's got to come over here any fucking way right we want to be wild we want a place let's talk about that because where do you think that's going like the way is an outrage culture reached full outrage it's coming back we turned it around I agree I'm turning around you know what made me think about that two situations in the past two weeks okay remember the first one but the Whoopi Goldberg one from yesterday with Bella Thorne I didn't hear when Bella Thorne she took some nude pictures somebody was gonna expose him so she just shared him herself first so I think somebody hacked her out hacked her cloud somebody like your cloud they're trying to say hey we're gonna put this out unless you give us money or some shit she's like fuckin i'ma put my own shit on Twitter yeah so Whoopi Goldberg gets on a train it will set of juggernaut my name is it lovely Whoopi gets on the viewer what look it's 2019 when you take pictures they go up to the cloud hackers can hack you so don't take pictures yeah she's like it's just common sense like it's not it's not worth it just don't take the pictures hey I was like oh your victim shaming but I thought that I thought that was what the outrage was gonna be it wasn't it was like oh shit whooping you're talking super common sense now Bella came out and said she was being a victim shame but the general public on social media was like so y'all oh man it would be for talking common sense and I was like oh shit if you can't say its victim shaming if she's correct because we are moving into an era where all information is gonna be available to everybody I think that's that's gonna be a thing that we're gonna have to overcome the privacy is going out the window done it's not gonna exist anymore like what our expectations of privacy are so much different than people that lived in our parents age well our kids it's gonna be even less and then their kids non exist they didn't even know FDR was crippled that's right FDR was crippled yeah see they didn't know he would literally hold himself up at the podium I think he got polio or some shit right so he was paraplegic right and but the press respected his role as president and they respected his privacy I mean he had side bitches he had all this shit going on and he was just stand up at the podium holding himself up whenever you were talking everything else besides that they kind of roll him around but the people didn't know cuz there wasn't this access oh I want us to get back the line each other think about it used to be a time where you didn't know what somebody's religion was we didn't know what somebody's political views were like you didn't like nobody knew like you just went you present it and you went the fuck home I think we need to get back to that well I think it's too much motherfucking so every small truth get back in the closet not just with your guys just what else get back to bullshit me today yeah just get back to bullshitting each other because guess what remember I used to say you don't want the truth cuz you can't handle the truth that dis era the world cannot handle truth that's why anyone tell us about UFOs what we think is happening with UFOs they won't tell us that UFOs exist because if they told us that UFOs exist motherfuckers would probably go crazy when the reality is we really probably need to know UFOs exist because it would humble the fuck out of everyone well that's the only time we get or right like in every movie right the only time Russia and China and America get on a conference call is when bro movies aliens are coming up the movies Ronald Reagan said that in a speech in the 80s Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev why to fuck a we beefin because one day we might be we might have an extraterrestrial threat and then we got to come together and everybody was like what the fuck is Ronald Reagan talking about look quickly we would put aside our differences we were three faced faced with an a threat from an alien world and everybody was like what does he know yeah I would respect I'm gonna find out tonight I would respect your prejudice if aliens came hold on oh my god okay all right hey you know it's true if I you know it's real it is real I really don't have no choice but to respect you mmm Johnny we're I think we're getting to the end of outrage I always culture I think he was almost over we had we put on a clip this last week of there was his kid in the front row in a wheelchair heckling me and went back and forth and initially I put it out like a fuck what's gonna happen am I gonna have these like you know people rolling up to my shows and like fucking polite you handled it really well he was also a special kid yeah he had something you know people have it you remember around people and they just have a fucking yeah like they have a clique you know who has it ari Ari Ari Shaffir he has this fucking I don't there's something I just when I'm around I just like him I just kind of wanted to tell me his opinions on shit he's asked him yeah how do you feel about carpets and he'll just fucking tell you how they I'm dumb whatever so it's like he just had this thing needs such positive energy and I'm making fun of a guy from fucking being in a wheelchair and he's making fun of me for having a shitty upper body and like literally I go to him I was like I said you know your upper body's pretty good and he goes what's your Excuse like quick and we had this moment and no backlash yeah the thing was cool no backlash should matter except for the guy in the wheelchair right if everybody else is like wow a lot of fuck are you picking on him the guy in the wheelchair don't care and the guy in the wheelchair is going back and forth why the fuck are you just never people that have it and there are always parents of people that have things like when there is this person has a seizure and in one of my videos everybody who had seizures was cool with it it was always a parent of a kid who had a seizure who was like my son suffers from how dare you wouldn't a clip up like that so it's always a fence on behalf of because I really think that people who suffer for things they went through way harder things in a joke yeah and they actually like that they're being spoken to as a regular person in the audience not babied like every other part of their life when can I get the door for you can I get it yeah yeah it's like they all right for the first time I'm in it I don't pose I won't poster like make jokes or talk shit about something that I wouldn't want to happen to me or somebody I love though right I can handle right you know saying yeah like hiv/aids I don't want it I wouldn't trip to I mean it's not what we used to think it was so it's a different thing yeah do you know what bug catchers are yeah that's a book around fucking people who have they try to get it yeah there's a bunch of guys the gay community we're trying to get a chariot yeah that's like a crow yeah hold on self load they're people that wanted to get HIV and this is back in the day where it was a death sentence there was a lot of guys who were doing that hold on their goal their goal yeah they would try they would put out ads like Craigslist looking for hiv-positive guys to give me the bug this is why cults happen cuz people need to be part of something there it's like in them some people are just broken exactly cuz I heard about that 20 years ago and I thought that was crazy but not and I'm thinking about it I'm like what was their life like yeah I need to know what their life was like if they had something to lose the day was actually successful would they be doing that yeah I didn't know what kind of people were out there trying to catch dis bulk this every every step in the spectrum of crazy you you think about it and there's a whole fuckin category of people that are doing that so bug catching was one of them like it was a big thing guys were like actively going out and trying and guys who had HIV we're trying to go give it to people yeah that's why I did thing with Kama I don't even necessarily believe in calm anymore because every day of our life we're trying to avoid crazy right yeah but you can't you know say when a guy comes in with a gun and he shoots up a motherfucking school yeah like what are we supposed to do we didn't do anything to cause that but he's got something going on with his life right that caused him to snap and it affected us like if you're walking down the street and you know a guy's just angry about something he bumps into you and you're like oh excuse me fuck you mean excuse me and he's ready to fight I don't got nothing to do with you right I've got everything to do with him so you really can't avoid this crazy yeah exists I had a conversation with someone they were talking about like everything in your life you have manifested and created I go okay explain babies who get shot in drive-bys or shut the fuck up yeah there's random things that happened yeah kids get leukemia what would they do something bad yeah come on I use it's bigger than you that's a thing with people hated him we are a very small part of this big fucking ecosystem right we really think that everything in our life is that important that it could affect the world get the fuck out of here some Chinese random factors why cuz you know you think about the secret like the law of attraction your thumbs become things I think the thing that we forget about that is not only do our it's not just our thoughts it's our actions you know I'm saying it's not like you're just sitting around you didn't think you didn't sin trying to think about doing this yeah you actually put in some fucking work that's the difference between the secret and reality is that people think that you think things into existence but no when you're successful and people say what did you do well I thought this into existence it's show me how you did that well I got up every morning at 6:00 a.m. I fucking hustle to the gym and then I wrote jokes all day a you go Lizzy bitch did this in the work yeah yeah but in the work it's like it's like literally if somebody says you hate one day you're gonna win the lottery so you're gonna sit at home right all day waiting to win the lottery get up and go to the fucking store and buy a Powerball ticket you know I think Chappelle had that joke he's like you don't think they're starving kids in Africa thinking about food nice roast beef sandwich I ain't coming exact now don't get me wrong it's plenty of things that I've thought about that I've manifested but like you said I took the steps to go put in the like his focus there's a process discipline I got this theory called putting the weed in the bag you know I'm saying and it came from the movie belly because neither DMX was sitting at this table with these two young kids and they were bagging up the weed and all the kids like I got thinking money what y'all got to ain't get money and team X is like put the weed in the back first then go out there and get money you have to go through the process yeah so I can start with a thought yeah you still gotta execute hmm put some fucking work in I remember I was talking to this girl she was a friend of a friend of mine and she was telling me how I found the secret and my life is gonna be amazing now and I'm gonna I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna meet the right man never does okay and then I ran into her like a year later she came to one of my comedy shows and I'm like how's everything going she's like I don't get it I've been using the secret she was a sweetheart of a person but she really believed that her life was gonna transform I'll never forget the juxtaposition of those two conversations that's why that's why the positions that we're in and media you have to be very responsible with these positions Malcolm X said that Malcolm X said the person who control the media controlled the monitor the masses so you have to be very very responsible well I remember when you used to get a lot of flack for putting on just different voices that people who didn't agree with yeah why are you giving these people a platform platform I'm like yo everybody deserves to be heard yeah I guess something not everybody but just I want to know how people think too I want if I don't agree especially people you don't again the conversation isn't a cosign and I think that's what we we often mistake well in this day and age to was especially on the left as so many people are talking about deep platforming you know 2d platform people I don't like they know I thought I don't like that you might get either I thought people getting mad Allah volleyball this week you know I'm saying cuz the comments he made the molle on ESPN which I didn't he just was like she was like hey let's shift gears like you can shift gives me any time but we didn't he said it just like that you should bring news I didn't say you nitwit was a placeholder right if she had said hey let's switch it up he would say hey you switch but every people's like already need to stop putting them on ESPN I'm like wait a minute huh literally just last year y'all he was the drunk uncle at the picnic right you love him or hate him he's good entertainment but that now because he said that you want to take him off and I'm like we got to stop doing that because guess what every single one of us is going to say something that is going to offend somebody at some point yeah yeah that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a platform I'm not calling for nobody to get killed it also makes things fun when people say stupid shit 10 times you know when Stephen Smith was going off about and ruies winning the title it was like butter bean this is a disgrace there was man like the guy is speaking the way he would speak if you were around him yeah do you got appreciate that unless you want everybody to be Ryan Seacrest you should fucking apprecia not there's anything wrong Ryan Seacrest but you should appreciate someone who's just given you what they really think yes why don't we do that's why he's so popular yeah we pretend to hate it right but the reality is we're gonna keep listening the secondly it's a ruse also attention a lot of people that's some America feeds off additional Trump is president yeah that's what the crashes are still viable was the first family okay drama every year every year they find a new piece of trauma no shit gets calm and cool the show ends so they need a new piece of drama Oh whoo you got cheese on this here who's gonna have a baby you gonna need a baby but whatever it is every year eight you're gonna chop your dick off but you know respect her for with Kim she is getting people out of jail she's going for it I can go back before they I respect the Kardashians because if we really really pay attention to the Kardashians over the past ten years first of all you got to put them up there with some of the greatest dynasties of all time this is Lakers this is Patriots this is fucking they've made billions yes billions with a B so yes so many social conversations have started because of the Kardashians you talking about interracial relationships you're talking about the transgender thing you're talking about jobs mental health with condoms yeah plastic surgery they did change the shape of American women they changed absolutely they changed essences they made that whole fat relocation thing popular they suck it out of your waist turn your waist in this little thing and turn your ass into this ridiculous platform look before okay Kim but Kim learn that from black women though good people forget but that's a pile of the women that you would look at someone who really has it yeah it's different yeah you will see a woman who has a big ass naturally it looks like it belongs on yes it's a different thing yeah yeah yeah they have thick legs right they're there they're fucking genetically superior built like a turkey they built sexy Kimber's inspiration you know people don't remember Kim came up in the black circuit right she did King magazine and smooth that's right he that's right that's right Wendy Williams radio show orally oh that's what I'm better I'm better when I was doing radio with women he knew her before she was ever on anything when she was who's who's assistant some of this is Paris organize closets for Paris Hilton I got an old picture like me and Kim from like to the Avenue different yeah but I will say she always had that vision she used to always say I'm gonna do what Paris is doing times 100 Wow mother fucking did it the secret because it used to be the kiss of death of a girl did porn that was the end Lisa and yeah she was the one to break that down well what's it to her jenna jameson I think jenna jameson was the first one to become actually popular outside of porn oh I thought you meant like the first person to break like the racial barrier employ oh yes you want therapist she was the first to bleach the racial but I mean doing porn periods oh yeah that where you could be up where you could be a celeb outside and you talk about radio it's not too many people that came up off the Liberty sex tapes between that really popped off yeah who made it office acts do you remember when girls were jamming obviously they were showing their pussy on purpose just happened to be down with fuck did you not know that camera was down near your pussy they set that up that's a lot of confidence today were climbing out of your cars showing their pussy yeah not a lot of which fingers Joe what is happening that's all the more reason you got a real MK bro that girl that was hopping on a cause and you could see her vagina sex tapes is out here getting prisoners free is doing that I don't give a fuck yeah I don't know the fuck if she's best friends with Donald Trump yeah right if you care about prison reform care about criminal justice reform yes you should be happy that these people are getting out yeah if you're worried about oh she's doing it in the White House with Donald Trump the guy who just did 15 years right nothing cares what President Lincoln Mauser and what she doesn't have to do this right she could just be buying cars and getting her nails done she's choosing to spend her time to get these people that are unjustly accused and and convicted and get them released and that and Trump like him or not he's listening to her and he's helping her and that but you know why because he's a celebrity he understands the angle yeah so you keep saying all these politicians to talk to uh celebrities yes that shit goes over his hey you gotta send another celebrity to get in his ear yeah cuz he understand that type of line he understands their power he understands where their reach is he knows that Kim K doing something is way more valuable than some random you know Democratic Congress person well you're seeing that so much now you look at Capitol Hill the past few weeks you see you know I was there meet me TI and David gross was there talking about opportunities on legislation I was there with taraji talking about bringing social-emotional learning in schools in therapy you had a time he see Coates and Danny Glover was dead as week talking about HR 40 you had john stewart there talking about the victims of 9/11 now be compensated by the way the 9/11 shit i don't even know that was going on bro if jon stewart hadn't done that that would i would have never even known that was going on and that is fucked up and it was a simple statement the people you said you would never forget you forgot anybody can get that you can be with no teef sitting in fuckin South Carolina in a trailer park you understand if you understand that like Jon Stewart doesn't have to do that it doesn't do that because he needs to it's in him yeah it gives you a different sense of purpose yeah like that's what really means something when you talk to me about talking about anxiety and mental health like the past couple years I feel like I've been walking in my purpose you know because I truly feel like if we can get more people to deal with their mental health issues you'll reduce so much of the other bull shit we complaining about in America the violence the gun shootings because when you got a bunch of people who have never dealt with their trauma I never dealt with their pain and their hurt hurt people hurt people yeah and all we do is go around redistribute in that pain the others you think murderers and rapists do that she could put it thrill of it no they are broken damaged people so they go and break in damage other people yes so if you can get people to deal with their mental health issues man that's the foundation of it all to me that's the real secret getting through to that shit yeah there is a thing about about purpose that like what happens I think when when some people reach financial independence and I mean like fuck you money meaning like you don't have to work anymore your family good everything that's good yeah you have some people go well I'm gonna get even more money and I'm gonna become a billionaire and a trillionaire whatever and then some people go I'm gonna live life instead of survive it or if you're working every week so you can get a paycheck there's absolutely nothing wrong with that doesn't majority of people are well you are surviving yes it that that that job is no different than being out there in the forest trying to find some foods you can either get some shelter you get financial dependents you have the opportunity to truly do whatever you want every single day with your life yes and some people go you know what I want to do I want to go to fucking DC and help out with these causes or I want to put on a whole comedy community you know I mean and like you really put it on your back I want to help other people out I want to have these conversations and just talk shit about you know fucking magic have an HIV whatever it is we're actually choosing to do the things that we enjoy because you realize what's important like you know when you're talking about something like opportunities on legislation I feel like that goes hand in hand with mental health because the environment is so important so if you can you know get into these these communities these poor and disenfranchised there is and you can start putting things in these communities that people actually need like in the hood you replace the liquor stores and the fucking chicken spots in the check cashing places which you know juice bars and mental health spas and you know wellness centers things that people actually need now you're creating an environment where people can thrive in instead of just trying to fucking survive in yeah you know saying you can't properly deal with your mental health you trying to survive every fucking day but I think what you're doing is very important is you're bringing up that conversation that conversation wasn't taking place before the mental health conversation about xiety amongst cool successful people it just wasn't happening everybody was pretending everybody was there they're hiding from it you keep secrets like yeah you got the float tank and you fucking compound yeah you telling people about it oh yeah okay the reasons why that thing became popular yeah I I got one in 2002 Wow yeah I did they for the first time like two weeks ago yeah man if you go to some float places they'll ask you how you found out about it it's like did you find out from the internet yelp and then they'll say Joe Rogan that's why I wanted the because I talk about it so much as videos I mean I gave one away I gave one oh I had bought a new one I said I'm gonna give one away and I just got random emails and I picked one of them had it sent to this guy's house had it set up I just because I wanted people to know about what these things are I've never felt stillness like I felt inside a floatation yeah that's amazing and it's like you know at first you'd like okay we want you to get butt-naked you know and you know the fuck's going you know saying and then you're like nah that's computing a lot of confidence in your cock I wasn't even swing an idea I'm a grower not a shower my shit is like no bro I can't be sorry I actually would try to make it a little chubby just in case you can't trust these peopie don't know record me in this shit so the lights went off and it's like when you first get in its allowing yourself to relax because at first you're fighting it a little bit you got your head up you like I don't know from a drown yeah when you finally just relax you know you don't even know what fucking I won't win right and I've never experienced the level of students like that it was point it was period where I thought I was actually I'm like I'm alive right now because your eyes are open but it's totally done it's totally ducts you don't know if you're really sleep and you don't know feel the water you don't feel the water you don't know if you're in and out of consciousness it's it's - it's Wow everybody should do fluid there yeah guys what is the hardest part about having influence that's a nice pregnant pause I was dope right then the clock was going like well-timed yeah I don't know what's the hardest I don't think about it that way I think it's you're very there's it's very there's very few people that you have the opportunity to have the kind of influence that you or I have or you it's it's it's very very strange I think you've got to realise what harm you can do you got to be careful and the kind of things you say are the kind of things you promote you know the kind of things that you sign off on or agree to and I think there's also a responsibility to tell people about cool shit tell people of things that have benefited you to help tell people about how you've overcome your own personal mistakes I think all those things are very important yeah I never I never even thought about having influence until like the past three four years because you know I'm just out here doing my thing just doing it but then when you really when you realize you are having influence and a lot of that influence could be negative yeah that's when you realize like oh shit let me make sure I'm doing the right things with these platforms you know I mean let me make sure I'm bringing on the right voices that people can learn from let me make sure I'm telling people about the things in my life that are making me a better person so for me it's like the best compliment I get nowadays and people say man you've really grown like you've you've really evolved like like as visible people can see it yeah that right there lets me know I'm putting out the right energy into the equals yeah and also people become inspired to seek that same kind of path when someone in the public eye like yourself and they see you grow and expand and change your views on things it also inspires other people to open up themselves and change their own perspective and enhance their own way of looking at the world yeah I said a lot of fucked up watch you're going live on the air you're not reading a script right no you're free balling it's gonna happen Annie and I think the worst thing that can happen too is like for me you know Breakfast Club has only been going off in nine years so I never had experienced this level of attention and you know you start reading things about yourself in the media like you read real articles like oh the hip-hop Howard Stern and I'm like oh so I got to be like Howard so I gotta get more that shit so what Howard dough right cuz I'm giving a little bit at night how would do y'all know so it's just like you can get caught up in that ya know you could get caught up in what people's expectations of you are yeah change you know a lot of people say that happens to certain comedians they become their character dice dice yeah I was gonna bring up his name's Andrew silverstein dot the dice man whose character yeah that he would do in his bit he would do he was doing a routine where he would be John Travolta he would do a Sylvester Stallone and then he would do this character called the dice man and that part was so funny and so good it took over his whole act yeah I went toe-to-toe with dad one time toe-to-toe yeah on Wendy Williams Show back in the day when I was Wendy's a sidekick and you know Wendy vh1 Wendy had a show on vh1 and Andrew Dice Clay had a song on vh1 so they bought him wanting to promote it and like we just ended up going I don't know why the fuck me and it was happen on each other yes and like vh1 edited it to make it look like he like kind of fucked me up but they kept a couple of mine in he was really upset like I called him I said you like a fat Fonzie fucking living I'm like oh shit it's on it's on laugh at that I thought it was funny I would've been allowed with that if I looked like a fat Fonzie bug Oh [Music] continued terminate a model but what you said is real good I never want to become a character chill my yeah yeah and I feel like it was a certain point in my life where I was becoming a character of myself and it's like that's not real like you can't claim claim to be a real person and be out here pretending to be real you either really you not yeah and what's real is yo being honest about going to a therapist what's really being honest about your mental health issues was really talking about being a father like that got real shit like yeah you can't always be try to be cool yes that's not cool that's fake and that only existed when there was like some sort of your pride projecting something you're putting something out there in these small bits when you're doing what you do and you're talking for hours and hours on got to be you got to be you you at the end of the day it's gonna come out whether you like it or nothing anymore there are and people with the longest careers I feel like are the people who evolved born time right yeah you could see the guys who have real growth like Howard Stern in the beginning when we really think about Howard like chicks were queefing on speakers oh yeah that was a normal thing in a Howard Stern radio show is come in who has the loudest queef on the speaker they're lucky that Tiffany Haddish wasn't around back then oh it would be over a cannon sound it doesn't make sense she's like large shit midgets into the fucking atmosphere well yeah she used to do that all the time she would quit fucking what she's shameless doesn't give a fuck that the equivalent of a guys do fucker like on comedy Letus approach to commie it's quite interesting somewhat be like didn't he likes bars he says he likes jokes he doesn't like school fucking mmm still fucking if it's the right bit can be funny really it has to be the right it has to be a real comic with a real reason to fuck that stool there has to be something to it trying to think Eddy fuck this tool bro see I like Eddie I like Richard I like Chris Rock bless you election well you know I'm saying I like that I like those guys that actually don't say just say something yes like have something and have something to say louis c.k has to say yeah like I want I like people to have something to say all that stool fucking is the thing and I want to get him on stage I think he could do it oh you never I would never disrespect the craft like that well you wouldn't have to disrespect it you just have to want to do it and then try it yeah I don't want to do it I think we do it for fun I do it if you don't want to do it don't do it but you could do it I tried one weekend and my first joke was like you know what
