I think that would pan out I had a similar idea Anthony cumin yeah we're alive sir I love it Joe Rogan if it was not for you oh my god this this would not exist which is insane that is a hundred percent actual fact I was watching you doing live from the compound me and Brian Redman were sitting in my fucking living room and we were watching you while you were fucking playing karaoke you're singing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen I was like this guy this guy just set up his own studio like he already has Opie and Anthony show at the time you guys were at Sirius XM yeah and he just decided to do this thing in your basement just for a goof yeah it was like a hobby it's like guys who don't have kids married who not married don't have kids don't have anybody telling them what to do and they also have disposable income didn't you get to see what guys really want to do they want to sing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen yes it was great crazy gun guy karaoke so I could do that if I was married I would have a wife that would lose her mind at my living room like my living room table that you're supposed to have a candle on and little tchotchkes and stuff is a widescreen computer monitor and a gaming system right next to the table I have a gaming computer that's just unbelievable and I sit there and just play video games so the table itself is a gaming monitor yeah the whole tape well it is one of those touchscreen ones no it's it's a giant wide monitor it's like like 40 inches wide so that's the table no it's on the table yeah the tables big heavy metal thing but but it's just everything there's VR goggles up on the console by the TV it's just sensors around the room for the VR it's a a playground and you're absolutely right guys will spend their money on having fun if allowed to that's what this place is this place is insane you know this is my house you go to my house it's my wife's house see that's how it works have one elk head on the wall that's all I have that's all you're allowed I laugh at guys when they have the the man cave like dude come on down to the man cave the chicks aren't allowed down here the TV that and I'm like no her place is the whole house she relegated you to one room a guy and you're happy about it you're happy that you got one room happy wife happy life that's apparently it didn't work didn't work for me you know the Thoreau quote that I say way too many times in this podcast but I love the quote most men live lives of silent desperation Wow yeah it that is true it's a hundred percent true it was I was married for a time and it was it was a nightmare it was a living hell for me the only thing that got me through as many years as I was married because I was married nine years and I don't remember one happy year out of those nine but I had gotten into radio pretty early on in that marriage and that was my life so I dedicated myself no matter how miserable anything else in my life was I was doing radio so I I thought it was awesome I have a theory about that I really do I think that a person needs a certain amount of suffering in their life and if you look at some of the all-time great comics or even all-time great radio personalities like Howard Stern yeah Howard Stern during his heyday when he was the fucking man was miserable and right right he would talk about it he would hide in his basement a long story lies like here's this guy he's the you know the biggest radio personality ever he's he's huge and yet he's gotta hide and he's just talking about masturbating and hiding from his wife and he can't get any sex and you're like it didn't matter if he was huge didn't matter for his famous didn't matter how rich he was didn't matter yeah he's just hiding in the basement and that angst came out on the radio like you related to him you understood it yeah yeah I I I get that and it worked for me because there was a lot of misery like when I started doing really well we moved back to New York from from Boston after we got fired opening myself you got fired for saying that the mayor died yeah yeah it was an April Fool's gag and because we always thought the the radio April Fool's jokes were so stupid and okey and yeah well we changed the format to all Elvis and it's like after ten minutes they say April Fool's so we're like let's just go balls out and say the mayor's dead and have a news guy come on and report it and everything and then it was supposed to subsequently get more outrageous as the the the show went on so by the end of it there was a Taiwan male hooker in the car with him and they crashed because he was getting a blow job as a like it was gonna get really ridiculous but they stopped it early on and never allowed us to even mention it so people really thought he died although it's kind of stupid you go to the ona show for your news but back then the internet wasn't what it is now exactly yeah was it even it was barely a thing it was barely a thing cuz that was 90 97 around there 98 what year did you get on your probably earlier I was on really early like the 80s I was on bulletin board servers and used to play trivia games with a 300 baud modem with people and I thought it was amazing even then and then in in the when we were up in Boston I bought a digital camera that was just this giant thing and I had a laptop another giant thing and I would take pictures of what was going on in the studio and then post them that night on a website that I figured out I used to code the HTML myself and make a website just to post pictures and links and people thought it was amazing like you're seeing what we talked about that day it wasn't instant but it was pretty cool and then I started doing videos I was able to put video like maybe eight second clips of nude girls if they were in the studio and pop that up and people loved it and then I got a bill from the the company for bandwidth and I didn't know bandwidth it was a twelve thousand dollar bill for a month yeah yeah cuz I think there was no there was no compression or anything I'm pumping video out to thousands of people uncompressed and apparently they had that happen a couple of times so they told I just don't do it again they didn't make me pay which was pretty cool Wow but at that point I had to learn about you know coding and a compression and things like that so you just kept doing it and just just put them in some sort of a compress for me yeah yeah would you uh would you used your member back oh god I think it was like four audio it was real audio which was hilarious player real audio player would pop up and then for video god I can't even remember what it was but it was terrible it was all pixelated you know like ten frames per minute because weird the things like real audio which was everywhere just yeah they just quit yeah they gave up around still and listen they changed into something else you know or got bought out by something up yeah yeah yeah that happens to everything but honestly if it was not for you and your show live from the competent and 400 P and a hilarious because Opie and Anthony was the first radio show that I really realized you don't really have to have a format yeah you just talk yeah it was just kind of a talk thing there was a hang it was a hang and a lot of the we were on the same company it was the same company as Howard Stern Studios radio look at that real still here it says it makes stories from your videos and photos now but this is exactly what it is it's real it's a real player automatically makes video stories from your best photos sorry automatic - yeah used to be a good way to watch porn with weird codecs when porn had a weird codex you know like who have fucking who compiled it yeah and you'd get it you'd watch it unreal player like we get porn from BitTorrent yeah yeah and then sometimes you wouldn't have anything on your computer to play it what's a codec not available yeah exactly hissed off because you like the fine nail fuck yeah it's like no that thumbnail was awesome I got to see this I remember the first time I ever got a porn video sent to me I was like this is crazy yeah yeah watch a porn video before it was just photos the photos were insane because I I guess it was around the mid-90s my brother had picked up a an Apple computer I don't even know what model it was or anything but it was it was pretty good for the time and I just sat in front of that thing for hours and hours on end just one porn pick it was no videos just pictures and you know how they used to scroll sometimes it was a corrupt file so halfway down it would just turn white yeah and pixelated in zigzaggy but just four hours just one more one more one more it would slowly emerge it was very very compelling yeah you'd sit there just waiting seedy printers faster now yeah that it was downloading photos on a 14k modem yeah yeah it's insane to think the technology end of it because you got thumb drives with more memory than entire computers had just a few years ago and and I remember I guess it was Bill Gates or something said you'll you'll never need anything more powerful than a 486 years ago and it's like but a couple of Meg's of memory and just crazy the demand for a computer power got way out of hand well especially with games and stuff yeah I'm a huge game you got now you download a game like Red Dead Redemption - or Call of Duty and and it's 75 to 100 gigs really those games yeah and it's like that would have would have been a hundred computers okay and to think of those floppy disks used to get games on yeah it would've been a pallet stacked up like six feet high of those disks to load it on a computer so like the old doom game yeah make those sounds and hopefully it would work and yeah now you just download them I haven't been to a gaming store in years cuz with origin or Steam you just download the game right off your uh offline and emption - you just download it you just download it like I don't know who goes to Game Stop ring thing anymore people still do though I mean there's one of them all I've seen yeah yeah yeah I've seen it I don't know maybe for used games yeah Xbox and PlayStation Xbox you could download - oh yeah yeah yeah and Playstations yeah you just plug that cat 6 or whatever is having a conversation with Jordan Peterson about this yesterday off air I was saying I'm really I get concerned because I feel like all of our information like the vast majority of it is now digital mm-hmm we have some things that are written down on paper but even paper so it's so easy to break and burn and fuck up I mean we lost most of human beings lost most of the information about Egypt when they burned the Library of Alexandria mmm who knows I mean there could have been all sorts of schematics and some diagrams detailed diagrams how they built some of the things they built last at all you know that easily could happen to us and then would be starting from scratch again yeah the when when it takes some form of electricity to to get to all this information you're really dependent on that there's going to be power that type of power forever and even if we figure out how to reboot electricity and say if someday in the future what if we have a massive coronal mass ejection and it fucking nukes the entire the whole grid and all the satellites go down and we have to start from scratch yeah decade two decades before people start rebuilding computers again that actually work well they're gonna have to decipher all this information they're gonna have to figure out those codecs they're gonna have to figure eight yeah they're gonna get drivers to make all this stuff work and they're gonna miss a lot of it yeah all the info is literally ones and zeros and has to be decoded and and put back together again and some important stuff if it's on a drive somewhere it could just get nuked yeah it's gone and then gone forever all the things that people figured out gone don't you wish that would happen itself I'm so cynical man my really lately more so I I think over the course of the past few years I've just gotten more cynical and I think social media had a big effect on me well engage too much yes I did I'm off social media now I have been for maybe months at least you know I did a personal choice well the Twitter kicked me off quite a few times they kick you off just dumb shit - it wasn't even it wasn't even that bad like the last one it was I was defending Jimmy Norton some girl was on just bashing Jimmy and and I was like look at you I go I don't even know what you are first of all you're either a masculine girl or a feminine guy and your hair looks like it was dyed with period blood is geyser and both at God they fucking permanently suspended me well that was the bat was it loads here even lives like you can't make fun of that you can't make fun of somebody and works if there's sexuality and I kind of called him a a femme or or a butch whatever it was ever whichever case whichever's case and to this day I still don't know actually but so I get kicked off a lot I have a Twitter account now but I have not told anybody what the name is or because I just use it for research for the show right because Twitter gets the news before the news yeah like that's where everything breaks now on Twitter you know what's interesting to me louis farrakhan still on twitter it's it's amazing you ever read some of the shit he says it's evil Jews crazy anti-semitic unbelievably yeah unbelievable and for whatever reason they're scared to kick him off yeah they won't kick him off I guess Laura Loomer is a Jewish kind of independent reporter girl and nut case lash nut case whatever yeah yeah whatever you want yourself she trained herself to Twitter yesterday hilarious I just watched it on periscope as it was going on and she's got a bullhorn and she's just yelling at Twitter as they lose me well you got a bullhorn well you know it's funny it's kind of left-wing tactics she was using yeah cuz conservatives the right Republicans whatever you want to call it are pretty mellow when it comes to they don't demonstrate great really they like to just get in there and do their shit whatever it is but liberals really like getting out there and marching and yelling and bull horns and stuff like that so it was weird like to see that on the other end yeah but she she just screaming and I guess I guess they unhooked her and and arrested her so they kick her off at Twitter for they kicked her off for talking about Islam and talking about how Twitter was celebrating Women's Day whatever whatever that was on a certain day by focusing like the picture was one of those Islamic women that got elected to office up in what was at Minnesota or somewhere so she said how hypocritical that was because you know Islam is for female genital mutilation and against women's rights and they kill gay people and and that's all she posted and she got kicked off for the hate speech against Islam and and then her argument was bluest Farrakhan is saying you know I'm not an anti-semite I'm an anti termite equating Jews with insects which is yeah pretty 1930s Germany kind of a thing so I you know while her heart was in the right place I guess did come off a little wacky she also had a star David a yellow star David on her or shirt as she was chained to Twitter people got upset with that there she has I just thought to tell you the truth I thought it was a good strategic move because you're gonna buy time with that because the police do not want that optic of a uniformed guy kind of pulling a girl off they're wearing a Star of David thing it just a picture looks bad so it might have bought her some time but I don't know if that was her motive she planned it out well she did apparently it was the number one trending topic on Twitter which is odd that you know she gets kicked off and ends up being the the number one trending topic what's really odd is this is wild man afford it may have perjured himself right Muir's going after Trump's deeper ties : is now saying that Trump was in cahoots with Putin who's gonna give him the 50 million dollar penthouse tower in Moscow yeah yeah you know all that but like no no that girl got kicked out kick it sounds ridiculous because I got like I said I got kicked off and I'm a little bummed about it but it's why because it's odd it's not just a private company anymore that can do what they want I'm not for government regulation so I don't know how you fix this but Twitter is now a thing where the Presidents on it world leaders are discussing things on it Emergency Management FEMA and and the weather services they put out alerts in case of danger or some kind of event that's gonna happen and because of your political ideology or calling a girl period blood hair you're not privy to alerts and safety information that well it's it's clear that it's not everyone's doesn't have to follow the same rules we've already established that with Farah Khan right you've also established that with Trump Sam Harris has been on a he was at least I think he's abandoned it but he was on a quest to get Jack to try to hold up his terms of service agreement and and kick Trump off of Twitter ironically what he's doing he's threatening nuclear war like do you understand that this is the craziest use of Twitter ever yeah and I think Jack's position was that it is it's more beneficial to have him on and it's really we are getting to see his personality in a way we've never seen any presidents predominate solutely I mean though the most ridiculous petty shit that he does like attacking Michelle wolf because of her White House Correspondents right thank people losers you know make it fun of the girl on Joe Scarborough the girl he married yeah that she had fucked up plastic surgeon each bleeding yeah yes make shit up I mean you think she really really thinks she showed up a mar-a-lago bleeding fucking plastic surgery scare he's a fucking maniac it really the meanwhile that it it's good for us to see because it educates us to who he is as a real right like there's a lot of who you are just gets exposed in those tweets yeah we little bit bit you can't know everything about a person from their Twitter but you can get you can parse out little chunks where you get a good taste and for him it's very very revealing yeah it is a weird thing this is what I think this will be looked back on as a very pivotal moment in American history and in politics where that kind of crossroad happened yeah because we were we were pretty satisfied with that political speech thing that and we need to bring up the lower middle class to the door and they just go on and on and drone on it's this weird speech that no real human being ever speaks like Hillary was hilarious and what Wayne today is that it was fake it comes off as fake and phony Trump comes rolling in it's absolutely batshit insane like the stuff he says like you were saying the other day he's he's giving his speech he said that when he was younger people said he looked like Elvis because he was doing some kind of a commemorative thing for Elvis down in Tennessee or somewhere and he says he looked like Elvis and we're laughing our ass off me and Keitha because no one ever told me what about Elvis no one ever told him that and and and there's so many things and I'm a trump guy I voted for the guy cuz I wanted that monkey wrench thrown into the machine I felt we had gotten screwed too many decades and it was time to let Washington know like look we'd rather elect this nut than any of you guys so I think it proved a point there are enough checks and balances in place where you know the likes of any one president really isn't going to do that much damage I think he's pulled the cover off a lot of stuff I think people are trying to compete with him on Twitter politicians are trying to play his game and it's kind of fun to watch as a comic entertainer it's gold do you see what the tulsi gabbard said to him what she's a congresswoman from Hawaii she said being saudi arabia's bitch isn't making america first like that's a congresswoman say they're all kind of making that they never used to do that no they did and it's odd that a seventy year old guy was the one that was like bringing twitter to social media into this forum it is on and yeah you would think it would be some young guy get in there and do it but i never do it the way he's doing you know that's just like a reckless maniac it's and that's because he can yeah the guy you'll never see a chain of events like what happened to elect Donald Trump the rich guy is just a billionaire a million or whatever you want to call he's got a lot of money money from his dad from his dad and then you know I remember him in New York when I was a kid Trump was always in the news developer he was always banging heads with politicians trying to get some kind of zoning thing going or build some other towers somewhere and so we were all familiar with him and we knew he was like this piece of shit guy you know like everyone was surprised like oh god he grabbed by the pussy he's like we saw in the Daily News in New York Post every week Trump was with some other who shit so it wasn't a surprise to to us yeah but he got out there and it was the perfect timing like we come off the the heels of eight years of a Democratic president and it just was people were ready for a maniac to be in a lot of them were some people are exact my favorite image of the election was that lady with the sock hat on the unnies with the glasses screaming like that to me assured in this era of outrage and chaos yeah yeah it just that was like the primal scream that set off the dominoes and they're all in motion right now it wasn't supposed to happen it wasn't supposed to happen Hillary was supposed to be president that's what everybody thought it was gonna go down in history as just one of those wacky elections and then business as usual yeah but you know when when Trump won it turned everything upside down and rip the cover off of I think not only politics in Washington but Hollywood the mainstream media the news media everything had the covers ripped off and everyone's now got a peek inside and realized how fucked up everything is you know you used to assume Washington at least the people had some kind of control like they were they were adults doing the job that needed to be and then you realize oh my god everyone's just a piece of shit do you know here's a story that disappeared from years ago do you remember the Washington madam that suicide herself oh yeah yeah book filled with politicians that we're getting they were banging all these prostitutes yeah and she was gonna release everything and she was doing press conferences and then she committed to us committed suicide but it's like well case closed you know no big deal I lost her books yeah yeah ever whatever whatever let it disappear yeah it disappeared things like that happen Oh like like politicians kill people oh yeah there's their secret backroom deals that happen and it's crazy house of cards is way closer to reality than people would like to believe yeah yeah way closer we over the course of the decades upon decades every year that goes by we seem to get a little more knowledge and a little less confident in the government I mean I watch some shit from the 50s you know there's plenty of things on YouTube and even even industrial films just this thing of how a family how to raise your family how to be a good wife all that stuff and it was all this weird propaganda of what America was and then as years go by you realize oh it was all bullshit like politicians were always getting rich and no one seems to know how or why and these deals that are made aren't always in our best interest they're not civil servants there to represent and help you and and as the years go by we see more and more of us and the past two years with Trump has just been man quite a crash course it really has yeah it's great I'm fascinated to see where it goes I'm fascinated to see if he seems you know I mean they always called Gotti the Teflon Don yeah but it seems like Trump is the Teflon Donald yeah he seems it seems like all these things keep happening and and even because of that like I remember Justin Martindale a comedian friend of mine is hilarious he goes he was talking about stormy Daniels he was like she's our Monica Lewinsky she's gonna take him down oh my god the fuck that's not happening no you don't get it he doesn't care that they know he fucked her yeah doesn't care to understand it's not you have to care for it to work right and that's just it people don't really care it's well some people don't care I follow like Rosie O'Donnell's account on Twitter and Rob Reiner is another one and for two years over two years they have just been like counting down and the day that it's like Oh impeachments right around the corner oh he's out oh they're gonna put him in prison I hope you and your son get a cell next to each other it's like how long are you gonna do this eight years is it gonna be eight years of you going well any day now no Keith Muller is gonna yeah do you remember when he was doing that wacky show in a basement so long cheek you like a mental patient like legitimately recommend to patients resistance screaming it was like he was doing like it was almost like burlesque or something you know what I'm saying like you know how it was like the radio version of burlesque yeah yeah ask is like when you see a girl doing burlesque it's like in a throwback to an old-timey way of doing things like the right handlebar moustache with the bowler cap we'll introduce her she's body she's bought daesh's please welcome Madame blah blah blah and she comes out to music that nobody listens to anymore and she's dancing around right it's very we ended there they're always kind of big girls they're not skinny and like a little stripper oh yeah they're girls who eat so it's like to throw back to a different time of rowdiness and when he was in front of that screen like thing with his suit on and his tie like the everything was like really well-written and raised precise points and I don't understand like with the red-blue and the background was either it's just it was so it seemed like something that someone had set up like but not as good as your compound yeah based on live from the compound it wasn't it wasn't as good as that it's like that's the background this is for GQ GQ is like okay we have $30 we have ours I think I think Charlie's got a camera he could bring it in $30 good hey we have a table the IKEA table that's $12 and you have $18 left we got some construction paper for the background got some big-ass blue and blue and red paint yeah yesterday what what is that and then he would just pontificate there and and he and his last thing was like because the end is eminent there's no no reason for me to go on Recep is finished yeah what is this my work here is done play some of this Trump is finished exactly 11:00 2017 was when he quit pardon from Trump or that Muller as have also reported here has succeeded in finding a way around Trump's pardon power and either of these near certainties spell Trump's doom so that's the most obvious of the seven ways for Trump to go now settle or really we'll get him on Russia it will be ugly and it will tear this country nearly apart but it will be necessary the second way is as I have also repeatedly suggested here that Muller doesn't really need to prove anything about Trump and Russian sabotage of the election there seems to be so much obstruction of justice for the firing of James Comey to the lies about Trump Jr's meetings with the Russians that it's hard to pick out a key player in the Trump inner circle who could not be guilty of it here we go and it's like it's still going still going still going and it gets fake news yeah end it now fake news it's a hoax but it is interesting like more to me is fascinating because he seems like a ruthless motherfucker yeah takes his time he's a good guy says hey look at me I'm gonna kill you yeah it's not gonna be today okay that's all you need to know yes I couldn't be today but I'm gonna fucking kill you and like every day he's plotting on killing you you see him drive by your house in ways yeah you're like when is when is the hammer fall and you look out your window of your office he's out yeah look at that guy thinkin coffee oh he has seen some shit oh I mean this guy he's yeah I mean he's a cold-blooded intelligence agent yeah yeah those guys have seen everything huh he knows the inner work is the machine and he knows how you bring a guy like that down and how you fuck it up and he's doing everything that leads me to believe that he's not fucking it up this is a slow play and if there is if there is anything to the Russian thing I you would think something would have leaked out by now well it has I mean is there was a video the other day of Donald that they just played on CNN of Donald talking about how many times he's actually been too rushed Donald Jr and you know he had said that he hadn't been and then there's another video of him from years ago saying yeah I've been there many times yeah five six seven well talking about business the problem with the people that are going after Trump that they don't seem to understand the guy right up until he became President of the United States was just a private citizen businessman so he had a lot of dealings around the world with his real estate and buildings and and golf courses all this shit happened when he was just a citizen doing business now whether it was ethical or not that that could definitely be brought into question whether it's legal or not I'm sure that's what they're looking into also but he wasn't he wasn't beholden to the people as a public servant there wasn't a conflict of interest because he was a lifelong politician right and using the power of his office to make deals so and that also goes hand in hand with him just fucking around like like if he went from selectmen in his hometown and then years and years go by and then you're the president and you built that career up any at any point in there they could call you out on being a horrible human being because you fuck girls or you're this so you died of just shady business stealing but Rob until two years ago he was just Donald fucking Trump yeah so it's hard to call him out on even dealing with Russia because plenty of business willing to deal with Russia and China I think the question is whether or not he colluded with Russia to get information about Hillary and also to put out all that propaganda against Hillary and also saying that they're gonna make a deal to do the Trump Tower in Moscow this is all while he was running for president uh-huh not being honest about it I think that's that's where it gets again I don't know almost there is anything illegal there I don't know if there's anything that that he did that is illegal because I believe when you're campaigning say whatever the fuck you want to anybody I think you're really running I mean you're running anything they've really run in the country yeah if he lost the presidency he would still have to have some ducks in in a row to continue his business so you know and his son took over that part of of what he was doing so he could campaign so whether Donny junior went over to Russia or not I don't really see you might think it's unethical and you might go well did he say if we win we'll do this and help you out so who knows about that part of it but I don't see in and of itself him going over there being that big a problem and the fact that you know the Clinton campaign and the DNC they had a lot of shady deals going on with Russia also in that crazy dossier and an English spy and a Russian like and that just never seems to get any traction it's weird well there's way more left-wing media publications than the right way absolutist the fact there's only a few right-wing newspapers and right wing websites are oftentimes maligned that you have treated seriously like there's no right-wing newspaper that's treated with the same amount of respect as in New York Times no Helen list doesn't exist now what the earth the New York Post well it's New York Prost right-wing I don't know outrageous yeah I don't give a fuck who you are liberal Democrat row conservative Republican they'll fuck you some of the headlines that have come off of the fucking post have been classic over the years they're amazing yeah like comics yeah yeah it's just comedy yeah one was uh the one I thought was just so douchey when Fred Astaire died it was said a stairway to heaven like fucking but that's unless they got a hit for that's the one thing that I do love about New York and Boston too yeah there's a harshness to the comedy because yeah people are fuckin cold it's cold the wintertime is calling like fuck you and that that growing up there man it fucking it flavored meat flavored burr yeah there's a million guys like that that like that Patrice that fucking a comedy a lot of it came out of that part of the world because that part of the world is different isn't that weird it's it's cold fuck I know and you think that just makes people angry a cold and a lot of people I think oh and very few people makes people like more down homey and compassionately stating Montana except for a few serial killers randomly right yeah other than that you get like people that work together and help each other because they realize they're in this together yeah there is a there's a stark difference between New York and Boston based comics and la-based cop oh it's amazing difference yeah yeah and some of them have that crossover appeal there and they've moved you know guys in and like Bill you know but maintains that Boston sensibility that New York sensibility yeah yes what's appealing about him is that he's still Savage right exactly yeah yeah yeah like that you don't grow that out here it's no sunny it's nice every day everyone's everyone seems kind of pleasant yeah out here whether it's real or faux ninis but it comes off as pleasantry and in New York it's just a grave disregard for everybody yeah you literally step over so many people yeah yeah who's their value yeah it's like if you have a million pennies and you drop a penny like what else oh shit right lost a guy on the train no it is odd when you think about if there was somebody just laying in the the gutter of the street in some small town in Kansas the the police say an ambulance would be called and people would stop and ask if he was okay and said and in New York you literally step over those people you just don't even look in their face you it's a it's an inconvenience yeah that someone is laying on the sidewalk if you were in the middle of a snowstorm and you were your car broke down and you saw a guy laying on the side of the road yeah you'd help him of course he's like oh Jesus support guy we're gonna help him too yeah hey buddy you all right yeah yeah not so much New York New York you just see him lying in his own piss needle hanging out of his dick yeah and I and I'm pissed that it stinks yeah down on the subway fucking gross it's fucking disgusting man yeah no can be does stink too though in a steamy August day it's the worst and it's gotten worse under a de Blasio's a mayor of New York now and say what you want about Giuliani who now is batshit crazy what happened with him I don't know I think there's blew a fuse he's not respectable anymore he's like some kind of well he aligned himself a Trump so that immediately gets you put into a category but he's also a little I think he's got some dementia like he just doesn't seem right it is lost his comb-over that he had a comb-over for what is that like what's-his-name with a comb-over and he realized oh my god I'm fucked yeah Samson's hair it's like that he lost the the last wisps those last wisps of comb-over yeah that had 39:11 going on yeah he was at one point you know after 9/11 they called 910 2001 he was a piece of shit no one like Giuliani ruined New York he ruined it by commercializing it cleaning up all the porn theaters getting rid of the tunnel bunnies and the squeegee guys like you know he went on a tear just gave the police and carte blanche to start racking head and taking care of business a cleaned up New York Times Square turned into a Disney type atmosphere instead of that drug-addled fucking mess that it was and and people hated him for kind of ruining that gritty New York that we saw in taxi driver and shit and then 9/11 he was America's mayor that's what they called him America's mayor he's going out of Yankee games into ovations and people he's standing with the comb-over he looks like a crazy person on the right yeah yeah she has totally shaved his head there's a lot of power in that head mother yeah you feel good you feel like a guy who is like hair on the side of his head unless you do a lot of drugs like hun arrests Thompson it's hard right off you can't pull that off I think yeah right hand side that's a that's a comb-over in the beginning yeah I love that above that above that to the right to the right suit oh yeah that's where it's first started that's the full column like him what did he do did he try to get plugs or something in the front I don't think so I know what that is it's just just rocking that full strong comb-over that is he he had a lot to do with the the getting rid of organized crime in New York City like the Mafia the five families all that shit was still running pretty rampant throughout the 70s and 80s as a kid me and my brother used to laugh our asses off we'd open the newspaper and it was like Johnny the horse Bugatti was found dead so we have our asses off at the names yeah like just those those mob names it's it's hilarious and that scene in Goodfellas at the beginning one that just going through and you know the nose and killer and this guy they all have those fucking names that are hilarious and yeah Giuliani was a big part of that I'm surprised they didn't kill him like he was absolutely responsible he kept going after them and kept putting him away with the you know the new RICO statutes that they had and locked up a lot of mobsters man so well you know another problem with the moms is they started ratting on each other yeah yeah as soon as you start ratting on each other all your mystique is gone yeah your whole legend is gone this the whole thing is that you guys have omerta you keep your fucking mouth shut you do your time like a man right you get out and you're a hero and that this whole thing keeps going this thing of ours this thing of ours but those fucking pussies didn't want to go to jail isn't that something like the old-school guys would be offered you know you could walk yeah or you could get a really easy sentence just talk go fuck your mother yeah and and then yeah they reach the point where it's like yeah I'm not built for president when they would put him in prison though it was like in good felt right I would be able to cook and they they paid the guards off yeah a sweet setup the internet ruined all that - yeah yeah you wasn't it well it was probably all dead before the Internet but but you know like Sammy the bull Gravano he was free yeah he did his time did the minimum amount of time he killed at least ten people they murdered yeah he he confessed to them you know talked about the morality didn't how he did them he wanted he's so bad they wanted Gotti so bad I mean Sammy the bull Gravano was a fucking straight-up psychopath yeah its total serial killer yeah and they let him walk and then he got arrested eventually for selling ecstasy in Phoenix he moved to Phoenix after that yeah yeah and then he was running shit down there and how did he just not get whacked out like was little ah was gone they all were gone there's no one care all crumbled it that's something yeah just like yeah poof went away don't think like God II was the first one that was like real flashy in public about yeah yeah Vincent the chin always used to walk around like a crazy person in the bathroom bathroom nuts but he would he would give people directions while he was doing that but he felt like everything was being bugged so they would do is they bugged cars along his walking route right they could record him come on that is hilarious what he was doing Jesus there's always a way yeah there's always a way to get you yeah the mystique was gone though yeah it wasn't real like the Russians still have the mystique Russian mobsters they are brutal to scary ones like they are the scary ones there's a worse mob because regardless of what it turned into there was a time where the Italian mob did have a line like you didn't cross family things like that but the Russians all my god will they fuck up an entire family the dog everything gets killed in the worst way yeah they're scary scary motherfuckers I had an experience out it was Broadway I guess and they have those peddled cabs that go around and they're all Russian dudes big legs on him they peddle around and I was looking for a cab a real cab to take me downtown I was gonna ride 15 blocks in a tricycle with Yuri pedaling in front of me so this guy passed by once and said you need the cab I was like now I'm good thanks comes around again I'm still waiting for a cab and he goes cab I was like I'm not gonna have you pedal me 15 fucking blocks no move and and you could yell at a cab driver in New York they'll yell out your window and stuff they rarely will get out of their car they know you know you got the medallion right there you could just call the number and say you were being harassed by a cab driver so they won't do anything this guy gets off his fucking bike you have a fucking problem you have fucking problem what and I was just like oh shit it's going down this guy means business and of course I'm like no no all good oh god I thank you I don't need a cab you write the motherfuck that was it but you don't fuck a Russian no they're not regular white people no they're not they're not they're hard people yeah yeah no but you see that in the UFC there's a lot of badass well obviously we now we saw that recently enough yeah yeah on top of Conor punched him in the face saying let's talk now yeah yeah boom let's talk come on we talked bone just twisting errific yeah yeah yeah and then they got those other videos that you see on YouTube and whatnot of Russians just up in in steel i-beams yeah like a hundred stories up backflip swinging to backflips hanging by two fingers isn't that rolling and sometimes falling yeah my hands are sweating are you just talking about that makes my hands chilly it is so uncomfortable to watch oh and because they're they get themselves in these positions where maybe there's this thin little alcove yeah and and they put their hands against one side their feet against the other this if your feet slip there's no no recovering me crazy this all reaction to just the thought and I have some friends that just know that I freaked out so they send me those everyone Christ yeah there are some things that are online oh my god they are nuts I can't do this man oh look my hands are pouring so yeah yeah oh my God look at this crazy asshole always crazy shit what does it say daredevil returns with latest shocking stunt on skyscraper this fucking motherfucker but he's doing a handstand on what is that a three-inch ledge oh my god oh come on what are you doing do this you fuck do it it one little one little fucking miscalculation or how do you do that how do you know your center of gravity isn't just gonna pull your right - fuck off Jesus Christ you went around the corner that's nuts what is this guy's life like if he just decides he's gonna do this this makes me very uncomfortable that is so fucking high of it's so high that is so high oh I wouldn't I can't do what he did it is on the ground right yeah yeah I can't I can't do those handstands and all that jazz right mark out three inches and try to stay on it with your hand or mark it up enough so that you like put pads under me right right and then give it so I could jump up and grab it and hang yeah yeah see how much of that I could do like a couple of things I could can for my fingers I might be able to pull myself up but if I got to the top I probably slip yeah yeah you know either height will definitely fuck with you Oh like if you're riding a bike on a sidewalk you will never fall off the sidewalk right you could just ride your bike you don't even have to think about it it's sidewalk what couple of feet wide if that was over like the Grand Canyon you you would you would be shaking you couldn't do it and it's the same fucking thing it's just your your perception and the height and you know you'd be fucked up you'd be like this I'm gonna fall off we have that HTC vibe in the back room here oh yeah and there's one game we have to download that game we haven't gotten that game when you go to the hardware store and you buy a 2x4 and you lay it down on the floor and then the game is you put the VR goggles on and you're walking on this 2x4 all over like in between two skyscrapers right so as you're doing it and like you hear sound I got that's awesome this is this is the actual game oh my god you step out oh here's the 2x4 so this 2x4 is real like you have an actual 2x4 right really walking on this so you're feeling yeah and you walk the plank oh my god oh my god and you look down like oh yeah what is that thing float in front of you no what's that supposed to be Jamie I've never done I don't know it's yeah the first of all watching it on a screen does VR know justice you can't really you are in a space it's so cool to kind of look around they they definitely have to a more work to do yeah it's it looks cool you feel like you're in a 3d environment but it's not very photorealistic no four kids are addicted to it really a run here after school oh really put the VR go they fight over it at first and they put the VR goggles on and play these fucking crazy games yeah I have the oculus and the vibe and the PlayStation VR at home and the best right now the oculus is the the highest quality of the VR goggles I think PlayStation has some pretty cool games out there though and vibe does too but I think oculus is going to come out very soon with a completely wireless one yeah yeah yeah so you're not like tethered to anything and you tripping over wires and shit that's gonna be yeah that that's pretty huge it's weird though because some games aren't conducive to VR and you would think like I play Call of Duty or battlefield 5 world war 2 thing just came out and I love that that game but I couldn't play that for our cuz I will play for fucking hours on end and to have the goggles on that long and trying to play a shooter like that I think VR right now is more conducive to experiences than it is like that that's pretty much not a game it's an experience and it it brings you into a whole nother 3d world around you but like a shooter game like Battlefield or Call of Duty not really conducive to me all right now not yet yeah I think in the future though a plastic gun yes like a real of you were holding a real plastic you need that interface yeah that would be fucking amazing for a shooter game yeah yeah there's a few other ideas that they're working on that should be available pretty relatively soon where the system Maps your house like the room you're you're in off of your headset and will superimpose things over the couch like it'll be a ammo crate a chair turns into a box ammo crate so as you walk around the room it's reading your room but making this VR world that looks more military or like a jungle or whatever it is so it won't be a couch you'll hit it but in your vision it'll be a box or an ammo crate or you know what a car something like that so that's kind of cool utilizing the real environment around you and then superimposing shit over it you know what else is really cool the boxing games yeah and the boxing games you get a crazy workout you get a real legit workout because you're actually like fake boxing this cartoon character yeah yeah and when you get hit you see a bright white flash like like you got yeah like you got hit like you got your bell rung yeah yeah you but you get you get a real workout when you're doing this yeah breath I've watched my girl plays that and it's hilarious it's funny to watch people do VR especially stuff like that because they're ducking there's another shooter game that she was playing and it's hilarious because she's like screaming and ducking down and your hand is up like pulling a trigger on a fake gun over something that isn't even there right so it's that it's cool to watch people play you have some crazy zombie game that my kids play yeah that's like that you get a bunch of guns and ammo and then the zombies are closing in on you got a gun them down yeah yeah it's just weird I'll tell you there are some games or experiences where you're walking through kind of a haunted house thing that are genuinely fucking alarming like like you don't want to you don't want to go around a corner you don't want to do anything and you know like there's when you watch on a monitor it's just the monitor there's shit behind you that you're not seeing unless you turn around and look right so you hear a sound and be like I am NOT I don't want to turn around I know that thing's gonna be right in my face it's frightening what is the alien game for is that for the vibe or oculus there's a Ridley Scott alien yeah that's a that I think it's both because I had it for oculus it's your fucking tariff yeah yeah alien something yeah it's the one like alien the original movie yeah yeah you're on a ship it's a it starts with the doors open up and that little thing drinking of the water that little tchotchke on the yeah on the desk and it's a yeah it really gives a good recreation of the movie which was fucking awesome dad's wonderful great goes down as one of my favorites he's also one of my favorite examples when people talk about pushing diversity in movies oh yeah this movie had a female lead who's a female superstar who spoiler alert ones up winning in the end any time yeah but you don't even notice now it never like it's crammed down your throat right is the last Star Wars yeah I was like get the fuck out of here laura dern you're not running the empire like what is this like she's the head general and then carrie fisher's the other head general and they're telling these men to shut up and this all makes sense to you isn't that fucking amazing mistress dude they had it that was 1979 and they had more of an idea of how to present that then yeah first of all Sigourney Weaver's just a fucking badass badass believable movies believe that she pulled it together she was such a great actress yeah that's alien descent this was like that thing that you did at Disney though Oh to go to free-roaming the Orange California well that that would Jamie know talked about that many times like that's the future like a warehouse like this space out here but converted into giant VR experience yeah yeah Jamie Orange California oh yeah we need to go damn yeah when I first saw alien back you know kids I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out their kids Zach my mom took me it was 79 yeah yeah it was leave it was just one of those movies that at the time everyone goes oh my god you got to see this that the chest fucking burst scene just slayed people but yeah when you're watching that because traditional movies the guy's the hero yeah that's what happens when Tom Skerritt gets it you're just like wait what yeah they just killed the the star the hero that was it was Tom Skerritt yeah as I'm not his fucking movies a big movie star yeah yeah and then I think it was like with the first movie where where the spaceship was kind of a truck and it was just dirty and you know just regular guys concerned about getting paid and and shit like that so uh yeah that's why it was amazing which is this one this is a covenant in utero oh so this is after the Covenant movie which is a fucking awesome one that's yeah I like that me someone I love damn movies I love a good good I like that shit that movie they nailed it it was just great it didn't matter for a woman was running and it was right they weren't shoving it down your throat no I felt like that last Star Wars one with Laura Dern and Carrie Fisher was like flying flying Carrie Fisher come on yeah I stopped I wasn't feeling it I didn't feel like they were look there's certain women like what is her name from house of cards the head woman yeah what's in Jenny from Jenny from fuck oh yeah Penn so it's something something something Penn fucks her name I think she used that so good - I'm Robyn Robyn right yeah Robyn right okay Robin Wright was playing in general I believe it yes I mean bitch right she she could send in some fucking tanks yeah leave I believe that she would like Nuka planet I'd buy that right Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern I was like come on who are you doing here they're running things I I think they've they just they're putting out too many Star Wars movies to have it that mystique and that kind of atmosphere that it was like to go to one of them years ago it's also it's it's Disney now yeah yeah which is great cuz you're it's consistent and it's good right but it's never stunning not or terrifying it's never it's never ex machina right right yeah yeah it's never fucked up like will you leave the theater going holy shit yeah yeah can't do that anymore then I'm gonna polish off the sharp edges and soothe the experience down to write palatable mainstream appeal yeah that first the first Star Wars back in a 77 again I saw that in a movie theater with my uncle my Uncle Joe took me and I didn't know Star Wars from a hole in the wall I remember the trailer playing on TV and I was like all right that seemed kind of cool and then we sit down and that opening scene with the giant ship just does a flyover and I was just from that point on I was just mesmerizing this the the illusion of size that they got in the ship and was an old ship the idea of like plastic model yeah practical effects it was all like hook models like they went and bought like a bunch of different you remember those old models that we used to do like cars and oh yeah um yeah remember those I glue them together get the model glue right I still love those yeah they took a bunch of parts from those things and built the Millennium Falcon they built those battleships from like parts like you can kind of tell cuz they're so weird and eclectic and some of the parts don't seem to match right worked yeah cool it totally worked yeah that was you know if you you didn't imagine being analyst x-wing fighters as a kid it was just an amazing thing it's yeah that's kind of gone it shows you how great alien like Ridley Scott's alien really was because all those Star Wars was a great movie honestly Star Wars doesn't really hold up mm-hmm I give you watch it today you look at the special effects like what what am I watching this yes so clunky and and then the Catena scene yeah yeah that's always mouths don't move like the monster face like it's weird if they're wearing a mask it's really obvious but then you go just two years later to Ridley Scott's alien that motherfucker holds up today it looks amazing yeah I got yelled at because I watched it with my kids oh yeah because my 10 year old can handle shit my 8 year old cannot oh man I I watched it I'm like you think you can handle it and they're like yeah I can handle it let's see what I'm gonna die the first time the dude got the tongue through the forehead watching daddy Mayers he'll remember that yeah my dad my mom and my dad took me my brother and my sister when I was seven years old to go see Bonnie and Clyde with Warren Beatty and what's-her-name there and I can't remember who played Bonnie not only Faye Dunaway very good thank you yes and now it's it's famous for being one of the most graphic machine-gunning at the end of the movie I mean they were pulling up they got ambushed by law and they just get shot up the whole movie though as a seven-year-old kid I liked these people they were funny they've dropped banks and stuff but you know they'd make jokes and they were cool and you got to know him as a person so as a seven-year-old I was like all these these people are cool so then the end of the movie comes and and they're out there and you hear the birds of fly away and Clyde looks at Bonnie with the one lens missing from his his glasses and it's really quiet and then all hell breaks loose it's just five guys shooting Thompson's at both of them and they're being riddled with with bullet holes and the scene goes on and they're falling down and against the car the car is just full yeah there it has it's it's so brutal it's crazy to seeing the girl get it oh yeah something ruthless about seeing a girl gets shot a hundred times yeah yeah look at her it was I I'm that we saw this at the drive-in and I I started vomiting in the car seven years old we had bit we had been to Arby's before so my Arby's was all over the car I was screaming crying and throwing up going like what the fuck did you take me to see I liked these people I had like a two-hour relationship with them and it ends like that I was horrified horrified as a kid yeah there's certain things but is that bad like ultimately hmm you saw that when you were a kid like me yeah maybe it's maybe it's not good to shield kids from too much yeah but maybe not to that extent show me a cartoon first because I don't know I don't know if it affected me it's hard to tell without knowing what it would be like if I didn't see stuff like that but the fact that I remember it vividly so many years later maybe had an effect yeah but is it a negative effect like there's certain experiences that you you went you can hand like today as an adult you could see a movie where a guy gets shot and you can handle it does I break you out of course if you saw it when you were 4 you'd probably freak out yeah but is it good to experience that when you're 4 just so that you know it's a thing and yeah you have a different view of the world or is it good like you're not a parent but as a parent this this is the age-old question like how much do you protect your kids yeah how much do you let them break their arm because you break your arm you know if you fall you break your arm if you know everybody's like helicopter parenting you constantly like I don't anybody to die but I don't mind any buddy gets banged up a little bit right right I think you should I think you should know that if you trip it hurts yeah you know this and this also you should know that the bullets are real this is there's a real thing that happens mm-hmm like with my kids um ever since my kids have been really little I've been hunting and so I've been bringing home meat and explaining to them that I this is meat from an animal that I shot if you go to the supermarket and you buy a steak that came from an animal and I try to get this in their head at night age and so then I introduced them to watching a hunting show with me where we shot a deer and then took the deer apart so check you've seen like they're watching us cut an elk apart yeah yeah my kids watching this and I'm like well this is where you get meat like when we dinner if we eat elk for dinner this is exactly where it came from I shot it in the mountains we cut it up we packed it out on our back we put it into a truck we drove somewhere and now we're here now we're eating it this is it yeah I guess if you present it like that yeah that's I would guess is a good thing maybe but there's something weird about watching a little kid watching an animal get shot like uh-huh yeah I realized my dad than that is that good it's my dad a piece of shit these like animals are so beautiful well animals a hot dog your hot dogs are fucking that you want a hot dog right yeah yeah and that's an animal like okay like because most kids just it's a hot dog yeah yeah yeah it's not an actual animal like they kind of know like if you asked a little kid hey where'd this cheeseburger came from oh it's from a cow but that's like damn that's like saying the moon is 1/6 Earth's gravity I know that I don't know what the fuck that means yeah yeah you know real I don't have a real you can't apply it yeah anything so yeah so when do you show your kids like like there's a lot of videos that I watched while closed my laptop and the kids come near like violent videos oh yeah especially like animals like I was watching this video of these hyenas tearing apart this gazelle oh it's fucking horrific they're ripping the guts out oh and she was yanking on the guts and this thing is making these weird noises fuck and then my you know my little girl comes over and slam it she's like what you watching and I'm watching the hyena rip apart of gazelles guts she's like okay all right yeah yeah well yeah so it but but kind of what's the difference between that and showing you hunting like is there I'm doing it quick it's one difference yes okay then when I shoot an animal if I shoot an animal with a bow it's dead in seconds yeah you know with a well-placed shot it's not going anywhere it's like the last elk I shot that one that's right out there on the floor in front of the werewolf that thing died in five yards Wow five yards tipped over feet up in the air I shot it right in the heart Wow a perfect shot so it was almost instantaneous death yeah yeah it might have lived 15 20 seconds and that was it people I don't know people don't seem to be shocked that much anymore I know you know trying to keep it from your kids and things like that obviously makes sense but it's almost impossible to keep some really horrific shit from people especially if you give you a kid a phone yeah yeah you're giving them access to a lot of nasty stuff and like I remember when I was a kid the the big thing was like faces of death yeah you want to go get faces of death man will watch it it's crazy guys they beat up a monkey and cut his head off and eat the brains and everything I'm like yeah that's kind of fake and you could tell the stage things and I think the only real stuff was like news footage of airline disasters and yeah accidents it was one that was real were these these guys somewhere in the Middle East tied these guys arms to one car his legs to God and they pulled them apart I cannot like watch that shit it's it's terrible and now in stunning HD you can see you know snuff films years ago was kind of an urban myth you know it was a thing now they're readily available to anybody oh yeah in a matter of seconds and I don't know what kind of effect that has on on people and and maybe society but and there's really nothing you could do Pandora's like out so I think it's affecting people though oh it's def desensitize I mean that's the argument about video games as well right yeah yeah we're seeing so much violence and committing violence in video games mm-hmm like Jamie what was that video game where the guy got in trouble because he made a video of him torturing some hasn't read - oh yes he punched he punched a woman in the face that was protesting for women's rights to vote suffrage and he and he got in trouble because he posted it and it yeah it was like a violent thing against women but it's the thing you can do in the game right like they made it in the game so you could do that on purpose and once it became viral people started going up to her in the game and doing even more terrible there's one where a guy ropes her hog-tie Czar throws her on the back of the horse rides her to his swamp and throws her to an alligator which then eats her and in the swamp that is so crazy that you can do that unbelievable the alligator will and it's not even a thing like hey do this it's just part of the game that they said well if people want to do it it's a very open-ended game rock star went bullshit with this game it's amazing just does it always happen the exact same way or do you throw no there are this rots in the water and did the alligator has a different way of yeah there are different animations for the same thing so and different actually there was one you'll be riding next to a guy that you're supposed to ride somewhere with and the guy says something like alright we're almost there something and if you're far away from the guy he yells it alright we're almost there and if he's right next he goes well we're almost there like the guy the voice actor had to do a shitload of takes based on what the animation is so I did the the voiceover for the UFC game right yeah look for ever yeah yeah and forever you're there for days and days and days reading every single variation of head kick to an arm bar to a takedown to ground-and-pound yeah TKO stoppage to kicking someone in the nuts like everything and and someone's got to fucking put that together and then it's got to be coated where it plays at the right time it really is amazing it's it's goddamn amazing i but read read dad's like really insane is this it there's uh what is this this is the body yeah this is a girl-power bear that's guys you smoked guta cigar dude it's so funny the the things that go on in this game the the ability to kill people I had Lewis J Gomez on the show and he he plays this and he there's like a morality direction you could take you could either be a good guy a bad guy really good really bad and it will affect how the course of the game and and whether you're wanted whether people are nice to you realize yeah yeah like you could do a favor for somebody you'd be riding somewhere and someone ago please could you help me out and yeah the women's rights activist not her but he's gonna throw this lady off of the Mount and this is just some guy online done this oh yeah I think this is the same YouTube he does he's got a lot of videos right yeah oh jeez he fell different things oh he fell he fell himself he was trying to kick her off and oh haha but and Louis apparently would kill everybody he killed a guy's dog and skinned it in front of him and then shot him in the face like that's really mean that's really dog in front of the guys yeah yeah and the guys just like crying it's brutal how I mean do you think that most politicians and those people looking for outrage is not aware of this yet yeah absolutely not years ago they were kind of like well it must be violent video games and it was so funny because like 10 years after doom like they're showing doom on TV like oh that's the bad video game was like Jesus cut that's nothing what are you talking about and now like like oh yeah yeah same guys yeah yeah GTI did some of the voices in GTA 5 it was fucking hilarious oh I know yeah to do that I sang some of the promotional songs for the beer piss Wasser beer it was great I know Lazlo who does all the sound for the the games but this thing sold like 750 million dollars in the first three days that way Mouse Jamie what happens if you bring a black man to the KKK yeah they have fucking KKK going on yeah there's a part of the game where you have to infiltrate but what happens when you bring a black guy look at the different happened really the Klan no they don't freak out not in particularly you know but the job I think the mission here is to just kill all the Klan guys it's not like you join up and have a good time seems like it would be more realistic as if you brought a black guy to the Klan meaning they try to kill the black guy right right but that would be real that would be crazy there are some weird parts in it where they're very misogynistic because it's supposed to be like 1899 or something right and it's very misogynistic and then there's some race references that they make that are kind of like move wow that's that's bold like what do they say about black guy like they'll call them boy in some of the when when a guy like a non-player character will pass be kind of nasty and they never present it in a good way it's not like you know oh cool this guy's great it's always some scumbag character Wow yeah my lumps it's like the last frontier for chaos right now yeah it really is and I think because there's such a lack of awareness on the part of a lot of people like I I get games the day they come actually before I get alpha testing beta testing I'm playing the games months before they come out really yeah I love it getting on that you sign up for the ultimate package on origin or steam and you get access to the games when they when they're tested I mostly just pay yeah yeah it's a pay thing obviously they want to make some some money and I want to play the games early but report bugs and things yeah yeah yeah they you just play they automatically kind of have something in place that will let them know if there's a problem or you can email and say hey there you know I died and I'm stuck in a rock now up to my waist have you ever talked to some of the people that make those things you ever have money show yeah yeah Lazlo works at Rockstar he's the sound engineer guy he records all the sound but he's involved in like every aspect of all those games from the beginning of Grand Theft Auto the first red dead red dead 2 and it's amazing I've been to rockstar in New York and took a tour of the place it's just a bunch of fucking nerds sitting around they have a day where you know you can bring your dogs in and it's all wide open no cubicles or anything the guys that run it are these English guys and they're brilliant or New Zealand or something they have that accent one of those weird accents that you can't tell where it's from work insane hours yeah yeah that's they are dedicated like a game like like a rockstar game GTA or that it's so above other games like like you can't even I've played some shitty games where I download it I start playing and within five minutes I'm like oh fuck this sucks like it just you know it sucks right and rockstar games are just you know it sounds like I'm doing a spot for him but there so above everything else the animation the the sandbox quality where you're able to just run around and do shit like that's an appeal that I don't like feeling like they're on a track right in a game and certain games are like that like Call of Duty is very track based you know you play online a lot against other people there's small maps but a game like that you could just go off if you want to you could just spend time fishing like you could just really get tackle and go to a lake and fish catch fish you catch fish it's yeah you take you seven eight hours just catching fish just fishing hunting you could go out and hunt I've heard that you track like the bear and and that motherfucker can you saw like can get you I love games like that though I love open-ended games I always liked that shit even when I was back in the 80s my cousin got a Atari 800 computer and it had a cartridge for a game called star Raiders and this was like right after Star Wars came out and I was fascinated because it wasn't just a joystick and a button that he got on an arcade game it was you used the keyboard like for warp drive or you had a dock with a space station at one point and you're you're put going in orbit around a planet like there was all these things that you used the keyboard for and I thought that was amazing like I don't like just a run-and-gun type thing right I like being able to use a lot of different keys and have a lot of options how much time do you spend playing video games I'm getting the impression it's insane there have been days where I have weekends or something where I have played from maybe 2 p.m. til 3 a.m. like 1213 hours of playing it's no eating yeah yeah II have a little snack a little snack I'll order something or miss he'll make something she's playing video games too though like I'll be playing on the computer and that's in front of me on the table I'm still gonna in the living room and then on the big-screen TV which is in front of me on the wall she's sitting in like a folding chair with a TV tray playing Red Dead Redemption on the box so you're just got occasionally look back how you doing back there oh you got to see this great kill we got a video a funny video of a couple engaging in virtual reality and they're having sex and the girls blowing the guy and in the video Joey Diaz comes in the room there was well there is vr porn have you checked that out I haven't it's really interesting there there's there is some that is pretty amazing like a girl will come up like you're laying on your back and a girl is in the room she takes her clothes off and comes up on you and gets right by your ear and unlike whisper something and you hear it you almost feel the breath on you it's that fucking crazy and and you you feel like you can reach and touch but you know there's not no one there but and again you can't even get close to showing what it's like on a regular flat screen but when you put that in it's a real space it's 3d and they look pretty real aside from the resolution difference because when you when you magnify something that close to your eyes the the pixels get bigger too so it's not quite there but you could see where that's going you get that and one of those fucking flesh lights I used a really really early version of the HTC vive many years ago Duncan had one my friend Duncan Trussell had one in his house and it was really pixelated and it was very strange it was just a real simple game and it was real blocky looking it looked like like old doom or something right but it was in complete three dimensions and so I was looking up and looking all around like wow this is kind of crazy and then I went back to his place like two years later and there had been a gigantic leap and approval huh and now the leaf is sort of balanced out it's not it's it hasn't gotten that much better right yet yeah there are a few games that I loved playing on the oculus because it's like flying games are incredible and if you have a really good system I've like dual 1080 ti graphics cards one of them is insane to have and my sister that's two of them and so I could run everything on ultra so do you prefer videos on a computer yeah yeah I prefer PC but I'll play on xbox and stuff it's pretty cool I'm terrible with a controller yeah that's the problem so mouse and the keyboard is so much more precise I got a yeah I always say I go if anyone ever argues I go I've never missed a folder on my desktop yeah I never got oh shit I missed it but there's something called an ape Zim apex that you plug into an Xbox or Playstation and then plug keyboard mouse into it you're running on Xbox with a keyboard and mouse so and it's so I destroy people when I play on that course yes more Acuras so much more accuracy and you're just quicker reflexes and yeah because I came from the online video game days of early 2000s and the 90s like it was always computers yeah mouse and keyboard was was it console was for babies yeah no they weren't good back then no now here's he was terrible yeah I when I play some of the like combat flying games they have things now that are you look like you're in the cockpit of a plane all the gauges work they have reflections of light coming through I mean the ground looks amazing and in VR when you pull the stick back and turn cuz I use a joystick and a throttle it's it's amazing you can look over your shoulder and now you're seeing your wing and the ground and you're pulling back and you get dizzy like you get so fucking dizzy and crashes are startling like if you lose control and you you're plowing to the ground you kind of jump because it's you know you're just it's I think it's that primal part of your head going like accepting what it's seeing I wonder if that would be a really good way to learn how to fly I would imagine it would be that guy that stole that plane up in was a Portland recently yes yeah dammed into the island yeah killed himself yeah he said he learned how to fly on a semi a flight simulator Microsoft Flight Simulator X is it's like unbelievable he was doing like loop-de-loops in the sky and yeah he's like let's see if we could do a loop and he was saying he's I'm gonna kill myself right oh yeah yeah he's like yeah I think I'll do it I'll try to do a loop and then nose it in and call it a day it's like what a maniac but the fact that he could get access and take off like that is kind of scary whoops we all think you know everything's so secure yeah remember when we thought they were like missiles on the roof of the White House and the Pentagon and stuff and then after 9/11 like yeah I guess not yeah I guess that was all bullshit the actual Pentagon got hit yeah yeah plane by a fucking plane although now you're gonna get a lot of people writing they bro was it was a missile everyone knows it you're a gate keeper yeah Rochelle you're a shill for the UM doesn't who who does your show that is a flat earther Eddie Bravo Eddie Bravo that's it I don't know if he's still a flutters he might have been he might have moved on do you think he's still yeah yeah he thought the earth is a dist maybe he said I think I don't want to misinterpret what he's saying I don't want to misrepresent I think he was saying he doesn't know but he doesn't believe NASA because it's only someone's word over history and he likes that he he thinks it's fun he's a conspiracy okay well they are yeah they are kind of fun but that Flat Earth one I realized I was arguing with flat earthers on twitter and that's when I really started going like what what am i doing yeah you can what am i doing why am i engaging that that is like the dumbest version of I know you are but what am i for the rest of time yes that's so stupid that argument is it's it's crazy I was talking I was arguing with somebody and then I had my show to do and Neil deGrasse Tyson was taping his show in my studio before I came on so he was in the lobby when I was in our green room when when I was on and I start talking about it and I go you know let's get someone in here maybe that might have an opinion on this neil degrasse tyson coming and apparently he gets shit all the time from flat earthers yeah saying that it's you know he's full of shit you know it all started off as a goof it had to just like everything else did it started off on 4chan did it yeah like free bleeding yes exactly which is hilarious people explain that people don't know free bleeding is a woman's rights thing and it's instead of using a tampon during their period or a pad they just bleed through their pants and show it proudly that they will walk around bleeding and it was never real it was never a real thing and then people saw it and thought it was real like they put it out there for Chan and people actually believed and no not just believed it started started doing it yes they started doing it for real yeah they turned it into some women's rights badge of honor to have pair of white pants on the giant patch of brownish red in the center it's insane it's crazy just shows you how easily manipulated people are yeah things that happen like that on 4chan that turned out to be goofs they start out as goofs yeah you know and and then they well listen we were talking about this last time I was with you right the proud boys yeah yeah get off as a goof and then became like what the they won't let him in Australia now have you seen that no it's it's gotten insane yeah like Gavin is considered like a war criminal at this point I know Gavin very well he used to be on compound media my network and that's where the whole thing started yeah it all started because people don't know it's it's amazing what do you think about it because it makes you question everything like how did how did Nazi Germany start was that a joke was that like Stalinism than everything in Russia Gavin had a show very outrageous Gavin is one of these just a funny outrageous guy his whole career has been based on satire and parody and yes and of all that's a provocateur right provocateur absolutely yeah loves shakin II be hard to find out where he really how he really feels and he's playing games right it's very blurry absolutely so we have we had this employee Ben Ratner little kid we actually hired him just because his name was Ratner and we wanted to call him rat like in Fast Times a rat why don't you turn on the camera so it was it was great here at never talked about girls it's like this really Jewish real red hair kind of gangly you know kid and he let going to Broadway shows and things and we always questioned his sexuality and whatnot and Gavin really started hitting on him going what are you doing like get laid a kid your age should be out there just fucking plowing through pussy and he's like um you know waiting for the right girl and everything so Gavin would continuously goof on him so he would always go to Broadway place so Gavin started getting music from musicals and playing it to him like hey look at this you pussy you know is this what you like and one of them was proud of your boy it's a Broadway a song from a musical a Disney musical I believe and it's helium Oh proud of your boy it's one of those big grandiose Broadway pieces of shit oh it is it's terrible so he goofed on about that and then said we ought to make a club called the proud boys and that way you can learn how to be a man and you know you'll get chicks and tattoos and you know drink beer and hang out with guys as a joke it was like this parody of a men's club and so over the top that it was like I think part of the way to get beaten into this gang this club was that you had to recite five breakfast cereals while the other members punched you and they would keep punching you until you spit so ludicrous so ridiculous such a parody and slowly this fucking thing mutated into something it got more members they started wearing what are those shirts the with the yellow piping on the collar and stuff it's a specific shirt that became the uniform Perry Ellis mmm Perry Ellis shirts a specific black shirt with gold piping and on the collar and and the the sleeves and that became like the uniform and because it was presented as a chauvinistic Club like like girls are allowed minorities are allowed it doesn't matter who you are but in essence it is a guy thing and we will talk shit about girls and we're gonna drink and get laid and it's just a men thing so they started getting together at bars you know in the area in Manhattan and how is this organized this is organized through his compound media show through the combat media show his own Twitter account and on Facebook which he subsequently lost he's persona non grata on social media but that's how it started and it never was supposed to go any further than that Gavin himself didn't really take it any further than that it's just let's get together every so often we have a good time we drink laugh everything like that well then this whole thing with politics got involved cuz and Tifa which is anti-fascist started coming into conservatives that wanted to speak so Gavin was conservative is a conservative he'd get speaking engagements at schools and weiu or any any of numerous places around New York City an anti-fog would show up to protest him and try to shut down the event so then the proud boys would go and protect Gavin so he wouldn't get harmed doing these speaking engagements and that so then it turned into this because they're fighting with an tyfa they must be the far the fascist right the nazis and once that gets out there there's no pulling it back you could try to explain how you're not a nazi till you're blue in the fucking face it ain't going away and especially because it's a good story the press likes it this good-versus-evil thing they present anti file like their protet they always call them and the protesters were beaten they're fucking violent a violent group of people that are there to to hit people they don't agree with and silence people that want to speak and that's exactly what happened with Gavin and Ann Coulter and Milo gianopolous Ben Shapiro a lot of these conservative people can't go to these venues and speak they get shut down because of a violent group of people called an tyfa so proud boys were kind of the answer to that so Gavin can go around and actually speak well when that happened more people came on board because they kind of liked to beat people up when you have a gang a group of people and one of their missions is now to beat up people you don't agree with politically when there was TLS there was tears to the membership like the highest tier was you fought for the cause right right I actually get into fistfights yeah yes I'm sure Gavin thought was like I've talked to Gavin I like Gavin I've had Gavin on the podcast yeah and the last time I had him on I didn't know what this whole thing was it's what I he was explaining the proud boys and he was talk to me about we're gonna punch them we're gonna punch people yeah it's like whoa whoa whoa I was like did you don't you can't just punch people like they punch back and then you get to get mad that you punched him and they shoot you when you get out of your car right right this escalates people don't just take it well it was never supposed to be an offensive punching when when I would speak to Gavin in every example I would see it was an answer to violence they today would have violence perpetrated on that problem they answered a lot of context and all all needed to say is he's calling for violence that's it and that's what they've said about Gavin over and over again right taking things out of context and use it as a gamble the other problem being that the anti-fog people are a lot of skinny dudes and chicks with masks on and they are not really that adept at fighting there's a horrible video of this one aunty fucka tries to hit someone with it looks like some kind of a stick or a pipe yeah and the guy catches it and fucking blasts him on the champion fucking put him down his bounces off yeah Crete unconscious yes yeah a lot of people died yeah yeah exactly that's how people die in fights like oh we killed him with his bare hands yeah you hit his fucking head yeah hit his head on the concrete you got hit by the world yeah the world right right gravity in a budge gravity has punched you in the back of the head yeah yes these people have this idea that they're gonna go places they're gonna shut everybody down and because they're in a group yeah I'm gonna scream and yell and hit people with bike locks and all this right yeah I'll scene yeah weird thing is that that's from the left that was never from the left before when I was a kid I grew up when I was from age seven eleven during the Vietnam War y'all lived in San Francisco and I was around the real hippies and I remember being a little kid I remember that even if times like there were flower children I mean they were right the hippies and the lefties were love and peace and no violence and everyone was doing acid right and now they're all on adderall and they're hitting people with bike locks it was yeah it's a different thing there was a time where the liberals the hippies the you know they were the ones that when there would be a demonstration and and the National Guard would show up they'd be putting flowers in the barrels of the guns there are famous pictures of that and then Kent State was a bunch of hippies literally getting shot by the National Guard the National Guard yeah that has completely flipped around it's the weirdest thing and I don't know how it got distinguished we're proud boys became this evil group of people and and an tyfa is the good group of people now I understand that proud boy proud boys were infiltrated by white nationalists yes Nazi white supremacist whatever it is but those were constantly being disavowed by Gavin Gavin never wanted any of that happen but is there wow you get in though here's the question because this is my you saw my last comedy special this is my criticism about vegans it's not that there that's anything wrong with being a vegan right when you have a group where anybody can join you're gonna get a certain amount of fucking idiots right if you have a million people for sure you have a hundred thousand fucking idiot there's no getting around that yeah so if you have a group where anybody can join and you have a million people in that group you're gonna have a hundred thousand fucking it fucking idiot and those people are gonna define your group the worst behavior in the group is where people are gonna call to as an example that's it I think this is also a symptom of the social media era today especially with Twitter because you can't express yourself and explain things 140 or 280 characters it just takes too much time so they can say oh proud boys racist scumbag Nazi that's a Gavin and there are always a racist scumbag Nazi yeah and all sudden that's the narrative and everybody keeps pushing it and that's videos of people punching little skinny people oh look at these people they beat up the ante fuck yeah he's fucking assholes and Gavin's an asshole yeah that's that's what it comes down to I've seen it presented well you asked how it starts and how it grows and how you become a member by buying a fucking shirt that's by buying a Perry Ellis shirt and opening a chapter to there are chapters worldwide you see it it's like here's the be proud boys Australia here's the problem proud boys fuckin Japan like it's everywhere and it never was supposed to get to that point and regardless of how these people act it now reflects on Gavin even though he wanted to hang out in a bar with a few people do his public speaking without being hassled and that's it and and I see the way the media manipulates things I've been party to it myself and I've seen Gavin presented in photos where you look and go holy fuck it's Hitler like like they get him there's one picture of Gavin that I was petrified by he's got his arms folded he's got a scowl on his face that hair you know the short on the side long on the top and he's looking like like he's angry and I'm like that that's not the guy that him and his wife who's American Indian by the way his wife's American India he's got beautiful kids that come over my house and use the pool and we hang out in barbecue I'm like that's not that guy yeah no one knows that guy from the paper they're getting this impression he's a really nice guy he's generous just a really cool guy to hang out with and what you see them do in the media is just crazy especially when you know he didn't invent some goddamn Nazi group he was just trying to have a little outrageous fun and it ran from him it got away from him the origin of it though well yeah the way you're describing that is fucking fantastic isn't that nuts it's crazy that that is what presented it I mean that that emerged it's kind of that we we fuck with rat all the time because we go can you believe the inspiration for the proud boys is this little Jewish oh I'm sure there is yeah yeah resi rat compound media rat you'll probably find them is it how much does this weird you out though that compound media was the source of all this it is weird like and it's one of those things you worry about like like I don't want to then be tied because I know how it works I love Gavin but I don't want to be tied to the proud boys at this point you know I got my own fucking problems through history I don't need any more piled on me well what was that thing that I'd sent you that there he is there he is that's a rat I guess that was Halloween look at you what's this I was wearing that suit that was I was the mayor from Jaws Oh mayor Vaughn I was for Halloween that's the guy yeah did the proud he started the proud boys guys 1938 propaganda poster little cutie a Norman Rockwell painting that's it he should be there with like a like a guy who's handing him an apple pie yeah yeah and that's a that's the face of the new Nazi movement I think there's a lot of mistakes remained yeah but Gavin's Gavin's made some mistakes and like his his whole thing of not of blurring the lines between parody and yes it's he thinks it's fun it's very punk rock yeah he came out last time he's on the podcast was a few years back he came on dressed like Michael Douglas from falling down he had a briefcase he brought the suit like the short sleeve she dresses like that all the time now like he goes around I just I just did a Skype interview with him yesterday two days ago and from the hotel room and here he's got the pocket protector and the pens and the glasses yeah like falling down he thinks it's funny but people need to understand and this is true he is the godfather of the hipsters yeah you put in godfather of hipsters Google he comes up yeah all of that wardrobe the guys are wearing that would they look like they're wearing old-timey suits with the skinny ties yeah that's Gavin McGinnis yeah literally started that fashion trend in Williamsburg yeah and they it took off from there that the hipster dress the way people would dress with those weird mustaches and all that shit yeah that literally came out of Gavin Gavin it which is amazing the motherfucker is he is like a yeah there's something like magnetic about the guy he is what a cult leader is like he could just start a cult which in essence by accident he did yeah between the hipsters and then this he's one of those guys like I like Gavin why don't you start why didn't you start a cult where you get to fuck the people's wives like that kind of cult why why do you go he also did some really good interviews online yeah yeah where he would trick these leftists into sitting down with him in interviews yeah and along the way they were having this conversation it would be exposed that he didn't agree with them at all right and they were trapped like this hardcore feminists got trapped with them and yeah a couple other people get trapped in this room with him yeah and they they realize like halfway like some of the line of questioning and the way he's approaching things like oh my god he's an interesting guy he's very interesting and outside of this proud boys thing have you never never invented that yeah never did any that he would be doing great yeah although he had a problem with one of one of his own companies that he made after vice they bought him out of Vice because Shane turned more liberal and and it wasn't really the they weren't really meshing any more over their advice so they kind of just bought out Gavin he got a lot of money and decided to his own thing he had an advertising firm I guess it was and then he got the boot from that for making transgender comments well he was talking about transgender people have mental health mental health issues was bringing up all these here's the problem he was he was saying some things that are correct yeah interspersed with again yeah harity and sarcasm and but in his mind this was like just this is something you can talk about where it was in the public's eye particularly during the Caitlyn Jenner the whole thing people had decided that transgender was amazing it's amazing it's beautiful she's incredible and he was saying no these are people that are mentally ill and there's and there's a website that he was pointing to I think it's called transgender regrets or something like that yeah where they have all these stories of all these men who turned into women and turned back to men again now that I don't have dicks no cheese and they have to take testosterone injections and they hate their life and there's some of them who did it looking when they were in their 60s and now now they're in their 70s and trying to be a man again and and that gender dysphoria was thought to be a mental health issue like anorexia like a lot of other right there's there's body dysphoria B people have weird you know bodybuilders get it they never think they're big enough right yeah yeah I have like weird perceptions of their physical presence and their move and some I had a psychologist dr. Deborah so who was discussing late onset gender dysphoria in autistic girls that autistic teenage girls they don't feel like they fit in and people can convince them that they're actually a man Wow and so a lot of them start taking hormones and and and going through transition massive regrets and then unfortunately for women when especially when you're a teenager and you're going through puberty and you take hormones you literally start developing male features your face gets harder and thicker and wider your shoulders get bigger like the whole deal your hands yeah click gross the size of a thumb you so you make these irreversible changes yeah ya know so you just described it as Jim Norton scream girl yeah this is the perfect Jim Norton is 11 to death he's a perfect example too of someone who's bulletproof because that's what he is he's he's charming like like in his his fucking debauchery he's a charming guy yes girls love him and think he's adorable when he's saying some of the most heinous shit on stage and and on the air and stuff he's you know where he's coming from yeah yeah yeah well there's no mistaking like he he wears everything honestly huh so he wrote the foreword and in my book permanently suspended he wrote the foreword he knows me like it's my brother first and then Jim Norton yeah like Jim knows me really well we're we're really good friends and I love the guy why didn't you guys wind up doing a show together when Opie and Anthony crashed uh I I think look I can't blame anybody because I think that having the security of a steady paycheck as opposed to the guy that just got thrown off of everything open starting his own thing it probably wasn't all that appealing to Jimmy who you know you just bought a new place in the city and everything is it just it wasn't the right time and then you know as time went on he became the go-to guy over it's serious from the Opie and Anthony show so I would love to and I do his chip chip person show and you know we're doing we're doing one in Philly next week the live show yeah we've been doing these live shows on Long Island we did one up in Boston and it's hilarious he comes out and the crowd goes fucking wild and he's got to be in character the whole time it's got to kill him it's got a killer and and it's so much fun to do I love playing the the straight guy co-host to his fucking insane character but yeah we've done these live shows and they're they're really a lot of fun and he's just a my god it's so ridiculous he's got to stay and get look at those pants yeah hilarious the place is like packed and it's crazy you guys reading what are the notes oh he wanted us to he wrote he wrote like a almost a play but it's all just kissing chips ass and how wonderful chip is and how thankful we are to be there like it's so goddamn funny I love it he's he's brilliant man he's just a great guy and very fucking funny I knew from the first I think that also kind of I'm not blaming Jimmy or anything but I think that helped to kind of break up the ona show in time I think Opie started resenting a little bit of that camaraderie that me and Jimmy were having me and Jimmy kind of slowly started pulling away and doing our own thing like it was and and the humor is you know the more twisted the better I love sick humor he does too and we laugh we did a whole bit on on like Laci Peterson and Scott Peterson the murder yeah and you would think like obviously he murdered his pregnant wife and dumped her in the ocean what could possibly be funny about that what people wrote tribute songs with this guy wrote a tribute song to her and another one of these self-centered assholes I thought he was gonna go viral by making a tribute song and it we started changing the words to the song to make it just horrible involving seaweed and things like so it was terrible but me and Jim are literally crying laughing and all he's just kind of sitting there like not really able to jump in or not kind of getting why we're laughing at this sick shit so it kind of pushed us further apart at that point yeah we both as people changed over the course of the 20 years we work together 25 years with anybody do it is is nuts you get a girl that's suck your dick every day for twenty years you're gonna be like oh fuck stop sucking my dick but now it's think it's opening it crossed from me you know yeah so you're gonna get on each other's nerves and I'm not innocent in the whole thing either but I was I'm a lot more laid-back like I I knew what real work was I worked for fucking living I did heating and air conditioning installation and it was freezing cold in the winter and boiling hot in the summer and when I got that first gig and radio because of Opie I'll always thank him for that I knew what it was like to work and I didn't want to fuck that up so I Plested a smile on my face at every turn and did the show four hours a day everyone has someone at work that they don't get along with you don't leave you no fucking you know you just deal with it and that's eight hours I don't know 20 hours of the day that didn't involve Gregg Opie Hughes so I could deal with it he was more like he had to express himself a little more which I guess is healthy in a way but I didn't need to so I didn't I didn't text him I didn't call him I he we got in an argument once and he goes dude you never even been to my house and I go alright get everyone from the show in here Jim have I ever been to a house nope Travis no Sam no erock no I've never been to anyone's house let me tell you something right now yeah that's not my chick would say I know my house dude it's exactly into my house type of relation I never been Africa what what the fuck you say I've never been to Spain what does that have to do with anything that we've if you had a problem with me not coming to your house why didn't you ask me to come to your house yeah like is there like you ask me every day and I'm saying no and I was saying no right right what's going on it was always something like that and believe me I'm not gonna sit here and shit on the guy I thought my shows for that I'm not gonna shit on the guy but there were definitely personality quirks and that I guess we both had but there was something like if I I would party all the time and and you know I had to be there at 6 a.m. and I'm driving from Roslyn Long Island to New York City it's it's 25 30 miles of just fucked traffic every day he had it could be 35 minutes it could be an hour and a half based on if someone's pulled over on the side of the road some asshole ashes in Queens whatever it was it was it was a shit Drive every day and you had to be there at 6:00 right 6 o'clock the show started and so even at 6:00 did be that kind of traffic yeah yeah there's it wasn't as bad as it got it like 7 or 8 but you never really knew it could it could I was never late late but there were times I'd come in at 5:00 after 8:00 after 6:00 was pretty much as late as I would I would be it was never more than that but he would go like he never had to say anything like this music starts there's a little bumper at the beginning and by the time it starts I'd sit down and he on mic would go well I guess there was traffic Anthony just getting in and now the bosses are listening and it was it just wasn't necessary to do that you know it kind of I was like he wanted something you got to be talked about guys don't do that guys don't do that to each other you fucking sit down don't say a word no one would know I'm late you know and that's what happened and it there were instances like that all the time it's all in my book permanently suspended there's that book out now it's out now yeah borders Florence and Noble room we think we have a copy in the green oh yes very good but but I thought it's at my house it's in my house I talk a lot about obviously the relationship and and with Hopi and and how it kind of slowly came apart at the seams I think toward the end he just had had if he didn't want to do a show with with me anymore I I don't think he wanted to do a show with Jimmy either that didn't last long and I knew it wasn't going to last long they I was the buffer between the two of them that ended bad it really did it it really did if you talk to Jimmy about it like yeah yeah he doesn't he doesn't express that kind of no yeah no he doesn't like Jimmy's a very loyalty driven guy like he takes that very seriously and if he feels somebody's fucking with him he really gets pissed usually it can get talked out and everything's cool after a little while but this one who this this is some work yeah I think honestly the way you guys interacted with each other what he was good for was sort of directing the whole thing right that's the impression that I got in them I mean how many times I do the show dozens right yeah yeah I know how many times I did absolutely I always felt like what he did really well was like sort of guide things like sit back more let you guys be funny but but guide like figure out like maybe we need more of this maybe we need more of that yeah there was real value to that absolutely but do you think that's fun when you go out and do an appearance and everyone's clamouring about a bit that me and Jimmy did or something for handyman yeah and he's sitting there going like well I I pushed the button and I drove the ship and I you know winches spots and if he knew it's it's it's funny because like yeah you're not gonna be appreciated right as much but it's like a guy who is good at defense but he doesn't score a lot of points yeah yeah yeah you're not gonna be LeBron James it's necessary guys who score the points though or the ones who everybody wants to talk to you yeah you ever see uh III think of Opie like um you ever see the prestige the movie the prestige with the two magicians no and stay it's it's a good movie it's a good movie but at one point because he has to use a body double the actual magician has to drop below the stage and the body double comes out and gets all the applause and he's under the stage the real guy that did the whole act is under the stage and he shuts his eyes and puts his arms out like trying to enjoy the adulation from the fans but it's not even him getting it and I think that kind of mindset was there there's and then resentment starts bubbling up and you start doing things like saying Anthony just got in you you hold things over people's heads the contract negotiations were a nightmare every time and Opie always wanted a one-year deal I'm like what the fuck you doing let's for ten years who gives a shit you know if they want to fire they're gonna fire you anyway contract or not but let's lock them in so if something happens at least we have a settlement portion we could take half the the what they owe us for five years whatever it is not one-year deal that's all I want because he always had this delusion of grandeur like there was always something better waiting for us to grab up and it's like the truth of the matter was the the glory years of the ona shoe were gone but any W years and the you know all that crazy fucking radio we were damaged goods after the sex in st. Patrick's Cathedral debacle we we had a couple we had a contest where people had to go around New York City and have sex at various famous locations with the Hard Rock Cafe and Empire State Building things like that we had spotters who were comics or people that worked for the show follow them around and they would call us on the show and go all right we're here at the Empire State Building and he's doing it I'm watching him right now so we had Paul Mercurio who was a comic and he was following one couple around and opiate put Church on the list and I went like hmm I don't know man he goes it's just to read on the air and say like what locations are and when we say Church people go like whoa outrageous but no one's gonna go to church don't worry well Paul calls up and goes well we're here at st. Pat's and he's doing the two-point conversion you got an extra two points if you were fucking her in the ass at the location because they all had point values for how dangerous it was Pat was watching to be sure that it wasn't Paul Paul was watching yeah yeah the spotter was supposed to watch and so he had to watch this guy fuck his girl in the ass yeah yeah there was a lot of theater of the mind going on too who knows what the fuck they were doing or where I heard I hear it was in the vestibule outside st. Pat's but regardless it's sex at st. Pat's right and me know if we looked at each other we both had digital delay like the delay button seven second we have like a 30 second delay we both had buttons in front of us there was another guy in a locked room down the hall that had a button to dump out of because we would constantly doing shit that would have gotten FCC complaints so the boss installed these buttons everywhere well we both had our finger on it calling like shit do we punch out of this it's hilarious guys fucking his girl in the ass at st. Pat's and neither of us hit the button and the guy down the hall didn't hit it we just went with it at that moment is like that is one of those moments like talk about a defining moment you move your finger one inch down and that never happens it's amazing to think about what year was this 2002 I believe 2000 it was right yeah we it was 9/11 we went through 9/11 on the air and stuff and then I guess that summer maybe what year did you guys wind up on XM 2004 I think it was we we got to sit out two fucking years out of our contract not working they didn't want us to go to mornings because Clear Channel Radio which was another radio company and CBS were were kind of fighting for us Clear Channel wanted us to do mornings against Howard Stern who was on CBS we worked for CBS at the time doing afternoons so we we were put in a position where they were both just throwing huge amounts of money at us and CBS was like we can't let them go two mornings it we probably it would be impossible to beat Howard but we would take enough listeners away where you might not be number one anymore that effects revenue you know you want to you want to sell the show as the number one rated show so CBS was doing anything they could to keep us in afternoons with the same company as Howard so that it was the most lucrative contract we ever signed it was a three-year deal we signed it in I guess two thousand one and after one year they canceled the show because of the sex that st. pat's thing that blew up I mean it was in the newspapers it was I had a look at Opie and dopey on the front page of I'm like fuck off dopey I gotta be dopey I was so embarrassing my family and everything was just fuckin nuts so I the CBS was like well we cancelled your show but we're not letting you out of your contract like what does that mean we talked to our agent he goes well you can't work they're not letting you work you'll still get paid and dude I'm talking millions of dollars this was millions of dollars that they had to give us for two years but you'd think like oh that's awesome back then there was no internet to speak of like you have no way to contact your fans well you could have a website which is what other ways that we became friends is I wrote about you guys right yeah yeah I wrote a big piece on my website about how I was yeah yeah a lot of people supported us and yeah but it got in two years you just disappear on the radio it's if you're not doing a show and you're out there you will go away they will find something else so we were really worried about that and again damaged goods so no one was really clamoring to hire us anyway but we went through two years where I was just making huge amounts of money and just buying toys I would go I went to Atlantis for a couple of weeks and in the Bahamas and I was literally I was pulling my luggage to leave at the the desk and I go to my check I go what do we wear why we going home he goes okay I said can I have the room for another two weeks like okay went back upstairs just stayed for a month no reason why am I going home after two weeks you're so conditioned like how long a vacation is right and and that lasted for two years and then satellite came calling which was we considered radio prison at that point was radio Jail anyone good because everyone that had fucked up in regular radio ended up in satellite like no one wanted to be in satellite radio at the time they had no subscribers me and Opie sat on the side of the the Belt Parkway once by my house in Brooklyn and we were like let's see how many satellite radio antennas we see because they used to be very obvious shark-fin big antennas aftermarket they stuck him and drilled him into your roof it was terrible the installation process was stupid no one wanted to get fuck their car up with this dumb antenna so we're looking at one like nothing and then oh look there's one and you know the money's one thing obviously but as a broadcaster you want to fucking be talking to people you know you want you want to entertain people you want people to say wow that was good and there was just no subscribers back then during our 10 years there it wound up getting very very good and and we had a lot of listeners but early on no one but satellite was calling and we signed you know we signed the deal but we definitely would have preferred terrestrial radio yeah it's now right because now satellite it sounded like became a big thing when Howard got on it mm-hmm and people were talking about and then it became a big thing because every new car you would buy you'd get a free 90 days or whatever yeah but now no one gives a shit yeah it's it's one of the most short-lived technologies not that it's gone I think it'll always be there some capacity man it is fucking clinging by a thread so many other that's why they bought Pandora I guess oh there's so many other streaming outlets out there and the fact in podcast the fact that podcasts are all free yeah yeah and then you could play them in a tunnel right everywhere it doesn't peter out on you and you know you get that signal constantly now so it's it's not like the old days every time you get in the car like your system identifies your phone and then with links uh planned commercials I remember they started playing commercials like what the fuck is this I'm paying so yeah you can play commercials he out of your fucking mind yeah that was it was supposed to be a commercial free they all talk about commercial free and then it ends up oh if you're listening to 70s on 7 I guess you won't have to listen to a commercial but even then I think yeah yeah they started throwing commercials on everything so yeah yeah short-lived technology it's weird and then to put all of your eggs in a couple of baskets that are circling the earth always seemed weird to me I can't get it you know why I think right yeah guys when I when I went to Hawaiian vacation I got a our that had SiriusXM built into it it didn't work yeah yeah what the fuck is this you have to deal with a satellite orbiting that you know something happens to the transmitter on a terrestrial station they send an engineer up there he turns a few screws or what have you you know something fucks up in a satellite what are you gonna do like you know how we're gonna get in a rocket and fix the fuckin it's really dumb technology at this point yeah yeah totally unnecessary unnecessary in fact that serious is still transmitted from a thing in the sky down to the ground yeah yeah and then it's transmitted from the people on the ground up into the sky and then back down to the people on the ground yeah yeah that's what's going on this is so so unnecessary just the people on the ground can just send it to the people on the ground on the ground why would you do yeah especially in this day and age with the but they're still doing it it's very weird yeah yeah it is they're gonna have to do something the fuck their model I don't know like I said by Pandora they're you know maybe start scooping up Internet companies but they're gonna do I think they're gonna move towards that direction yeah I think that's all they are you know what's really weird though it's like the fucking AM radio is still a thing like like that's the weirdest thing to me the the death knell for radio has been it's been forever like the second another technology came out it was like well I guess that's it for radio yeah television we have a an amazing invention here and radio was supposed to be dead but it's just hangs in there people just can't let it go regular radio especially a.m. may I remember as a kid my dad having the am like music on the AM radio satellite was coming out of a tin can static and shit and that was kind of all you had I drove home a lucky like a year ago and just on a goof mmm-hmm I decided to put on AM radio and I was listening to an AM radio show and I had a big smile on my face all the way home because it was like I was listening to the past yeah yeah it's like a time machine right I was some weird one of the local talk shows a weird local talk show in LA where they were talking about traffic and the Dodgers game it's archaic so strange like first of all anything with anything that is trying to inform you is just unnecessary at this point unless it's you know fake news the the big CNN and Fox News and everything those will always be a fixture and stuff but local fucking news do you really need the the team that cares at six o'clock it's all just shit that you've already seen online there's not one story that will be on the 6 o'clock news that I don't already know in depth it's also the lowest rung of show business in terms of competence they're terrible at it and they're all drunks it's hilarious dude I have never seen a group of people that can drink more than fucking news people they they just get hammered constantly or miserable I think that's it I think their mom went through a whole thing when Roseanne was supposed to be on the podcast and right after she got fired she announced she was gonna come on the pod casts and so these fucking newscasters start showing up where our old studio is actually they went to our old studio and they were parked out front with cameras and this is where I got I got upset first of all you guys are terrible at this and second of all you just assume that because you're there I have to talk to you mm-hmm so because you see me I'm gonna say something to you because you put your camera and your microphone on your face it doesn't work that way fuckface yeah yeah I'm not gonna talk to you you're not good at talking yes is the reason why you do this yeah like a really good job doing this because you're not good at this you're not going at it you will one day get a really good job doing this or you're just not good at it yeah one of those because right now you're right here and I'm not talking to you this is nonsense like you're holding this fucking camera hi we're here with CBS and for news like yeah I don't have to talk to you yeah did you have a camera in front of me doesn't my we're gonna have an interview now sometimes they feel like you're obligated to address them well I trying to come to my house yeah yeah I've had that happen s not fun it's definitely not fun my neighbors I'm not talking to you they knock on my neighbor's doors and the know about me and stuff and if you think like like we deal with LA or New York imagine what the news team in fucking East Bala bumfuck like that's got to be the worst they are just terrible at what they do terrible local news in some podunk fuck town is hilarious to watch it's one of the things that comics have to do when they come into a town you have to do local TV shows morning the morning chat so thing shitty is you think the view is rather than talk shitty is those shows Morning America fucking pens get together these shows in like the local one in Boise Idaho or oh yeah Dallas thousand times worse worse just terrible and and I I hate that there's such a double standard when one of them fuck's up when a news person fuck's up they just apparently leave him alone like where was everyone with what's-his-name from from and was it NBC Brian Williams well Brian Williams they kind of got on yeah but no Lauer Matt Lauer oh yeah like Matt Lauer it was in the news or I think but where was where was the mic being shoved in Matt Lauer's face as he's trying to fucking go home or something there was some of that I think he just hid I mean he went straight to Long Island and went to the Hamptons and he's never left but were they camping out in front of his house like like they did they were yeah they just he's just been banging divorcees and riding a motorcycle to get back on TV that is just it was stunning to me is how much money he made oh yeah like I didn't know he was making that much money like that is insane and four years later for a long fuck is that like a giant ranch in New Zealand that's like thousands of acres I think I decide you need that it's so crazy because he's got some access issues like the people that want to get to certain parts of the public land they have to go through his ranch so there's like an access issue like some sort of easement well these people were supposed to be able to drive through and they're fighting it off and you should just sit at his desk with that button that opens the door but it lays a gate up so they could get through that button there's a I'm shit about that button love the bud they all had that button yeah that was it yeah it was because they had big offices and they want to be able to lock their door suddenly interrupt it on a phone call oh I wasn't so they could bang chicks in the office like women executives had that button - oh okay yeah but that's the thing that sounded very very yeah yes Audrey indeed yeah well the media grabbed onto that like oh my god he had a button to lock it like I sitting there when I fuck fucking some nervous girl just heels that click because all fuck he hit the button yeah there was a lot of that that was like accentuated like there was a one guest that brought in a bunch of sex toys and he bag and he kept it in his office and he's like oh he keeps a bag of sex toys in his office this shit in this office I got a flamethrower okay Elon Musk gave me a flamethrower yeah awesome but a flamethrower in his office yes it's that kind of thing if somebody gave me a bag of dildos it would be right over there next to the flame thrower he has a bag of dildos unless I made a conscious decision to throw it away or my god I found it it would wind up getting tossed but Matt Lauer decided to keep it in his fucking closet yeah I don't know apparently he gave some people some I think the guy was getting laid yeah that's what I think and I think a lot of what else happened the all the the details of it it seems to me that it's it's all of it is like very blown out of proportion I don't like that that that's happening because everyone is being lumped into the Harvey Weinstein category which is the that's the Busey for the fucking pyramid right there Cosby's the tip right right Cosby's literal one yeah he's literally number one yeah yeah there was a woman who said this on I believe it was CNN or one of those talk show she said he may very well be the biggest serial rapist in history and you even fucking bill Cod literally sitting back on my couch going yeah biggest serial rapist yes tree Wow a time machine would be wonderful just to see people's expressions when you tell him like what's happening in the whole celebrity a forum like like what's uh hey Cosby's doing never seen a photo of Howard Cosell yeah next to Bruce Jenner and OJ Simpson poach and it says I've seen the future and you're not gonna fight it leave this fuckin crazy when we were kids we used to watch The Cosby Show yes when it was when he was Bill Cosby the stand-up comedian that will go on HBO and everybody loved him he was American loved her America's dad right there The Cosby Show revolutionary on television he was at that time raping them insane not just raping them but drugging yeah and and friends daughters like oh he knew come on over I'll help you with your career Wow plop yeah drop to and you're fuckin drink and if you don't okay put your feet up that's why I stick my dick in him and that hazy like a few of them just hazely regained consciousness for a minute and just remember seeing old build pounding away with the that fucking flounder I I think he got the I later in life yeah yeah I think I'm not sure I thought they were using that as kind of a sympathy thing but he looks pretty fun flying and him the same jail they sent Whitey Bulger oh wow yeah boy and he's he was what 95 or something like that Whitey Bulger was he that all I think it was that fucking all like in his 90s that's off that's a grudge that someone held on to for quite a while well the guy hated rats apparently and that was the thing that Whitey Bulger all throughout his time of running the Irish mob was ratting people out yeah yeah that's what was really crazy he was another guy just like we were talking about the fucks is named the Italian guy yeah Gotti god no the other one Oh Sammy the boy he was in the mob ratting out other people in the mob while he was murdering people yeah yeah like the FBI allowed him to sell drugs and do a lot of he won the lottery twice while he was doing this you know how that works how the wall of snow Ellis would win the lottery and he would use that as a way to show income so he would pay them for their lottery ticket or steal it from him whatever they did it and then he would say look I won the lottery and then he would win the lottery so that way he would have all this money laundered and could avoid tax evasion charges that way you have a proof of income that's why I'll get that boat where'd you get that Cadillac where'd you get that house yeah yeah yeah that's that's fucked up twice you know both y-z to win it twice he was yeah he was the FBI was helping him to obviously they were giving up competitors and well they they were responsible probably for some murders yeah yeah they would bring people to him like that that was a thing like hey we're not gonna kill anyone but we'll bring this guy to you so you could have a little chitchat and you know you're driving the guy to to his death yeah pretty much so he was living in an apartment in Santa Monica with some girl just talked a lot and apparently she was yelling at him and that's that's how he got arrested like like a domestic yeah there was like some screaming and yelling and they were weird and that was what got people looking at them like who the fuck are these people and then they started mean he wasn't even like hide in Montana or anything no no right out there on a ranch somewhere in the middle of nowhere where no one's gonna be suspicious yeah who's in fucking Santa Monica in an apartment that is fucked up crazy I don't understand like how it's gotta be the the the most stressful life to lead just on the run i watch that some of those shows like Cold Case Files and when they find these people you know their inmates are saying about the brutal prison hit on Whitey Bulger trying a job Oh Mike that's like Rosa oh Jesus Christ yeah it's a he definitely got what he had coming to him I don't see how anybody could argue that apparently yeah so no sympathy he's a shit just amazing then he's 89 made it to 89 89 what was patrice like 40 when he done yeah yeah yeah how's that work I have no idea but yeah I mean he must have been looking over shoulder constantly while still in his wheelchair he was beaten to death with what it may call shanks locks a lock in a sock a dr. Seuss weapon while in his wheelchair before possibly having his eyes partially gouged out with shanks oh yeah that's some real challenge tried to chop off his tongue Wow sometimes it works sometimes jailhouse justice actually happens you you don't you don't you don't think it will but then at times sometimes sometimes sometimes people get what's coming to them yeah how do we get on the subject of Whitey Bulger III don't know we always just loved it so yeah yeah I love that you've established your own sort of media company I love you decided to just yeah start your own network yeah but is it is it are there challenges like what we do is pretty simple because we just put it out there and then we put ads on it right you know and yeah or YouTube puts ads on it but is it is it challenging to like I mean you you have a bunch of people like when I was there other folks were coming in and they had their shows in the studio as well and they had you change your green screen you know you should change yeah yeah it's the more convenient way to kind of instead of having a different set for every show it's a green screen and then we just pop it in a pop in a background we could do some pretty funny things with it - we've done that I I did a reading last week of a part of my book and we went to an establishing shot of a cabin and I moved to a chair behind the green screen and it's just me by a little fire burning and I oh oh welcome I didn't expect you and you know so it's kind of fun to be creative with the thing other than that yeah there there are a lot of challenges it's I I am NOT I'm in front of the mic guy that's it I don't really like any of the other parts of the business visit it's weird just this is the EO of the business or I I'm the guy Keith though is the guy I've delegated a lot of the responsibilities as to the tech end of everything and finding the people we need to run equipment and stuff over the course of the years and it's worked out very well but but it is one of those things like it's it's two companies you have the entertainment that's going into the microphone and then all the shit you need to get that to the people yeah and the business model and and you know billing and and all that shit that I can't fucking be bothered I have video games to play I can't be bothered with that shit so you operate on it's a subscription people pay by the month and ya get a ton of shows they get the mike Ward show yeah yeah Mike Ward who's in here last week yeah and they get Aaron and Geno doing in hot waters our morning show and they're just out of fucking control they are the one show that I watch sometimes they go like oh wow that's I wouldn't do that yeah yeah oh yeah yeah they're brood are they comics yeah yeah they're comics in New York and they tour around really funny guys then so this is the this is the page with all show yeah I I pilfered Bill Schulz and Joanne no satinsky from Fox News they used to be on Fox News a red-eye and stuff oh really East Side Dave is an insane motherfucker from the old Ron and Fez show what's in hot water in hot water is the morning show that's uh yeah that's Aaron a Geno Kevin Brennan who is just a mental patient Kevin scares me he yells a lot I come into the studio and I just hear his voice booming yelling and I get an anxiety attack like it's my dad yelling at mom back in the old days yeah it's just a you know we're always looking for how many shows you have on shows that fit I don't know how many is that shows available like to stream like anytime you want yeah yeah every show most of the shows go out live I like the element of just a little danger there of of being live as it goes out me too I like that yeah and I don't know what it is but just knowing you could edit something might make you a little lazy as you're doing it you can't stop yeah Jamie brought it up like it feels different and we've done shows and aren't live yeah yeah it does if something happens we're streaming at one point time it fucked up we couldn't stream so we just edited it and put it our filmed it in advance rather and put it up later but it's this feel feels weird it does it's because there's a net there's a net down there you could you could leave if you had to take a piss you could go I gotta take a piss I got you know this is you're going out live this is it hi here it is I like I like that yeah yeah that's something there's a feeling that there's people listening right now right yeah and everything's archived so subscribers can get all the past shows from all the shit is available can they download audio as well as video yeah yeah audio only audio and video yeah it's it we give them a lot of options we went with subscriber based because when I got the boot from Sirius years ago I couldn't imagine people wanted me to be Hawking their products in the first place and and I didn't want to be beholden to sponsors right I can't have anyone telling me what I can and can't say anymore just ain't gonna happen but is there an issue trying to get people like I had a friend who was on radio and they left and went to do a podcast and a subscription podcast yeah and what he was saying is it's really difficult to grow like you have to keep those people that you have you have to keep him happy and he they would do things to engage with them and they would do like little events where they'd go to a bar mm-hmm meet everybody and do a show from there he said but it's really hard to grow because people don't want to pay when there's all these different shows they could just get for free yeah that's that's always a challenge but there's also the commodity that people can't get anywhere else is entertaining shows like you could have a free show that sucks right and there's plenty of those out there but if you're good at what you do and you already have an audience because I say it all the time Corolla had the greatest line once he was being interviewed and someone said how do you how do you make a successful podcast he goes oh okay rule number one be famous and it's like yeah you gotta so I figured if we get up and running in a month me and Keith figured it out that we could hold on to a lot of the ona audience that would come over and subscribe quick get up yeah and that's why thank God I had that studio already built in my basement yeah I was able to all we needed was the logistics of pumping it out onto the Internet in a bigger number than I was doing at 3:00 in the morning we were doing some of them outside too yeah yeah we'd set up the camera out by the pool like my first guest was dice which was hilarious yeah dice came by we sat by the pool and then later on he went downstairs into my basement I that karaoke stage and he was singing Elvis karaoke songs it was hilarious and that's one of those moments we like dice is in my basement singing Elvis fuck did that but yes so that model works for us and it's been working but I'm kind of seeing you got to keep on your toes in especially a technology-based business we were just talking about satellite radio like you know you just can't tell what's gonna happen you really got to kind of look for future trends and whatnot and maybe more of a hybrid thing because it's a balancing act of bringing new people in and like you said keeping the people that are there already but bringing new people in with some free content so maybe a tiered subscription thing where there is a free level with sponsors but then a tiered premium level hmm with the material that we've already had maybe past shows or something or extra content but so we're we're always trying to think of what might be a good option when I first fired this thing up we had no fucking clue I mean this was usually you would kind of do some kind of a research testing or whatever marketing analysis of de parts and shit like that and I just I was like I could I could be here by 4:00 p.m. how long is it y'all gonna be six two hours for six I could I could go out at six and then I don't have to be there until 4:00 p.m. that's fucking easy still lets me party Monday through Friday fuck that I want the three-day weekend all the time for the rest of my life Monday through Thursday and then we have programming on Friday in the slot that I'm supposed to begin during the week so it just I wanted I didn't want to fucking be driving myself like that yeah forever so cut back on the hours the days and it worked so you know I'm very happy with that but again you know we're always assessing and seeing what we could do to kind of build it because it is that trade-off of audience like obviously we're not gonna get as many people watching on a subscriber base than we would if it was free with spots but you know do you want to cut down on the paid subscribers and boost it up and then how far do I I go with advertisers where somebody can call them and fuck me over now and do I truly have free speech now or as free as I can be with a subscriber base so it's a balancing act I see what you're saying like you don't want to totally abandon the subscriber model because then you're at the mercy of subscribers of advertisers and it gets like we have advertisers now we have a couple of them that we pop maybe two spots on a show and I do it they're all live reads so I make them fun and funny and you know people like I learned that from Howard years ago when Howard would go to spots before he was syndicated to when he had all the time in the world sometimes he didn't even know he was still in a commercial break it was just funny so I try to keep it light and fun and add in things so it doesn't feel so intrusive but I don't live and die by sponsors it's not it's kind of supplements the subscribers stuff so that works and and I don't know maybe I'm paranoid because of my past that that sponsors might get pissed at what I'm saying but when I look at the shows especially the shows I've been doing in the past a year or so they're not as harsh as they were I was really fucking angry like five years ago when I started this whole thing I can't believe it's almost five years already that I've been doing this at compound media and I was just pissed and the show was a platform of like venting and and revenge and like I just I wanted to fucking yell and and be pissed about things and bang the desk about politics and society and and it it came off as very angry and then as as time went on I realized like people were telling me god dude just be funny like just joke about shit and you don't have to be serious like I thought for some reason I do almost like a political show because of the fact that you had gone through so much shit yeah yeah I was resentful I was pissed and and you know it's uh it's one of those things that really carried over onto the show but in the past couple of years I guess it's been especially with bringing Artie Lange on board for the eight months he was with me it's very difficult to get into any kind of commentary on society with Hardy lank sitting there how it was odd it was great I mean you know the the preface everyone gives his fucking love Artie he's hilariously funny so quick and and just a goofy knock around regular guy but the demons man the demons it was it was kind of rough to deal with like I said I'm a relaxed guy if I already didn't show up one day I do the show myself didn't he do the show with Opie for a while no he was a guest on an Opie show and and I guess Opie approached him to be a co-host or something he said no okay but yeah I was never part of the show I thought he was gonna be part of the show yeah there was kind of a rumor going around for a while so when he came on I was like it's not gonna kill me if he doesn't show up you know for a day every so often because I'll just do the show myself but it it turned out to be a little more than that and there were some days that were real good in other days where it was a little frayed around the edges and you know redundant he's got different kind of demons yeah like Beelzebub he's got like the main demon he really does man and it's so fucking sad to see cuz I mean there's no question about the talent there he's he's hilarious and a great guy great guy you always hear that yeah I always hear that yeah I remember when we hired him it was I was at the Comedy Cellar and Dave Attell came he goes so you're working with already like yeah goes well welcome to the wonderful world of the 3 a.m. phone calls and not being able to find him like oh fuck what did we get ourselves into and and that's kind of what we got ourselves into but again I mean I had a great time his he's one of the funniest motherfuckers especially on a mic like that the the who would think that when Jackie Martling left the Stern Show they'd be able to replace him with somebody that was just funny as fuck and and have legendary shows with with Artie on and you know he he definitely earned a place in in broadcast history but we just you know after eight months it got a little too crazy too unpredictable and he needs some predictability what was what was bad about it well it was the the attendance issue was a little odd like a principal yeah yeah the attendance he wasn't he was tardy and and there were some days he was fucking just most days he was awesome but there were some days where you know the heads down it was kind of kind of a little iffy and you know regardless I know he knows that too I mean he's he's he lives in that body so you know he knows it so it was a little odd and then we picked up Dave Landau who's a young comic out of Detroit he filled in a couple of times when we had him as a guest on the show and then he filled in a couple of times during our tease few sabbaticals that he was away for a week or so and me and Dave just hit it off he's got a great sense of humor he's a little twisted he's got a great backstory the guy was just a fucking piece shit for his stories about like drunk driving he crashed every car he had he was arrested 15 times before he was 18 like just a disaster and you're look at him now he's got a great wife a beautiful kid he's working comic and he's awesome he he knows how to co-host my show he gets it he we don't step on each other he he knows exactly what to throw in and when so really happy with with Dave Landau he's great thing only did one show with him the last time I was in town yeah he's great yeah he's a he's a good guy dude yes smart and really decent like it's so weird to see people that you didn't know when they were such fuck-ups and fucked up cuz like you know you almost want to go alright come on we'll just drink one night I want to see what a disaster you are you know yeah because you know you just don't know how fucked up people can get but you never know he's he's a decent guy yeah I like what you're doing man I love it I love that school you're doing something different here and you you basically you got put into a corner yes said all right I'm gonna figure my way out of this it was a lifeboat at first it was really expanded it now and it's p.m. it's become a really interesting thing yeah and and I never expected it I I gave it a lot of thought in between being fired and when we finally fired it up compound media I was like what do I do - why do I go fucking buy a ranch somewhere in the middle of the sticks and get guns and write a manifesto or something or you know I didn't know what to do right no one was knocking on my door to fucking give me a job so when the idea came to do this it was pretty much all right I want to do this and regardless of how many subs I get the overheads gonna be barely anything it's me in my basement doing a broadcast so I wasn't really worried about the number of subscribers or anything like that and when we launched and it was really successful during the course of that year we started getting other shows Legion of skanks the guys out there big Jay oakerson and this Dave Smith and no no they have their own thing lewis jay gomez yeah they got their own thing on their own network but for a while they were doing their show from my house which was so weird it was like because you need their legion of skanks with them they have their part of their show is that live audience so I'd have people coming into my backyard that I didn't know from a hole in the wall that had driven out to Roslyn Long Island to sit on folding chairs in front of the guys and I'm walking around my basement like who are these put like this is a little weird it's a little intrusive but it's cool but it and then it really started getting fucked up because during the summer months they'd all jump in the pool so now this swimming at my pool people the Legion of skanks was in my pool and it was the weird it was cold we'd all just you know have a few beers talk you get to know people yeah so it wasn't that bad no one ever did anything bad they respected the house and everything which was very cool and then Gavin was doing the show we got Gavin on board from my house and a lot of times it was at night so I'd be upstairs on my couch watching TV or something he'd finish up come upstairs and sit on the couch and be like hey man what's and I'm just like I just don't want to talk I talked all day I'm just I want to watch TV so it became a little weird and and after a year keith was like let's get a place in the city it's easier for guests yeah so we got a place at 35th and 7th right near Penn Station which works great you know I take the train and now I don't have to fucking drive into the city although that's another nightmare the Transit Long Island Railroad but it just works out better that way it gets me out of the house it's a separation of personal life and and yeah the the job so it works out I like the podcasts in my house too I think everybody does my little kids he'd hear in the background screaming at each other my mommy she took my thing you know because they were really little at the time - yeah owned it for nine years holy fuck yeah oh my god no time yes I did it in my house and then we started doing some of the ice house and then I got a got a place got a the last one yeah yes you just went to remember that and then as the show got bigger I just said let's get a big place this is this is insane Joe I like I don't know how much you've shown the people on your show do you venture out and show them anything because it's it's insane it's a fucking airplane hangar this is giant and everything in every corner is cool like it's all just cool there's four uh you got weights and mats and and then that that hunting thing that archery game it gained it's amazing it's you know it is a game to scores like you compete against each other yeah you're firing real arrows with your compound bow into what is that Kevlar a Kevlar screen the tips are flat like the top of a water bottle so slaps it it doesn't penetrate yeah I went to a gun range a couple of times on Long Island that also used a video on a screen that was made with giant rolls of paper one horizontal one vertical and a censor would read the light that would come through when a bullet hit and that would record where you shot and accurately show that and then after too many holes got in all you have to do is wind the paper a little bit on each one and it it miss aligns the holes so now you got a whole new sheet of paper to shoot at oh yeah and and it was very cold to be able to shoot at video targets of you know the bad guy yeah well it's just like really good for real-life situations I think that thing's amazing yeah you you you're not just looking at a bull's-eye like a typical target face you're looking at the crease behind the shoulder where you're trying to hit the heart by the way you nailed that one like the second one you did it was a deer just a video of a deer standing there and it's moving it's not a still picture and you drew that back and hit it exactly in the crease behind the leg yeah that was a hard shot really cool this fucking game is very addictive though you'll be out there pulling that bow back you fuck your shoulder up yeah yeah pulling back 70 pounds all day long yeah it's gets super addictive Lee think about how addictive it is to play video games oh yeah I think about competing against another bow hunter and you're talking shit to each other playing this game yeah here walking out in the field yeah that's really great practice for actual bow on it yeah you could tell it's very accurate to wherever that wherever that bolt hit it's fucking right right on the money very very cool though this place is awesome you know this place I can't even you you were you know you took the ball and fucking ran with it man you really did this is amazing just an amazing accomplishment like you're not--' you're the guy like like people you like oh you're gonna Rhodes podcast oh shit he's the guy you like ended up being the guy because of you awesome man because of being a guest on ona and then watch crazy having a compound that's absolutely where it all started crazy I just want it when I was doing that I it was trial and error I would go to B&H photo in Manhattan and just buy shit and take it home hook it up and go yeah that don't quite work throw something in the closet get something else and slowly built up what I needed to have it work my goal was really to have lower thirds and video over my shoulder and and look into the camera with the teleprompter so it looked like the news yeah but it was done by a drunk guy who's you know good to go off and just sing karaoke horrible language like that to me was always funny like it was a parody of a real TV show I wanted to look good not just a grainy camera with it Xbox headset lightly just talking about this at the comedy store the other night we were watching the news it was on the television and we're saying how much better with the news be if you get a couple of us and get fucked up and start smoking weed and they're just like but the real news like actual real stores like oh shit fuck that guy just did an of the news is just with comics like I've actually after doing that at The Comedy Store watching that talking to a couple friends I've actually thought about doing that like having a nightmare right yeah or a morning news show it's just a show where one hour the day is just like you get the AP feed yeah yeah all the news feed and you got video to go with it and you do a stoned out or drunk new show yeah we Alex we we have a guy Michael malice that does a kind of a daily wrap-up show at 11:00 p.m. and it's hilarious because he'll put like the other day was talking about Tucker Carlson and the graphic comes up and it says Tucker calls it but it's a picture of who the fuck was it Sean Hannity it was a picture Sean Hannity and he does shit like that all the time and people like dude that's not Tucker his wife no it's it I thought it was but he does that on purpose like he fucks with the graphics and the the ticker at the bottom and everything and it's really weird it's really funny he's he's a smart guy - oh he's a clever little shit yes so but that's the shit like that is great we did it we did an election show during the presidential election a couple of years ago and Gavin was on that one and we had all the big American flag waving in the background on the green screen and everything and and we were calling it like a sporting event DiPaola was there and it really turned into like a football game you're just going oh my god we just got Florida oh it was so and it was we were all drinking and laughs and it was an election coverage like the news would do but we were just hammered and laughing our balls off them what do you think happens to Gavin now well no one bounces back from this that kind of shit it's so dry it's a different kind of shit that he's in right now cult leader tell like he's in this they've they've got David Koresh yeah as now says he's got the Eye of Sauron on him yeah once that's on you it's very hard to shake that fucking thing off of you yeah if anyone can do it it's Gavin he's been really reborn a couple of times like he was supposed to be after that trans thing not really uh they gave him a lot of shit for that anybody wants to come it was his company yeah but that's like professional stuff that's not like a showbiz stuff now he's in this weird showbiz exiled yeah yeah well he's on let's see our TV yeah he's still real he does a show there yeah fuck watches that I don't know you know III see clips of him but yeah it's was that what did see our TVs it's another kind of an internet forum yeah but more straight news kind of based why would they have him on it he was on there he got hired by them maybe a year or so ago if they were trying to do something straight he's not like well he's kind of the goofy I think the goofy aspect of it then they'll have you know the regular straight-laced guy why don't you have him on compound anymore uh he got a better offer to go over there you know I'm not gonna hold anybody back here why are you don't you it is weird though because you can be stricken from the record as they showed with Alex Jones yeah they just holy fuck did they just get rid of him he's a non-person they fucking took every aspect of his feed off of every bit of social media and it's obviously a coordinated effort yeah yeah this is one company that also competes with another company they all just universally decided on their own independently yeah now they coordinated that I can't stand the I am an absolutist with free speech I and and I know the fucking line it's a private company you can do it they want freedom of speech is about the government and this is it it's like yeah but are you okay with that yeah are you okay with the faceless corporation deciding what you can watch and see and hear and who can speak based on nothing but this arbitrary ideology that comes out of a building like I don't like that I want anyone to have the ability to speak about anything they want no matter how repugnant it is like like meet it with lively debate well here's the here's a perfect example forget Alex Jones let's talk about what we talked about earlier Laura Loomer versus Louis Farrakhan yeah you where's your consistency you got to explain to me how that works how does how is it okay for the guy on Twitter to be calling Jewish people termites mm-hmm I mean that that is that's something you terminate yeah yes it's Nazi Germany type yeah exactly how is that okay that's okay with you but then I mean how about look it's it's works that way on the left as well like how about that guy that just got kicked off a CNN right he was talking about the Jewish people in Palestine and then he's for Palestinian Liberation and they were like fuck you you're done like this this decision that or the the thought processes involved in decisions that they make is not based on rational thinking and objectively it's so arbitrary you just don't know it's based on which way the culture is swinging you know and the culture is is swinging in a way that avoids any any possible accusations of racism if you think in any way platform you're gonna be thought of as racist you avoid that because there's some people say horrific shit about white people oh yeah yeah they don't get banned literally calling for their death and and yet they don't get that girl that got hired by New York Times and was a massive uproar because she had so many anti white things on her Twitter oh yeah yeah the the asian girl yeah yeah yeah i mean just all that ridiculous left-wing woke nonsense you know they you're allowed to be completely racist against white people massive generalizations against white men in particular yeah yeah it is it absolutely is discrimination and it's absolutely what you're doing is you're being prejudiced but you're being prejudiced with a stamp well you've got a stamp of approval yeah yeah yeah you're allowed to be and I love that just rules that are made up that are ridiculous like you're a racist I can't be a racist right I'm this or that or that I can't be sexist I can't be this I mean it's like who's making these fucking rules up exactly and how come I am not privy to any of them of course I can I can call on any of these roles did the beautiful thing about that is that hypocrisy will eventually bite them in their ass and people who are rational who listen to the argument against it though you you absolutely can be sexist against men yeah absolutely can course and you are a feminists are 100% sexist against men there's this feminist that I follow her fucking Twitter picture the image the big one the banner one yes says trust no and okay well good fucking luck cutting out half the population don't trust them how about trust all women you gonna do that well yeah great congratulations because you got about 15 to 20 percent cunts and that's you're gonna have to trust all them yeah yeah good luck you got 80 80 85 90 % maybe good gals yeah you got a you're polluted well got a polluted population just like the men know the population of men is a polluted population of women if you if you thought that you were gonna get pure drinking water without dropping in those purification tablets you're gonna get charged there's some shit in there yeah you're gonna get you gotta get sick yeah that I there's no there's no 100% on any of that so when we saw the whole believe all women think that happen turn the Cavanaugh hearings and whatnot I didn't do that bit the other night did I know okay I'll tell you something more fair that's it's it's it's crazy like the idea that anyone would say believe all women is as mental as saying believe no women it's the same stupid thing because there's gonna be assholes is gonna be pieces of shit I I was saying on the show the other day like no one really wants equality no one equality isn't good the the fight for equality is where it's at right and you never want to attain it because then you're not special anymore if you're fighting for equality that you're always a victim there's always a an oppressor and you're fighting that once you're equal you can be called a shithead you could be called stupid right everything else you're just another face in the crowd with another stupid voice that probably shouldn't be heard so no one ever really wants equality no matter how much they're clamoring it was get a chief you're gonna find some reason why it's not right why it's not valid and you can still say that you're you're being victimized by something is it currency in it yeah yeah there is there's this definitely equity and being a victim and not being equal yet yeah but you're fighting you can say things that other people can't say right we see it all ties you can be completely prejudiced you can do a lot of things you could never do if you were another race yeah and now you see this uh that avenatti guy that lawyer just hilarious he hate the whole believe all women lit and then like a fucking movie script it spins around and bites him right in the s where he's like I didn't do that she's lying the fact that it happened so fast Israel like if that would have been hilarious if it happened two years from now yes but the fact that it happened right after yes it's just beyond hilarious well like the AC uh Asia Argento chick right yeah the other one the one who was accusing Harvey Weinstein of raping her right and then turned out that she had you mean it's basically what it what do they call statutory rape when you have sex with seventeen year old boy which yeah I don't think it is yeah I don't think you think it is either but the laws the law and the fact that it came out and that it came out that Bourdain had paid this kid uh during the whole time they're all just believe all women and like don't believe that one yeah yeah yeah that one you probably shouldn't believe this is this is a problem you had a real fuckin problem and the fact that all that went down you know I mean it's just when these things play out like this it almost makes you wonder like god I don't I don't really believe we're living in a simulation but if we were living in something that's designed to almost it instills this lack of appreciation for reality yeah that it seemed it all seems so bizarre and ludicrous and it keep people keep like when when the Anthony Weiner got in trouble for pulling his dick out I swear to god there was part of me that was going this doesn't even make this is so so obvious it's so like right there yeah yeah so on the button yeah this won't even subtle enough a lot of that stuff it seems like everything works out too much like yeah it's scripted yeah like during during Trump's campaign I kept saying he's got a win I go this doesn't play if he doesn't win this isn't rocky won this has to be rocky to he's got a fucking win it not about the battle and the bravery and that he's got to win this for this to work to really highlight the theatre of the right right he's got to win yes and some fucking one spot Theatre of the absurd I mean that guy president with his fake hair sprayed in with the white around the eyes it all seems so fake everything he says he says the way he looks like yet everything is insane I still every time I see him walking down the stairs Air Force One I'm just like holy fuck Donald Trump is the president like what what kind of wacky world a really wacky world really wacky yeah the other day and I am black your world when he was given that speech about Elvis and it's just like people telling me I looked like Elvis that's what people have told me if I wasn't blonde I look like Elvis and and it's like no one told you that even a little bit like Elvis no one ever told you that maybe your belly right when Elvis was sitting on the ball for the last time but that's about it how about when that reporter confronted him look at the two of them together picture people tell me I look like the king maybe oh my god a little bit about the upper right-hand corner one have you ha ha have you ever seen anyone trap anyone okay well okay that fat my favorite fat Elvis of course thousand memes now yeah yeah have you ever seen someone so committed to a comb-over for so many years like so committed it's not just a coma it's I don't know what addition it's a wacky contraption walking up the stairs of Air Force One where the winds blowing it behind you see the whole back of his head is bald yeah where's the hair coming from it was like a fucking Vader's head without the helmet it's kind of looked like that weird like what's going on you never know where it's starting and where it ends in how long it is it's like look at that oh my god that's just a picture the the video is more to Derr because you see the flops yeah yeah chaos well how about you know he didn't want to go out there for the 4th of July memorial because he didn't want to get his hair wet his hair wet in the rain that was a yeah that's what they were saying what I don't know that is such a weird thing like he it was a set of September 11th that's what it was the president 9/11 oh is the Veterans Memorial is a Veterans Day isn't it like that the president is is a guy that's so like insecure yeah that there are ever for decades he has to fucking do a fucking Dairy Queen ice cream fucking move on his head every day so he's fat like yeah the thing is like if you're really concerned so much about your looks or high why are you fat like while you're at it I don't think he thinks he's fat I think he's like one of those guys that you talked about having a body dysmorphia body dysmorphia they just he looks in the mirror and sees Elvis like young leather-clad Elvis yeah he's got this weird thing you know where he doesn't believe in exercise because he feels like the body is like a battery and if you put any energy and it's gonna wear it wears it out well the motherfucker is up at all hours the dirt during the campaign for the midterms he was doing three rallies a day flying all over the country and he never seemed to be like he was falling asleep or losing energy so I don't know what he's doing well do you know about all that he says I get exercise I mean I walk I this I that Trump 71 said during the Oval Office I run over to a building next door I get more exercise than people think I run over to a building that's amazing my exercise is incredible he's on allegedly according to one reporter he's on diet pills and he's been on diet pills forever and then there's a prescription that they mean he he actually even cited the exact Duane Reade pharmacy where he was supposed to take this for like a little while he wound up taking it for years I was taking some form of amphetamines for him in this day and age you would be fucking stunned if you found out how many journalists how many people who are writers how many people that are Nationals how many people that work or on adderall um oh yeah Ethan I'm in I mean I live in an area where there's a lot of people that have money and they work real hard and because of the fact that they need energy I know a shitload of people that are taking adderall yeah folks that are in Hollywood folks that are in finance all sorts of different yeah I know quite a few also yeah they it's everywhere man I mean it's it is such a you know the difference between methamphetamine and amphetamines the difference in meth and what you're getting when you get adderall is so goddamn close yeah yeah so close but math it's crazy yeah you take that your fuckin your meth head the only difference is how quick it hits you yeah literally the only difference and then the dosage that you get is obviously regulated if you get adderall right right I don't know I I'm not I'm not a pill guy I never have been what do you got here Jamie we pulling up it says here about being on a treadmill Oh awesome block I was on a treadmill for the first time actually in quite a while and it was a very steep angle and I was there for a very long time he said they were surprised and they said well you could stop now that's amazing haha and I said I can go much longer than this if you want me to hey Trump I got a fucking right now buddy I got a challenge how about you join the silver October Fitness Challenge oh man hop on we'll put that strap on you we'll see what's up see who's amazed [Laughter] everything is over the top with Trump it's so good that dieted successfully before have been more of a believer in diet cuz I'm strong you know I've always been more of a believer in diet cuz I'm strong you know hit the ball far I mean I'm strong physically he said that is so hilarious we imagine wrestling him how weak he must feel like just a bag of jell-o just bush it's all cushy the bones are barely held together a thread like what are you talking about your stream is all far I'm strung I mean when he said that he would beat up Joe Barden that was my though that was like yeah peak ludicrousness yeah yeah he's like what you beat up to Joe Biden would go down fast and hard that's what he said dude the fact that they're talking like that again absurd it's so fucking funny that well and Biden has said the same thing I keep I'll kick his ass he's a plate when did the Truman and Dewey trade barbs like that back in the day is what is he saying Nixon and Kennedy they asked me what I like to debate this gentleman I said no I said if we were in high school I'd take you behind the gym and beat the hell out of them meanwhile I don't believe that I think Trump would kick his ass I really do Trump is meaner and I think Biden would make a mistake yeah Trump better behave it uh he would swing and he would slip and he would fall and he'd fuck his knee up and Trump would kick him in the face like a soccer ball he would get lucky and he would walk away and Biden would be holding his teeth and blood coming out of his mouth anybody told you when the best the best ever and he'd get away with it yes like he gets away with a lot of things and there'd be a lot of dick Trump's ass and get back at him but it would never manifest its it would never come to play no no it's like what's going on now it's like where people thought stormy Daniels gonna take him down and then it turns out stormy Daniels beat some chick up on a porn set and and now she's after avenatti also because he apparently isn't giving her an accounting of where all the money that she raised online was going to and he apparently filed she said he filed that lawsuit against Trump against her wishes she didn't want it done and now she she's not getting an accounting of the money it's hilarious he has a decimation said she lost yeah now she has to pay his legal fees so this naughty naughty guy's hilarious he wants to run for president just another dummy in the mix another dummy listen he's another guy chaining himself to a building it's the same thing it's the same horn right he just wants attention I should talk to guys in Hollywood he works in Hollywood he's like a high-level guy he's got a respectable job and he's like we need a guy like that like that avenatti guy on our side it doesn't talk any shit why he doesn't take any shit a guy who could call Trump out on his bullshit and I'm like what are you talking about man like what are you talking about this guy this lawyer this guy's the guy you think you need running the country are you serious it's a disaster they wanted to believe that he was the guy right it fit the narrative yes we need a guy like that we need a good guy like Trump you know right what Keith Oberman is this is what all these people are a good guy who's gonna tell him you fat fuck you fucking liar you piece of shit well the Trump Trump has nothing to lose is what it is like Trump could say anything and he does because were they gonna do what they're gonna do he's one of the things about diet pills they were putting about and feta means and they were reading down in this article all of the side effects of ocean and it's like mountains of grandeur elevated sense of your place in the world all he is the president elevated sense of the president wow that is a I'm the president of the world I think he thinks he is but yes he's working but if he's the press the United States you're basically a pretty much present in the world yeah yeah I mean at least if there's a number one through 10 you're number one yeah yeah who's definitely number two they think that is that's number two no it's not Oh his Donald fucking Trump Donald a one of my favorite very quickly Vincent Lee she was she said I would like to be President that's what she said oh yeah yeah liking to be President well you should never be president then cuz that's not what the job is that jobs not some shit you put on your resume right I like to be President I'd like to like a cookie yeah yeah that's what it comes off as I would like to be the queen like that I would like if you kiss my ass I would suck my toes what would you would like it Trump like it that's why Trump comes off as like just a bad stand-up when he does those rallies and everything yeah like you could tell when he's squinting at the the prompter and he's like we as Americans must live above and then you see his eyes open he's like so let me tell you about he's on prompter and that's when I go oh here it comes here comes a winner and and when he when he talks about ice and he's like the men and women device just amazing people a job that none of us want to do we don't want to do and then starts the crowd work this guy over here look at him he didn't want to do it see his wife knows he's what like he's doing crowd work like fuck it's the president it's so fucking bizarre do you remember that one 90-minute speech that he gave this rambling nonsense that people go this is the day the presidency unraveled it was two years ago that shit was forever he's still unraveling it's it's it's not even unraveling it's just who he is do we go back to the you know this guy the hole and what we need to do cuz guaranteed in 2020 that's gonna be the pitch against Trump we need to return to some semblance of society it's gonna be a young Democratic Socialist type character that says a lot of things the young people want to hear right and then it's like a completely anti-racist anti-homophobia trans right so that's the right that's what I think and you're someone who can hold it together and some doesn't have a good fucking Beelzebub in the closet yeah that's getting tougher and tougher to find these days man there is some shit just fucking graveyards falling out of people's closets and it's the people that want to be in power that all have these fucking skeleton yeah yeah that's what's the weird thing these people that want to be in power yeah I think it's hilarious like you look at the politician like you just described at a rally or a speech and behind them it's just it's so well choreographed like every nationality is represented and you know you just see it looks like something out of a fucking Star Trek episode that hats from different lands and all kinds of things and it's like that to me is just as fake and and potentially like offensive as just the Trump background that's like white trash it's like Laura Dern running Star Trek or Star Wars it's like just bring it back yes it's like oh okay I see what you're doing not the Lord turns a bad actually she's a great actress but then that role when she's like telling the pilot to shut up listen stop guys a fucking straight-up killer without their flying a pilot he's pilot spaceship getting down evil robots I want to blow up the planet yeah he's really gonna be intimidated by laura dern I remember when we first started running this Empire shop no sound fuck up she's force-fed just force-fed that yeah these really obvious this theatrical plays at diversity and inclusive yeah yeah recive nests and you can tell that they're like they've pushed everybody there's no authenticity to there they're messy not like they have to push every correct button and say all the right notes and make all the right sounds it's yeah yeah it's like this thing they're they're they're complying it's a compliance thing right much as it is an expression of who they are as individuals yeah yeah you have to be compliant with this new this new way people are thinking and behaving but but it's so ham-handed like like it's really over the top it's obvious it's like a guy named Weiner pulling his dick out it's not too obvious it's too clunky to write in the head you know what I heard that some of the movies that are coming out I think they're doing a girl version of bad boys which is like why the fuck it's just again it was bustard like Ghostbusters which was such a success and then I saw this there is how my little girl kicked off a Twitter yeah yeah like goofing on what's-her-name there Leslie lessons yeah yeah so I read this the other day there's a Broadway show of King Kong is now a Broadway musical and they have this amazing kind of marionette gorilla on the stage giant fucking thing and the girl it plays a and arrow and and now a new girl has been cast she's black now I'm like this the whole gist of King Kong is the fact that it's a white broad yeah like the whole island is full of black chicks whoa this is this marionette King Kong Pixar what's up with his face I don't know they had to make him you know almost you know how the characters looking the Lion King musical something yeah yeah it was that that's all a marionette yeah it's like a fucking it's on cables and and shit there's people working it and oh how strange if you if there's a video clip of it and you see it kind of move it's a it is Strauss yeah we got to see a video but like I said the whole fucking thing is based on it's the white chick yeah like like it it's part of the story you can I can understand you can cast a black actress and a white actress apart is that but when it's so integral to the story that this fucking guy yeah is that's sick that's amazing yeah yeah it looks pretty fuckin badass but where's this fur get out of there buddy wow this is amazing yeah isn't that sick and a fuckin out Broadway stage they got all this that's going on it really is that really is amazing they got the teeth lit up and everything yeah the lighting is pretty important and pretty badass so this is the old one the old one used to be a blonde chick yeah yeah no not anymore you know we're gonna get a black trans man yeah I mean the whole gimmick is that congas been on this island with black chicks yeah and he sees her and just loses his fucking mind yeah I have a whole bit of bike you heard it the other night it's the fucking brilliant it's so goddamn funny it is true it's like yeah that movie is like the most racist movie when the remake came out I think it was a Peter Jackson remake came out patrisse went off on it yeah and did a whole thing about what the movie represents and what the chick and the gorilla represents there and it was fucking brilliant only as Patrice could have done it and he you know he nailed it do you know the movie frozen the little kids movie yeah I never saw it a girl who can fucking turning things into ice yeah I think there's a Disney version a live Disney version that they've decided to do and in the live Disney version they're the girl is now played by a black girl uh-huh but it's it's a blonde girl who lives in like Norway yeah it doesn't to have her be played by a black girl when people went crazy they sent all these emails in like this is outrageous like what are you doing it's like yeah but I feel like these companies they it's there's too many people involved right it's not like a compound media it's just Anthony cumbia making decisions right right with something like Disney you have this board and you probably in in California you have to have a certain amount of women on the board right magically Pamela's peeling you have to have like equal representation of everyone everyone's super concerned about diversity like paraphrasing pitch to show and when they want walked in there the first question they said he pitched the show they go okay where's it diversity where's the diversity like he was pitching a sitcom yeah where's the diversity he's like I'm just pitching you something funny I pitch you a funny program yeah yeah okay we need a we need an Asian man I need a black woman we needed this and that and again like we were talking about it's so obvious that it becomes distracting yeah like I don't want I don't want to have to watch something that that diversity is just forced in there right because you notice it and now you're distracted and you can't really enjoy the thing like that King Kong thing like howdy how do they do the part where the the the natives on Skull Island Kong is just like I a get out of here but this one is like all this yeah like there has to be something different yeah and it's definitely the hair color and the skin cuts just what it was it's regardless of how horrible it is or whatever has it's just the way it is grow up right move on I yes time has passed you by old man old white dude yeah Oh old white dude doesn't like when a black woman gets real if it's sorry for all black women oh so there are so many instances where that's fine and no one would notice and whatever I don't even I don't have a problem with Hamilton or whatever they want to cast founding fathers as black and Hispanic dudes whatevs go at it but like when it's an integral part of the story it's most of the story it's the reason really loses his mind right falls in love with the white chick I'll hold he's he's on camera in the movie he's there losing his mind because of the white chick yeah just don't make a movie right then just don't don't make the movie does it make the play yeah make the play we're gonna have a black woman of color yeah yeah woman of color that's that's my favorite criticisms is how dare two white people have this discussion without a person of color well that's true yeah yeah it's the colleague that shit for this but it's from who yeah that can go fuck themselves who preposterous idea the idea that way hold on Anthony before we go any further let's bring in a person of color yeah yeah a person of color how should we we are we were two privileged people we shouldn't be discussing is that is true you can't even communicate about something no no you can't and all we hear about is how we need an open and honest discussion about race and then the second you try to have one well shut up don't talk about the one that everybody keeps ignoring do you want to know what's races Harvard tries really hard to keep Asian people out yeah yeah making it way more difficult because Asian people are far better at school than white people just the way it is and they have to balance that they it would be full of Asians but so what if everybody was got accepted for qualifications yeah that would be asian harvard but it is amazing the people that are rallying against racial discrimination don't look at that because that is absolute racial discrimination but on the other end of the spectrum right right you're taking these people that are there are minority there are small percentage of the population and they vastly outperform most other groups yeah yeah and because of that harvard has made it more difficult for them to get in and now there's a giant class-action lawsuit against one of the most liberal and progressive Institutes of higher learning ever racist they're fucking undeniably racist that is a racist yeah it's race against the superior people it's absolutely based on nothing but someone's race ethnic background yeah and they're they're doing it yeah so they're doing it for now for now but but you don't hear about this from the social justice warriors and Bader's they wanted to go on about white privilege and you know yeah it really is but look I just like bringing shit up that I notice and and if I notice that they're squeezing diversity into something that doesn't need it III think it looks it's like I said distracting and it's out of place and then other things like the other day I noticed and and you probably shouldn't even say it that the Mars probe that just landed on Mars and they showed the control room at Jet Propulsion laboratories and they're all as plotting could possibly be the least diverse room I've ever seen in my life a bunch of white nerds that's all it was there were a couple of like big women like like kind of you know lesbians lesbians in there but for the most part it was every nerdy guy grown up and landing a fucking speck a billion miles away on fucking Mars it's it's insane because when it push comes to shove you need the people that can get the job done right and and if it's that room of people it's that room of people you can't artificially diversify something just for the optic and get the job done they had everyone in that room had a reason to be there and I assume it's based on qualifications but if you notice that or mention it I'm sure I'll be called a fucking racist for that yeah for sure don't ever notice things guess what the rule is don't notice trends don't notice things feel like that's going away though yeah we do so I just I don't see it the holding I just I feel like it's a bright wave of nonsense that's hitting us and it's gonna balance back out and rational thinking is can here's the thing like this is where the things that drives me crazy it's like you know address your white privilege recognize your white privilege no you know why I'm not racist okay so if I'm not racist you should be concentrating on racism you shouldn't be concentrating on people who don't experience racism because they're fortunately white because I didn't do anything right yes by being but what they're doing is they're putting you in a position where you're all is guilty and once they put you in that box they always can shut you up because they're the logic is not very good so the discourse is not it's not well thought out it's not really nuanced so because of that they want to be able to just push a button and shut you off right that button is the white privilege button but that's you're looking at a but you're looking at a reality yeah do white people have it easier than people who get racially discriminated against yes sure the problem is not the white people that have it easy the problem is the people that racially discriminate yeah yeah so you're looking at the wrong thing so you're finding someone you want to make them a bad person just by being the you know the the thing that you've decided is the oppressor yeah it's a racist thing everything is the same level whether you have an opinion about something just voicing an opinion about something that involves race or sexuality or whatever it is and literally calling for violence against yes people have a certain it's all in the same category when it's ridiculous you could have your personal opinion on anything that that is sensitive these days like I said race or sexuality or what-have-you it doesn't mean anything unless you use some kind of negativity or oppression or something against the person because of your opinion until you do that you just have a fucking opinion right and and it's not all that dangerous patrice used to say that too it goes I never met a racist in my life was I never met one never sat down and had someone calling the n-word or anything like that it goes never met one he's been in the wrong places maybe the knife take him some places but but it's like let's say you have somebody that has a low opinion of of black people and used your going to a bar you sit down and there's black dudes sitting there and you watching the Yankee game or something and go uh he goes hey look at that the Yankees have win it is is the guy go to turn around and go fuck your and drop it in bombs in it or is he gonna go yeah I guess so like like there's there's levels of alright they he might have an idea about it but until you start exercising that I don't honestly you don't see a problem with it there's terminate and they have discriminatory ideas about all sorts of things it's just when you allow some but don't allow others when you allow discrimination against white people but you don't allow it against black right yeah create resentment when you allow discrimination against men but don't allow it against women because you feel like women have been victimized so it's our time it's our turn well no it doesn't work that way it doesn't work that way especially when you're talking to people that aren't rapists right yeah call everybody a rapist and the people who aren't rapists go oh okay so you think everybody's a rapist well you well you're fucking crazy and then they start changing what rape is right yeah yeah well that's what they that's kind of what they've done I mean obviously the like the louis c.k situation I know that is so people are so divided on that one and my opinion is if if he didn't do anything make anyone do anything against their will he's just a guy that has a strange proclivity you know he likes jerking off in front of people apparently the cats out of the bag there yeah but like with those girls that upset 20 years ago were they that upset 20 years ago that that now it's an issue or with a giggling where they let like I need to know how they were then because I don't give a fuck what you think now like at the time what was it okay was it cool with you did you sit there and fucking rib elbow to the ribs with your girlfriend go look at this guy jerking off in front of us to me I don't care what what time is done because the the the the way something looks the morality or ethics or respect that is expected in 2018 ain't what it was 20 years ago right so you can't be held liable for something you did 20 years ago when it was normal or a little strange or whatever the fuck it was well I think it's always been weird to peed off in front of people that's an odd thing to do I think about it is though he asked if he could write and this is something that I've brought up to be buggle you know and people say oh you know he would lock these women in the room and be it off tomorrow stop okay if you guinness if you're gonna like push this you're saying that because that fits your narrative he's this abusive person who's his power now here's another problem with that when this was all going down he wasn't very famous no that's just a - so what power was he abusing he he was a successful comedian he was admired by his peers because he was really funny yeah he wasn't louis c.k like the super star filling out Madison Square Garden louis c.k yeah it wasn't the same guy you know he he didn't even have all the HBO specials and all the Netflix specials yes yes same guy so he was just another comic that liked to beat off in front of people and he would ask first so when you say that he you know forced these women and wouldn't let them leave none of them say that in fact he asked and when they said no he didn't do it he didn't say oh well good you don't want me to beat off that'll make it feel even better when I beat off in front of you shut the fuck up and sit down you know he doesn't doing no no he was asking which is which is so strange but weird it's not it's it's not in the same realm as as Harvey Weinstein's not even fucking know it's not even close it's not even close but people don't want you to rationalize now don't want you to grade things they just want to talk about abuse all abuse gets shoveled into this one little pie chart area like this is male abusers yeah and then they'll put Matt Lauer right next to Bill Cosby right next to louis c.k like well this seems kind of crazy and then when you say it's crazy like Matt Damon said let's I think we should make a distinction you become a rape apologist if you say things like that and it's weird because it's odd because even saying the word rape these days like a little red flag goes off in your head like how did I say that did I sinful did I say it evil and it was a sound evil or salivating right don't be salivating don't smile when you say it's very somber mnDOT's this I use the term all the time because it's the only one that really fits Orwellian yes everything is so strange now it if you read 1984 years ago you couldn't fathom things getting like that but man in some cases it's Eve worse than than expected do you think there aren't uh none person you don't think there's an unbalanced unperson yeah wipe them clean from the fucking that's it yeah the this new speak words are twisted like it means the opposite of what it was supposed to mean and and it's something that you never thought would happen I always thought like we read a book like that or some other kind of dystopian story you get like a like an orb is supposed to be some kind of orb with the government looking at you and yeah don't do that sir 26:53 Oh to sit down and and then it's like oh fuck it was us oh we're the rats yes we pick up our phone and we're at each other out and we're big brother like we turned out to be the bad guys yeah the collective it's not the government Dave like a like like oh boy you're gonna the government's gonna put a tracking device on you fuck that he comes to my house and once it but I'll shoot him I don't care oh you forgot your phone don't don't leave your house without your fucking tracking device yeah like it's the same thing and they do use those in crime case scores everything is presented as a convenience when I first got EZ Pass it was like this is awesome I don't have to wait on a line a tollbooth and throat change in or something I'm whizzing right through and then I see a story it's like Oh easy pass use in a divorce case to see what the husband was going here or there that and it's like oh that's handy that's handy and then you see on the Insurance commercials it's like use this safe driver thing it goes in your car and it acts like a planes black box and and it shows how safe you driving they'll reduce your rates it's like really it's not gonna be used if I'm speeding again into accident for them to go yeah we're not paying your fucking thing because obviously we read that you were speeding and and and didn't stop or like it's all presented as a convenience Alexa you literally you're TVs they all rat you out it's Alexa isn't this magic thing that everything happens internally that shit sends everything you say out records it somewhere and then sends whatever it's supposed to give back back to it and that's what it is but everything is is saved and do you really know when it's listening and what when you're taught you say certain thing I had Alexa for a little while I don't know why all I ever did was like Alexa whether it would tell me the weather I could have checked on my phone and then it started doing things like I'd just be watching TV and it would be like I don't have an answer for that like yeah I don't need that shit I don't know what it's doing I don't know what it's listening to dialogue from the television from maybe the TV maybe it's just listening to every fucking thing I say I think and sending a transcript you somewhere things you say because then you could go to the app on your phone and every question you ever asked it is listed there in text fucking form swear to you every conversation you have but the goddamn thing is somewhere well hey wow dad what are you worried there you go well hey hey hey long as it keeps us safe right right keeps us safe how about yeah if you're not doing anything bad well in 10 years will this be bad in five years just like shit that of 20 years ago wasn't bad now it's a fucking crime right you'll be exiled from society I don't know what if what I'm saying now can be brought up in ten years and you know when I play video games I say some pretty nasty shit yeah I don't want Alexa or or my smart TV to listen to every fucking thing I say and record transcripts of what I'm talking about and we bring it in our house no one's forcing you to put this fucking ratignolle's you you you paid for it you spent money and you put it there and plugged it in yourself it's amazing how we went from not trusting anything I remember when in online shopping first started me like I'm not putting my credit card in there now you laughing what are you kidding you just drove through 2020 face scanners license plate scanners to get here yeah your card is being picked up by a sensor so they can target advertise you in the mall so there's no privacy anymore and we love it we love that there's no privacy I don't want to go to the mall for Christmas let's go to Amazon and now there's a list of every fucking thing I buy at Amazon that's being sent to everyone all over the place you think you got privacy fuck you you can't even move to a Montana anymore in a cabin and be off the grid it just doesn't happen so I love Jessie the body ever see Jessie when it does I'm off the grid I'm I'm going to Mexico and I'm off the grid and it's like he's got a show called off the grid it's like well yeah you're on the grid right I'm a fighter governor ease yeah he's off the grid but he's constantly on the grid there's no off the grid anymore there's no the whole world's gonna be on the grid yeah the whole world that's what I can expand these satellite imagery things for my internet yeah doing that as well were they gonna have satellite internet available everywhere all over the world all over the world everybody up to speed and I was talking about this with somebody else isn't it amazing that GPS has worked for as long as it has yeah flawlessly it's amazing how good never a problem inch by inch like literally tells you turn right and you're right they're amazing and I think we have the dumbed down version like the military has that the premium version like sure but yeah by this by the inch and we have you know by a couple of feet but it's to me it's amazing that like it's worth to this long never goes out like oh it's really I had it on cd-rom in my car in 1998 stylin yeah I had the early version of that and it was a big stupid thing that had to sit on top of the roof of my car to catch to catch the satellite like a disc or sounds like some some weird antenna that had to go up there yeah they used to have to have to pick up the GPS how come the satellites aren't any different but the receivers are like can be a lot smaller and fucking phones in your fucking picks up while it's in your pocket they're tracking you while it's in your pocket in your car as you're driving of course when it's off when it's I I don't trust any of these electrons I use them I'm not gonna throw my fucking phone away and and if I do forget it there's no more horrifying feeling then driving away from your house and going oh fuck yeah I don't have my tracking device and you will turn around and get it because you can't function without it it's everything to people again if there was that EMP or whatever the fuck it is that just zaps the the grid you would see pandemonium yeah in no time well you would see pandemonium if just the power grid went down for any reason if some yeah like a terrorist attack took out the power grid yeah we need power way more than we think we do oh absolutely you just think nothing of we in New York we had the hurricane a few years ago five six years ago I guess it was and the one that took out Jersey and Long Island and stuff and we went nine days without power in in the house and on Long Island and you could see it fraying around the edges man society just the first couple of days you'd be on online at the gas station to fill up jerry cans to take back to your generators at the house and it's like oh okay excuse me oh no you were first go ahead go ahead by that seventh eighth day it got fuck you know i was standing here go fuck yourself get to the back of the line now could you imagine if that was you trying to get your kids medication or something or food like it just goes a little longer and now moods getting a little scares you are gonna have a problem and i'm stunned it hasn't happened to any extent really we saw we saw it close with katrina i think and violence started that was that was a little out of hand but you zapped that grid and give people they have nothing i wound up getting a giant fucking like a cummings generator this thing like is for backup power at hospitals so when the power goes out in my neighborhood literally my pool is running floodlights in the backyard every tvs on it comes on automatically just sit there and fuel with it's a liquid propane I have two one thousand gallon tanks buried in my front yard why so it would it would it would last for all long fucking time lungs and I defended on how much you use because the more the more draw on it the the heart of the engines got to work so it depends if I'm running my whole house it would last a few weeks and it's safe to that propane to be in those cans oh yeah underground now they're in giant tanks but they're running natural gas into my neighborhood so I might have it converted over to natural gas but I like the fact that if the gas breaks - I can still at least Jack a an LP truck somewhere and fill up my own tank you know push came to shove but it is just every light in the house can be on my neighbor hoods dark I'm just looking out like an ass fuckers yeah yeah a few times I'm waiting for a big one though like I really want to being bad blackout just like and they're gonna know that you're the guy with the power let's say the guy with the fridge that's where the guns come in like it really it there is something a little creepy about the the prospect that we are really delicately balanced as a society it could really fly apart we trust too much that the powers just gonna be on yeah that the waters gonna run that the food's gonna be at the supermarket or whatever the fuck it is like you got a great advantage being able to hunt you know many people don't know do you know what American refugees would look like the fat fucking mess crossing some border to Canada to be saved from some Cataclysm that happened down here what a bunch of fucking just weak soft no nothing every convenience they've used for years just not trained in the feeding yourself outside in the wild you have no idea give her skin an animal you ever kill something to eat do you know how to get water from just the humidity in the air or you know there are things that we just don't know because we depend on technology and we trust that it's always gonna be there because it has been I mean you know we get very complacent but that's why if it ever failed oh fuck you better hunker down something clearer it's crazy indeed and on that note dude we just did like four hours under it it seems like it flew right by it did floor that is nuts Joe I got a Thank You Man thank you I love being on your show for real you're the reason why this all happened it's crazy now people know it's fuckin nuts I I love it I love it was good see thank you very much cool oh the poopies gentleman yeah he's got a book out permanently suspended available anywhere go to compound Mediacom for all the details all right bye oh yeah awesome [Music]
