here we go in three two one Rick Baker ladies and gentlemen how are you sir hey I'm great Joe everybody's been saying no my Instagram I should do this podcast for ages well I'm glad they listened or you listen brother I've been a fan of yours forever man I was a huge Star Wars fan when I was a kid and you inspired me when I was young I really wanted to be a makeup artist I wanted to do special effects and the kind of stuff that you do I had no idea yeah man I think it was probably Star Wars that kicked it off for me because I like many kids a lot of people today you know we're so removed with first VHS and then DVDs and laser discs and now streaming it's so easy to watch movies but when Star Wars came out we would go see it over and over and over again it was like a little contest between a lot of kids that I went to school with and I think I saw it 13 times while it was out in the movie theater but I became fascinated I've always been fascinated with comic books always wanted to be a comic book illustrator and I always loved like like those fantasy novels like creepy and eerie you know those those graphic novels but I really became fascinated with special effects and particularly makeup after your work well you know it's kind of the same thing for me I mean I you know I I grew up in I was born in 1950 you know I grew up in front of a TV but it was a little black and white one you know and there was always the monster movies on Saturdays you know and or Sundays and that just stuff just hit a chord with me and I just thought I have to do this you know when did you what was the first thing that you did first first ever makeup yeah I did well I mean you know I was I'm an only child my mom wasn't supposed to have kids because she had a bad heart and stuff and but they wanted children and but I was very shy I stayed in my bedroom I couldn't talk to an adult and stuff like that yeah the very first thing you know I got interested in makeup and I got some just white greasepaint and black greasepaint and smeared it on my face and just with a layer of grease paint on my face when I was looking in the mirror it wasn't a little Ricky Baker anymore and I could do things that I couldn't do without this shit smeared on my face yeah uh it just it helped me overcome my shyness but I mean it it started with that but I mean I but I wanted to do something more you know so I ended up making I made my first mask I think when I was 13 and it was a curse of Frankenstein Frankenstein and I did that one mainly because I thought I could copy that one make it look close enough because it's it's there's some crudeness to that makeup I've actually it first didn't like it but I like it now you know I mean it's when you find out how the film industry works and poor Philip leaky who did that makeup had like a week to prep you know and no money so I did I forgive some of the faults with it well it's great will you stop and think about the earliest versions of makeup in movies like special effects style makeup in movies you know you go back to like Nosferatu is probably one of the very earliest right I mean they really didn't have anything to go with there wasn't anything to copy they kind of had to make it up yeah and I mean the you know the thing is the Nosferatu is such an Emmy it's a great film it's a great still to this day yeah and and the look you know I mean it shouldn't work by all right you know it's like a big hook nose you know no but it works great and but yeah it's same thing I mean lon chaney had nothing to work with raw spirit gum and grin and he did to this day someone still the bit my favorite makeups and some of the best makeups and I think the limitations in a lot of ways made the makeup to work better you know I mean now we can add so much stuff and I find that happen so much now like with that face off show and stuff people it's more like about how much can you pile on someone's face you know but sometimes the most effective makeups are Justin genius a little bit of things that you do and a lot of the humanity show through like launch any and in Phantom of the Opera a great makeup yeah that's a terrific and Cheney was just brilliant and yes I'm great at making scary faces that's how I learned to make scary faces watching Cheney movies yeah he's another one there's like there was not much to for him to go on there wasn't he was kind of like a pioneer yeah for sure and I mean again like I said it's still some of my favorite makeups that and you know Jack Pierce's Frankenstein's monsters yes again crude materials you know he you know it was and you know poor Boris Karloff what he had to endure I mean that is and isn't none of the makeups he did on force we're comfortable you know with cotton and spirit gum and collodion collodion or if you know you might know because you fight background kind of stuff but it's a plastic that used to use it to close up boxers wounds and stuff um it's like kind of this liquid plastic but it smells horrible and you know to be working around someone's eyes with his fumes of stuff and yeah I mean he'd had to put up with a lot so it's kind of like a glue yeah it's kind of a liquidy plasticky stuff we keep up a video of Nosferatu what year was that twenty I don't know nineteen twenty to twenty that's crazy yeah you stop and think about that you know film itself had only been how old then yeah not very yeah you can get a video of it yeah his just the whole thing about the way he moved like everything it was so creepy and interesting well no whole film him he's just beautifully shot I mean so many of those silent films I mean the photography is so incredible you know I mean I wonder how what they did with the fingers like how'd they get his fingers well those I think those are just his hands at this point you know I mean later I mean in in like the John Barrymore dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde mhm you know they'd I remember reading and Famous Monsters which was again my like my Bible you know did you get Famous Monsters at all yeah oh yeah you said creature you know sure you know they they said you know John Barrymore did the whole transformation without makeup you know and it's not true he's got finger extensions on right pointed back of a head you know yeah but yeah it's nice right - brilliant so what did they do for his ears do you know well I'm not sure what they're made out of same with the bald head I mean I know rubber existed then I mean you can kinda see I mean he's got I I think it's probably just like a slip rubber which is like a you know he'll what we Halloween masks are made out of ears and bald head and nose yeah some sort of prosthetic nose right yeah and those big pointy teeth but again I mean with you if you really kind of analyze didn't look at it you you think this is stupid it'll never work you know and but it works great and I also think it's because Max Schreck was great yeah does some really cool things with his hands and stuff well if you didn't if nothing like this existed and it was dark out and you saw a guy like that in your house you would freak out well you know that's pretty terrifying what it's not somebody in my house anyway yeah someone's smiling with you yeah yeah it's just it's such an interesting time capsule when you look at these films and you look at something like like Nosferatu from 1922 and then you look at what we're doing today with CGI in a lot of ways I mean I'm not a fan of CGI I'm not a fan of it in terms of like for monsters month it just seems everything seems fake there's the suspension of disbelief is higher than if I'm like what you did with American Werewolf in London what one of the one of the more brilliant things about it was the special effects and the makeup were fantastic but they were these really quick scenes it was like you saw it for a second it was burned into your eyes and then and then it vanished yeah with it what John Landis said to me is that I'm I'm never gonna really show the werewolf for more than a couple seconds mmm you know I hardly even want to show it then you know right and what was great about werewolf working on that film with John Landis was he you know said you're the expert that I went out four legged hound from hell I wanted to make a biped werewolf you know we argued about it it was basically you know he wins he's the director you know but he says before they get home from hell make it and I did I mean the first sculpture was what the final thing became same with everything in it the Nazi demons all that stuff mmm you know cut to you know like when I did the Wolfman I mean it did thousands designs and and you know all these producers are going well maybe if you do one between this and that anyone between this and that and or maybe this poor should be over here you know and that kind of stuff just is so soul sucking yeah yeah and it's one of the reasons I retired you know I just it but to this day I mean like on the cover of my my book is the sculpture from of the one of the Nazi demons from American Werewolf and a number of people said this is like one of the greatest designs ever you know this kind of stuff and it's people were production designers and stuff and it was it's pure Rick Baker without right and that's what I thought the industry would be in right which it isn't for the most part well it's just everybody wants to it's the same with comedy it's the same it seems like it's the same with everything everybody wants to put their greasy little finger prints on it and and say that's the reason why his nose is like that was me yeah I told Rick Baker you don't know what you're doing yeah you got to make the nose wider yeah no I know that's and it's you know it's watered watered down the designs yeah like I said it's all sucking I mean if and when you know you know it sculptures take a long time and you know you said we sculpt every pore and every wrinkle and everything you know I have like magnifying glasses I wear on and doing this and after you spend you know hours and sleepless nights doing it and then some guy who doesn't know what he's talking about comes in this as well you know why don't you do this you know well they're disturbing your artistic vision it was just it's I mean when someone contributes money and they're the ones who get to decide whether things get made or not made you know just they think they're artistic as well yeah it becomes a disaster and it's the thing you know I mean when you see a movie or TV show others forty seven producers yeah you know it used to be they were show people and it was a guy you know for example on gremlins - Mike Finnell who is the producer who came from Roger Corman school of filmmaking you know so you really checks every penny and but he was a guy I could go to and he go what he would look at everything and go why is it why is this why you're buying this and you would explain it to him and you go okay that makes sense and there'd be a person you could talk to and you could get an answer from it now there's like I said forty-seven producers and nobody will commit to anything you know it's it drove me crazy and you know I mean I it was I I did make it because I loved it and I was I feel so fortunate that my hobby he became my profession and he did well and got Awards for it and stuff and for something I would do for free you know but it got to the point where I was just becoming a bitter old man because of all this and I just know I have to retire and I want to make things for myself well I still can you know almost 69 years old and you know having trouble with joints and vision and all kinds of stuff you know and and I I'd be pissed off if eyes working on some movie it's a person producer that but didn't know what he was talking about and I screwed up my work you mess with your head yeah it's time to just you know make my own thing and I'm loving it you know like what kind of stuff are you doing now I do all kinds of stuff I mean I I still do makeups you know for fun I've actually cast up some of my own I've saved all the molds I cast up some of the old Star Wars stuff animals and stuff and I've do animations I make models I make little movies but you're just doing it purely for the joy of it painting and sculpting it's just like it was when I was a kid nice Muslim my bedroom was my workshop you know I and it you know I'm surprised and still alive you know I was I had a bunch of toxic chemicals in the same room that I slept you know and but it's you know it's what I've done since I was a kid is how I have fun is how I entertain myself you know and and like I said on my Instagram everybody's going you know I thought you retired and I said I retired from the film industry I didn't retire from being a creative guy I mean this is who I am this is what I do it's how I have fun that's awesome you know as much as the process was probably annoying with the Wolfman the end result was cool I really loved how you did it and you made it old-school it was kind of like almost like the original Wolfman but like read you know redone yeah well I was a fan yeah and and you know and I think it's I think that - I mean people who love what they're doing and to come up from a fanboy point of view you know it's and it's something I think that producers don't understand because they're all about making as much money as they can and they think everybody's trying to cheat them out of money and stuff you know it's like there's so many times I would say you know why did you hire me you know be if you don't you're not letting me do what I do right and it's like well you're the best like what let me do what I thought may be the best have some faith you know I mean you're making it so I can't and the Wolfman was a case like that I mean it was a battle through the whole thing and that was one of these things with thousands of designs and changed this one thing but I thought that you know in the end the original director left right before we started filming they brought somebody else in and I just said we don't have an approved design I'm making what I thought I should make seven months ago I did a test on myself that basically looked like that we don't have time to screw around new director isn't gonna have a choice which I don't think he was really happy about but in the end I mean I thought you know that movie was a closest thing to an old-school horror movie in a long time it was but it also had the feel like a lot of people fucked with it it felt like it was missing an individual or singular vision well it's every movie now yeah that's so frustrating to hear well I think Tarantino still pulls it off oh yeah yeah no I mean he's a rare guys that still you you watch a movie and go Jesus Christ like the shit that he gets away with that's a Tarantino movie like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that is a Tarantino movie there's not like if you told us all that movie and you said who made that movie I'd be fucking Tarantino that movie if they didn't they're going to jail he gets away with so much in his movies seem like his movies and he's a family you know he knows movies really well yeah and no I mean thank God for him you know I mean I really enjoy his films and it's I met Quentin I was at a film festival in CJIs Spain it's a science fiction fantasy film festival as a guest and I was there that's where I met Peter Jackson we actually he sat next to me in a screening and we became friends and and he had his movie brain dead have you ever seen that no oh it's really good yeah our Lee fun it's really gory but funny gory and really clever but anyway see when did he make that well this was like in the 90s or something I guess I I'm real bad with dates you know but anyways we were sitting and talking and and Freddy Francis who was a director and a director of photography for did a lot of Hammer movies and and stuart freeborn was there ever sit in this thing and there was a big kind of goofy kid walking around you know and and I thought he was just like a fan so I said come on over and sit down with us you didn't only started talking and go what are you doing here and you know he was obviously like an American he goes I have a film here you know and it was Reservoir Dogs and we went to see it and I actually left in the scene where they're torturing the cop it's funny people think I like gory gory stuff you know because I've done it in films but real stuff and if it's really intensely done on a film like that was mmm I mean I thought he was gonna let this guy light this guy on fire that he's and where he's got the cop in a chair at one point I said I can't I don't want to see this so I left and so did Wes Craven Wow yeah and we went and he got so jazzed by that you know Wes Craven couldn't take my movie and Rick Baker couldn't take my movie is so cool ya know it was and that was a great thing I mean like I said I was my introduction to Peter Peter Jackson and we became fast friends we kind of had the same background it's like you what you said to me about wanting to be makeup artist and reading those things I know so many people like that you know you know Danny Elfman we said that to me oh yeah John Fogerty likes that yeah I don't they wanted to be makeup rest but he really likes like that stuff you know slash you know a lot of these a lot of these different people and you know and they went into rock and roll instead of that you know and but you know I never veered off that path I mean from from age 10 this is what I wanted to do and I didn't have a plan B and fortunately it worked because I I grew up very lower middle class and you know wasn't in it didn't know anybody in the film industry you know and when I finally met somebody I was 13 and Universal Studios just started their tours and I talked my parents they said you know you're gonna be a teenager it's a special birthday you know what can we do you know and I said can we go to Universal on the universal tour you know and in my head I was gonna hop off the tram and run into the makeup department and they were gonna hire me you know but on the way I knew that are you familiar with Don Post's masks the dump Oh Studios they did a universal classic monster masks they were in the back of Famous Monsters and stuff okay but they did these really high-quality masks that were like $35 in the 60s which was way beyond anything I could ever afford but everybody every kid monster kid coveted with those masks you know and he his studio was in Burbank near Universal and I had seen him on TV talking about how he was biting Universal so long he got close that's my dad if he could maybe look in the phone book and maybe call up Don post and we could go a visit and they were very gracious you know my dad is sending to my son Ricky likes monsters he makes masks and we're in close by can you come by and they said sure you know gave me the whole tour Wow yeah and on the wall in Don post Studios was a picture of Bob Burns who I had read about in my monster magazine see he's a collector and he's done some makeup you had a mummy suit and a gorilla suit that he made and and had his phone number and I wrote it down and I again been I was still pretty shy and I got my dad to call this guy who I read about in monster magazines and he was the first guy I ever met in any anywhere related to the industry and again very Bob and Kathy you know welcomed me into their home he told me you know he showed me how to do a scar out of a cutout of Martin's wax and where to get the stuff and Max Factor and and he just was like one of the first people to show me stuff and he worked at the local CBS station and introduced me to the news the guy who did the news men the makeup artist pseudonym made up the newscasters and he was like blown away by the stuff that I did he goes I'm gonna take you to the makeup union and it was like 15 at this point and so I went to the makeup union with a box full of heads and masks and make pictures of makeups I did again naive thinking that they were gonna say start tomorrow yeah the job and the business rep of the union said you know give up kid you're never gonna get in you know that you have to be born into the industry it was a real at that time at that time there was a lot of nepotism I mean there's still dad to add yeah but he says you know if you were her Westmore you know you would get a union card with your birth certificate yeah old man but nobody knows you know know anybody you're not can he said first of all you have to be 21 to serve an apprenticeship Elvis 15 he said there's gonna there's only a few apprenticeships and they're gonna go to a West more to a Bauer you know somebody who was a named makeup artist or a relative right and he also said the kind of makeups that I wanted to do which were monsters and good stuff you say that those jobs are few and far between and most of the time you're gonna be mopping sweat off of some bitchy actress hmm and it was kind of like trying to crush your dreams well he kind no it kind of did but it also was like you know what fuck you I'm gonna show you and and I did definitely did I mean boy was he wrong yeah turned out to be the greatest of all time yeah well I don't know about that I think dick Smith is the greatest of all time but well you have to think that I can't believe you didn't get the book I'm sorry I'm gonna make sure well there's a there's a picture immediate Wow that was from a newspaper article in my local newspaper oh and I think it was a sophomore in high school and that was the first time they called me Rick Baker monster maker yeah that was that's from high school that was yeah I was think I was the third no I must have been like 14 or 15 or 16 something like wow man you were committed to the path oh I mean my bedroom had it was all masks and you know of the roar did you ever do the roar of model kids yes yeah dad yeah yeah I mean that was one of the big regrets that oh when I got married I thought well I got it grow up yeah you know really models I got rid of the models I've regretted it ever since those were so cool you paint him I remember those I think I had a I think I had a Creature from the Black Lagoon one did they make a creature yeah yeah that was that was an interesting film right because that was a that was a unique turn on makeup where they took this guy and they kind of put him in sort of like a scuba suit slash reptilian thing that was one of the cooler makeup works for the time it still is it's still the best man in the sea yeah really well done pull that up Jamie Creature from the Black Lagoon that was like what was it 50s yeah and if that was the West more regime Jack Pierce who did Frankenstein the Wolfman all the classic stuff was used old-school techniques during the time when other people were doing foam rubber and a new regime came in Universal and all of a sudden a jacket a pink slip you know you're you're out you know these movies yeah very cool yeah go go with the larger one in the lower left corner Jamie what you see the whole body yeah I mean what cool design it is and it was designed by a woman Millicent Patrick who she nailed it she did but she didn't get a lot of I mean Bud West whores regime got the credit for when the movie came out with some that yeah when some publicist found out that a woman designed it it was they did a whole kind of Beauty and the Beast campaign and apparently bud Westmore was furious you know he goes it's my work it's and he was he was famous for posing with other people's stuff you know I mean a very fine sculptor named Chris Muller sculpted the creatures head anyways and I think he did the abdomen and some of the parts and he also desculpe the metal oni mutant from this island earth you know the big yeah and there's a there's some pictures of Budd Westmore holding a really inappropriate sculpture tool next to the sculpture and from what I heard he would whenever the publicist would come to take pictures he let give everybody a day off for the afternoon off and then he would go up to the lab and pose what that's so disappointing you know when you want to think that all these people who take credit for all that work they did the work yeah and I tried to do that and it's funny because you know so many people mean I never wanted to be businessman you know and I never even thought about that aspect of it you know that I'd have to have employees and all that you know I mean either and I hated that I didn't I mean that was something I didn't care for you know and I resisted being a business man I didn't have I wasn't listed anywhere my company wasn't listed I didn't have a letterhead I didn't have business cards how the hell I don't didn't have an agent you know how the hell I ever was successful I don't know other than that fact that I worked hard and my work was pretty good you know yes unfortunately I don't work down for me like I said certainly did what was your first gig like what was the first first professional gig that you got where it was like holy shit I'm getting paid to do makeup well I mean the first time I ever got paid actually did I think I did a a makeup for a stage actor who wanted to be old and I charged him $75 and which was you know more money than I ever gotten from anything before like I said just came up with a number in your head yeah well I kind of somehow figured it out no but anyways I did these pieces for him and he lived off that Pasadena Freeway that one it has a weird right angled off ramps you know and my dad drove me there because they couldn't I didn't drive at the time and and he actually had a makeup kit and had some hair pieces in it a bunch of stuff and he said you know I will trade you this instead of giving you $75 I'll give you this makeup case and with the pull of this stuff and I was like yeah that's really cool you know but my dad wanted to teach me you know responsibilities and stuff and this was around the time I I think I was like 16 and was gonna try to drive and he goes you're my insurance is gonna go up and what you have to do is you have to get that money and you have to give me the money to for the rate of the insurance that's going up it's like oh man I really want this makeup kit no but but I mean I had amazing parents who I mean I wouldn't have been I wouldn't be Who I am if it wasn't for them I mean that's cool they supported me it Mike's crazy decision to make monsters for a living well they must have been so happy when it paid off though yeah I was glad that they live long enough to see that and I got to bring my parents to the Oscars if you talk oh wow and you know they were they were very proud and and you know it was funny because I mean I had like my mom's brother and my uncle would you know say stuff like you know witness Ricky gonna stop doing this silly stuff and do something can make a living at you know yeah all those people but you know my dad basically never grew up and I knew I never was going to you know what was your dad what'd he do for a living well he did a bunch of different things he was a high school dropout because he he had to help his family his his mother and father are gonna pay bills and he had a variety of not very good jobs you worked at Sears as a salesman you drove a truck he did stuff but he was always he was very creative and it was kind of held down in his lifetime you know don't do that you can't write you know do something and make a living serious and because of that I benefited from he supported the creativity and when I I think I was a sophomore in high school he decided he wanted to try to make a living as an artist and we lived on my mom's bank teller salary for a number of years he hardly made any money at all but he was happy you know and and he because I mean like I said he supported my creativity and he was really my first teacher he he - ah showed me what you could do with pain he knew a little bit about sculpture you know he he was also a fan of monster movies you know and he saw you know the Fred of March dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde when it came out you know and told me all about it and that was a movie that they didn't have on TV I really wanted to see you know and he said when he saw it in the theaters you know he wouldn't hide his eyes or hide by the seat you know and I so wanted to see that and and he also said you know War of the Worlds the George Powell oh yeah that was so cool then the sound effects were great and you know that was never on either end when I was in the seventh grade I think it was I decided to get on the student council for the main reason this is my plan was I was suggested that we could raise money for the school by having showing movies after school we could rent 16 Miller movie 16 millimeter movies and show them and charge admission and I basically just went through all the movies ahead and seemed I wanted to see you and got those you know and there were maybe four or five people that showed up to see him but I was happy yeah what was the first film that you did special effects for first film was a film called the octo man and it's kind of a cult classic because it's such a crappy movie you know it was shot in ten days at it all it Bronson Canyon and in Griffith Park well there was a night I see I graduate I'm high school 1969 and I went to two years to a junior college 69 70 71 I guess it was so you went from that to Star Wars only like five or six years later right yeah something like that yeah that's crazy yeah and King Kong and you know yeah there's the octoman yeah don't matter I didn't design oh my goodness look at that yeah but I mean this was I was a full-time student I had six weeks and like I think a thousand dollars to make this suit and so I after school I and I got my friend the very first job I ever had actually this and this again happened because of my dad when he was a truck driver delivering plumbing supplies he went to the wrong building in the building he went into was called Chloe productions and they made Gumby and David Goliath stop-motion animation which I did stop-motion is well big Ray Harryhausen fan you know and for some reason I grew up in Covina which is east of you know LA like 30 or 40 miles and wasn't and there was anything film related out there but for some reason Clos Keyes was out there um I think because it was cheaper rent and he III was my on my quarter a week allowance when I found a place I could buy rubber it was like eight almost nine dollars for a quarter rubber in you know it took me a lot of weeks and a lot of more lawns and a lot of stuff to save up that money and I said I need to I need a job so I I didn't have a car we only had one car in the family and you know I went to any place I could walk to supermarkets you know Busboys all this stuff nobody wanted me and my dad said well I remember this place and did stop-motion and you'd stop motion you know maybe so I went there with my box of stuff you know and and it was summer vacation between my junior and senior year of high school and they said start tomorrow got paid minimum wage which I think was you know a dollar twenty-five or something at the time but that place was like a magnet for any weird kid or anything there was like a stop-motion fan any stop-motion person would show up there one point or another and I met this guy named Doug Bezeq who was a few years older than me and we became again fast friends you know he read Famous Monsters he was a ray harryhausen fan and Doug when I did this on this octoman film Doug had a little workshop and we did it in his workshop we did it together Wow but yeah it was a and it was a real introduction in the film industry because it was the very first days filming I'm filming in Bronson Canyon Griffith Park we show up we went in Doug's 57 Chevy it had an octa man in the backseat you know and we show up there and looking around and there's nobody there and what the hell you know so and this is you know before cellphones and all that shit so we'd have to go we went back down the hill down Bronson Canyon to like there was a market there and a payphone called the production office and it was like oh yeah we pushed one day we just forgot to tell you you know a movie called the octoman you forgot to tell the people who are making the octoman the title character of the movie that you weren't filming you know and it was also I mean they that's a perfect introduction to the movie industry though oh it was in and I learned that that you know that you can't believe anything they tell you you know I mean it was designed by somebody else and I got this job handed down through people I met at Khloe's it was going to be stop-motion at one point they decided that was too expensive they're gonna make a suit and the first thing I did was a little maquette and a little what Mehcad has got a small sculpture of the design but I said there's because he had they tried to figure out how they could do eight tentacles on a man mmm and his feet kind of like turned into tentacles and it kind of split off and into a back tentacle but I said I think they look like elf shoes in it and there's not a good way for me to join the two things together and and it's like kid don't worry about it there's only gonna be one shot of the octoman in the movie where you actually see it the rest of the time is this gonna be a shadow or a glimpse you know but we'll have a money shot where you can you know make sure it looks great the movie starts out with a close above his feet you know basically you know then and you know it was Marill introduction I I thought it was going to be like working on a hate mail Herman Miller meaner movies like I did as a kid you know Iran just jumps in and we're making a movie let's do it right yeah wasn't that and the DP the director of photography cuz I had long hair and Doug had long hair he called us the girls this was at a time when Harris you know get the girls to get their silly monster suit out you know correct but we there was a if you can believe this the octoman was written by the guy that was the writer of creature and black lagoon and he also wrote it came from outer space ah so it was basically those two scripts combined with Eveleth ecology thrown in and he we you know it was like there's this day where they instead of in you know in the creature they put a log across the lagoon and they can't get out you know here it was a log across the street and they're driving it and Winnebago and they can't get out they get out to try to get the log out and they open the window beg a door and the hawk demands in there and he knocks a guy down and then they're supposed to I think I supposed to pick up a log and throw it at the hawk demand and I go you know where's the prop log that we're gonna use and and and you know because was that it's that and I go that's it's a tree limb you know I got it that's gonna hurt the guy in the suit and it's gonna hurt the suit you know and I go and we we're gonna rehearse this right because no we don't have time to rehearse it and I go oh when he knocked man supposed to bend over and pick up the pier Angeli who was the female lead who killed herself after this movie can tell you what how good the movie was you know I said when he goes to pick her up let's cut there because if you cut I can wrap the tentacles around her no look more like he's holding her you know so anyways they start filming without rehearsing octoman opens the door and knocks a guy down I picked the blog throws it the octoman hits him rips the suit he goes walking over and he's virtually blind he's looking out at two little holes out this far away you know it was a real claustrophobic suit the poor guy Reed Morgan who play the occu man was great to deal with but it was very hard suit to wear goes to pick up here Anjali nobody says cut so he picks her up so walking around the guy who knocked Underground's laying on the ground spread-eagle he ends up stepping right on his nuts Oh falls over backwards throws pier Angeli opposed against the Winnebago oh she's crying says he wants her mother that guy's holding her nuts you know broke his hand cuz the log fell on his hand and everybody screaming I'm going to rip my soup no no we lost a day out of our 10-day shooting schedule so Harry Essex who was the dress and writer I was tearing pages of the script like just we don't need this we don't need this we don't need this and then when they tried to make a movie out of it it made no sense I mean I think of the first 20 minutes our stock footage if you know in the beginning there was nothing and then you know then there was slime and then you know the whole I can't wait to watch it there's a I think it's in public domain now I think it's on YouTube but there's a blu-ray out of it I might have to fire up a joint watch that one now when you when you look back on that you mean it's gotta be kind of even though it sounds like a clusterfuck it seems like it's kind of a fond memory as well because that was where it started it was you got to see how much nonsense there is in the movie industry but you also got a chance to get going yeah and and I got you know we we came up with a way to do this because we couldn't it's a foam rubber suit and former president baked in an oven we didn't have a big oven we didn't have the mean so we we came up with a clever solution and that's what I had to do so many times in films do things that people hadn't done before and a budget and schedule you know and and try to figure out and that's part of the fun yeah but what was cool about the octoman the male lead was Kerwin Matthews who was Sinbad in the Sun for just in bed okay I get a Ray Harryhausen film I was yeah big fan of you know so one of the first things I had to do there's a scene where the octo man's tentacle supposed to creep through this cave opening and they basically wadded up some tar paper and I stood behind the tar paper in Bronson caves and stuck my hand in his tentacle and it did this and when Kerwin walked by I said super dynamesh which is what Ray Harryhausen's technique he called for a few films and ago you know about that you know so I thought that was really cool my kids found out about Harry Hill's and from Monsters Inc uh-huh and they were like who's that harry houses yeah and i said well he's the guy that made all the early monster movies and so then we sat down and we watched King Kong together then they were scared at first like oh my god I'm scared but they started laughing when they saw King Kong the stop-motion yeah I mean it's it's today in comparison to you know even comparison to your version of King Kong when you could you know make it mechanized and you know it's just it's it's amazing when you think about how far we came but you know the yes the stop motion and and Harry hasn't didn't animate on King Kong he did mighty Joe Young but King Kong was what inspired him that was Willis O'Brien and and Pete Peterson know where the animators on that but he did the was the the one the one with Medusa did he do that one huh Harry Hudson yeah yeah Clash of the Titans right that was him right well I can and Ray was a one-man show you know and stop-motion you know it's 24 frames a second you know himself all himself and when you're animating seven Scott and Jason the Argonauts there's seven skeletons fighting seven rise he did all that I'm saw himself and I became I became friends with Ray Wow and I would save them and this was during the time when computer stuff was starting out you know and you know his movies were 50,000 dollar movies you know you know the whole bunch of the movie you know not just as effects in the early ones that he did you know and I said you know it doesn't it piss you off that now they get millions of dollars and there's hundreds of people working on stuff that you did by yourself you know and well they could never take away the legacy though no even though he did it all but he him he was not just a groundbreaker but he's the guy when you think about stop make stop motion films and horror films he's the guy that you think and you pull up Jason in the Argonaut skeleton scene I can't believe he did that all himself I mean that's a very very detailed and intricate scene no cuz you have to match what they were doing yeah I mean and you know you're in a room by yourself and you know moving up you know fraction of an inch a puppet at a time you know and it takes whatever you know and I mean having if you've never done stop-motion appreciated oh my god what year was this I'm not sure exactly and look they pop out of the ground yeah it's a great bernard herrmann music in this you know he always had the terrific scores in his in his films as well you know and again he was a fan who made a living doing something that he loved you know and and imagine being the actors and having to sort of respond to all this yeah to these skeletons that are popping out of the ground with shields and swords which aren't there would you yeah and which you know it can came you know months later yeah okay you've seen the skeleton now yeah you're scared he's going to take your soul well Ray would kind of direct those scenes because in most directors don't know what to do with that kind of story you know yeah but he was and you know what I thought was great about Ray is like so many artists you know aren't appreciated till after they're gone you know who Ray saw the impact he had I mean I went to his 90th birthday celebration in in in England where the the British Film Academy did this great tribute to Ray and everybody showed up I mean Peter Jackson came you know people who didn't show up sent video Steven Spielberg's in a video Jim Cameron did all talking about how much Ray's films and Ray's work influenced them and it was really great you know and is so nice that he was able to be appreciated like that in his lifetime and and now I'm actually I mean the funny thing is I'm getting that now with this with my book that's come out people are just going oh my god you're I love you so much and this stuff have you done it's just you know it's nice to know that you you know I served a purpose you served a giant purpose and you served a big purpose in my life man like I said I'm such a huge fan of your work and when you look back like what was the first thing that you did were you like okay that was a good one well you know it's funny once you do of something and you look at it you see all the things are wrong with it you know and and I always say I wish I could see the film before I make this stuff because so many times the thing that's supposed to be the most important thing just isn't in something that you like threw together is all of a sudden the most important thing mmm I mean I I mean American Werewolf was probably the one horror I mean that's one that really put me on the map I mean a lot people say King Kong was but American Werewolf you know I looked at it and I thought well that's pretty cool you know but I also a god I wish we did this and I wish I do it you know it didn't do that you know and I see so many things that I would do differently now that movies a masterpiece what it's a great film and it's a great film I mean an i my second film was schlock which was john Landis's first film and I was 20 and he was 21 and I had again I had six weeks and I think I had $1,000 again to make John played the schlock throught this I don't know if you've ever seen no never saw nother one you're gonna watch low-budget you know movie shot by a kid basically you know with a you know and he like I said he played this it was based have you ever seen Trog yeah Joan Crawford yeah yes he saw Trog and couldn't believe that they made this movie so he was making like a joke a joke version of schlock you know and he wanted to play this ape-man character and it's like well okay you know but you're gonna be the director too so you know he had to be unset at 6:00 in the morning whether slok worked or not all made up you know and it was shot in three weeks in John and I were going on to our sleep at night you know he I would make him up we were out in Agora where it used to be an Oakwood school where John went for a while on think it was thrown out of and we lived and worked in this like screened-in patio that was left over in this dilapidated building and I was making up John on a barstool and eventually he was like falling asleep doing those you know that thing you know and I'd have to grab him but he for some reason they were doing the daily set at MGM so we would have to go from after 12-hour day of filming and you know our removing the makeup we'd get in a car drive to MGM look at the previous day's dailies try back sleep for two hours get up start again oh my god and it was during a heat wave in Agora and the first day John had the suit on all day and I was like combing and brushing it in the hair was just falling out in handfuls and I went oh my god did my my second film in my career is over I would stand up on my hair director trying to dry the suit how it's like a glue more hair on it you know but it's it's it's actually kind of a cool makeup in in in in kind of a fun character you know and John had already written American Werewolf and he said my next films going to be an American world for you wrote that by the time he was 21 he was 21 you wrote it Wow and he goes it's gonna be my next film and he said I want to do a transformation in a way that never done before it doesn't make sense to me that a man changing in his body going through this metamorphosis would sit in a chair like Lon Chaney jr. and be still until he finished changing because I think it would be painful and I want him to be able to move and I want to show the pain and you know how would you do that no fucking idea but I would love to know because we both love those transformation scenes you know pull that transformation scene up the initial transformation scene is so fucking awesome because I remember seeing it in the theater what year was this in 1981 I think okay so it's 14 years old I was in high school and I remember seeing this in the movie theater and this was another one that sort of cemented the idea that I wanted to be a makeup artist when he pulls all his clothes off and he's burning up and then he looks at his hand his hand starts stretching out like that was incredible well this was just such a different werewolf to like everything about it was different yeah well again and I credit John for that and he also said you know I want to do it in a brightly lit room it's not gonna happen like it's gonna be real you know how did you do this you know we call it a change Oh hand it's actually a fake hand we storyboarded the whole sequence and that's a different fake hand there that's the second one right and that's another one there it's got syringes in it that we pump now he's wearing an appliance and it matches that see um and we store you bird of the whole sequence and as you saw when David first took off his clothes he's not very hairy right and I said for me to glue a little bit of hair on and then we do him a little hairier and a little hairier it's better for us to work in Reverse let me do him in the hairiest first now pull hair off and trim it Oh interesting yeah but we boarded the whole thing out so in this hair growing was reverse I punched her through rubber and then pulled it through and we printed it so look oh this is a whole fake back again with things coming out of it that's it so you punched hair through over and pulled it through and then reversed it Wow but what I we thought what would be the most impactful thing would be for his face to change last but what I don't like about the transformation like here the wolf has a big mane of hair so he's got this big a neck that I don't like you know and it's you know that's David doesn't have lenses and his eyes were just read from that was a ten-hour day of makeup so just exhausted yeah yeah this was incredible man that's crazy that he doesn't have any eyes he doesn't know anything in his eyes that's just his eyes yeah holy shit um but yeah this is the first stage change Oh head so this is a rubber head that had mechanisms that push it out you know and this is the second stage change our head it just stretches out like that the thing that was interesting because I mean I I was 30 when we did this it was at a time when there weren't people that did this kind of work they're just a few in Hollywood do you know like John Chambers who did Planet of the Apes but for me to find a crew I hired kids that didn't me fanmail I was a kid a kid from Texas that sent me fan mail another kid from Connecticut and they were like 18 Wow I mean I had a crew of like basically 18 year olds in me it was like I think six of us and who did this film you know thirty however many years ago I'm not good at math it still looks pretty decent he's fucking awesome not just pretty decent I mean there's a reason why I have the American Werewolf the Pat McGee version of it sitting there in the front yeah but now I have to call Pat and tell him the legs are off what's wrong with the leg there too stretched out and too long it but you know we actually that was the problem cuz I didn't know how he's going to make this four-legged wolf from work yeah and I thought well I'll figure out something and it came to me one night I thought I remember as a kid you ever do that wheelbarrow race thing when somebody holds your feet you're walking on your hands you know I thought well if we do something like that and have like puppeteered legs in the back so if the reality is if you really see the full wolf there's feet sticking out of his ass he's got two legs sticking out but we had him like on a platform with wheels and the back legs were puppeteered with little rods you know so you never you know the back and the back legs come in that's when you cut you know right right and a lot of this stuff like in Piccadilly Circus in the big bus crash and yes that's me in a wheelchair with a where they had which on pushing me down the street wow that was a great scene god that was a great scene yeah boy werewolf comes bursting out of the the the point of a yeah which divides the guy in the head that script I think was the only script that I've worked on my entire career that the script that I read was basically the script we made the only difference was when John wrote the script originally that arrows the cinema in in Piccadilly Circus was at cartoon cinema and in the original script was a cartoon cinema but when we got there it was a porno cinema so he changed that scene you know to a porno cinema other than that it's the say the script is basically verbatim when he wrote as a 20 year old and his use of music and everything was groundbreaking at the time people didn't do like the way he did you know and his friend that kept returning Jack more or more and more rotten every time like that was a genius idea as well like that Jack had explained to him when I came in you got to kill yourself you're a werewolf you're gonna kill a bunch people yeah like oh so everything about it was so unique it was a it it completely flipped the whole idea of what a werewolf movie was on its head yeah and and it worked you know and Griffin who played Jack when I first made him up in that makeup he as I was putting the stuff on you know in the makeup chair he's kind of like getting more and more sad and like sinking down on the chair and and it's like what's wrong Griffin is something wrong and he goes look at me yeah yeah he goes look at me it isn't my big break and I mean I mean my throats torn out and I mean nobody's gonna look at me you know and it's like did you read the script yeah didn't it say your throat was torn out yeah good but I didn't I didn't think it would look like this and I did you know and that's what John thought he was bummed out well he was at first you know because it is it's disturbing to see you know yeah but it's a great role yeah I don't know and he was brilliant and he was terrific to work with you know but the initial shock I've seen himself torn up right was it was hard for him to take you know so realistic yeah but he but he would you know I thought okay I gotta call John was in England already scouting locations and so I said you know you got to talk to Griffin he's you know kind of upset about what he looks like you know but you know I took that opportunity being a sensitive guy that I am to tell him that the third part of his transformation was it was actually gonna be a puppet it wasn't even really gonna be him because he was supposed to become basically talking skeleton right I know and the makeup process is an additive process and and you know he would have to be a huge skull to look right you know and he wasn't too happy about that either but I said but I want you to operate the mouth because you're doing the lips sink you know you're doing the voice you know so he operated the puppet but he he turned out to be a great guy you know and and and he I thought he was bringing in the film and the whole film you know the film is amazing and it's funny too that's one of the things that's interesting about the film it's like it's silly but horrific like the violence and the the the explosive scenes of the werewolf or ripping people apart but then some of it is hilarious well that host sequence in the porno theater with all the detail of bloody play I mean when we were when we were filming it I was kind of going yeah it was a welcomed sort of comic relief from the graphic horror of the the werewolf tearing people apart yeah yeah and you know it's I think it's a brilliant film it it's annoying foam and it changed my life I mean I got my first Oscar for that film you know and and I mean so fortunate to me that that Shawn came into my life and this this happened again because at Don post Studios that I talked about or I they made the Halloween masks John was a mail boy at Fox for a while and he knew John Chambers he would deliver mail to the John Chambers who did the Planet of the Apes makeup and he talked to John Chambers at first about doing schlock and John said well I need you know 250,000 dollars in the budget of the whole film I think was thirty thousand dollars you know so he I think he basically didn't want to deal with this hyperactive kid yeah and so he sent him to Don post Studios and dime post you know said well same thing they didn't really want to deal with his kid and and they had it would be way too much money you know right but they said there's a kid who comes in here and buy his material I used to go there to buy materials because in those days now there are stores that sell all the supplies that you need right did I used to have to drive all over California to get what I need stuff they would only sell you in a 55-gallon drum which I couldn't afford you know like polyurethane polyurethane foam which is a two-part foam that forms out chemical reaction forms it up makes cyanide gas when it forms which nobody told me but Don post would you know poor Simon it can you go here you go kid you know on first time I used it my bedroom I practically died really yeah and I have a real strong I it I have a very strong allergic reaction to it now and because of that yeah Wow I mean my throat closed up I could hardly breathe in whoa and you didn't know what was going on and I found out what it was but darling cyanide Jesus yeah but because of that because I left that that's the only time my life actually had a business card and John says you know it said Rick Baker monster maker but I think it's a trick Baker makeup artist you know but I gave a card and some pictures to DOM post and when they were trying to get rid of this kid who wanted a flunkey gorilla suit thing you know they said well this guy's made some gorilla suits why don't you talk to him and John lived in Westwood near the cemetery there the veteran cemetery he drove out to Covina and again I was still pretty shy at a point in my bedroom at that point was you know I had I slept on a convertible sofa because I had gotten enough money to buy one so I could fold it up and have more floor space to work but my masks had work tables everywhere are you knowing and john is very loud and and and and and hyperactive and and he was coming in and he was flipping out over the stuff that I made you know and like touching it and stuff and I'm going scaring me yeah but I mean thank God I mean American Werewolf you know put me on the map and I mean I did coming to America and Eddie Murphy was you know being I did a lot of films with Eddie and because of John actually met my wife Sylvia on John Landis film where he had me play originally it was a Jesus Freak it was a film called into the night and it was all filmed at night and met my wife on Hollywood Boulevard in front of Frederick's of Hollywood in the middle of night and turned out I mean change it to a dope dealer I was playing a dope dealer and Sylvia was the hair stylist on the film and John came in and says I want you to be in the movie I want you to play the part you were born to play a hooker my wife was a hooker in the background you know and there's a picture of us it's in the book actually on the night we met Frederick's of Hollywood yeah that's cool and now we have two amazing children and a great life well you and John made magic he really did I mean that movie was so good you know and as we said one of the things about that film is it's it was so strategic in its use of the werewolf hmm you know that you you do really when you got a chance to see it like one of my favorite scenes was when the guy the businessman is in the subway he's running away from the werewolf and you know it's chasing him but you don't see it you don't see it until he's stumbling on the escalator and then you see it at the bottom of the escalator just walking into the fridge just walking of the frame and you're like fuck yeah and they cut right before you see his feet sticking out is that yes well that was something with the design of the world was well because because John said he wasn't gonna show it I normally you would when you do something that's going to be an animatronic Eric you've kind of sculpted in a neutral position and you let the mechanism make the expressions but from my experience in other films the editor doesn't necessarily choose the moment where you think it's the best expression you know and I thought if it's only going to be on for a second I want it to be scary-looking so I sculpt it in a scary expression on it which normally wouldn't do I just so there was no way that it wasn't gonna look scary right snarling yeah well is that was that the case with the cantina scene in Star Wars because the Star Wars scene there's that's that's a crazy scene because you've got so many characters in that scene and today when you go back and look at it like it's pretty cheesy yeah yeah yeah well I that came about originally the you know film was done in England nobody knew Star Wars was gonna be Star Wars you know Stuart Freeborn was the makeup artist in the film he did the Wookiee he did the cantina scene originally but George wanted to embellish on it and didn't like a lot of the stuff that he did so at ILM which was in van nuys then Industrial Light magic when I first started the guys who are doing the visual for that for Star Wars my friends that I met at Chloe's Dennis Muren and Ken Ralston were were shooting the special effects and George came in and said do you know anybody they can make a mask because I knew I want to add some masks to them to the cantina scene and they go yeah we do so they called me in so I went over to Val G & Avenue and George on a flatbed editor showed me the sequence as it existed and I was flipping out and missing what a cool idea to have this bar for the aliens you know and go on let's do you know Stewie do one that has Ike you know like that's kind of like alien pirate that's got a like alien parrot character and it's nothing goes well we don't have any money you know it's like you know we've already spent the money you know we don't have a lot of money for this I just want masks you know and I said well I you know what I have a bunch of stuff I made myself for fun that we can screw in there but there's a devil guy that one that I made that five years before Star Wars you know there's a werewolf guy in another guy with khloé' eyes I made those before Star Wars I just said you can use them I thought they were gonna be stuck in the background you know him but we did like the cantina band you know the first on top top the first aliens that you see almost all the first days you see our lawns that we did I think we did 30 and but what was great is yeah that was one of the masks I made before he's good yeah oh yeah that was such a great scene too though you know these are Stuart freeborn's things you know but the thing that's great the cantina band was never there and when you see the movie you think it's there and I've uses so many times where I say can we shoot this like in post-production that's the devil guy yeah and these guys were the guys that when the guys in this end the guys we so you shot the alien band and post yes in in Los Angeles in a by different people at a different time and I've said to you know I want to say to people let's can we shoot this in post and because what happens you know most directors don't like dealing with this yet you know and they'll put it off to the last shot of the day and then it's like well you got 45 minutes and go but this is the money shot right and I prepared four months for this and you'll give me 45 minutes to do this it's not right you know let's shoot it in post-production well that'll never work imagine it's like did you see Star Wars yeah you know the band that's in the cantina yeah that was shot by different people in a different country months later did you know that no no it's like you think they're there you hear the music that they're playing through the scene you know these are some of our aliens those two guys the blue guys and as is that werewolf and that was the only one that looked like a mass well yeah I mean I think it I think they all looked like masks we made that guy and that mask in the background was one of mine that I had before too you know but yeah great scene again it was a great idea and people I did not make that one that was on Stewarts um people think of it fondly you know and it's more that it's a great ideas and they work is great yeah what was it was a great conglomeration of cool characters all in one bar and you know at the time I was completely in unique and new things oh yeah and but after that every movie every space movie had a cantina scene you know and and it's like American world do every transformation after American world was basically the same transformation and they did the same things you know and it happened on thriller - you know I mean I because of American Werewolf when Michael came to John Landis to do thriller you know he'd like American world he wanted to do he wanted it to be a short film you didn't want to call it a music video mm-hmm and John contacted me and said you know Michael Jackson wants to do this American Werewolf like music video you know for the song thriller which I hadn't heard and it was like you know Michael Jackson little Michael Jackson Andy Jackson 5 but yeah you know he's not called that anymore you know and so he goes Johnson I'll send you a kiss at it listen to it and get some ideas you know so I and this was when we had the Walkman you know and yeah I'd listen to it with wine I had another one that I would like like pre associated ideas when I was listening you know and he was like this I thought well these we came up the idea doing these zombie dancers and and I said well you know I'm sure you're gonna hire the dancers way in advance so they could learn the dance because no they they there they only need a couple of days so they hired him like three days before we filmed anyone I can't that doesn't give me time to take life masks and do all the stuff that I would do and he's obviously be really cool you know so I said how about if the first time bees you see are like me and my crew because we already have life masks we can start those today and we can spin the time and making some cool and so I'm in thriller coming out of a crypt like this you know and and all my crew basically are the first guys that come out of the ground and break their windows but the dancers I said I'll figure out a way we can do them and I because I had a number of life masks of different people and small medium and large male small medium large female and we sculpted we kept pieces we called like bandit masks they were kind of like this around this area like abandoned you know right run yeah it's like a raccoon Mouse yeah and it didn't have the nose on it because you know proportionately you could get away with more mm-hmm so we had different sculptures of small medium large male small Milosz female that we've just say okay you're a medium male number two and we made these big teeth that we could pop in their mouths and put some denture lining material and fit them so the dancer makeups were not as good as the more featured make but Michael in the upper left-hand corner that one Jamie were the eyes yeah look at that like that was excellent and again we kept it that way when what happened is the Dom bees after that everybody was just doing pieces like this I only did it like that because the limitations I had but that was I mean that was a rather really quick job and very little money thriller was very little money for me it turned I mean they spent the money they had a lot of cameras in the last summer filming but it I was in working day and night every day the way to get this stuff done and John then surprised me with the making of us roller on the day that Michael was coming out for us to take his life masked and make a cast of his face he goes oh there's a camera crew here a couple cameras saying what are you talking about he goes I want to do a making-of and I go I was gonna no no it's like it always looks horrifying to see if somebody have a life mask take its Brian and I go I don't need and Michael's really shy I don't need we don't need this I don't want this he goes shut up we're doing it you know it's like fuck you know I'm not happy about it but then so many people have come up to me yeah and who are makeup artists now and you go the reason I'm a makeup artist cuz I saw the making a thriller and it inspired me that to do this you know and my stock answer is you thought that if this idiot could do it I can do it there was a time where music videos were a new thing and then thriller changed what a music video is it was so huge it was a a world premiere event that was on MTV and it's so hard for kids today to understand what that means but we were all like gathered around the TV waiting for the Michael Jackson Thriller world premiere and it premiered and it changed what a music video is yeah then all of a sudden it became this film and it was really cool cuz like Michael Jackson was this sweet guy and he's on a date with this beautiful girl and and next thing you know he's a fucking werecat or whatever he was was that supposed to be that like well yeah I I he wanted to be a werewolf isn't that you know I don't think he should be a werewolf and I thought something feline would be fit him better you know and I originally did a like a black panther and then I was afraid of the black panther you know that I didn't want him to be associated with a black panthers you know what I mean the political yeah yeah so I then became more fantasy I gave it longer hair and like white Steve you find his transformation to the cat because it was reminiscent in somewhat of a mirror of American werewolf but cool and unique in its own way I think oh we didn't we didn't at the time - yeah I wasn't sure what it was I was like it's not a cat isn't a werewolf was it yeah well call the world was sometimes people call the cat is there yeah yeah I just you know thought it was cool like Union no it was definitely cool look whatever it was but you know what happened I mean on trailer was like work work work work work and originally it was going to be my my crew were going to be the guys that do the makeups and they were all non-union and it at the last minute became a union production so I had to hire Union makeup artist and there were men you to do the dancers and many of them were people I didn't know and there weren't a lot of people that were good at this stuff hmm huh yeah that's gonna give me a little bladders in his hand there's actually an American Werewolf hand in here at one point I think oh really yeah you know leftover heads yeah that's a nail growing thing was from American Werewolf and then you did a similar thing with the ears and then he had the whiskers yeah yeah it's like yeah he's before his hair grows yeah silly but when you look at that like what is that yeah is that a cat whatever it is it's cool yeah but he the it was an amazing experience because I know I was like it was really stressed out the day that we were filming the dancers and that was I had to make up Michael as a zombie I had a number of makeup errs I didn't even know and then work before with before they were doing other zombies and I'm running through trailers going no no no like this you know I've been making up Michael and it's like ah man and we were filming in Vernon downtown Los Angeles and next to the farmer John meatpacking plays and they just slaughtered the animals and it had this weird smell in the process and then the dance started and I all of a sudden it just like this wave went over me of just the stress went away and I just was looking at what was having in front of me you know what's gonna hold my god look at this you know and and people would pay money to see this and I get to see this you know I saw this roller dance happening when it was you know for the first time there you know when it was being filmed how many times did they shoot it not that many I don't think but there I think there was six cameras on you know um the whole street you know friend that was filled with cameras and but the other thing that was so cool about it that was one of the dancer makeups that Michael when we were doing him in pre-production Michael did a a Motown special that was on television where he moon walked for the first time that nobody had seen the moonwalk and I didn't see it I was busy working and but one of my crew who went home at night and it recorded it and he goes you're not gonna believe this is the same kid that was in her makeup chair the other day because Michael is very shy as well really meek and quiet in person and he's so dynamic onstage you know and and it was he's like two different people I mean when Michael's performing he's incredible you know now he was a and I mean to say he was unique is the biggest understatement in the history of the world yeah but this whole scene with him when he becomes a zombie it was so bizarre to like even the dancing was so strange you know it was cool though oh he's really cool and to see it live for the first time you know out like cold with it they don't do anything like this anymore I mean really it doesn't happen yeah well you know it's funny I like you you've said a number times I try to explain to my daughters let you know we we had television but you I had a TV Guide I would look at every page and try to find when a monster movie is going to be on and have to watch it then or I could see it yeah and if I wanted to see it again I would have to wait a year or you know there wasn't an internet you know and you know I had I had to go to the library to find books on makeup which there weren't very many you know now you there's all these YouTube videos I didn't have some you know and but it's it's a different world I mean the information wasn't is available and you couldn't you know you couldn't just call up let's see thriller yeah now when you did the Wolfman was there a push to do some sort of CGI version of that was it did you have to like either a discussion about how to do it I expected that it would do it CGI because everything at that time was basically CGI and I had a friend that got a copy of the script and I read it in a red like a CGI thing hmm and I was actually filming at Universal we were filming some of the Norbit stuff at Universal and I went to a a producer there that I knew who was a visual effects producer as well and I asked him if he knew anything about the Wolfman you know because I said I didn't love to do this you know and that's one of the films that made me do what I do you know and and I said it was gonna be CG because no actually they were talking about it being a makeup and Inca will you put my name in there then you know I would love to do this so they the original director wanted it to be a makeup and I thought we were going to do transformation we actually built stuff for a transfer me it was a weird film in so many ways it seemed like you know Benicio was great to work with he wanted to he wanted to be the Wolfman you know he's a monster a real monster kid too you know Anthony Hopkins was great you know III did it with my friends David who else he but III think we were the only people that wanted to be working in a movie called a Wolfman I mean think everybody else was embarrassed that they were working in a movie called The Wolfman really yeah and they would do things the production manager called me into the office once and said what what is this why are you by buying all this hair what is this hair for I go seriously why do you need this hair and he had a big behind his desk at a big sign said Wolfman and I went and covered it up and cover up the wolf park with my hands and go right now we had this a man I'm gonna make him a Wolfman and I need hair for that why do you need hair cuz wolves have fur it's like what the fuck I can't believe I'm having this conversation with you you know because what I mean do you need all of that hair you know I mean what and they like that through the whole movie it's just so embarrassing you have to talk to someone like that I know but then I'll just let you do whatever you do I know and you know I think people who are in industry who have to deal with this stuff all the time to think that I never have to you know write it happens all the time you know and it seems like everybody has to yeah yeah and but I mean it was very frustrating but again Dave and Lou Elsie and I we we had we'd worked day and night and when everybody was gone we had the best time you know we're gonna Wolfman movie you know and when we first filmed the sequence in the gypsy camp or this all these gypsies mmm and fog and stuff is like that's what was it was very reminiscent of the old movies but like a new version of the old movies yeah with the fog and the gypsy camp and all that jazz it was really similar to the original launched Annie there was also a junior yeah and he had kind of a hammer film feel to it too you know and we and Anthony Hopkins makeup was was you know a little more curse the werewolf Christopher not Christopher really hot with was the name Oliver Reed Melina um had that kind of feel to it and and I mean like I said Benicio is a real big fan of the horror films and and we got along great in fact he would come into the makeup trailer with old monster magazines and that he bought on the Internet and there he is and he would quiz me on stuff you know I know what's this I knew everything I knew it you know everything on every page you know and we became we connected we bonded over that you know the scene where he makes the transformation in the medical theater uh-huh that was a great scene it's all CG though is that all CG CG oh it's basically it's based a lot on ideas that I had you know because I I mean what I said you know cuz they said well we got to do the great transformation like American Werewolf and I said American Werewolf we had a naked man who changed into a four legged hound from hell right here we have Benicio del Toro and we have Benicio tutorial with some hair on his face you know and some teeth right we can't the changes aren't the same we can't stretch out his body we can't write you know well we wouldn't have that same kind of feel so I said well how about if we do things worse fingers twist and do uncomfortable things and stuff like that right but we actually made a lot of stuff but it's so weird I mean like the production we weren't even invited to this set when they did the transformation even though he had stuff they didn't want you to they didn't want me there why is that I don't know they didn't want your input you know I guess even though it's a lot of the what's in there is based on some animatics that I did and some drawings and stuff but it was a really weird deal I mean it's like we were the unwanted children in that movie you know that's so crazy for me to hear something like that it's so it's stunning because I would have assumed that in my eyes your Hollywood royalty like you're the guy who made American Werewolf in London you're the guy who made so many these incredible movies with makeup and special effects I would think they'd be pumped that you were there well yeah I thought that too I know but it wasn't the case but you know I mean I you know something interesting when I read this book my career I complain too much about the film industry and I shouldn't because it's been really good to me I mean I like I said it was my hobby and I made it a decent living at it and I got Awards for it and I got free food and things you know and it is magic I mean you you you it's like time traveling like working on this movie when we're in you know London in areas that haven't changed since the 1800s and you have all these people and period costumes it really is like your time travel you know and you get to work with some really amazing people yeah see this is all CG a really well done CG is really well done yeah and and Steve Begg who was the visual effects supervisor was a a really great guy and he was really upset that we weren't able to do this stuff as well but they think they did a terrific job and I you know I like CG to a degree I mean III like the fact that it's another technique that we can use to do things that we can't do in the real world with rubber yeah right right I just don't like that they do things when we can do it you know and I think a lot of it comes down to Oh before American Werewolf I would have to try to beg people to let me do something I mean it was like can I put a mustache or and a scar on this guy you know and after American Werewolf I would get scripts with stuffing and I had no idea how the hell I was gonna do and I like crazy crazy stuff but they they would say to me what because they did a lot of interviews after America more often they said what is the material that changed that allowed you to do the work that we haven't seen before and I said I got adequate time and adequate money and it was the first time I had that and after that I like when I did gremlins - I had a year's prep but the problem is I need answers a year before we start filming because I need to make this stuff and usually a directors on another movie then and doesn't want you know eventually after I hound them I'm try to get an answer it will give me some kind of answer which just to make me shut up you know hmm CG all that stuff comes in post the film's already made you kind of cut it together they start making the stuff but this is obviously makeup that is yeah so CG until transformation till he's the werewolf and then when he's aware of this was done in a different day yeah well I mean they the CG was done all imposed yeah right but yeah him sitting in the chair was Benny stealing the day and this is that's actually the stunt double and so sometimes when he was running he was running on all fours yeah and on in leg extensions and most of that stuff is Spencer Wilding who was our stunt double there was there are some shots of close-ups this is Spencer the stunt double yeah but that was what was weird about is like he's running but he's got kind of like dog legs yeah yeah but he's running on two legs yeah with dog legs a biped I get it that's Venezia but it was it was a hybrid you know of American Werewolf and the original Wolfman yeah you know the Wolfman had you know he said he stayed on his balls of his feet you know he didn't try to get that illusion of like dog like oh yeah original one yeah yeah and you know I it's so funny because I walk like that as a kid though all the time you know and it would do things and so could Dave Elsie but when we tried to get the stunt guys or even Benicio to do it they couldn't do it we couldn't walk on the throws on the balls of their feet like that with their heels up you know or not I don't know you know at any second how come I can do it but it's also something a skill I developed as a child now when you see a film like that and you say you know you think about all the the difficulties that you had in making it was there ever a film where they let you just go crazy just do whatever you wanted to do well pretty much American Werewolf yeah well that was the best one yeah well that's and and again you know I gremlins to which I did it was a film I turned down numerous times my friend Chris Chris can't speak Chris whale is did the original gremlins and I didn't basically want to copy Chris's work right and I also know it was a big job a lot of stuff and and they kept after me Chris was unavailable I think he was doing the fly and the Jeff Goldblum first yeah which is Japanese man Jeff was great he should want an Oscar when the all-time great performance yeah a lot of people forgot about that move oh I know he's he's brilliant in that um but the they said what can we do to entice you to do this movie Michael let me redesign the gremlins saw Michael I would like to make them individual characters Chris's version all the girls were the same mold all the Hmong ways were all the same mold so you basically because you can't make one puppet that does everything so you have the you know this puppet you have your hand and you have this puppet you have some rods on you have this puppet that does this but they could be interchangeable for any any Mogwai or any gremlin making them individual characters means I had to have you know six versions of each one you know so we made hundreds of things but I said you know if I can make them characters and change the design some I'd be more interested and then we came up with the idea of doing the genetics lab where one turns into a bat one turned into a spider hmm one turns into a vegetable gremlin but what was great about working with Joe Dante I mean Joe is also a monster fan you know monster kid guy so we we could communicate in that in that way you know we would say you know it's like innovation Sossaman you know when I was talking about okay like Barry Sonnenfeld who I did men in black with I said that - he he'd go yeah I never seen a science fiction movie never saw any science would he go I said I went to see alien but I got too scared and left and my crew on many black oh my god is gonna be disaster you know and I was saying you know I don't you know it could be a really good thing he could make a really unique film and not just base it on other stuff yeah see you know and I think men in black is a really great it is yeah it's really and he was he was terrific for it you know but at first it was a little scary you know but Joe but you know Joe is great and he's really open to suggestions you know and on the first gremlins they had a suggestion box it's like what can we have the girl Melissa do and people would put things in there so you know we could say how about if we do this how might we do that okay you know so it was it was a nice collaboration you know and that was fun so you have some fond memories oh no I mean I have a lot of fun memories and mostly it's in the pre-production time I mean my crew it is hard though to not concentrate it's like you have to make a concerted effort to not concentrate on the annoyances and the negative parts yeah and it is hard and especially when that you get every day yeah but the hours you know people don't realize I mean a normal film days a 12-hour day yeah but I you know for me an average makeup is a three-and-a-half hour makeup then you have a twelve hour day then you have a our removal time hmm so they're very long days I spent most of my career working 18 15 18 hour days you know in 20 hour days and sometimes all night you know yeah and all day just to get this stuff done you know and that's pre adderall yeah yeah and I you know I'm surprised that I'm you know cuz I'm gonna be 69 in like a month and I'm surprised and still alive first of all you know and and and able to walk and do stuff you know when I think about the days of standing on my feet all day hmm all the stuff well what about the chemicals that's the thing that I would think it's a little scary yeah you know and and we I mean I because of my experience of like I said with a polyurethane foam and yeah yeah I know that you know this stuff is dangerous and I also had one time we the paint that I used to use to paint rubber it's hard to get Robert to paint to stick to rubber and I found out that on the Creature from the Black Lagoon and they made paint out of rubber cement and Universal tinting colors and thinned it with benzene and it was bond to rubber so I used to paint my masks in my bedroom with benzene which is a carcinogen yes hmm atomizing it spraying through an airbrush you know no spray booth or anything he says I used to have a five gallon drum of benzene that I'd wash my hands off in oh my god and then when I found out because they weren't material safety data sheets like they are now you know I found out how dangerous this stuff was I became kind of fanatical about you know my shop my studio I had seven spray booths to take the fumes away and and make sure it was safe and I mean oh I had I think when the safest shop in Hollywood with us stuff because I didn't want to I don't want to find out ten years down the line and half my crew died because of some dealt with me so but yeah it so it's a little scary especially in the old days when we didn't know better right it's most people now are pretty safe with this stuff what was the last film he worked on Maleficent not the one who just came out but the the first one yeah and it was interesting I I it came about because a friend Tony gee who is Angie's makeup artist does her beauty makeup all the time she worked with me on first one the Nutty Professor and then we did life together and she was like the department had on the Grinch Grinch Stole Christmas and planted the Apes the planning Apes that I did dealt with all the makeup artists and um it was really great she's a great beauty makeup artist but also a really great effects makeup person and she said to Angie you know oh and when they were gonna do Maleficent she cuz you have to get a Rick Baker he's the guy to do this you know and he's got a good aesthetic and he knows nothing when to put stuff on and when not to and knowing and I said Paula I don't know I don't women are the hardest to make up you know the especially if you do an age your makeup you know I don't think any woman must look old and I've done some films where we do the most incredibly subtle little thing and then the actress won't want doesn't want to come out of the trailer because they say they look like a burn victim you know stuff you know or in tears and and I said you know ie Angie wanted appliances he wondered rubber on her face and I was thinking I not I don't think she should have you know I said I think we can do it with the horns and maybe it's just ears you know right but she had this very specific idea that she wanted these angular sharp mmm she's you know so I mean the very first thing I did I did it as I said let me just think about it and do a design what I think it should be mm-hmm I did as a design and then I met with Angie she came to my studio uh-huh which is now a storage facility the and she brought a couple of her kids in in like a nanny kind of person in paparazzi follow to read we closed the gates and we're talking and she's telling me what she wants and one of her kids says to the nanny person niggas I want a coke in angie was mid-sentence talking to me and she went please yeah and it really I like that she was teaching her kids manners you know and that kind that kind of sold me right there you know it's like okay she's a mom too you know and and she is incredibly beautiful to look at you know and she's pretty persuasive in that respect you know yeah they don't get any prettier yeah they just get different yeah but I mean ah yeah well you did a great job in keeping that beautiful face but adding just a little bit of weirdness yeah demonic weirdness with the cheeks yeah and again with the horns I was saying you know maybe this is a really good case of doing CG horns and having them trapped onto her because when you have something that's that much authority it's well we made a really lightweight it was incredibly lightweight and we spent a lot of time developing these lightweight horns that could be removable so she didn't have to wear them all the time right so they removed like an appoint about this far up off of her wig so I thought if they decide they don't like it we can take them off and they'd be a good strategy for CG yeah but they she she wanted him and she wore them but so we you know we spent a lot of time trying to make those really light what about the wings the wings I didn't do I don't I think I'm not sure how they did that I didn't go to location on the filming Tony G made her up and I had a really great Dutch guy who was a fan named our Ian Titan who did who put the appliances on with Tony G and represented me on the set what is that picture with the American Werewolf with the hand stick that's a Mike Hill yeah Mike Hill does these cool of like wax figures but they're silicone so he did me and he did me as a younger man which was when the worst ones he's done this is at the Academy for something but yeah he I gave him the molds actually from American Werewolf for the hands and some of the stuff but he does he does these great figures and unfortunately i die and i think even grease the one they did of me was one of the one the less successful looks good well it looks good but it looks a little grim - and i part of that was my fault though he wanted to do me smiling and I go you know what I'm working I'm like this is my concentration face you know and but I sat for him and he had life cast and everything and but he does some brilliant stuff what ever happened to the original molds and although the original masks and stuff from American Werewolf in London the original sculpture of the wolf well that sculpture gets destroyed basically you make the mold I have one of the original head still I mean foam rubber is is basically the SAP of a rubber tree that you put chemicals in to make a cure and you whip air into it to make it foam and you put another chemical in to make it congeal and you bake it in the oven but because it's an organic material to decomposes and rots oh really yeah and it will last through a film but it usually doesn't last years but it does the American well the stunt head the one that I killed Griffin with on the moors and then go through the big daily I have and it's hard as a rock it turns to like I call like grain crackers and if you touch it hard it'll crumble into dust Wow mines it's all hard like that but it's not even people don't touch it you know so what does Pat McGee make these out of the one our wolf is I think it's probably slip rubber and polyurethane foam and that lasts a lot longer but it will decompose Oh order another one yeah well you get them to do they keep it out of sunlight and keep it out yeah you know I mean he doesn't get out of the studio yeah that's good he'll he'll last a long time you know I mean I I have Bob Burns who this guy that I met when I was young has some of my original mess that I made when I 13 oh wow and they are still supple you can still move them I don't know how that that rubber has lasted all that time that's pretty incredible a long time when anyone comes here one of the first things you want to do is take a picture with the world that literally is like one of the front like everybody and their brother has a photo like posing next to Wolfe retain the Wolves biting their head or pretend they're having sex with the wall people from behind what I think I should get residuals I probably this little piece yeah well taste something free cokes nothing but that I mean that thing is it's if you had to go through like all the more are the most iconic monsters in the history of films I mean you're you're in the top two or three I mean it's it's right there with all of them that that what werewolf was like my god I mean it's absolutely one of the most iconic monsters ever cooked someone just on my on my Instagram just posted a picture of a tattoo a beautiful tattoo of the werewolf oh yeah so many people have them one guy did a cover-up tattoo that was incredible the werewolf bday it's funny to have that werewolf I have hairy on people I've got the Grange yeah and some of the stuff Harry and the Hendersons yeah yeah that's another one oh and that's one of the films I think still I mean when people ask me what my favorite one is I say Harry because I I can look at that film to date I think it holds up perfectly fine the only thing I think I would change is I would make his teeth a little more translucent yeah but that was a challenging movie because he had to communicate and just fly his visual expressions right and and carry the movie you know and I think he did and I think it works quite well was there is there a movie that stands out as being the most frustrating like the end result probably you know I mean they're all frustrating to a degree you know what I don't know if there's one particular one I mean I did and I don't consider this my film I was approached by Bob Weinstein to do a werewolf movie called cursed that West Craig was gonna direct and I basically turned it down and there wasn't a lot of time and Bob used my own words against me apparently on a on a DVD of American where I said I'd love to have the opportunity to do a transformation again and do it knowing what I know now with the crew that I have now right Nicholas I'm giving you that you said that you know so I said to him the only way I would do this is if you don't have an opinion and Wes doesn't have an opinion you just let me make what I think is best for this film that's the only way I can make it cool in the time that you have I can't play that change this change that game you know absolutely the horse that's not the case and say that and yeah it was like change this change that change that and it was just like you know and you almost have to have a clause in the contract that if they do fuck with you at all you could just leave and get paid I've done that you know in in one-one contract but yeah it turned out the they started the film before they really had a script and it was oh yeah it happens all the time and they it was just a mess and this haven't heard of it first you know what's good you didn't hear but I'm surprised I'm even mentioning it because it did they shut the film down and I went okay and I said but we were we were doing some really cool transformation stuff and it wasn't quite done and I said listen if you ever think the films gonna pick up again if you can keep a number of my people on for another month we can have this transformation stuff or put it in a box we'll be ready to go said if they disperse now it's going to be like starting again because necessarily get the same people you know right you know I know just put everything in a box you open to ship it to us where you know if we start up again you know we'll figure it out they started up again I didn't do it I was on something else someone else took over then they changed everything that I made they didn't use a lot of what I made but the film has a single card opening credits as Rick Baker on it and I I spoke with the Weinstein ago I don't want credit for this film is not my film this isn't my work anymore but it would help them to have you on it yeah yeah yeah so I mean I found that frustrating you know but you know again I have no right to complain about this stuff they don't do a lot of monster movies anymore and the number of werewolf movies you can kind of count them on one hand right I mean the anthology stretch here we have the howling of course you have America werewolf you have the earlier films but this it's you know and then you have those I don't consider them werewolf movies those what are the ones with the lady there underworld beckons do underworld yeah yeah those are kind of but what they're fun to watch Kate Beckinsale in a suit it's pretty fucking hot but they're just kind of wack the movies are kind of why the vampires are wack it's like I don't buy any what you're selling I don't think he's a real vampires I'm not scared I don't think that's a werewolf get the fuck out of here yeah well I'm more old-school yeah horror movie guy you know I'm not a big slasher movie guy you know I mean now again I I don't like I mean I can't I can't watch those fights that you know Zemin UFC fight oh no I have a one of my crew eddying shoutout to any great guy yeah Eddie was the priest uh D with all the Gracie's okay and he was saying hey you gotta watch this Rick and I mean these guys hit each other in the face with elbow and I know it's not for me you know and people will send me because they think I like this stuff pictures oh look fell down cut my head you know I I pass out and I cut myself you know really yeah yeah yeah yeah I I mean fake gore is one thing you know but I I think it's bad that you know a movie you know when you know Halloween and and Friday the 13th and it just became what's the most graphic way we can kill a teenager right and people become when you see you know a guy with him you know get shoved a knife shoved a design that people I use like cheer alright that seems wrong to me you know yeah the desensitization you know you should be repulsed by this stuff right and I mean I you know I don't know but it's so fun I mean people would think it's funny and kind of ironic coming from someone like you who's made these insane monster films like American Werewolf in London we're just ripping guys heads off Piccadilly Circus monster gore you know and it's something like you know if it's a zombie killing you're killing zombie that's okay you know that that's not real you know right but just killing a person it another person killing a person in a graphic way I'm not fond of you know so I don't like you know I mean I like you I call them monster movies more than Bryce you don't need to yeah and you know I mean that Charles Laughton Quasimodo I mean it's brilliant mm-hmm yes it's a brilliant makeup yeah 1939 right and you know it's a perfect makeup on a perfect actor no Charles Ilan was great in that movie and you feel for him you know you feel further Frankenstein's monster you know those movies just don't they're so few and far between today like I see a real Frankenstein type movie will you fond of the Robert De Niro version of Frankenstein you know when I heard they were gonna do that film I thought I got to do this you know no and I like I said I don't have an agent I have a lawyer that makes my deals that I ended up you have to they give you a contract you don't understand you know right um and he I said do you know anybody is involved with this because you know can you put in a put my name in the Hat you know and they didn't seem to be interested and when I saw the film I I was kind of glad I didn't do it I wasn't yeah and I also it was disappointed I thought how cool they got Robert De Niro and not just some big stunt guy right I know yeah cuz you know Karloff was a good actor I yeah - and then eventually you know when it turned into the clean strange who was bigger and stuff who was still kind of cool Frankenstein but it wasn't Karloff you know I thought great that they have an actor you know but I was so disappointed and when I saw it I didn't think what he did was amazing at all and and the design it was a lot of work and I thought it was well done but it didn't have the impact that that Karloff right yeah that's right expression yeah and and you know and it's something it's very much I when I was a kid I did a makeup thinking well he's pieced together out of a bunch of different people should be lots of scars into different colors and things you know but it's you need a certain silhouette and something that just catches your eye you know and and I didn't think that one did pull up that vent the image of Robert De Niro as Frankenstein and you should pull up the Porsche car light at the same time Boris Karloff one I mean that was the first and that's iconic yeah and again the design if you think about it doesn't make sense you know why does he have a flat head in right why is that bolts on his back yeah well that makes more sense because that's hard yeah that on the left I think that's a test or something that looks a different to me mm-hmm yeah and again it does kind of make sense when you think of as a man that's pieced together a different part right but why they piece in his face together I know I'm like what you know all right because Boris Boris Karloff wasn't that pieced you know it was that the head was very bizarrely yeah with that head and you know in in the stuff you read that Jack Pierce said and press at the time was you know i Frankenstein wasn't a trained surgeon he would take the easiest route to take the brain out the top of his head by cutting the topics head off opening like a box yeah and putting him you know new brain and closing it back up we're like a box but but it still wouldn't be flat yeah you would to put the skull back on it maybe be an eighth of an inch shorter you know how about Frankenstein's bride she was still hot I know was that Nefertiti crazy hair yeah but she was still hot is that the original Frankenstein yeah that's the Edison Frankenstein and again he has kind of a flat head so I think yeah yeah he's kind of goofy-looking but yeah Carla Carla face was just so perfect for it you know and I didn't know there was that many Frankenstein so the other one what does that one drink whether it's Christopher Lee from crankenstein right and it's uh what's a Young Frankenstein Oh young Frank yes and Herman Munster on the bottom yeah the monsters are cool yeah but it is kind of funny that Herman Munster is just a ripoff for Frankenstein well he's supposed to be well he's supposed to be though and you know I mean yeah that's why I just like Dracula yeah sure and Eddie's kind of like a little Wolfman yeah yeah yeah I remember it TV Guide when before this came on the air but they talked about the new shows that were coming out you know this is in the 60s and this is when the big monster craze happened and I you know I was all over it inside there's gonna be a Frankenstein guy on TV you know and it was a great time for somebody like me you know and then just soaked it all in and what is the impediment like it seems like people love those movies when they come out why don't they make more of those movies you know well first of all the Wolfman that I did wasn't very successful yeah it didn't make a lot of money that was stopped in production at one point that was reshot they reshot a bunch of it yeah well we came back for reshoots and again this is same thing it movies called The Wolfman right they call me up and go we're gonna do some reshoots in three weeks we want you to build suits for two stuntmen because we're gonna do this Quadra petting which wasn't in the film originally and I said in three weeks and I said remember when we did the Wolfman we set up a shop in London that took like two months to set up you know all the molds are somewhere in London I have no idea where they are you've got him in storage somewhere said we had found her crew we did the whole thing I go there's no way I can do it in three weeks I said what do we filming they said well the fight at the end in the house and all that I said well the sets gonna take a while to put back together oh you know no we started that three months ago oh and I went so you're giving me three weeks to make the wolfman for this reshoot and you knew about it for three months you know it's like you know and if they would have called me even a week sooner it was a time when everybody was out of work it was kind of a dry time but the you know week before they called me a whole bunch of shows started everybody was busy I couldn't find a crew you know it's like coming so how'd you wind up doing it working day and night and I got my friends Dave and Lou Elsie again and I found a couple guys that could kind of do something with his stuff and and we pulled it off you know but it was I mean I seriously was working day night got on a plane flew to London got off the plane made up inicio and another trailer we had people I hadn't worked with before making up the stunt double I mean it was like we have to do this because Emily Blunt is going to be doing Gulliver's Travels she's only available for two days so we have to film though so I get off the plane makeup and ecl stunt doubles made up everybody's looking good I walk out to whoever filming and they're filming the stunt double in silhouette and this is again there's like video village where there's an army producer seating in chairs looking at the monitor and I went over to him I said okay you have to explain this to me and they go what right can I go why are we filming this fucking stunt double when Emily Blunt Benicio del Toro Hugo Weaving are sitting in their trailer we only have Emily Blunt for two nights or filming in the summer in England it gets dark at 10 o'clock it gets light at 4 o'clock in the morning it's going to be light in two hours this is one of the two days that we have Emily Blunt why are we not filming her and they all looked at each other like oh yeah why are we not filming her whether must there must be a reason you know the movie was cursed what isn't John Landis his son involved in some sort of a remake of American Werewolf he it's been announced that he was going to do that I don't know if it's ever gonna happen those things happen all the time you know why they announce it man it's just yeah Thank You Ramon to Toro every other week there's some film that he's gonna make that yeah and some of them happen someone don't you know but he's a big fan of monster film yes and he again I think he's he was a part of the strain wasn't he film yeah and and I met Guillermo first he was a makeup artist he used to be a makeup artist in Mexico and he was a Dick Smith student and a fan you know dick Smith fan and dick introduced me to him and Guillermo came to my studio as a fanboy a makeup artist first and they did Hellboy with him with him and I was in the strain he has me killed by one of the Strigoi and strain the strain starts off great the book does the books really good for like three-quarters of the way through and then it seems like they just kind of tried to finish it hmm you know it's like very compelling in the beginning it's like an interesting storyline like okay I see what's going on I'm not much of a reader and kind of dyslexic do you listen to books on tape I know it doesn't work from either oh really yeah I always say have too many voices in my head but I when I'm when I'm working I mean I have a real hard time you like if you do a red carpet thing and these people talk in any other side it's short-circuits my brain right and they asked me a question and I'm just hearing these other people and I words don't want to come out of my mouth you know and it's kind of that way when I'm working and I think part of it like I said it was an only child mm-hmm I learned working in a room by myself Brian in quiet you know Brian I like it that way I mean I if I sculpt or paint I listen to music but if I do stuff on the computer I'll do a lot of designs on the computer and stuff and I do some computer animation stuff for fun I can't have any other hmm sounds and stuff yeah you justify need to be focused if I you know my wife knows this very well if I'm trying to answer any email and she's like talking to me I just totally screw it up I mean hi your brain just doesn't work that well I did a book signing the other night and if people are talking when I'm signing my name I wrote I wrote the prayer is a person had spelled her name and then they said they were seeing something else and I screwed up their book oh okay mom I've written my name wrong in the book there's a picture some drawings I did as a kid and one I did a pen-and-ink of Dracula and I wanted to be because it was pen and ink and I couldn't erase it I you know got out Famous Monsters to make sure I spelled Dracula right and very carefully he was looking at the letters and writing an opinion ink it says Drac Lila and I did a painting from my wife this kind of romantic hold a painting you know it was for Valentine's Day and I wanted it I didn't know how to spell Valentine so I looked it up and I very carefully painted Valentine time so again thank God that my career choice worked out because I couldn't work in an office and I'm sure I'd be a homeless guy no I mean my brain just doesn't work like a normal person well but it would the way it does work is wonderful the way your brain ten focus on the things that you really love and you figure out how to how to get it to focus correctly just shut the music off just be alone yeah it surprised me that I can do that you know in and and I really get in the zone I really focus on what I'm doing and to me I mean the funny thing is I mean my I think I started saying this before I was talking about not wanting to be a businessman and stuff and people are always surprised that I'm hands-on still you know a lot of other people who have for example Stan Winston who was great and did some great stuff and was great for the makeup industry and and and helped advance the state of the art was a businessman more than a hands-on guy he hired people to do the work and he had a good eye and he would contribute stuff but he rarely sculpted the stuff I tried to sculpt the stuff I design the stuff you know I'm in and I'm always surprised when people go I paint and sculpt and do all these things you know and and when people see one of my paintings they go you can paint you know I'm just like they're shocked that I can paint and I go you can sculpt you know I have a there's a bronze gorilla at the hell Izu as a sculpture that I did and people go you can sculpt it's part of what I do no no that werewolf came from yeah you know but yeah I don't know what I was going with that but yeah I I you think that there's ever a project that could come up that could tempt you into coming out of retirement if somebody listens to you on this podcast and realizes that a lot of people fuck with you while you worked and said Rick we could do something amazing just one more you know when I first retired I would have said yes I mean I was leaving it open that I said well I'll maybe do designs or consult you know I'm having way too much fun doing my own thing you know I mean I I still probably have the remains of my Halloween makeup you know Halloween is a big thing in my family mm-hmm I'm so sorry they didn't send you a copy of the book it's gone I'll get it don't worry I get it up put it on the Instagram oh it's not so much about that I just say if you're a fan I think you're like oh I am a feminine way by the response that I mean it's awesome when people I mean they're loving it and it's known it's like 250 bucks you know but it's weighs 17 pounds it's too vile and with 2,000 pictures in it up from birth basically in my last film and beyond you know in in my retirement but I don't know where I was going with that what you asked me well we were talking about possibly coming out oh yeah mate you were saying how much fun you're having right now no I I seriously doubt that anything would we get me back well that's great to hear well cuz it's not great you know I'd love it if you did another movie but it's great to hear that you're having such a good time well you know anything say um when I watched Breaking Bad mmm and Bryan Cranston you know is such a great actor but I said you know he would make a great lunch Haney if they ever did a remake of man of a thousand faces which was the story of lon chaney he would be a perfect person you know besides being a great actor and my wife so me and I went to a Comic Con and went to a panel that they had on Breaking Bad and and we went back in I met Bryan and Vincent and I said that to him you know hmm you know and I don't know maybe if that happened you know I I don't think anybody would go see that film now and how many people have no lon chaney is you know you know but he to be able to recreate some of those makeups on and after like that you know if it was the right people but again I I realized you know I mean death became a more real thing to me when my parents died and I have friends that were younger than me that are dead now on my favorite crew or my best guys and we just recently passed 54 or something um and I know there's an end in sight and I know you know I've got arthritis my I've got cataracts I there's a limited time that I have left to do the things I want to do and I want to do what I want to do you know what I mean and I don't want the frustration in the stress beautiful yeah beautiful look you already did it one of the most amazing movies ever I mean you know if I died today which I hope I don't I mean I would be happy without accomplish and that was another thing with the book I mean when you see it laid out there in 800 pages you know saying well I made a lot of shit my time you know yeah I've made a lot of stuff and and and I'm proud of what I made you know I mean you do the best you can and the circumstances and I fight one of the things that I realized when I read the book to which a Cameron publishing who did the book in and Jonathan Rinzler who wrote it who did he interviewed me a lot and he also went back to old articles and all things at the time and did a really nice job of weaving the story together but when I read it I thought God you know what a pain in the ass I am but I fight for what I think is right for example the Grinch How the Grinch Stole Christmas they wanted me to paint Jim Carrey green and that was it you know and it was like well I mean I think they wanted to Sahara too you know but right but it couldn't come on you know it's not called how the green Jim Carrey sold Christmas all right Grainger's don't Christmas yeah Grinch you know so I did like I do many times on myself like I did a Wolfman I make myself up but I films himself in his show so I made myself up what I thought the Grinch would look like I film some stuff cut it together I shot him good you guys this is cooler than that green Jim Carrey I'm sorry you know and then gone well it doesn't look like Jim Carrey and go no because it's on me gonna go but again it's not the green Jim Carrey you know right and it's it seems to me it should be this character not just you know yeah I fought and fought and fought and I ended up doing a thing where I decided to use the internet to help me get my point across so there was a internet movie site at the time that was popular in and I knew the guy who ran it was I was a fan and I said can you say that you saw this test that I did and the guys at Universal were making a big mistake you know and just let the fans chime in so there was like thousands are responsible what the hell is wrong with these idiots that are run in the movie studios that shouldn't I don't want to see green Jim Carrey I want to see a grand show so like two weeks before we started filming me they changed because of this well and I had sent you know I only sent the copy of my test to Brian Grazer and Ron Howard and Ron's going how did this guy get hold of this copy of the attack long I don't know I only sent it to you and and Brian no and I'm gonna didn't let him know what I did at the time now I don't care because it came it's I think the movies better for it you know sure and in fact even at an Oscar party one of the executives the studio came up to me and said you know thank you for for doing the Grinch in and for arguing with us cuz you were the decision was right it was definitely right he turned him into the Grinch he really was the Grinch but I thought I was gonna get hit by a meteor or something this is not an executive never tells you that stuff you know I know but I again I mean I I fight because it's my work and if my names on it I want it to be of a certain quality you know and it's not easy to get it done that way you know and and it's part of the battle you know but it's also part of the frustration you know so no I only have to fight with myself you know beautiful listen man thank you very much for coming here it's been an honor and really I was really looking forward to this as a real treat for me to get to sit down and talk to you thank you so much I'm glad we do anybody has an America more open their Lobby can't be bad guy thank you Rick thank you she ate it my pleasure bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
