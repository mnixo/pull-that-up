hello freak bitches so after you got through this yeah what made you do 4 & 5 there's always the carrot of like just wait by the way here's what they do they set up that you're the auditor now so you're you're auditing these things in your body you're now the boss so they go they tell you get your hat on like you're it's your job you don't need to believe anything you just need to audit them so you need to do your job as an auditor that's what they're called auditors people who are the one to take you into session and playing ecology right so you feel like you're in a leadership role so you're doing these things a favor you know and you're like well maybe it's true I don't know I mean I do sometimes hear voices you know like you know you have a moment with yourself and you're like it might be really kind of crazy so you're like maybe this is an answer it's it's sick because it speaks to a side of you that wants answers about life you know and then you're like no this is some crazy shit man that it wasn't even that people a twat no you know it listen you believe what you want to believe at the time right does it feel to you at the moment like maybe if you just keep going all that it'll fall and what and I'll make sense yes like I'm confused now but if I contemplate this I really think it over eventually I'm going to receive enough information right it's all going to be like all right I was a fool what I hate then right so for example one time I had talked to a friend about it I said you know and her song about some zena's shit she really pulls me into celebrity Center so fast into a secured room and she handed me my ass she said don't you ever say that word outside a secured room I'm writing a knowledge report on you she said I'm writing reply guys you never say that word out loud in a room that's not secured okay and never won and so she wrote a report on my knowledge report she wrote a knowledge report on me I got sent to what's called ethics which is like the Justice Department of celebrity of Scientology and they said they brought me into another secured room because they have to get somebody who knows this information and if it never ever say that would say never confirm it never deny it never give that information out ever that just never discuss it just say I've never heard of it you sound crazy and then I also this is all just theories of course and I'm not going to research any of this but I think parents try to outdo each other with their stories about what the fuck they felt and it just becomes like they're really they're really like they're not sane people most parents know and I've learned to kind of already be like they'll just sit down next to you like you're Forrest Gump they'll just sit down and just start talking to you so you just had your kid I said you got to watch out for you know I remember my kid in blah blah blah blah do it's like airplane you know I mean with it with a fucking person he talks to me you want to kill yourself it's wait until you start going to school and you gotta you gotta hang out these parents all the time because your kids become friends with their kids and then you you become friends these people that you would never be fucking friends with this is what I do is I just look straight ahead and I don't look at him I don't respond to what they're saying and then they just sort of talk quieter and gradually leave you're gonna have to go to dinner with them and your wife can be friends with some lady you're gonna let's go on a double date okay fine you're going to go this one guy no he talks and he doesn't look at you he tells me these fucking stupid stories about his kid in the basketball team and he looks at you for a second so so what Adams in his bathrobe and he starts looking dumb he's like and that did the coach won't put him in the game and I'm saying like he's a good player good player coming up working with the game and he's fucking rambling rambling with no regard whatsoever for your attention span the entertainment value of what'd he say he just the underlining insecurity of not being able to look at you or he's so in self-involved he's self-involved doing some weird thing with his hands where he's like click talking with his hands and I'm going Jesus Christ looks literally like someone's what fantasize about doing to him oh not just running just running away I want to hurt him the guys hurt by life he's so damaged by life I don't wanna do anything to him I just wanna get the fuck away I always picture those people and I have a giant roll of duct tape I just put it on that it's like a cartoon level speed now cartoon level I just put it on the mouth and I go and the last one it comes up and over their head and then it hangs down the whole rest of the tape is hanging down over their head awkwardly shit and I and then I just go back to eating or whatever and they just sit there and slowly have to take it off there's some brutal fucking people it's you know there's a bunch of weird people that you you know you get closer to them and closer to them and you find out about their life yeah but you know and all those people I want to do that too I'm sure they're talking about me so for sure yeah yeah I'm sure they talk about me too that's just how it goes seemed like he was in a bad mood now all the time yeah yeah this is friend of Ron Weitz who's a friend of mine who the first time you met music oh I don't know and Ron's like I'm telling you he's a good guy like he's a dad too and we're all buddies together now but he's like I don't know I just I'm guarded I've been beaten down by some of these fucking basketball stories these assholes yeah yeah my kid he's a good player he's a good player did you want put him in the game just you think of things that you would torture somebody talking about and you like I would never do this to you why you doing this to me you're not even thinking about like verbal waterboarding you're like in your own little Guantanamo that's a great way that's writing like when is the desert all right coming so I could say I don't need dessert so what should we do Gary beep let's wrap this up what should we do what should people do people should fucking stop complaining right people figure out all the fuck they are good call people should not listen to America propaganda of fixing the shit they suck at they should be trickling down at what they're good at they should be competent in certain areas but you're not going to become Beyonce or you know like your bone structure is a certain way like you're not going to solve everything your IQ can get a little bit better but don't worry about the incremental figure out what you fucking put you on fire and your halfway decent at if you're lucky enough right now to be listening and you're good at what you like become Tunnel fucking vision because there's way too many voices telling you what and how and here's the other thing and this is the big one job because you have a humongous audience the biggest thing that I've seen dividends from have the conversation with the person that's holding you back the reason most people who are listening right now we're not doing that thing is they're worried about the opinion of somebody usually their mother usually their father and the reality is is that your spouse may be the person holding you back and you have to have that conversation cut them off we have to get to a place where you're doing you because the number one thing that scares the fuck out of me is regret and you're going to sit there 72 and you say I wish I wish I wish and whether that's money or spend more time with your family there's a million ways to do this not everybody wants to buy the jet not everybody wants to smoke weed on the beach in Bahamas like everybody's got a different fucking thing figure out what your fucking thing is and stop making fucking bullshit excuses who the president is your mom did this like like I missed it I had that idea for uber then why didn't you fucking do it dick that's what I think Joe inaugural this is not about parties we're taking these people on we're bringing God back in even from our that wasn't very religious like Trump has gotten religion learning about this because let me tell you something Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves God and he's been briefed on all this and he's going to roll their ass up so the pedophiles better get ready I want to I want you to clear something up right now look at that camera and tell everybody you're not Bill Hicks haha tell those stupid tell them you're not I'm not either tell them well number one I can people think there's a goddamn conspiracy until a potentially die here's what happens they think it's a flatterer - I take real stuff notice Joe's on his research documents ask so he knows all these little points I'm making better than I even did yeah I'm like remembering stuff when he brings it up because I try to suppress that this crap I can't handle anymore man I'm 43 and I'm sitting here looking at all this and then these people come see on the street they go Hey Joe Hey Joe said like five times and that I tried like oh I knew you were you know we're me not Joe I don't know Alex whatever whatever your fucking name is now I've shown by the program is over yell at another major in Canada a benefit ya know they say Joe here's the I'll be on the street I'll be the restaurant and they come over they go they say hey Bill hey Bill hey Bill I made a really show Rogan mercy and and and I'm did I turn around though I know it's you all because I get a few pieces in one little video with a guy that lived in Austin that you knows how I met you would be you don't a little bit like Bill Hicks that's what's ridiculous about it like what did you get like massive plastic surgery changed the way your voice sounds like your voice is so different than exciting is that no one ever wants to look real conspiracies because they're complex and hard to understand they want to just go with the earth is flat you know there's aliens living underneath the Capitol dinosaurs aren't real or well no I mean listen the point is I'm not gonna bash Eddie Eddie and it's good to have a free open mind but he doesn't promulgate stuff he's only researching what's been said so I want to just get this out of the way I am Bill Hicks I'm actually you are how old Bill Hicks be like 60 I think he died at 32 in 1994 so do the mouth I know one thing it's hot in here is it really oh no how do you not know I was much do get really cold oh do you well you get crazy you're a goddamn elfin inferno I'm melting [Music]
