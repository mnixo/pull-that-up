hello freak bitches I know a dude who thought he was buying a stereo but he's actually buying bricks you got one of those stereo he's a fucking half a mother he stopped at the street and bought it from a guy named Jamal I had a guy I was buying pet food I pulled into this parking spot I got out and this dude literally opened the van like he was gonna take me in and fuck me like I was like some little kid who's about to scoop up out of the woods and like it was a molester and I'm like what like what do you got he's like stereos 1by stereo I was like this is the weirdest he's opened up the door like as people parked the car and like was literally like oh hey man you want some of this like you're asking for trouble if you do business one of those guys oh that's the most obvious shit ever you know he's just randomly trying to sell a stereo out of the back of a van like now what are these things that they do and whatever light people go and they have what do they call junket see it well how are the junkets no no no I'm sorry the the thing off the fucking five do you always see in the movies and all the fucking Friday they all go to a place and they they they buy stereos and radar hats swap swap meet oh yeah well in their way it's a swap meet in Jersey they called what do they call the market something like that yes that was a Cajun I used to go to where they used to do the the bicycles whatever those Street car races and next door to it they had what whatever was called and you'd go there and they had pretty much shit that was stolen it was just a festival and they tried the table free because everything was 50% off even the sneakers I remember and then we found out that the guy would go to the fucking factory and jump over the fence and take all that the sneakers no mistakes so the irregulars mm-hmm they would take those and just sell them at those anymore it's swap meets oh and then we found that we cut into his action I swear to god we could we cut into that action and the Binaca action then our car those tubes are blocked best prank they would throw thousands of a mount with the little things like the chemical was off you start blinking too much like the chemical would be off then it was best to spray like real pepper spray like people would spray it and you see what happened it's not regular Binaca what is that teargas it was like the [Music] Spanish kid that was a frittata and we make him jump the fence and we'd have thousands of tubes Oh we'd sold for fifty cents a piece on Monday in the sixth and seventh grade hilarious but there was always three kids that complained it was a little like the chemical imbalances all I've been saying for a while that I think Caitlyn Jenner created Donald Trump not really but who created this thing I mean I think there was a thing there was a tipping point and for me it was when they gave her a woman of the year in Glamour magazine and then ESP of her athlete of the year yeah and remember that ridiculous thing that they did were they circled her house with a helicopter and she was hiding behind the curtains and it was about mysterious like what in the fuck are you selling what is this and for people at home that are like in Indiana and they're drinking beer and they like football and they want to watch the ESPYs to see you know like who won best quarterback of the year and they're seeing that kind of shit they're like what the fuck is this we need to make America great again yes you know I never linked it that specifically but I think you're totally right even right now when I've been watching NBA season just started and I love basketball every time I turn on TNT now it's Barkley and Kenny Smith and Shaq and Ernie Johnson talking about race they're not talking about basketball they're talking about race they're talking about policing those are all important issues to talk about but people go to sports for the release they go to sports because they care about the athletes and what's happening on the field and in the in the boxing match whatever it is and now everything is becoming politicized so ESPN is giving their athlete of the Year to Caitlyn Jenner it makes no freakin sense well that wasn't about ratings down you know it's because people are talking about Kaepernick and politics instead of sport does that make the ratings go down really is the ratings boom the ratings are hugely down in the NFL this year and a lot of people are linking that I don't know it empirically I wouldn't be shocked there's a lot of people in this country just have zero tolerance I mean it's almost like separation of church and state yeah they would like their sports to just be sports and about sports yeah you know and I I kind of appreciate that in a certain way because it's like if you were watching a comedy show and all sudden during that comedy show they started deeply discussing religion and right like really like discussing deep intricacies of different faith-based cultures you'd be like what the fuck am I want this is not comedy right do is funny sure but once you've heard that thing and now you're doing something else right you're doing a different thing I'm not doing sports you're doing you're doing race relations are you doing but I understand that it's also they look at it as a platform for our culture and that's what Kaepernick did he said look I have this platform and in some ways I think what he did kind of worked because a lot of kids in high school now are doing that they're taking knees and the national you know when they do the national anthem it's strange but it's also like the black like when people have the black fist at the Olympics those dudes that did that in the night of seventies I think with 71 maybes everyone tell you whatever that was I mean that got people talk and this gets people talking to and maybe sometimes you need to kind of inject some sort of something to think about yeah during sporting events I'm not I'm not telling them not to do it of course I would Nick Kaepernick wants to do that go ahead these guys if Berkeley and all that wanna if they're TNT bosses are okay with it may go well you know you can do that instead of talking about how many points Durant had then so be it but I'm just saying what I think most people want from sports is an escape yeah and I can tell you for sure in the two or three weeks at the NBA seasons been gone every time I flipped by TNT and they're doing that I change it when those homeless people are breaking in my house joy drove by every night how many homeless people broke in your house a couple really yeah because we're under construction we're renovating on the first one broke in Brumbies very fucking similar you can't scare him really yeah I was sitting I had dinner at my sister's house the girls went inside everything is under construction we got like a big dumpster out front it looks like it's under construction and I'm sitting off to the side with smoking a cigar in the darkness and this girl just starts walking in walking up the driveway starts to go into our back yard and I see her and I'm like wait why No I must know her it's a weird thing when you get robbed that you're like it's like a such a confrontation that you're like like have you ever been like in the competition and someone's like hey man and you're like oh I must know this person hi and then they attack you and you're like oh fuck this is how it starts that that was what happened this girl was just going our backyard I go on we must know her and I go hey can I help you and then she was like oh hey and she like said something like I worked for the DWP or some child's organization something and I was like no this is this is you're breaking into my backyard you and I start fucking shouting at her and she just keeps walking towards me she's not fucking scared at all Priscilla is a 130-pound bull mastiff a beast of a fucking dog is going at her like leaping at her and all this keeping up is a little tiny like dog fence that we had in our front yard it's time fearless this woman was you couldn't shake her hair I think a heroin addict probably mmm yeah and and I was like motherfuckers we called the cops and then the cops show up I ever was shit on cops I loved him they showed up in three minutes they were there in three minutes the woman had already taken off I told him where she went and the guys like yeah it's you know there's a new heroin dealer in town a lot of a lot of junkies and homeless people are gonna be loitering around here until we stop that but he's like I'm sorry and I'm looking what both my daughters are in the in the doorway and they're looking out and I'm like hey man I tell the cops a good deal on if the girls come down for like two seconds and you just let them know that they'll be like you're gonna there's nothing to worry about and he said yeah no girls gone down so jours an island come down and they had lollipops and they put notes on it they said you are our heroes and they gave them to the cops I'm gonna talk about a heart fucking breaking moment these cops are like ladies well first of all we will be circling this block all long nothing type in this house we will keep an extra good eye on this house and Georgia starts pulling on my shirt she's like dad let's go dad let's go I was like hold on George he's not done I think she's like dad dad I think we should go to the house and I was like Georgia it's fine by the guy gives his speech and we walked back to the house and I was wearing this shirt and she goes you are wearing a marijuana shirt [Music]
