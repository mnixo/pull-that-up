the girag and experience think about how much of our lives are influenced how much of our society is built on services that bring pleasure to our senses and our sense of touch we can go get a massage damn right you can you know the right place our our sense of taste there is food what to asine right our sense of hearing Shore we make beautiful music our sense of sight we make great art so much of what we do is to satisfy our five traditional senses and imagine if we had ten senses or twenty I have a theory on that it's called the fart principle I have no understanding of how that principle could relate to this but I'm all ears so this is why if you did not have a nose and you could live your whole life without a sense of smell in the year 2012 it's very possible if you if someone farted in front of you you would have no idea that this terrible gas is you're inhaling it's in your note you wouldn't have that sense of smell so you could exist and not have any idea because gas is invisible okay that's a bad example and I'll tell you want some good exact could be alien life form all around us all the time that we don't have the sense to like it's like worms can't see so you'll be able to weaken so two things so first it's it's a good example in the sense that no pun intended in the sense of that without if who knows what senses we're missing and therefore who knows what there is to measure in our world around us that we are completely missing right all right get back to that in a minute regarding your fart theory yes here's the problem all right the my theories up for peer review it is a code it is totally getting peer reviewed the device is the right thing to call it - it's a legitimate hypothesis thank you it's out on the table now here you go you ready it's my lab so uh one of the active ingredients in the smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide mm-hmm it turns out hydrogen sulfide is extremely Lethal is one of the most lethal gases that exists well why do we have such a good sense of smell for that why don't we smell other get why don't we smell nitrogen mm-hmm well we don't need to smell nitrogen because it's not going to kill us because it's 78% of what you breathe anyway hmm we have evolved a hypersensitive sense for the smell of hydrogen sulfide if if there was a Jenner if you gave birth to someone who said hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful and let's smell more of it let's get canisters of it they're dead ten minutes later no longer able to propagate the gene that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide we had to not like that smell otherwise we would not have survived the by the way hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of the the digestive activity of anaerobic microbes that's why it comes out of your lower intestine with not only where the Sun don't shine where oxygen doesn't exist the microbes that thrive down there they are an aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is one of their byproducts it has been theorized that there have been places and times on earth where the ocean currents stopped and when ocean currents stopped oxygen at the surface of the ocean never makes it to the bottom so you can't sustain oxygen life-forms at the bottom of the ocean there are no fish there wouldn't be any fishes down there if the ocean currents stopped because the ocean currents not only go from one place to another in the world they circle they circulate top to bottom right so it's a two-dimensional thing going on three dimensions actually so so if something happens on earth will you stop the oceanic cycles you can create a condition in the lower ocean where anaerobic life-forms thrive and if they thrive they out gas and one of the out gases hydrogen sulfide it will gurgle up from the bottom of the ocean rise up near the shores turning shorelines into the smell of cesspools if you were alive at the time and didn't run away from that you would have simply died from it that is all well and good therefore the normal level the nose theory that if we didn't have a nose we could all just fart we didn't have a nose we wouldn't have noticed hydrogen sulfide and humans would not have survived it and some other creature would be having this interview right now I not agree with you and disagree with you at the same time and here's why what you're saying involves real people and real life adaptation to our environment what I'm talking about is aliens that are just like farts and this is why you gave me a crazy long-winded really in-depth explanation but you still don't discredit the possibility that just like the sense of smell it exists but it is invisible there could be many things around us that are also invisible but we have not developed any means to detect that okay you were being metaphor so it works right Wi-Fi yeah well but you a bitch wait so you're being metaphorical with your father yes Oh God but saying do I live no one would have had to have it oh no I know first parties yes what I overanalyze you right through it wait you will hear it and you beat it down that's cool that's cool oh by the way one global warming scenario is the currents yes you see the day after tomorrow did you see that unbelievably horrible yeah yeah that one was was that went to two glows yo good who was bad when it was the cancer baby and everybody else is dead outside but there she's surviving with the cancer baby and she's gonna stay there for the kid me 100 billion people are dead so no drugs at all so let me get back to your nose your partner just crazy oh okay so now here's why you're probably not right well definitely not right look it's a ridiculous idea no no no no but there's a reason why you're probably not right okay okay because beginning in the 1600s we learned that our senses are not only they not only fool us they and occasionally don't work they're not all that the universe tells us is that they are not they don't have the capacity to recognize all that's going on in the universe well certainly at a microscopic level well that's my point that's my point so in the early 1600s two important advances actually late 1500 you had the invention of the microscope and you had the invention of the telescope this is really the first steps to enhance our senses beyond what our human biology endowed us with and upon doing so we discovered things about the world that were previously oblivious to us we discovered nose farts when Louie when leuwen Hoch brought his telescope of his microscope to a drop of pond water and saw what were called anima cul√©s what else were you going to call the little things paramecia and protozoa thriving in a drop of water that was a nose for it keeping with your vocabulary that was something that previously no one had any idea was there and my point is beginning in 1600 and with an ever improving march forward the methods and tools of science have served to enhance our senses increase our senses increase the range of our senses but more importantly give us whole kinds of senses that your five senses could have never even imagined that our human biology couldn't even approximate so as so so what's an example yeah we don't have senses to detect magnetic field at all that's why you can sit in an MRI chamber and sit there in you know whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea the strength of the magnetic field that's being cast across your body we don't have sensors for it you don't have sensors for radio or radio waves well the difference there is we do have sensors for one aspect of the electromagnetic spectrum we have sensors for infrared visible and a delayed sense for ultraviolet sent me oh wow that's pretty loud and a creative ringtone just like mine yeah and learn that ghosts aren't dangerous he goes old yeah yeah so so the point is the radio waves are part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum we we have access to some of that and we call that for obvious reasons visible light right but outside of the range of visible light you have ultraviolet x-rays gamma rays radio waves microwaves so yes we can't see radio waves but that would just be an extension of our senses in the way Geordi and Star Trek The Next Generation had his visor though that visor allowed him to see the entire disco star Trigon I got it had to go there just cause I had to and my sideburns are Star Trek sideburns I don't know if he so he puts the what he that visor enabled him to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum if we were thusly equipped you'd walk down the street and the microwave towers would be ablaze with microwaves and you tuned into sort of ultraviolet and if you you'd think twice about going to the beach because that's the stuff that gives you skin cancer especially people with lighter skin if you if if you want to see what would be a good example if you want to see if there's a burglar entering your house just shift over to infrared if the burglar is warm-blooded they will show up even if all the lights are out like the predator exactly exactly it's another way to detect the light so so we have so science has broadened our senses and given a sense is that our human biology could not have even thought of or invented so the notion at this day and age that something is happening on this tabletop that is eluding us I think is just simply unlikely because we're so good now at finding things that previously I escaped our notice right in front of us right now that frontier is that the energy extremes of the CERN accelerator in Switzerland that frontier is at the James Webb Space Telescope where we're going to look at the earliest formation of matter in the history of the universe these are the extremes of our measurements of nature today you're a fucking human being
