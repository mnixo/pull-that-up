the girag and experience yeah here's another lesson I learned that I have to remember before I forget that I learned about the movie business Dave had a fucking great movie called the wrong guy yeah and it was a great movie and we went to see it I think Bryan Callen went to sit with me and we were fucking howling and I was like holy shit dave is gonna be a huge movie star that's gonna be a huge movie and I remember watching it going like this is like one of the best comedies I've seen in years and then nothing yeah Disney shelved it yeah well what happens how Hollywood Pictures was our distributor at Disney then they shot Hollywood Pictures down in the middle of production and then when we were done they reopened Hollywood Pictures but with a new president of Hollywood Pictures and he didn't want to touch any of the stuff that the other guy had started I always they're like that yeah because if it's there if it's a failure it's their failure yeah but if it's a success it's the other guy success yeah so they just don't deal with it so they so got shelved for like five years like they would even admit they had it so he never had a theatrical release never got theatrical release so it's available on DVD right now and dollars on Amazon right now yeah really well then people said oh yeah I'm gonna pick it up right now with some one-click while we're doing the podcast yeah that it's actually what I'm one of the things I'm proudest of is that movie like creatively and comedic Lee it was brilliant you know it was there he goes watch this one click Oh done it's that easy people I love amazon.com yeah that was a brilliant fuckin movie was really fun I had enjoyed the shit out of it and I remember you guys all coming out to see it that screening yeah yeah and I remember thinking after is over after the whole thing where it didn't work out and never got a mic while this is a this business is crazy like this yes doesn't make any sense I know cuz we really thought we you know we were clear cuz we had you know the big thing was always well if you're doing an independent film can you get distribution and we went into it with distribution we had Disney lined up in the script phase you know so we had distribution lined up we had even had we were even in profit in foreign sales while we were shooting the movie based on a trailer whoa that was taken - can so we had we had advance sales foreign sales that put the movie in profit while we were shooting but they were all contingent on a US release it seems like you could get my meeting and talk to the new head gun go Dali yeah we tried it for years well thank you we make a big deal we'll do press releases yesin yeah we tried to hit just me for a year and they just wouldn't have anything to do it now Wow now there were other people even tried to buy it from Disney and they wouldn't sell it really yeah Wow because it emphasises success then they fucked up yeah wow what a creepy fucking business you wonder why Dave Chappelle went to Africa yeah yeah well it's beautiful there
