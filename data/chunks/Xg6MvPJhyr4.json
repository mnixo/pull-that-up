Haynes fresh back from Australian outback where he's out there wrestling croc see those reflexes fuck that was good even hit the table didn't even come close that's years of jiu-jitsu years of trying to keep people from choking me yeah my instincts a little too jumpy that's the problem right - too much quick movement there's got to calm that shit down to the bonding oh right honey's the opposite you need the opposites and steady baby yeah she's bowhunting is pretty much the opposite way of thinking than jiu-jitsu cuz jiu-jitsu you got a fucking oh that is a you gotta get out yeah constantly but you gotta constantly be protecting yourself and moving and trying to close the deal the hunting is like steady yeah cuz you hear out there wrestling Wallabies I heard yeah something like that Jamie's ready to go Jamie's he was saying that he's like I want to wrestle a fucking wallaby I don't think you will be up we saw a dead one and it has claws about that long do they're real yeah I mean so you can imagine and their legs are just obviously bouncing all the time their legs have just got to be jacked in with those big claws I mean what I try to relate it to is if have you ever tried to hold down a cat a house cat that doesn't want to be half man right so they have a little tiny claws many of the wall would be with those jacked legs and big claws could do plus it's wild would be good I have a wild cat I had a feral cat is that random Wow the cute little fella yeah whoa yeah that's not real is that real that's really it's teeth yeah Jesus Christ I'll look at the claws on those things if I don't know if it'll show claws ever I can't believe they have teeth like that see those front claws what the hell's a wallaby eat I figured while B was like eating nuts and shitting now I think the murderers like babies so it looks like a little kangaroo yeah oh they have a kangaroo tail in the whole deal yeah yeah yeah they're just they're very similar kangaroos it's not a real teeth though that wasn't photoshopped Google Wow Google Wallabies teeth because I just have a feeling that was bullshit I just looked like a vampire there I feel like they're like the ugly stepchild of kangaroos because they're kind of more hunched over I'm like ah damn we're losing viewers what crazy right god yeah we're top live then we're losing viewers like crazy we're down to five thousand nine hundred we're dropping maybe I'd turn it towards me maybe that's a problem uh probably when it's turned towards cam Oh jump it back up oh yeah we're up to 6500 it is your is your paid Hey that's after I leave it that can't be real that's a the one we're looking at right now is like vampire deer I've seen those things before those vampire deer that's a real thing right those deer with those crazy fangs I think so yeah it's real but like why do they have fangs like that like why does they're not predators for a strange did you see that uh they found for the first time ever a deer eating a human carcass a deer yeah yeah a scientist receiving a pull that story I posed yesterday all right folks is very distracting go to Joe Rogan dot live and you can see this whole thing I would read this but here's the thing about getting older folks your fucking eyes start to go Cameron Haynes eyes are still excellent though I tell you this motherfucker cast yeah he can't see anything conspiracy theory with the same age with the same age in his eyes I don't why my suck but uh this way good oh my dick is getting bigger almost going on with that either no imagine tit for tat people would trade in glasses for bigger dick for sure um show feet what does that people are so weird yeah hi now some of the people put they put weird comments just to get you to read them and here they got me this fuck alright folks I'm gonna shut this off and we're going to just have a podcast Joe Rogan dot live you can watch for streaming on YouTube until we make this big deal with twitch yeah ma'am and live video do I save it done nope didn't save it target does it you can save them yeah as a little thing up an upper right hand corner but I didn't I saw it right as I was pressing and mid press it's not like what's the big deal you know don't know I don't know dude so never-before-seen deer spotted eating human bones make sense though like they would just think it's like calcium calcium yeah they don't know it's a bone it's not like they like fuck these people it something's like finally deers eating people no but we've showed videos before of deer eating birds like cuz they eat birds all the time oh they do yeah yeah like literally actively going after Birds like the falling out of nests really deers like following it and the birds trying to chase the deer off and deers like yeah whatever I'm eating that bird look at this so this Bert this deer is the other birds they like get out of there get out it's a button buck he's got these little tiny dubs and he's trying to get this ground nesting bird he's going to go through that past that tree and then the guy filming it see see the bird hopping around the ground so it's a bird that fell out of a nest oh they don't have like the moment eat that oh yeah hunt yeah it's kind of Lee's chasing it I mean he's going after a purpose what a predator is look at the speed the speed that deer shows but it just shows you how opportunistic live animals are oh yeah wild animals like some something in that deers body tells it to eat that thing hey there's no compassion out there for animals no much animal an animal look at him he's eating it oh my it's dark yeah that's what he goes yeah life eats life it's just weird to see a deer for some reason eat a bird and do it on purpose his oxide oh yeah this is good right he's good there's a some sort of wildlife thing uh they were doing some sort of a survey and they captured these birds with a net they had this net set up in this area with these birds fly just so they could capture these particulars but the deer kept eating the birds and they couldn't figure it out they're like what is going on here and then they watched they had a video of these deer walking up and picking them off the net and eating these birds well the birds like jaysus I can't believe this happen yeah getting eaten by a deer yeah you don't see that every day no but I'm not surprised yeah I'm not surprised either I've seen cows do it too this videos of cows doing it for the longest time people didn't think that they thought that you know those are just herbivores yeah no they're just nature's just set him up to be super slow but if something really delicious is in front of them I thought it was an Eddie Bravo thing Oh conspiracy yeah he came up with it no it's not an Eddie Bravo get spread fun Eddie Brau believes a lot of conspiracies but he doesn't believe that what is this one Oh what is that an eagle Jack and a bunny rabbit yeah that's a deer oh this is a little deer girls are so ruthless oh look at that BAM we could do this all day folks you got back from the real wild man like ever you were the Instagram story so Cameron Haines and our buddy Adam green tree and a few other fellows were up there in the north country of Australia yeah and you guys took over the underarmor hunt page and it was epic man that the underarmor hunt page like the little Instagram stories yeah I don't like Instagram stories you know why cuz they're only 15 seconds and the little teases I want you guys to be like live-streaming out there yeah be nice wouldn't it but it was super cool where you guys are at was terrifying yeah kept showing these brown snakes these yeah the second most deadly snake in the world yeah that's what I'm told yeah you sound like how many of them uh four or five yeah but it only takes one yeah and you're dead right like I'd realize dead well second most deadly yes doesn't sound good that's okay no no and then there's you know big old spiders and crocodiles yeah you guys saw crocodiles yeah you even filmed crocodiles yeah they were right where we were you know super it was is I mean this is still not even their summer but still very warm I mean where we were up hunting Buffalo at the top man is what they call which is out of Darwin it was 90 to 100 degrees so there's some film yeah of now this is a freshwater crocodile was not as big right not as big or as aggressive as a saltwater croc but could still definitely do damage and this was you know mere feet from where we were sleeping and this is the where we would go and take baths and or just kind of cool down during the heat of the day that's where he was right there and how big was I got oh I don't know 6 8 7 8 feet something like that you know he wasn't huge but he definitely do some damage they don't hold it you did you guys see any other saltwater once what you there no no so when you you're telling me about this one pond that was near you guys or you saw eyes at night you didn't think that was it that was it is right there so the the first night we saw the one just that one right there we went over there and videoed him and and checked him out and then the next night Adam went down there to the creek and it was only about maybe 15 20 feet across his small just very shallow and he looked out and said he there was like six sets of eyes red red eyes which is crocodile so and that was you know they'd moved in so have you ever seen a live saltwater one in the wild um I think we did the last time I hunted there up but I'm trying to remember or maybe which I think when we were flying yeah when we were flying we saw him oh wait because so you have to take a flight from where Adam lives Adam lives near Melbourne right who lived in New South Wales and then you fly four and a half hours to Portland to where these water buffalo are yep and then last time we used a helicopter to get out of Darwin - and that was four hours in the helicopter whoa and so this time we had a helicopter so we through the country kind of look at it and we saw some pretty big Crocs from there on the river system so how do you know like where to stop like when your buffalo hunting how do you know where to go well I mean basically it's however far you can walk you know I mean you kind of get we were walking I don't know I want to say at least 10 miles a day 10th end I think Adam and his guys one time his camera guy walked 18 miles one day so we were just you know we were always you know 10 12 13 miles a day so discovering country it was it was hard hunting up there right now because this is their wet season or the tail end of their wet season and so the foliage was was really grown up really thick so it was very hard to see the Buffalo normally later when we went it's all burnt up because of you know summer and so there's no foliage and you can see the Buffalo from miles basically but with this grass the grass is in some places eight eight feet tall I mean you'd have to be 50 yards away to see a buffalo and there you know 1,800 1,800 to 2,000 pounds so it's it's makes it hard to find them and then it also makes it dangerous to trail them you know if your blood trailing them or if your even if you just surprise one you know you surprise an animal that close a wild animal like that and who knows how they're going to react yeah that's a huge animal yeah and and with that grass just you know as you know Adam and I did a and the camera guys we did a podcast up there and we were kind of talking about the challenges of the hunt and that was a big part of it is just not being able to see very much country and so people never hunt Buffalo this time of year this is like people say why would you go you're not getting you know nobody goes this time and we did when do they go they go later in the year you know when there's not so much foliage so they go like in their fall there yeah it would be you know what last time I went is December which is just before the West season starts this is the tail into the West season right now so we're thinking about we want to take you up there would be around November October November because you don't want to get stuck in the with the wet season hit because there's a big rains but you want it and also it makes it easier to find the animals because there's not water everywhere right now there's water everywhere so they don't have to be concentrated to get water but later in the year all those a lot of the water sources have dried up so if you got a good waterhole you know every animals come in there well so these are for people who don't know um this is an invasive species of water buffalo yeah an enormous Asian yeah and what is it called is just called Asian water buffalo like what is the actual name and I think it or yeah there might be I just call them Asian water buffalos that seems like there's a sea in there somewhere Asiatic or something I don't know BJ me can look at Jamie look it up but uh it's such a wild cool-looking animal yeah yeah they're big they're big in a my bowl here's a big old bowl on uh we called him in using like a wounded calf call oh wow so this is this is what it looks like yeah well wolves a female obviously typed in Asian water buffalo nothing yeah that's it that's what it looks like yeah go 2 cams Instagram page and there's a picture of the there's yeah there it is now that's Adams oh that's Adams yeah then there's yours is in the upper right hand corner but you only write this the only see the skull yeah and then that's a fucking head if people don't want to see that what is he doing now it's folks that's how you make cheeseburgers fine there's only one way there's another picture of it I think when it's coming it when he's coming in right there right above that Jamie right now right now the one with the far left yeah right yeah right there that's him at full draw or without that's looking through the riser of the bow yeah so that's that bull coming in aggressive he was you can see his eyes he was just pissed off and that's he was coming that's at under 20 yards and he's not stopping and so I shot him their frontal through the chest and had is a almost like self defense Wow so these are animals that if hunters don't go up there and kill them they actually hire people to go up there and kill them right there yeah they I mean these things have has spread disease up there I mean there are a non-native species and they any water source up there is ruined any natural habitat has been ruined because there's so many Buffalo so they just want them killed basically they're like it'd be like similar to coyotes here you know except 2,000 pounds oh yeah yeah yeah and no predators either no there's nothing else to kill them and and maybe a croc could kill a you know small one right but uh they just need you know a coyote down here in North America don't ruin water sources and ruin habitats like these things - these things are just wrecking machines and there's there's hundreds of thousands of them up there so they ruin Walters water sources for the native animals as well like all the other things anything yeah because they shit and piss in the water yeah yeah yeah well it's Australia is so strange and as is New Zealand in that all these people imported animals there in the 1800s and I guess even before was it when did they establish Australia and New Zealand I'm not sure I forget when they step see if you can find out when they establish recently with Josh Zepps didn't we but they they brought in all these animals with no game plan yeah they just let them loose and then they lurk route Jesus so in New Zealand they have these beautiful stags these incredible animals and in some places they have to shoot them out of helicopters just to control the population which we're it for people in America it's like unheard of like how could you do that like that's that's a it's like an elk like a majestic animal you're gonna shoot them out of helicopters just leave them there to die it's way different it's you know up there there's just not enough hunters because in all of Australia they say there's as many peoples are in LA the LA area here in the whole country since New Zealand says it was a ok the first European explorer to sight New Zealand was able Jan Xun what a name Jan Xun Tasman on the 13th of December in 1642 but that's obviously just a European people been there for a long fucking time oh yeah and Australia was 1788 and shortly thereafter then they started bringing in all these animals the idea was that they were going to make it like a European hunting destination right for for rich pitch what what douche bags yeah so they asked all these animals but with no predators right yeah and so people were to come over from Europe and they were going to go to Australia and hunt yeah the rich people and so I think they're in they told me that it seems like it was in 1985 they're gonna wipe out all the Buffalo and they had some money funded for it and they were going to try to get rid of them and they got halfway through and quit they killed like half of them something like that yeah Wow and then they quit and so now it's just as I was saying the whole country's about the size of the United States you were telling me this but I didn't know that the whole country has the same amount of people as live in LA here so there's just not that many hunters you know a small percentage of them are hunters so there's nobody to control all these number of non native species and that's from water buffalo to the fallow deer that I was hunting to stag there's not as many stags as fallow deer but all these species just there's no measure for control really yeah and they brought in a bunch of other non-native species too it's a it's an exercise in conservation gone totally wrong yes they brought in cats to take care of certain animals and they brought in Fox and then the Fox and the cats are out of control and they kill all the ground nesting birds and now it's kind of fucked up to us here in America but people in Australia hunt cats yeah they hunt them the way in they hold them up like look I got one and yeah it's a cat yeah it's weird yes like that's fluffy what the fuck yeah no I we saw a guy and he had a rifle and he's walking on a road there just it he lives there you know I mean that's his home his lived his whole life I think and he's walked on the on the road night went down there I had my bottle and eyes you know I said hey woody after he's like Oh after a big black cat and I'm like like a just a regular cat he's like yeah that's like just a feral you know wild cat he's like yeah it's a black one though he goes so there's a ten dollar bounty on it that the property owners around their head if anybody could kill this black cat is ten bucks but they don't think anything about it because there's just wild cats everywhere how weird is that yeah it is bounty on a kitty cat yeah well people um that have researched it in America just in North America cats kill somewhere in the neighborhood of three billion birds oh yeah yeah billion yeah that when they found that out like apparently like scientists were shocked the biologists were shocked it's between one point five and three point something billion and that's not even counting like mice and rabbits and all the other shit that killed squirrels I never forget I had a cat they used to UM I used to live across street from this park and I had out this one male cat and he was just a murderer and I'll never forget watching him walk across this park with a squirrel between his legs so he was biting down the squirrels neck yeah the squirrels dead and the squirrel was his size practically and it was in between his legs so he's straddling it and walking with it dragging it along so he'd show it to me good deal oh he was super psyched that was awesome he's like dude look what I got it's like alright that's the probably a large percentage of his weight right there it was it was probably no bullshit at least three quarters the size of him yes it wasn't a big cat it was a fat fucking squirrel yeah that that probably have been a nice battle it's just weird the adverse squirrel cats are the weirdest animals man yeah cuz they're they're cool with us but they're straight killers I know but the only story I remember about a cat I can't remember where I heard it her who told me but that oh maybe was one of my cop friends but anyway if a if a I can old say it's an elderly person that has a dog they died the dog is that people come and find the body that the dogs laying there with them you know just like a loyal whatever and if a cat if they have a cat and they die the cat eats our eyelids and lips yeah right away if you stop feeding that cat the cats like look I'm eating it look likes its owner yeah yeah yeah so that's really all you need to know about a cat they eat each other too like crazy old people uh there's just one lady was a hoarder and she had a bunch of dead cats she had so many cats in her house and the cats had died and so they she wasn't feeding the cats yeah cats were eating the dead cat yeah whoo yeah it's hard out there now it's hard out there Cameron AIDS imagine be a cat you live with a hoarder like this bitch doesn't even let me go out yeah let me out I would kill some birds oh yeah that animal just want to be out and live this though that's what we need to we need to be able to live I mean that that two and a half weeks I was in Australia that was man I took two showers the whole time there's a sleeping bag and it must smell good what hey that's just how it goes that's what people are smelling good night yeah we're just used to it yeah so and I'm just for the viewers I'm a clean four I take a couple showers a day but you know when you're hunting that's just the way it goes yeah were you wearing wool no I was no he's warm oh right but like a thin layer merino actually keep cool cuz he sweat net and he regulates heat really well yeah it was you know where we were hunting deer in New South Wales which is outside of Sydney it was actually cold at night I mean that's how you guys were walking on like frozen grass yeah yeah yeah they're covered with frost but I mean it night it was freezing you know I mean it was like 32 degrees we were used to we thought we were gonna be hunting in 90 to 100 degree weather so yeah it didn't you know when you're laying in a sleeping bag that's only rated to 40 degrees in his 32 and sleeping on the ground it's that's rough it's rough you're saying that those deer were like super turned on to or like they were tuned in like yeah they were very strong edge they they've been hunted and you know they don't have liens like we have here that which keep the deer on edge you know because we have the lions are just killers but they don't have a predator like that but man is there an antelope species and or it's a they can see so well and so fast reacting it's just amazing but what are they this is a fallow deer right yeah what are they related to um for I just said it right there you said an antelope but I I'm not sure once I said it I'm like are they so don't don't quote me on that we might have to look that one up too but all I know is the reason why I said that is because they can see I mean antelope or notorious for having an amazing vision you know ten times what what humans have apparently and that's how these were I mean I don't know if the deer antelope or whatever but they can see extremely well so they were seeing you from like a long ways out oh you couldn't I mean I hope there's this one buck out of stock and I had a cameraman with me and that the key for stalking animals is always staying in the shade if if you stay in the shade and you got camo on especially if they're in the Sun you know how it is looking looking into if you're in the Sun you try to look into a house you can't see right so it's the same thing with shadow so you always want me shadow well we were 330 yards away from this buck I was stocking he was feeding in his creek and we had this small patch of sunlight to cross three or thirty yards away it's a long way away and I told the cameraman I'm Mike we just got to get across here just stay low and get you know hustle through there so we could we hunched over and got in seconds we were through there got to the shade looked over at the buck he stand there staring I'm like are you kidding me ha he's already so we're in the shade so then for sure we weren't moving I'm like don't move and he's just staring staring staring staring and I'm like don't move he's like I'm not I don't don't move he's he's on he's just looking anything is going to spook him he's like I'm not moving and he was crouched down on his knees and so finally the buck like took a few bites of grass and I'm like okay he's feeding next thing gone so all he did he's took a couple bites of grass for the road he's like no I already know I'm out of here but I'm taking this with me and he was gone that was it yeah there's smoke that's long rifle range we had bows and it's just a barely this so and we have to get close with a bow and so you could imagine it just if that that one example tells you what it was like basically so we were talking about different bow setups like you had brought two setups he brought one for deer and you bought one for Buffalo so for people that don't understand there's two different ways that you were going to approach this the Buffalo is a giant heavy boned animal so yet a real heavy arrow which is going to go slower yeah and those hours just too slow for those deer and the deer would actually move out of the way before the arrow got yeah yeah like matrix it was you know the thing with penetration with an arrow is weight the weight of the arrow equates to more penetration with heavy bone and you know that we talked about the buffalo 1,800 to 2,000 pounds so you need something that hits hard well when you have a heavier arrow it's going to fly slower so those were flying at 245 feet a second out of my high poundage bow but I thought well good mouth I mean I didn't these will be alright I was shooting it so well I'm so accurate you know practicing out to 90 yards all the time shooting really well so I thought you know what I know it's supposed to be for Buffalo I'm just going to use it for deer so the first week there I tried it for deer and it was just like these deer were seemingly 10 yards away but having the arrow got 2 minutes I'm not talking long shots and I'm like ok maybe there's just a fluke just a flu so they would see it hear it they would hear it and they would duck out of the way or just be gone I mean just like be 10 yards away so they would move out of the way before they all got to them yeah yeah and so finally I thought well maybe it's just in a super calm they're so so quiet you know I don't my bows are quiet a heavy arrow make bow even quieter you know it absorbs that sound and in the energy so your limbs are just like that there is more like so but it still makes an always-on a super calm windless day especially when it's cold you know I mean it's just that sounds going to get across there so I thought well maybe just a fluke maybe the deer were pick something up pick up some movement so they were just on me this is whatever I'm not worried about it you know I'm not used to missing I'm used to be very disciplined on my shots and taking high percentage shots that relaxed animals if I do do my stock right my goal is always to shoot an animal that has no idea I'm there you know so it's relaxed and so that wasn't happening here and I thought well maybe maybe it's just because they're high strong and they were on me so what would the the the time where I decided okay these arrows aren't going to work was a wild boar was out there big boar 45 yards okay this should be slam-dunk money and I just cut camera over my shoulder he had no idea we were there draw back shoot and he had he was facing his head to the left and he was heading back to the right probably a few feet away but time the arrow got there I mean well I didn't even have to even I like shot and went oh are you kidding me he's that gone that fast spun and just gone and so that at that time I Mike okay these this is not gonna work it's so crazy because although there's no predators there the hunters that are there are out there all the time they don't have a season no there's no season these animals are just tuned in 100 every day Wow yeah and so and mostly a rifle so I mean they're used to if they see somebody that's like a danger because they've been shot out from you know hundreds of yards so it's just yeah it was it was challenging but so I changed from those 245 grain arrows and I thought well I need to shoot my not 245 245 feet get that 687 Green Arrow to a lighter arrow and I thought well maybe this will do it yeah you know is shooting 300 feet per second at that time did you change broadheads yep did you go to the trocar no do you step with the solids no I shot with a buffalo and actually you know it's funny actually what I ended up killing the deer with too was uh what were the Magnus stingers and I also that but they expand I had that expandable head you remember that one that I used on the bear yeah it was a grave digger grave digger yeah yeah that ruthless name that head and that that head flies so good oh his money so use that as well yep so when you're out there man like so you're around Sydney which is where people are there's there's those animals are hunted pretty pretty regularly yeah then you're taking that flight for four and a half hours and then the helicopter and when you're in the area where the Buffalo are there's nobody I know it's remote that is a wild wild place yeah when you think about the the size of Australia the size of North America with the same amount of people as Los Angeles but the area where you're at is that that is as wild as it gets yeah I mean would you fly those foreign half-hour from Sydney to Darwin and most that there you're looking down at country with nothing nothing no roads no nothing and that's that's a large majority of Australia's like that and it's just overrun with Buffalo yeah a lot of it is yeah and uh what's a crazy place yeah and we did find some you know some drawings up there too from that from yeah I mean all the natives yeah yeah for the Aborigines and did you did you know that those were there before you went there today I know there was an island new the pilot now yeah so we wanted to go see him oh wow so are they in a cave like where they're on the for the weather not to get to them has to be on like the underside of a rock so where we went we filmed under there's like you could imagine people getting out of the rain there and their huge boulders and they're getting and is just a perfect spot to stay dry and so that's if the rain was if they drew on a part of the rock where the rain was hitting obviously was gone but in these these areas they were protected so that drawings were still there last time Adam was here he talked about some of the Aborigines there and explained some stuff but when we went back to my house we we had dinner and we sat around talking he told me some crazy stories at the the horrors that those people faced and how they had been wiped out like them been poisoned like he went to this one cave and he found bones all through this cave he's like this is crazy there's like human bones he's like children's bones you find children's bones and then he had heard this story from one of the other Aborigines that lived there that someone had brought food to all these people all the NAB originals air and just poisoned the food and just killed them all off yeah it's it's fucking dark yeah yeah dark now I don't know so they don't know that they don't know who made those hieroglyphs or they or the cave drawings or whatever they were or when they did it either now now they say I put it up on my Instagram page and I saw some comments there and they're saying that the more brightly colored the older they are huh but I don't know I think I think the pilot mentioned 10,000 years old maybe I just guess unless you know I have no idea coach thank you I think you just threw that out there yeah how would you know I mean it's just something I'm sure somebody knows I mean right that studies that I'm sure there's probably a few people yeah it seems like when you think about the actual numbers of how much land you're talking about how few people live out there and how many of those things are probably there and also one of the things that Adam was telling me that's crazy is you could have the way they refer to themselves like Aborigines they call themselves a mob like you know instead of a tribe it's a blob yeah and they're like there could be one mob and he said there could be a mob he goes full kilometers away and they speak a totally different language all right yeah right yes I go how many languages are they was Oh hundreds yeah what yeah hundreds so they can't talk to each other he goes nope yeah no written language yeah they they have different expressions for things yeah yeah I heard that too that's crazy I know what it I mean it's really it's like a tribal society right that's yeah that's just the way it goes well it is like a tribal society but it's also like your I mean right now there's culture and there's civilization that is linked to who knows how many hundreds if not thousands years ago and it will go away because there won't be people that understand it it's not no not someone who's studying it yeah and there's so many different versions of the way they communicate that it's just like you're you literally watching history dissolve right in front of you yeah yeah and it's a it Sam it was amazing to be in that country walking and hunting in the same that that they have for you know however many years and what a date hunt back then because this is obviously before the Buffalo came in before they brought the fallow deer I don't know just whatever Wallabies are while the native thing kangaroos yeah yeah Wow yeah but it was it was cool being under that rock in envisioning them being there too yeah you know that long ago doing the same thing we were doing yeah that's that's uh that's a real mind blower man it's just so fascinating thinking about that that particular continent of Australia that no Europe used it as a prison colony in England brought a bunch of people over there and go look you people are assholes stay here that was on there's an island off of Australia right that they used for that well they used Australia for that I thought I god what was that Island I know you're probably an island as well that they still do I think that's what they tell immigrants right right yeah and they have to live there for a certain amount of time before they can come over yeah they have some weird immigration laws in Australia like of people that are complaining about Trump wanting to build a wall listen they got surveillance way worse and it's like a prison yeah I if I understand you're right it's like a prison and they have to stay there for you know like I said a certain amount of time before they're a citizen yeah see you find that Jimmy Josh Zepps actually brought it up to us and he was explaining how brutal the immigration laws are over there they don't want anybody move in Australia they understand I have a good thing going on yeah I mean if you haven't been in Australia it is lovely people there are fantastic they're super friendly they're really nice and again there's not that many of them so it's expensive though yeah very you know I mean there's a Eamon he I think his house was like a two-bedroom house and four or five hundred thousand dollars Wow yeah yeah makes sense though you gotta bring shit over there right yeah like they were saying the gaya when I was in Sydney the guy who was driving us I was telling us how much cars cost over there they cost so much more money yeah especially people like classic American muscle cars and I was talking about how much like a 1968 Mustang was worth yeah and he's like it's probably worth twice what it's worth and I merrily yeah because they have to ship them over there what they have over there which is sweet was a Toyota Hilux diesel trucks those are pretty sweet what is it it's just a toy Tundra is it like a ton it's like it they call it a you that's a pickup Oh like a utility vehicle I don't know yeah I don't know I'm just trying to use learn the lingo but a ute is a pickup and is a Toyota Hilux diesel and is this what Adam was driving around in no I can't run what his is there it is right there huh yeah that's a okay so it's like a flatbed yeah hmm I'm not sure what that maybe Adam has that I can't remember now one of the things I thought was weird when I was there is how many people have snorkels on their truck yeah yeah that one right there yeah that's driving through water well it's not just water it's also dust oh really Wayne to me though chokes up your air filters they have those things way up high so that it when the engines getting the air like apparently it mitigates a lot of the dust because a lot of the dust is like headlight high yeah when you're driving and that gets you a little bit more clear air okay well that's out of my wheelhouse I know bow hunt down and well you know the name of it no I just notice cuz they're cool well whenever you go to like Africa whenever you go someplace that's fuckin brutal you see a lot of Toyotas yeah Toyota's no ha no they know how to make car that laughs they do they do but they're not I mean here it's just like you know Ford Chevy you know I don't know cuz we like American stuff I guess oh yeah but still you still see a lot of like old Land Cruisers yeah I mean how many FJ dollars there see there in where we were on in the outback driving around everybody has those yeah every person has a truck set up like that well the gun I guess you have to yeah if you realize after time like this is the only thing that makes it yeah because Adam was saying when he drives from Sydney to Darwin you know we took a four and a half hour plane fly but it is three days so you have to get your rig has to be bulletproof yeah yeah basically yeah they have an expression you could take a Range Rover into the bush but you need a Land Rover to get out of the bush is that right yeah okay yeah they just those Toyotas it's just it's kind of crazy how well they last and when you really think about like for the longest time America did a real shit job of making cars at last it was a period in American cars from like the 1970s till I think till probably like the late 90s a 2000 he finally got it right now we make very dependable cars as well but for the longest time we were making dog shit well I don't know about all that but I do know we're gonna go up and do that huh me you and Adam and we're gonna do a Netflix special they don't Netflix and Netflix doesn't know this yet what why why Netflix would would national oh good that's good move it's a good move only something on the Internet yeah I wanted to be like an hour-long documentary style hunting film giving back you know killing Buffalo taking the meat back to the community doesn't natives yeah yeah a bridge yeah that's what I envisioned that sounds like a great idea um it could be certain it could be done on Netflix or it could be done and you just put it online yeah that that could be just as I mean Netflix is awesome for sure but there's some people that don't have Netflix everybody has an online connection yeah my my goal is to sort of use you because people because I wanna I want it I want hunting to be shown in the light that I know it to be which is hard work respect for the country and the animals and giving back so with you involved more people care about it right and we want to have you involved because we like hanging out with you and like well I was explaining this to Adam too when we did my podcast up there in the bush it's like ever since I've hunted way back when Roy moved to Alaska and I was left hunting wilderness on my own I loved it so much I kept wanting to find somebody who would love it as much as I so I could say look how awesome this is isn't this awesome and I kept taking people there and trying to convince him how awesome it was it wasn't awesome for him so it was like but you want to share something that impacts you so much with other people who appreciate it so that's why that's what that's what I was saying when Adam I were talking is that you know you love bow hunting and so that's when you are so interested and invested in something have such a passion for something there's nothing better when someone somebody else shares that passion right yeah so that that was that was why there's a few different reasons why you could be involved thank you I'm excited about that but I also think the difficulty factor is what turns people off I don't think they exactly to be so difficult no no you try to introduce bow hunting to people first of all just shooting a bow people think oh let's you pull the string back you point at the spot you let it go good luck with all that it takes fucking years yeah takes years to get confident with well and I remember when you first started showing me how to shoot when first shot in my backyard and I immediately recognized I think like after first of all you had a 90 pound bow which I definitely shouldn't have been pulling back my shoulder was fucking killing me after the first ah like this takes you got a build up to this goddamn yeah but then I remember thinking like to be accurate with this I just went down a rabbit hole yeah oh my god just took my first step down a crazy rabbit hole and who knows where it leads because this is not easy no and I'm I have a very addictive personality yeah and I need to figure out ways to channel that addiction in positive ways because I can get lost doing things that are not good so bow hunting and archery itself to me it seemed like okay this is a discipline it's a worthy pursuit it's fascinating and I'm very very interested in it yeah but for a lot of people I think it's very daunting like oh I don't think they realize it people think of hunting as like Elmer Fudd like you know you go out there or they see some hunting scene in a movie where there's a bunch of rednecks and they're fat and they're sitting in a tree stand or something like that and they think it's easy they think it's a bunch of people that are just killing animals and they don't care and then when you actually go out and do it especially we go do it with a person like you you understand what this thing really is and what it really is is this incredibly difficult pursuit that takes immense amounts of hard work and dedication and you got to be in fucking shape for it yeah and this is something that people are starting to realize now right oh and I think you're a big part of this and over the last few years and all the platforms that you've gone on to tell your story as if people understand that big-game hunting in the West and the western style hunting elk and mule deer the type of stuff that you love to do is very very difficult it is a combination of athletics of extreme endurance of hiking outdoorsmen ship survival skills and then the knowledge of hunting and then you have to be a good shot on top of all that you have to know archery yeah then you have to be able to keep you know with that adrenaline hits yeah all of a sudden and that's what's hard is people have invested so much into it they've been thinking about the the moment the crunch time for so long that when it happens it's too much yeah so it's really hard when you've been thinking about something for years potentially or at least all year you know that oh here's my chance here's my chance and then you get it and you're not ready yeah because it's just too much - it's so hard to stay calm well it's also something that you need to do a bunch of times until you understand it yeah it's like I try to explain to people about we were talking about fighting earlier we're talking about when Pete if someone has never fought before and never competed before the the scary thing is not really the what's nerve-racking is not the actual fighting itself yeah once the fighting starts you're actually kind of like just in the zone and you're just doing it I mean you might be intimidated especially you're fighting a guy like Mike Tyson or Anderson so or something like that you're gonna be shitting your pants yeah but the real terrifying stuff is the build-up the lead-up and that's kind of the same thing with hunting it's the moment before the shot yeah it's your adrenaline is pumping it's like if you had a shoot an eight ball across the table long shot and your life was on the line it's almost like that and you don't get any warm-up shots yeah it's no warm-up shots just all of a sudden here's is one shot all the marbles and you gotta stay calm oh and the animal might be moving yeah my god well fuck no it's I was saying that on this last hunt it was you know we had me Adam and Remmy Warren and supposedly we're supposed to be pretty good huh the best of the best and we were struggling to get something killed and I was just like imagine how frustrating this would be for somebody a new hunter I mean yeah it's no wonder people try to bow hunt and then just be like are you kidding me this is impossible and it's but it's it's that challenge anyway it's that whole journey which is why I want to do that special yeah and I wanted I want to share all that's positive about hunting it to as many people's you know and we are reaching new people these days you know I mean hunting it's it's in the crosshairs and some aspects I guess but we're also other people are getting because I get I mean III went to an archery shop up there Benson's archery in Sydney and we just had a few hours know to say hey Adam Adam I are going to stop by swing by and quite a few people came I mean it was it was surprising how many people showed up but a lot of them were vegetarians you know six months ago listen to your show a lot of people told me oh I found out about you from Joe Rogan or I didn't hunt alright I didn't even eat meat and all these different stories all these different from all these different areas so we are reaching new people you know I want to make sure our message the one of respect and reverence and an appreciation for everything out there and for survival and for just you know outside of the life outside of the city I want that shown in a way that I know we would you know that's why I'm selfishly want this to be a big thing just because I'm sick of hunting you know the Elmer Fudd thing you know I see I was watching a movie the other day and they showed a hunter and is like the girl was on there and she was what was that there's three girls that were kidnapped and one of them and hunted as a younger girl and so she was like do you know what movie that is anyway so she was had the upper hand she was tougher and she was more prepared because she had been a hunter and I'm like oh that's cool but then they show her as a little girl hunting and her perverted uncle had molested her not hunting drinking beer oh god maybe split split yeah that sort of was so the hunter in there was sort of child molester I'm like why it's the most misunderstood and misrepresented discipline I think that we have here in America it's it's so confusing to people because when we think of food we think of restaurants and we think a supermarket yeah we don't think of wild animals and the connection that people feel like they don't have with their food is one thing that comes up all the time lately so people are constantly looking for these farm-to-table places yeah I guess a farm-to-table place out here called a peddlers fork it's a really good place they have great eggs like you get the eggs they're like real dark yolk yeah yeah the food is all grass-fed beef or from a farm that they have a connection to and they buy the meat from the farm and there's a lot of that these farm-to-table places where they these restaurants have a great relationship with the people that actually grow the food so everything's organic they know where it comes from yeah and people are super connected to that they love the idea that because factory farming is kind of freaking people out yeah and for the longest time it was happening without us knowing you know I think during the 80s and the 90s it was all going on and no one no one understood yeah so now people are becoming more aware because of the internet because of information and they're becoming more aware of where their food comes from and you're also seeing a higher number of people that their response to this factory farming thing is well hey I'll go vegetarian or hey I'll go vegan and before I hunted with Rinella that was my thought I was like I don't want to participate in factory farming yeah so what am I gonna do I'm gonna do one of two things I'm either go hunting I'm gonna hunt for my own food cuz I knew there's something wrong yeah like it's too easy to just get a steak I would always like pick up a steak and I go this isn't be an animal yeah Here I am at a supermarket now it's a Styrofoam container wrapped in saran wrap like this is fucking weird yeah it's weird you could just do this so my thought was if I shoot an animal and I hate it like I didn't know how I was gonna feel I never shot fished yeah all my life yeah I never but when I shot that deer I was like oh I get it I get it yeah I mean it was an extreme amount of respect it's on video I mean you can see it on mediator yeah anybody wants to watch it you could watch it online the first time I ever shot a deer it was intense yeah you know and and then cutting it up and eating it that night I was like this makes sense yeah this is a and then when you actually find out that you know these animals the money that come from hunting tags and even from buying hunting gear there's a percentage of money that goes towards concert nation and this is all very carefully thought out by people like you yeah and by these people that really respect and care for these animals yeah and you get deeper and deeper into this and you understand what it really is and then you see this whole community of these people like yourself and Remy Warren these hardcore hunters that are also like deeply connected to the land and conservation and deeply appreciate these animals and this is how they get all their meat yeah this is how they live and like that was extremely appealing to me yeah it's a I think Steve Rinella has done a great job making getting that message out and in a in a perfect way really I mean he's a great spokesman and in his show I used to watch his show before meteor now I can't remember what it was well within is that what it was yeah yeah okay and I remember he had just something about and then I'm like okay this is different I liked I was a hunter you know I've been 100 myself my whole life but his his portrayal was different than what we'd seen before and so you know maybe the mean and some of the other people you've mentioned an atom have just carried that on and tried to do a good job of educating people who don't know any better and I just you know it's like I wish everybody could be out there I mean that last day we were up in the mountains there after I had killed my dear and we had a back strap so we're picking up camp getting everything away but I had I had a awesome fallow deer back strap which is like the prime for people don't as a prime cut and I cut it all I cleaned it all off every piece of anything that was on at hair if there's any tree bark anything that was on there was just a perfect clean piece of meat I sliced it all up we got a green stick to put it on skewered it on a green wood so if it's dry wood that was just going to burn and so you know you can't cook on that so it's got to be green and we put it over the fire there and it was we seasoned it it was oh good it was probably some of the best meat I've ever eaten standing around the campfire just pulling that off that that stick that we had cooked it over the open flame was I wish everybody could know what that was like to know that that deer just previous to that was alive in the woods we harvested them which is aka killed him and then ate him and that's that circle of life or whatever you want to call it or just that moment that's I wish everyone could experience it because I just think they'd have a different take on on hunting and hunters and being self-sustaining it's very different meat is very different when you've killed it yourself it's impossible to describe without experiencing it I mean I could try give it my best shot but I'll fall short but I remember eating that meat that we ate when I was in Montana with Rinella the first hunt and it was so delicious we're cooking it over a campfire and Steve it brought this little grill not not a grill like a great you know that would set down over the fire we had sludge at the end and it's like like if you buy a steak and you cook it it's great taste good or call this a good steak this is nice but there's no connection there no none when you're eating an animal that you killed yourself and it's difficult to do and you you were hard hunting for many many days for you have that deer yeah so there's this intense respect and connection that I think we all I mean we harp on about it so many times that people listen to these podcasts here Jesus Christ you guys stop talking about how awesome hunting is yeah it's because it's impacted both of us in a very very positive way in a very there's a primal genetic sort of ancestral thing that's happening when you hunt yeah there's there's a there's some lights that go off that you didn't even know were there like oh you know there's a switch over there yeah and like oh this is a part of my brain that's lit up but it was never lit up before yeah and it's not it's not what everybody thinks that the negative aspects it's not a barbaric thing it's not a cruelty thing it's a very respectful thing yeah and I understand the people that have bad feelings about it I understand the people that look at it like animal cruelty like you don't have to do that you can get food other ways you can eat beans and you don't need to do this yeah I understand how they're thinking but my thought process is very different my process is what you're doing what I'm doing what all these people to do that hunt is you're entering into the wild and your for us a small window a week or whatever it is you're becoming a part of this crazy cycle of nature yeah you're taking something out of that and leaving something as well you're spending a ton of money that money whether it's the money for the Outfitters the money for the tags the money for the gear all that stuff percentage of that goes to make sure that the habitat is maintained make sure that the animal population is maintained make sure that Department of Fish and Game is well staffed with biologists with people that are monitoring these animals because guess what if that doesn't get done it's it's these animals are not going to be there anymore right they're not going to be taken care of and North America has the best wildlife management program or management system of anywhere and that's why almost all the species that we have here there's more now than there almost ever has been in even with shrinking habitat because we're in crouching on on where they live but we're still the number still flourished because we're not hunters aren't just oh let's go kill wipe them all out I mean we're it's managed it's efficient game as manners are funded by hunters and what we pay that with with the tags and license and so it's there's a system to it well but at the end of the day like they're in Australia we were getting up in the morning out of the sleeping bag grabbing our bow and taking off we're hunters that's it and that that feels man it feels like I said I wish people could know what it feels like because I see people comment on my social media and they say this is in the 19th century anymore you don't have to be a Neanderthal or whatever but it's just we we are hunters yeah well most of those people have cheeseburgers on their Instagram pages he's fucking hilarious there's so much of that oh just one chick she posted something mean when I post a picture of some elk that I was cooking yeah and I said hey honey I go you got I like to call girls honey because it makes him feel like I'm a sexist you got a you got a fucking BLT on your page sweetie and she's like well that was just from four months of go before I was enlightened like oh you came in late it's always the most adamant vegans like just became one yeah I'm most proselytizing ruthlessly aggressive once I understand where they're coming from and I think that's very important for to get our message across is that like if we're not animal haters this is not this in it's it's hard for people to understand that someone could love animals and love the idea of animals and love wildlife but still eat them yeah you know I always I climbed up in this tree there I found this place where the deer were coming into this field and like I said this area had been hunted but I'd figured nobody had ever hunted out of a tree there you know not like a whitetail back here you know in the in the East or in the South that get tree 700 all the time so I'm like well I think I can get up in this tree these deer coming out in this area I probably have a pretty good chance so I was up there in the tree and these does and fawns were out in the field and they were running around chasing each other playing I mean it was just like speeding all around in circles and bumping into each other and it was cool to see and then this a doe and a spike a young buck came out right under my tree the spike was 24 25 yards away basically a chip shot with a bow especially had no idea I was there and there's a thought that we were getting low on meat in camp and I hadn't killed a deer so I you know I had said before I'm like I'm killing any buck that comes out I'm taking him and then I was watching him up there and I'm just like I just you know for me uh it's got to be the right animals not just like I'm not some bloodthirsty you know I still watched the deer I still appreciate their beauty and that you know they're frolicking about or whatever you want to call it and it still enjoyed that this this young buck was down and I had said I was going to get me for camp but I'm not some bloodthirsty guy so I just we'll know I'm just gonna watch him and you know enjoy it and he was there and then the Buckeye ended up killing stepped out and you know an old buck he was you could see his hip bones because he was so rundown from the ride and he was getting older I could tell he was an older mature deer and that's that's what I want to take I want to take an animal past its prime that has done his job for spread his genes for the health of the herd and was that's the animals we want to take out and so he was he was just a rundown old buck that's why I took yeah people they that's the problem is that people associate someone who wants to take an older big mature animal with trophy hunting like oh you just want the antlers you just want a big but they don't understand that that is actually the animal that you should take yeah and he's still yeah he's still great me yeah you know sure yeah but I mean it that that's just you know for the health of the herd that's the one you want right you know if you're doing it right well you know young ones then we'll get a chance to fill his spot right and that would be the natural position if there was an this is the natural position if there's predators the natural position is the really young ones like the fawns get taken out and then the really old ones start getting worn down they get taken out and then everything in the middle gets to breed yeah and then this guy who's eight years old or whatever he is he's had plenty of opportunity to shed spread his genetics and so his his offspring will be everywhere and they'll get a chance now and the thing is nobody makes it out nobody makes a hot life they're all dying everybody we're all dying yeah so I mean justice so if I wouldn't killed that buck it doesn't mean he's gonna live forever I mean he's gonna die yeah one way or another it's not gonna become a fairy the fact that he died I shot him and he was dead within seconds is guaranteed and people are always talk shit about this is the very best way he could go yeah you don't want starving to death yeah or you know dying because his teeth don't work anymore I literally can't eat food you know this move I've seen animals where you you look at their teeth and there are almost none left yeah you get a like a really lit buck this Bucks teeth were flat in the back so he's yeah you can't they got a gum it they can't go enough yeah right on it down so it's a you know in Adam also found two bucks that had fought and got stuck they were fighting an offense was in between them just a cattle fence they got stuck in the fence died yeah so it's just that their life is I mean how many guys out here in the street you know fight and kill each other and get stuck together it doesn't hat starve you know it's life in the wild is I mean unless you're out there and you witness things like that you just live in it's it's not real I think the real problem is perspective you know I mean I think unless you're there unless you're experiencing the wilderness itself like I've talked about my experience on Prince of Wales Island that you know Bryan Callen and Rinella and I we were up there for Sagan I think we camped there for six days and you you're-you're your idea of what like life is it's only based on what your perception is like what you're seeing on a daily basis well he seeing Ventura Boulevard you're seeing billboards and you know new movies coming out and Keeping Up with the Kardashians there's a new season look at that new Audi well that's a sweet looking car hey I got the new iPhone alright and this is life and then you're out there and you go oh this is life - total quiet yeah like this no cell phone service rain animals yeah and then if you die no one's gonna know no you fall and break your neck and die right there something will eat you no one will find you they're nuts that's normal you're trying to stay warm you're trying to get food and there's more stuff like that yeah on this planet more spots like that on this planet then spots like Los Angeles yeah it's a it's weird yeah I don't know it's just it's but that connection I don't know I guess there's no there's no way to see it in front of your computer know it but I wanna if we can film it right and share a right I think people will get it they're getting it a little now get it more than what didn't right right now so I mean that's my goal with you know what we've been talking about and I mean we talked about the difficulty I didn't remember I wanted to mention this um that hunt the hell was I mean I've been on a lot of hunts in a lot of places over the years and I hadn't struggled like I had on this hat it it was so difficult I was telling the guys back there I said um I'm questioning my life right now what what what am I doing with my life it's just because I'm like it's not going to happen you know I'm not going to get it done and the animals don't care about my goals that they don't care about that oh we're socially making this great film and portray hunting right there like now we're not it has nothing to there to stay alive that was it so just like Oh everything that I felt like I wanted to do or achieve or my it was just like it's not going to happen and it felt like God have I lost it you know I mean I was it was looks like this is hard yeah but when it works and you do it right and that shot happens then it's just like okay and I don't know it's just that that doing something so difficult and being successful and I've said this before has made me who I am you know I mean without without a challenge like that I don't know I don't know where I'd be right now so it's a I don't know at some that sometimes you cuss it and then man you're just so appreciative of the journey those difficult moments are with the only thing that makes success worthwhile success was easy if you woke up in the morning first day yawn have a cup of coffee Step five steps there's the biggest deer that's ever lived shoot one right through part you wouldn't even feel it it wasn't it wouldn't be like no and I don't think people understand how difficult it is to because they watched these TV shows have you ever watched a hunting show there are half an hour long so you're watching 22 minutes without commercials right yeah in 22 minutes you know they usually build up for the first you know 15 minutes well you know we came close to him but we could not get a shot and finally get a shot what you don't see is that these it takes days and days and days of 1012 hours higher up down mountains up and down and up and down and when I met you the reason why I got in contact with you and the reason why I met you is because I was so confused as to why someone would need to run ultra marathons in order to get ready for hunting yeah I was like what the fuck is this guy doing like why is he lifting weights and do all this shit from I didn't get it yeah I was like this I was just getting into it and I was trying to figure out like I was I would start to watch things on television I was starting to read certain articles and read certain books and I was like well what is this whole Fitness connection I'm hunting like why do they need to be in shape I'm like I'm in pretty good shape like what's the big deal well I went with Rinella and when I went with Rennell one of the things I realized boy I got pretty winded going up these fucking hills like hiking hiking tires you out especially high altitude and then I see your your videos online I was like what fuck is this guy into and then as I go deeper and deeper into it I realize like oh this is like an extreme pursuit this is not just like something just go out and do this is something that's really hard to do and a lot of people there I've read this one article but this one guy who is unsuccessful 12 years in a row elk hunting yeah boy we finally shot an elk yeah like 12 years like how many times this guy go out how many days did he camp in the forest yeah how many days you try to stalk and get winded or snap on a twig at the last minute or you know the elk season and bolts that most people are unsuccessful yeah I mean 9 out of 10 every year unsuccessful I think it's more than that ok hunting with archery it is about it's about 10 percent cease at 10 percent yeah so 9 out of 10 are unsuccessful so people who don't hunt who see you know dead stuff all the time they think oh you just go out and kill an atom right No right most ninety percent don't it is really hard and it's just like until you're out there you got the bow in your hand and you're trying to close in on that animal and you're trying to do everything right from A to Z with and there's so many variables during that whole path it's just like it's even impossible sometimes you know even even for me after 30 years and this is a very strange can action that you get with nature and forget about even the fact that you're pursuing these animals to hunt them and eat them but there's a very strange connection that you get when you're out there and that total quiet woods where they live you're in their world and you lock eyes with them and you meet them and you see them and you're in this place with no cell phone reception with no people anywhere near you from miles and miles yeah it's a totally different feeling life shows you another aspect of itself that you didn't know existed yeah yeah and it's out there every day yeah but we're just you know living in our bure muted hey we're very limited there's something about cities and this existence I mean don't get me wrong I like it I like a lot of it I like the fact you can go to a restaurant I like going to the movies I like the fact that if you know if your phone breaks you go to the fucking mall and get a new cell phone all that stuff's wonderful not not bad but the other stuff is fantastic - and we're disconnected a giant percentage of our population lives in these urban environments that have a complete and total disconnect from the actual life on Earth yeah like life on Earth is not just urban environments and life on Earth has this broad spectrum of different ways it manifests itself and to experience all these different ones to be in Alberta and see black bears in the wild to be you know in Colorado and see mule deer and being the woods and the mountains and to be around these different animals it's a different it's a different understanding of the actual existence that living things have here on earth that living things that share the air you breathe and the water you drink and the earth itself that was that that was the best part of that trip because we would split up Adam would go one way I would go another way in the morning I'd have Mark Womack with me he'd have Jameson was his camera man's name would go with him and the best part was at the end of the day hearing what everybody saw not but not what if you killed something because we didn't carry were there a long time it didn't kill very much but just what everybody saw you know from the Bucks being locked up that we're dead ed - one morning we were up and heard something a commotion up ahead of us and marks mark says it's a buck rub and his hours and I listened for a sec I said no that's two bucks fighting so we took off up the hill and I got 25 yards away and these Bucks were just going at it just fighting pushing each other around and I couldn't get a clear shot didn't get up there in time to do that but that story and then Adam would say well he called in three fox you know he did a varmint column three Fox came running in or he saw this many wild boars or he was close to getting inside a giant fallow buck and however didn't work out and then I would share a story about what I saw you know about another brown snake or something like that and that was that was so fun just getting together over the campfire not talking about what we killed but just what we saw on experience yeah you know and it's you know I was flew home last night and just got in this morning to LA and I'm looking around the airport I was thinking about all the people I wonder how many actually would get me you know because I feel like an outsider a little bit especially coming back from a hunt and I'm just looking at everybody thinking I don't get them they probably don't get me but you at least understand what they're doing I think you know I mean when I was checking my luggage in it I was flew virgin coming back from Sydney to LA and you know the lady that are the check in she's like what's in that case I said I was a bow a weapon I go could be yeah yeah it's a bow and arrow what were you doing I said hunting she's and she goes we'll rhihub don't tell me don't tell me she didn't want to hear it it sound like I have leather shoes on I was like I was hunting Buffalo she's like there's Buffalo here I said well not here but yeah there's there's a lot of Buffalo in Australia and uh she's like well I don't think you can fly with the bow and arrow I'm like I don't think it looked in though yeah you can I said it's just like I said it's not even a firearm weapon type thing it's just you just check it in just normal but anyway I I was thinking as like home man that's how old was this lady oh she wasn't old she's much younger than me probably I mean I don't think you can fly with her bone yeah why was she telling you that I don't know she never looked into that I said I go well I ended up you didn't have to do anything she said you're gonna have to sign all this stuff because they're not allowed and I'm just like I said listen I fly with this all over the world is elite he worked there yeah illusion no no oh that's hilarious so she said there were way more strict which maybe they are virgins Moisture no sir she said she could I said why just flew Qantas to Darwin and back and nobody said a word I said it I've she was have you ever been in Australia before with it I said yeah I said I've listed I've been everywhere it's never an issue trust me I'm not trying to believe I mean just trust me so anyway but yeah it's just it's just there's times when I'm just like God am i the outsider or or what I don't know but you know it's like we were talking before this when we were on the way over here about a show that wanted me to come on talk about guns but there's going to be like a large audience and there's going to be a bunch of people on the panel and you talk for seven minutes and you go to commercial break and I'm like I'm not interested yeah I'm not interested in doing that because I think that it's a long conversation that you have to have with someone it takes a while for you to understand their point of view it takes a while for them to understand your point of view it takes a while to establish the fact that you're a very reasonable person and this is a very nuanced conversation much like when that guy in France ran over a bunch of people with his truck I don't think the truck should be outlawed I think the real issue is human beings that are capable of doing horrible shit crazy people right why are they capable of doing that let's get to the bottom of that and let's stop ignoring all the factors and just concentrating only on the weapon right that kind of conversation is a long conversation that takes hours and hours and you still might not get to the bottom of it right that's how I feel about like you talking to someone about hunting yeah like if you came over it's almost like I don't want to tell them like if someone says like that you have about like what's in the case I got to bow and arrow what do you do I practice archery yeah it's easier that way I like to shoot at targets oh yeah target shooting oh that's cool that's in the Olympics yep see no one picks yeah except my targets they move and they have antlers yeah I know well they can't tell them that it's I know I think I'm just like takes too long yeah it does but I don't know I think I'm I just don't like hiding Who I am basically so I'm always I just say hey just what I do so yeah she's like don't tell me I'm like I was hunting Buffalo I'm telling you I don't care there's a species no they live there you're gonna hear you're gonna hear what I was doing whether you like it or not nobody wants to hear it well it's kind of like with my with my social media I like putting up stuff that so I can weed the people out right you know I clean holding the Buffalo head in the water I'm like okay this is gonna weed out so the people who I really don't want here anyway right they're gonna get mad at you for sure but they would get mad anyway yeah and there's a lot of people that listen to these conversations and they get a perspective that they would have never had like there's a lot of people right now that are listening that are in their car that are on their you know on the bus or whatever and they got the headphones on and they're thinking about this in a way that they never thought about it before because in their mind that because of the fact they live in these urban environments and they've never been exposed to hunting and they get all their meat from a store or from a supermarket or from a restaurant they'd just never heard anybody talk about it yeah and this is a it's a weird part of our life it's a it's a dangerous disconnect I think with life and death the dangerous disconnect of restaurants and supermarkets well here's here's one thing I think people just get tuned in to what they're interested in and that's it I mean even Instagram does it so on the explore page or whatever that is what comes up is what you look at yeah so what kinds of on my page is like hunting and fitness you know that's so it's all that so whatever you're looking at whether it's gay guys or or cooking that's what's good that's what that's your world so sort of well our world is now is we only were only exposed to really what we want to be exposed to you know and that's why I'm like no I'm hunting Buffalo I love that lady to be exposed to something different right right right so I don't know I just um it's comfortably know what my point is well it's it's what you're saying makes a whole lot of sense is that people do they find these communities with like-minded people and becomes an echo chamber yeah yeah in the direction to the choir yeah that goes all the way back to like a million hours ago it feels like since we've been talking about why that Netflix thing is so appealing to me and having you involved it's just because we've reached so many new people and hunting is so it's so important to me and I think I mean just the just that people can understand what motivates us and why it's important I just want that just want that shown right you shared right but there's definitely a way to do it and I don't know where we should go I mean whether it's the Buffalo place or somewhere else but I think it's a great idea to do know Stephen Ellis show net eyes on Netflix yeah yeah and it has one star guys yeah people are so angry they find it and they shouldn't have to eat me yeah everything you want from celery yeah people get a they get super super agro you know you want to make people really angry tell them tell them that there's a growing body of science it shows that plants are intelligent yeah yeah Glantz thing they feel that they scream and all that fucking freaked out like babies oh you don't even have to say that this justifies eating meat just put that no when I put that on Twitter just the the data yeah that and people will fucking go crazy and attack me for hunting yeah or if you talk about all the animals that die when they're when their salads being made you know I mean so you know it is it's different whatever level they put they prioritize or put different importance on you know that we've talked about that too they feel like they're doing a good thing and they also in in many ways look if you're if you're shoeing factory farming you're avoiding factory farming and eating more salads and eating of you know farm-to-table vegetables instead you are definitely contributing to less death and suffering a hundred percent yeah but you're contributing to some yeah I just are if you want grain if you eat grain you're contributing to first of all what do you care about do you care about insects like where do you draw the line yeah if you don't care about insects well then what you're okay but if you do if you think that insects are life well there's pesticides they're fucking there it's a Holocaust every day out there fucking bugs yeah the spraying those goddamn things constantly and if you if you want to have a healthy crops there's a reason why they have these pesticides yeah that's because they want to kill these animals that are trying to eat the crops kill these little bugs well and I don't know I just keep going back to this recent trip just because I think about it it's just like here's another example so those the brown snakes up there are second most deadly and we saw a number of brown snakes in the road while we were driving Adam swerves around them you know try to not kill him not kill him he wants him to stay alive well yeah big spider he had crawling on his face I saw that thing why do you let that thing grow on his face I don't know he's he's Australian this is different buddy to human but not killing it was that on his Instagram uh it was yeah it is somewhere see Adam dot Green Tree dot bow hunting now he changed it to just Adam green tree Adam doc green tree why I don't know the bow hunting plan I think it's too big Museum yeah maybe I don't think he's worried about that at all I don't know you people poor that guy seems immune to to hate yeah it's a um he's a great guy he's uh but he is sensitive too I mean he's is not that's what I'm saying it's not like were just quote cold-blooded killers right you know what I mean there's one time we we didn't have an argument but I I didn't believe him about something and he was so upset he's like all right he was I'm brutally honest you know he's like mad that I didn't believe him so it's not it's like he a warm-hearted person he's not just a not running over snakes robot no no no and so people think that we're just sees these cold-blooded killers out there barbaric or whatever no no I feel like and I don't want to judge people who are but I feel like we are just we understand the circle of life better yeah I don't know well you definitely more accustomed to being around it yeah definitely expose to more yeah yeah you know I think like I said I I have friends that are vegans I know a lot of vegans and people think that for some reason I hate vegans I mock a lot of things I make fun of things that are that are targets and a lot of like the proselytizing nature of vegans in that the angry self-righteous moral high-ground stance that they take it's easy to mock it's right there yes it's easy and I think I think most of the people that do it they do it for good reasons most of that you know trying the lifestyle and eating that way yeah but there's also health problems with it you know and then people don't like you saying that either I know a lot of people that have tried it and they give up after a while because a lot of my friend Sophie from the Comedy Store she just started eating eggs again yeah for the longest time she was just trying to just go straight vegan she kept getting her blood work back and it wasn't healthy or actually she wasn't she was in the blood work Sam Harris was the blood worker he went vegan for a while but his blood work was all fucked up so he started eating fish and eggs and yeah it's like there's people that but different bodies are more adaptable to different kinds of diets and some people just don't do well on a raw plant-based diet and maybe they're not as disciplined to some folks maybe they're not doing it right yeah I don't know yeah it's hard to say but everybody's everybody's different but I don't think there's anything wrong with going out and killing animals and eating them and I think that's where we differ from a lot of people that think that you should not be allowed to do that you should not be allowed because it's barbaric I don't think it's barbaric I think it's spiritual and that's what what freaks people out they get very angry if you say that but they but they wouldn't get angry if you talked about Native Americans doing it it's very interesting and the thing is is like the big difference is I don't care if they don't eat meat I don't judge them for not eating meat but they judge us for killing you know what I mean so it's pretty one-sided as far as they won't accept being a hunter and being self-sufficient well at any hunter I know isn't going on vegan pages and talking shit you know I mean I mean so it's it's just weird how they're so hateful and so one side you know up on our soapbox you know and I don't feel like we we do that I mean I know some people do it I know there's gonna be people that say they're gonna say well first of all they can say how many times am I going to be on here as many times as he can come what's the other podcast folks what's the record of the most people on here yeah for they get most number I don't know repeat guests somebody probably knows probably Joey Diaz calendar I push challenge yeah count all that all the fight companions everything ready bro yeah yeah oh that's true yeah and then they'll say more talk more boring hunting shit that's fine I know you don't have to listen folks a lot I do a lot of podcast I got one later today with Jordan Peterson I guarantee we're not gonna be talking about hunting let's who's that he's a professor at the University of Toronto he might hunt he might I don't think he doesn't uh uh he hunts liberals but he um one of the things is about what we're talking about earlier that we were saying that people sort of find their area and it becomes like an echo chamber yeah and I think that's one of the issues with with whether it's veganism or even hunting is that I think that people they need to be that have these dialogues with people that don't necessarily agree with that right so they can find out how the other person thinks yeah and you know if you do if you are talking to a person who's a hunter and you find out that they're actually just a cruel psychopath like fuck man I wouldn't want to hang out that guy yeah I mean I haven't experienced that but I know they must be out there yeah so probably if you were sitting across them house freaks and everything and everything yeah and you were having a conversation with someone like that I mean it would be it would be disturbing but I think that most people that are especially people like yourself or a guy like Remy Warren or Steve Rinella very well-spoken who is also an advocate for conservation loves wildlife if they sat down and had a long-form conversation like this with someone who's a reasonable person who's a vegan for all the right reasons is a vegan because they care about life and because they want to be cruelty-free and they want to live life with his little footprint as possible yeah I think they'd be surprised at how much common ground they find yeah I mean if you if if anybody spent a day in the woods with Remy or Adam they'd be shocked at how much not hunting they know just how much they know about the environment about about where they're hunting about different species about the animals and tendencies and in foliage and I mean those guys are amazing yeah and I think that almost like we're talking about like with the Aborigines we're kind of losing their culture we're losing out on an understanding of how these people live there's a little bit of that could be said about the culture of hunting is that yeah if it goes away and if it there was a trend about 10 maybe 15 20 years ago where from what I've read at least obviously I'm pretty new to it I only been hunting for five years but that they were considerably worried there they were really worried there was a real thought that the next few generations that hunting was going to dwindle down to such a such a low number that the hunters would not have the same sort of impact in in terms of politically where they could affect the retaining of public lands yeah and which is a huge issue with with Americans today and you're seeing it with this Trump administration where you're seeing the erosion of the Environmental Protection Agency and the erosion of the status that protected status that some national monuments have and perhaps public lands have people are super nervous and you had a conversation a long conversation with jason Chaffetz Chaffetz Cabot's Chaffetz Chaffetz yeah who had a very controversial bill that he had out that was pulled back it was a bill to sell off public land that was pulled back because of the activism of hunters and yet who care yeah it was a it was what they determine what they were gonna determine was disposable yeah three million acres yes opposable as well that was that was HR 621 and then there's HR 622 also so there's two of them kind of back-to-back different 622 just took away the law enforcement on public lands which in in turn they wanted to take it from the the federal government to give it to the state which people think that's just a way where the states can say well we can't afford it so we're gonna have to sell this public land exactly because it's a resource and and the states have to the states have to balance our budget every year federal government doesn't so if the state has to balance its budget and it's not pencil II now and they can sell X amount of acres and that's going to help they're going to do that as others to it so yeah that is there's also wildfire protection oh yeah yeah yeah I mean it's like a bunch of issue fighting wildfires is all it's a federal issue but if it's private land if the state sells it all that shit's gone yeah there's no more federal protection yeah and you look at I don't know it's uh that's a big one and so sportsmen really stepped up and that was through social media how they can now we have more of a voice than we've ever had you know before it was just these politicians making decisions and you know the little people didn't really have a say now we have a say I mean jason Chaffetz you think well why would he care he'd look at his Instagram page he might have you know I don't think he has 20,000 whereas we have pretty big numbers especially you so if you mentioned something about it he gets overwhelmed with hey are you looking out for us are you doing the right thing by us we won't vote you in next time and so then it makes those guys think holy shit did you see his town-hall meeting yeah I mean it's crazy it's all sportsmen and sportswomen showed up and helped people that care about public lands and they went crazy yeah that I don't that was uh kind of a guy was always be always had mixed emotions on that because the yelling and stuff doesn't it sends a very clear message it doesn't accomplish much as far as their but yes it sends a message for sure yeah it's danger and he's not going to be a politician anymore no I never sign and I don't know I'm not sure I haven't you know I see every once while he likes some of my stuff so it's like here's going into male prostitution that's what I heard is that true Jamie can you google that I just made that out I know Jason if you're listening I'm a comedian I'm sorry yeah don't so much he he seemed like just a super nice guy but it's a politician and I told him I say lysse was I go listen you're the first politician I've ever met and he's like oh you've lived a charmed life puzzled by representing Javits decision to quit Congress well I bet is that fuckin going on that Town Hall having almost people screaming up probably thinking what am i doing well he's you know like I said he seemed nice but maybe that politicians have to be personable that's how they get elected you know you ever watch house of cards no I could show she watch it yeah freak you the fuck out if I really liked I should be scared we'd all be scared so I'd liked I'd like to learn more I haven't I haven't asked him you know what's going on or whatever but yeah I mean I was I liked the fact that he at least took time out to talk about it you know instead of just I'm not sure why he did but I appreciated the fact that he did well it's he's an interesting guy because he saves money for the people by sleeping in his office he has a cot in his office that he sleeps in to save money on hotel rooms for the people so it's like yeah it's not like he's a total piece of shit no you know he I didn't get that feeling but Rinella has a very bad opinion of him yeah based on his record with defending public land right and Rinella thinks that he does not understand the significance of these decisions right these decisions are they are a step in the wrong direction that will snowball out of control and will eventually lead to privatization of public lands and the loss of the access to them by the American people that you know was all set aside by Teddy Roosevelt and all those people that had such great insight foresight back in the day yeah and that's you know that was the worry with he says well no I'm just taking a law enforcement away from these lands and get or not taking it away but giving it to the state and like I said with the whole budget saying so people were thinking that when they don't have enough money not just for the law enforcement but for enforcing illegal timber harvest right and dumping trash right and so when all that happens that that lessens the value of the land so when the value of the land is lessened then it's just like okay whatever this is a garbage dump anyway right so it makes it easier so they thought that was just a step in the transition of moving taking that away from public land and privatizing it so that's right now as opinion and maybe it was I don't know but he seemed like Jason seemed like a very nice guy when you were interviewing them we don't know enough about that particular issue but when you talk to God like brunella who is simply invested in a very well read on it he is of the opinion 100% that it's incredibly negative idea yeah HR 621 which is gone and 622 which he thinks is equally negative and he thinks it's essentially like a Trojan horse right nuts and I told him that's what I said too as I said you know sportsmen don't support 6:22 either the girls get mad when you call it sportsmen probably is there another word outdoors people Edwards people can say sports people like what lacrosse players I'm so sick of that are you it's cuz you're a man you're male priviledge is showing Oh bitch I thought was white privilege a - oh you gotta have it all American privilege white privilege cisgender privilege peanut butter jelly ratios yeah people chose racist I had actually a pleasure alone I didn't even know what that was about all I saw was your post and the head just like I did surprise me though people think the peanut butter jelly is racist this is how deep it gets because white people eat peanut butter and jelly whereas black people don't necessarily eat peanut butter and jelly so to have peanut butter and jelly as a food choice in school for kids is racist because other ethnic groups don't necessarily eat peanut butter and jelly what in the fuck well first of all who doesn't like peanut butter and jelly uh some communists I think maybe Chinese folks from Lester's yeah hunters probably don't yeah that guy from that movie that molest girl um yeah who North Koreans maybe maybe the most evil ones maybe they don't like Peter Byrne John probably is ridiculous that's delicious any choice people are just working too hard to be offended that's you're exactly 100% correct right there people are working too hard to be offended yeah yeah there's a there's a lot of folks out there that just looking for something to get to ticked off at it's so it's too easy it's too easy to get by you know and I think that's also something that happens when life is too fucking easy yeah there's not enough struggle you're talking about kids and about putting your kids through difficult things so they understand accomplishing goals and they understand how things aren't easy you have to struggle through stuff and how it's hard today because you know you're doing well I'm doing well our kids are fine yeah they don't have to worry about where foods coming from it's gonna be there you open the fridge there's the food yeah so you have to figure out like okay how do you get this kid to understand and appreciate the value of a difficult task overcoming that difficult task and feeling that good feeling that you have of building character and of and knowing yeah I can push through something like you had to do during that tough hunt very difficult questioning yourself then finally success ah and then you had a good feeling good feeling of success and of accomplishment and of realizing that you will fight those demons in your mind and that you will stay the course and keep hammering as it were yeah get through on the other end with success yeah you've done it before and even though you've been doing it for fucking decades those questions still come to your mind that's what's in that for me personally that's why I work as hard as I do just because you get wake-up calls like that and you're just like okay I got to be on my a-game well it's one of the reasons why I like doing really difficult things which leads me to what you've got me into is running yeah I've been fucking running lately I run all the time now I run fucking hills it's crazy I run hills I put a backpack on with a weight plate on I fucking walk hills I'm like what am i doing how often are you running several days a week really yeah depending on whether or not I'm home like then route that we did yeah okay I do that route and I also do that steep hill near my house yeah I do that there's a couple different routes that I go how is it I mean is it easier than easier but it still sucks a fat dick that's what's about to say that's like that's running hey that could be a shirt running sucks a fat dick but I love it looks is it's it's it's definitely slightly easier yeah but though you remember that fucking steep steep hill once you get to the bottom yeah and then you go back up as awesome that's it is awesome but it is always hard yeah no it's never easy yeah when I'm getting to the top of that thing but I can make it all the way up to the top now stop really yeah I can make oh that's good yeah that's awesome it's fucking brutal yeah I made sure that I could get there fuck it's hard and but you you did mention that it has helped your cardio and I like dude well that's one thing that I noticed like I didn't I didn't a kick box for a couple of weeks because I've been too busy doing other stuff and I wanted to keep with the running because I was getting some accomplishment I was getting some progress out of it I was seeing progress and then I started going back and some of my other workouts it didn't affect my weight lifting all my cut up kettlebell workouts at all yeah man kickboxing it really affected it yeah it affected it a real positive way because I'm doing all hills yeah so I'm basically sprinting a lot yeah and heart rates just spiked yeah yeah and so when I was I was doing rounds on the bag the other day I was like cheese I got wind yeah it's kind of crazy that's awesome yeah I was like deep into like the third and fourth round and I was still slamming the bag and I was like this is weird like I've got like an extra gear here did have you dropped any weight yeah I've dropped a few pounds okay I'll be like somewhere between 194 196 where I was hovering around 200 but I've dropped down before just by my diet yeah got shitty again got shitty again when I went to Mexico I gained like eight pounds in a week in Mexico yeah beer and Mexican food that's not good that's not good for weight control we're definitely not sure tastes good though yeah well I haven't been doing jujitsu very much when I do jujitsu a lot I fuckin the weight just flies off relate anything I could eat a horse but it's a jujitsu just so calorie intensive yeah no I mean yeah weight burned right yeah you just fighting for your life well let's what's your running goal um I don't have a running goal I just I'm definitely going to keep doing it and keep getting in better shape and then if something if I decide okay I need something to strive for yeah then here's my goal okay I'm gonna do the keep hammering 5k next year and fucking kick ass out there you go instead of this year when I did it where I was like oh Jesus this is hard well zero running how about this guy almost 25 seconds short the two hour marathon barrier so crazy he did break the world record though broke the world record two hours and 20 seconds 25 seconds I believe it was so he was only 25 seconds short of breaking what people think is this unattainable record that's insane he'll break it or someone like somebody Raiko somebody will yeah but it's so close so in Nikes apparently lady you will invent yeah I don't think so I'm not built like that guy yeah they're all built the same way I bail they're all built like popsicles it was super humid when he was running this twos like 70% humidity which isn't like ideal no like my hot water that's high well that probably could have been the 20 seconds right for sure yeah maybe they could do that and Seattle in the winter of course is running on sand ah I guess there's an article I just read yesterday I think I was on TechCrunch maybe or wired somebody like a writer for there was trying to break a half marathon and he wanted to see if he could break a 90-minute or half marathon this is first time running on that course and he broke it by two and a half minutes Oh SEC there's something special about that course - like a mile and a half track I don't know why you'd be able to run faster necessarily there but yeah um can those shoes they made - or what is it what's the deal with the shoes something super special training I don't know exactly you can't buy him yet you can like only win them off a raffle if you had Under Armour he would have won that's it baby yeah that me of the ski pameron shoes get Under Armour keep hammer and shoes that you could get it under armour doc huh can you get your keep hammering shoes can buy them anywhere I don't think so what the fuck Under Armour get on the ball you can't buy my my 3-5 shirt I always wear either yeah well that's a rare thing shirt with buttons keep that away from the public know about important we are we are I don't know when it's going to be released but the Cameron Haynes line is coming out yeah the Cameron Haynes Under Armour you a hunter on yeah yes yeah and you're gonna have a saying oh yes I know yeah it's awesome it's the boots are amazing yeah yeah beautiful boots uh camo shorts pants um base layer hoodie jacket it's killer and when is this all the stuff you don't know when it's coming out now I don't know it's but they're in the in development stage right now yeah I think they they texted me when I was in Australia said they have samples and for me what was awesome when you took over the UA hunt page on Instagram you do more of that now right because I talked to Brian Offutt we're gonna Brian we're gonna get on the ball with us yeah I mean when I took it over the week that I took over there was so if you look at impressions on Instagram it went up three million that seems like a good thing Brian isn't it I really wait or waiting for a response look at Brian off it what here when I'm in the camera Ryan what's up you look at him up there oh so yeah so no out and when Adam took it over when we're on that Australia hunt it went up like they went from was it four hundred ninety three thousand to five hundred two thousand followers so pretty good jump yeah that's good jump yeah I posted it on Instagram too yeah and it's just a matter of putting out interesting content yeah well that's what I was saying like the Instagram story was nice but I would have really loved it if you guys were straight if there's a way to stream like more often like they had like very specific moments we were streaming yeah and I think that as technology advances especially did you see what Elan musk is trying to do is trying to fill the world with one gigabyte Internet but there's going to do is launch satellites into the air that's going to allow people to have one gigabyte is fucking insane tear gas yeah and if that happens you can stream live from anywhere but say goodbye to privacy by the way there's gonna be drones filming people right outside their window it's gonna get really crazy but live but what's going to be interesting is you can be in a place like where you were yeah and you could you know call people from your phone you could have film things you could stream live and all that stuff would be available and you would have real internet access in the in the bush and and that's what people people like that I mean they're already asking when's a film coming out yeah we filmed this Marc Womack with his company sub seven film twofer Under Armor and we're like we got turned this thing around fast and I saw a drummer put out this can come out in the fall on farmer bullshit listen let's get to sell fuckin may know people okay people like I mean the chop chop people don't have patience anymore I don't have patience anymore I don't either I would like you to finish the sentence quicker please I thought I saw I saw Marc Womack we got off the plane together and in LA here and I'm like hey you get that movie done or what on the play yeah he said he was working he had been editing so I'm like alright let's get that thing posted so I don't know I mean people are primed for right now they followed along and in our super invested in it and it'd be it'd be awesome to get up good listen I'm your manager now so I'm gonna make some calls we're very decided we're gonna make things happen quicker yeah you got me running you got me doing a lot of shame shit dude you gotta be doing a lot of things I didn't think I'd be doing oh that's awesome so I owe well good so it makes me cry Oh YouTube for forgive me this to talk about platforms listen I really do think that it's made a big impact and I think you and Rinella and Remy Warren and Adam and the people that have had on and Jim shocky and you know real representatives of the noble pursuit the real the the real hardcore enthusiasts that truly have a deep love of nature and that given these people this this platform and given these people this this way to communicate these ideas I think the millions and millions of people that have listened to you guys it's changed perception and I think that that perception is there's a ripple effect and that perception is going to lead people to maybe read your book or you know read maybe a Rinella book meat-eater or maybe listen to some of these books on tape or maybe you know look into Aldo Leopold or look into some of these people that have really been these huge figures in conservation and of the love of wildlife and hunting and they'll get a different understanding of it than people have had because of movies like that split movie where the hunters are portrayed as a child molester it's like right now you know that you said hunting was dying or you know that one time that was the fear and now they're like and my Instagram page is 20 year old guys you know that Laura are into it and are buying bows and the bow rack back home is packed and you know Eva shocky and I will do appearances and we have a line that goes for hours you know young girls waiting for her because she's a hunter you know in her book coming out taking aim is about that lifestyle so I mean I feel like we're sort of turning the corner maybe a little bit and so we just keep that momentum going I think for sure it's turning the corner I mean as far as the what I see in the communication that I get with people online I mean the bohrok is that are they experiencing an up jump in sales yeah I mean went yeah I mean Wayne the other day like I can't even remember what day it was but he sold something like 40 bows a day in a day that's crazy yeah that's like for folks who don't know that's like 50,000 plus dollars in bows in a day and bows are a specialized thing it's not it's not something that people you know it's it's a very there's a steep learning curve to get involved you know we were talking about it about if there was a Hoyt Academy yeah in California if there's a place to go there's not a whole lot of places to go like when you took Scott Eastwood you went to that place down Riverside yeah Riverside our street yeah it was yeah there's a few great places like that yeah but there's 30 million people here and it might be five of those spots yeah you know I would love it if Hoyt had a place where are ideally they had more than one place you know where people could go and you would get fitted they would find out what's your proper draw length you know what how you know what weight should you start out what you know weight arrows should you start out someone could teach you how what the proper form is how to release an arrow correctly yeah and really understand but just I mean even if someone never wants to hunt just understand the the meditative and beautiful effect of just launching an arrow at a target and have it hit that X the witchery of archery witchery yeah is it witchery that's a book oh really or the witchcraft of art o or Zen in the art of archery is a great I think that's a book the witchcraft of archery doesn't look that up hmm I'm almost positive I read it really mm-hmm Jamie clawed help me out you're leaving me hanging it Iida witchcraft of archery is it No uh yes nope yes come on it's probably uh only one copy guy handed a look at I wrote this oh you don't believe him Wow witchcraft of archery here we go witchcraft of archery witchcraft plus archery is both now looking good very witchcraft page pagan which was plates in the witch work oh no mmm no not looking good separatist the witchcraft of archers are gorgeous I read something like that mmm all right interesting okay just can we edit this part out nope just kidding' this sorcery of archery yeah yeah it's fun it's a beautiful discipline I mean even if someone never chooses and honestly if you really want to get into hunting just straight-up hunting you probably start with a rifle anyway it's a far easier way to do it no no don't say that or wear earplugs if you do do it you don't want to blow your ears off yeah another problem that I'm running into is a lot of people have been hunting for a good portion of portion of their life yeah a bad hearing I know my ears ring all the time for when I rifle hunted that's cry was just a kid because I should go shoot my 300 Winchester Magnum up at the rock pit but I mean this thing was so loud and I used to love shooting and I was like oh you're a pussy if you were I mean nobody wore hearing protection not crazy it's just like nobody wore bike helmets either you know what I mean does the same type of thing but now my ears this ring was on yeah all the time that shows your taste in music that's why why do I listen to some of your Instagram stories listen to music you listen to me Jesus Christ another always good ears ringing when your ears are ringing light sounds better okay what the country or the router love the rapid to the other half is good Mia Mia Adam listen we drove drove to Sydney for two hours I think we listened to Kendrick Lamar uh his new song like probably 20 times Wow in a row yes did you guys like seeing the words long look whatever though we still don't see the Nords did you say the sing-along with the N word or do you guys get silent during that part it's just kind of good a funny thing man with white people like what are we supposed to do what are we supposed to do when it gets to that part of the song I know it's called be humble uh be humble pizza sauce no that's a song oh yeah humble and then be humble to when the n-word comes up just does that realize it's actually be humble bitch be humble oh really yeah it's a good one that's the mixed message do you know that one day me yeah I wasn't it I wasn't asking how they liked that new album and down in Australia with the Kendrick Lamar intricate yeah I don't know about it until you brought up to him well no he made fun of me always put my instance my music on the insta story that you guys rap a lot no like a lot of rap though yeah and country that's kind of what I listened to but then he had this song I'm like okay hey where the hell do you think you learned a song from for me right and what did he say I don't know made something out yeah we play lied are there any Australian rappers I think there are not not anybody knows but I remember they had we had the radio on down there mm-hmm and they there was some rap on there that had no idea what it was so it has to be from there mm well there's so many different rappers now though there's no way you could know all this stuff it's like we've reached a weird saturation point with music where there is no God I mean every year they're coming out with new music yeah I know but I mean you get used to certain sounds or certain styles and this was like something I had never I've listened to a lot I was in Brazil you were in Brazil with me yeah but one time I was in Brazil's listen to some rap music some Brazilian rappers like this is badass yeah I hope what they're saying isn't stupid cuz it's I don't understand Portuguese but it sounds badass yeah it's a great thing would be great to work out - yeah you don't know what it's not as distracting right like if their lyrics are corny yeah yeah I don't know I don't know but I think there is Australian rap but it's not Kendrick Lamar be humble Iggy Azalea is d.o right now yeah but Iggy Azalea she's from Mary's from Australia oh she's white white privilege don't let me what black people over there they do write but met expats American expats sneak over there they look yeah I'm not sure okay hmm that's one of the few places I would live outside of America yeah look at the shitty that's nicer Canada and Australia those are my spots yeah it's cool I mean Sydney traffic is ridiculous no while they fucking drive on the wrong side of the road they're all confused yeah there on the left like what are you doing over here over there go over there let's switch this around everybody that's probably why it's all messed up yeah like look the roads are in place everything the gut roads in the right spot yeah drive on the other side yeah simple fix yeah simple fix how does it need so traffic filled mean how many people live in Sydney five million whoa that's crazy yeah five million that's crazy no it could think of that because there's 30 million people in all of Australia right or is it less I think it's a little less probably less okay let's say it's 20 million so it's that would be like if there was 75 million in Los Angeles yeah no more synergy and more than that yeah it would be more but like 80 million there's 80 million people just in Los Angeles yeah there's only like like a few big city I mean Melbourne or I've probably said it wrong 23 points out yeah million in all of Australia and fiver and Sydney Jesus Christ that's crazy 25 percent the entire population it's a beautiful city though I love it Sydney's really awesome yeah no it's great it's just we were gonna go to the bow shop and I said you know I go the both shops in Sydney right he's like yeah I said how long is gonna take to get there so we did it on the map questing' or whatever an hour that's like I said this like la this sucks hours in the same city I didn't expect that well they're in Eugene everything is fine you don't have to worry about shit up there you got two lane roads there's no cars if you don't make it through one traffic light cycle you're like what the hell is going on wait this is bullshit well you get used to a place like that man you know and the life it's nice and calm and it feels different like life feels different in a small town it's like there's a I feel like this is some woowoo spiritual bullshit that I have no no science behind whatsoever okay but I feel like people give off energy and I feel like cities whether or not something's happen or not the amount of humans in there there's a certain amount of energy that you feel when you're in a smaller town you're calmer yeah I really believe that yeah I feel like there's less ah and I don't think it's just the activity just just cars and I think it's the actual amount of humans in an area like there's some sort of a psychic energy that they give off you're not buying I don't any sound buying Anita but maybe the witch thing of archery haha Maurice Thompson I knew it I had that book 1878 Wow hey what is witcheries unreal word I told you I was right you were I'm redeemed five out of five stars and bar nobles bet it's a good book Wow so it's in Barnes & Noble yes um can I get it on a Kindle fine if I can get on my Kindle mmm yeah which revoir Cheree speaking of a whole different um I don't know what you just said but I'm gonna be I'll be in my cubicle tomorrow no you want you gotta quit that job dude today yeah I just call right now let me call for you oh yeah you're my manager on your manager Kendall nice $5.99 I'm getting it thank you thank you young Jamie the why tree of archery and if my fucking Kindle and I try to enter it in it's like nothing exists I'm like listen bitch I've dragged on through this alright yeah it's it's so crazy that you keep a full-time job it's just uh understand how you do it and that's also what a lot of people that get involved in hunting the amount of time that it takes like people don't have the time I go as I was listening to Jason Carter on some podcast who's talking about pursuing one individual buck for like two weeks yeah and I was like look fuck has two weeks to go after one animal is uh crazy who's got that kind of time only like a real like crazy four people Pro type character yeah yeah yeah that's you know it takes time I mean it's just even just the dedication to to regular practice takes time for archery but that's the next level there's nothing archery is uh it's it really is in terms of hunting it really is the ultimate pursuit the ultimate in difficulty but that's what I stop at the compound thing people are gonna try traditional archery yeah pump oh no trees for pussies settle down yeah enough is enough how about kill it with a rock how about you kill with a rock a person did are you wearing shoes pussy I always wanted my shoes I was wondering yeah I know I was wondering how anybody would kill with a recurve for I was hunting because I said my 245 feet per second bow is slow right that'd be super fast for a traditional bow oh yeah so I mean I could imagine what this deer they just I don't know it was very tough very tough the Argan tree you probably could oh we know you were there yeah but it sound like the air you were in they were very unnaturally hyped up I hear unnaturally wired because they've been hunted by so many people I think they're just normally wired but when people kill them is when they're writing you know until they're distracted because they're it's a breeding season yeah so this is post rut those Bucks are not even with doze at all and they're you know just just tuned in you know but during the ride it would it would be easier just be like honey elk during the road as opposed to not or how you do to the club with a boner right people get distracted I've never hunted a dude with a bum I'm glad I'm glad to hear that I was wondering I have questions sometimes I get a I beat around the bush to get to the answer all I got that's what I got you're doing right there yeah this is a this this it's funny how these different animals have like different seasons that they come into like the idea that only one time a year they breed like they're a mammal it's not like a dog like dogs want fuck all the time yeah but like deer one time of year yeah everything starts to pop in nature says listen this is how it works you want to have a baby in the spring it's a way to do this you got to do it in the fall okay in the fall you got to get cracking and then she's got take some time to cook up that baby drop that baby in the spring and then good but it's bizarre yeah there's actually some bucks that were they call it crow keen which is grunting because they weren't really the full runt but some doze that didn't get bred the first season if they don't get bred they come back into heat so they we call them second cycle dough's there coming into the box I mean they'll do whenever this gotta wait for the female right so the Bucks were actually still sort of running a little bit we heard some croaking so that was just for so long no that's just a few does it hadn't been bred well that's one of the coolest things about elk hunting there's nothing like the rut when you hear elk screaming like if the people have never experienced that before even if you have no desire to hunt please go to a place where elk live during the rut just to hear it cuz it is insane so wild yeah they're so loud and the sound sounds like something from the Lord of the Rings yeah doesn't even seem real and you're gonna be in Utah this year oh yeah over that Utah I'm very excited yeah well we're definitely gonna film some stuff there yeah we're definitely gonna film some stuff we'll do some Instagram stories that will we'll definitely get some footage and we're definitely I mean we got some footage from last year when you and I were in to hone ranch you have funny Instagram some elk screaming we're pretty far away over hundred yards away and it's wide open yeah where's Utah's a little bit more wooded and we'll try get a little bit closer yeah those Bulls will be coming close I'm very excited oh I can't wait either I can't wait just to see you I can't wait yeah yeah I mean thanks for introducing me to this man changed my life really has been have been great to share with you and and it's been great
