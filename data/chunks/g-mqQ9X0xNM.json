the girag an experience those women was a bad motherfucker very bad motherfucker a solid you barely made any lemons really yeah I mean think about the shitty movies at Paul Newman mid I really can't I can't come up with one you know I can't come up with i'm not familiar enough with his entire catalog I remember Stallone did that comedy movie with his mother oh it was a momma from the train yeah we got it no it was another one no no this was um what was it called uh this is gonna drive me fucking nuts um oh it wasn't it the same woman that was in golden girls that played the old woman but she had a brown hair oh this is gonna drive me nuts I don't know lady trivia person how do you know that I don't know it seems like I romelli well let's just look up Stallone's alone was it like Oscar Oscar it was it was ask Oscar was one let's that's the one that I'm thinking of yeah well he definitely had one called Oscar that's not the one I was thinking use motherfuckers the room on the front right one but it wasn't throw momma from trainers throw average for train was that old gross lady from like Goonies or something like that or my mom will shoot stop or my mom was out okay so he did two comedies in a row he did Oscar and then he did stop or my mom will shoot that's how retarded people were in the 90s like you know what forget all these great comedians we have we need to get alone up there they just kept giving him money old lady trivia look at this it was the old lady Estelle Getty from gug golden girls with white hair that's so crazy and look at him he's like ma can't believe we don't know what are you doing mouth with that gun haha she can easily go for a second look at the look at his face man oh my can't believe this look a little my gun is looking big jaws is I think has it been confirmed or or light Lake completely confirmed that he actually started out doing porn is cuz that's a row ya know he did a movie did like a sauce was like no show a soft core yeah yeah so he wasn't like laying pipe on phone so all right it might have been might have been laying pipe but I'm pretty sure they didn't show it if he was I think it was like an angle thing okay and they wanted to sell it to him for a million dollars like it wouldn't give you ten cents a piece of shit well it's got a gun fucking sure you yeah well that's that same thing man that's that thing of like wanting to win like I was I went to eat dinner at this bar and I was sitting access lady and you know like sometimes you're sitting next to somebody and you can tell they have some there they there they're having a problem and life or something you either kind of looking for help sometimes I get around people and you just feel it they they're lost or they want something like I'm just seeing their eating and she starts talking to me right and then right away she's goes into talking about how her sister was getting married and her sister invited her up to Big Sur to go to the wedding and got there there was no where to stay and her sister her steps or her sister-in-laws a bitch that was the story she was telling but you're looking at someone who's like caught that's just one little piece of the puzzle for them they're locked into this world view of fighting they're constantly on the offensive trying to like poke back at the world and that's the one little symbol of the thing that she could give me but then you said something shitty to the bartender and then she likes said something shitty to somebody else realize like oh this person is just going through the world trying to shank every living part of the world she wants to cut and shank and hurt she's shut down but inside of her because that's what I recognize I'm like shit this is like an sometimes the cruelest sort of person is someone who started off trying to be nice and then got shut down for being nice sometimes yeah and I could see all this used to be a very sweet nice person so I said to him you know you should start doing you should start doing like service work or missionary work and she's like I used to do that I used to do that I spent years doing that and she was it was like I could see that part of her you know and then I could see she thought that by doing good things in the world she should get some reward for it but instead of getting her word for it she got hurt whatever it was that happened during the course of her serving the universe she got less of what she wanted or didn't get what she expected and because of that she's like fuck it I'm gonna be a bitch from now on cuz I tried to be good and I got punished for my wife has a friend that's religious and her and her friend her and this other friend were going to this woman in her other friend we're going to get like a real estate license and she didn't get it and she passed she failed her test but her friend passed and she was complaining about it and the what she was complaining about she goes I don't get it I am a good person yes why didn't you know why didn't God hook me up with this actually literally said that that's it right there see that is the great fallacy of being a good person is the moment you start doing being a good person as a job and you're supposed to get these fortune paychecks from the universe in the form of luck or good things coming to you that's the moment you fail you fail you really have to resign yourself to the idea that mostly if you're being nice to people they're going to hurt you first of all there's an unbelievable amount of pressure as an artist after not having a show in four years to you know every time I do a show I want it to be the best show I've ever done and this was like such a small amount of time to put that much art together that I was you know everyone's like you fucking bitches in Mexico I'm like I'm working I'm not I didn't go to Mexico to fuck you know but you're very strange way of saying fuck how dose it's very bold oh really it's like let's go I'd like I did Roboto to it like you're wearing a cape I didn't go to Mexico to fuck it's like here you know what a confident way of saying fuck why do I what do I like to do fuck no just like it's like you're almost defiant in your tone so I gotta tell you what happened I uh you know cuz every I'm gonna go off subject just for a second cuz no way every time on the show every time I think wow I've experienced a new sexual thing that I've never liked this is insane like how many are left when a girl shoots an ice cube of my butthole Oh Oh or you know like a buff or like when I'm laying down and then like five women are just giving me a massage just using their tongues I'm like oh five it's not gonna get better than this you know like this is like living like a baller yeah I didn't know it went over to handed I got to just stop there you have five handed and then so I meet a guy yesterday he's like oh yeah we did some great red rope shit and this and that on my credit crunch I'm like I don't I don't know if that is he's like you don't know what the red rope services and I go no but please tell me like what the fuck are you talking about right now my name is marty and i'm the inventor of the red rope service so obviously sitting there ok so you're laying on your pizza massage parlor you go it's a service it's not a name of a place oh god it's like a code word you go Cal get it can I get the red rope ok so you're getting a massage I think it's only in Asia and you're laying on your back and then you go you know you get that you get to the happy ending point where she gets your day card and everything and you're like I would like the red rope at this point she ties a rope and there's the crazy part it doesn't have to be red it's just a rope and they tie it to the whatever the the bars above the massage table and they hook their feet on it so they're upside down and so they start spinning around and then they put their mouth on your hard dick and then they let go God they helicopter their mouth around your dick all the way and I've never done it before but the guy says it feels like your Dick's gonna like you've never felt anything like that before in your life and it feels like your dick is just going to explode with you know like a neutron bomb an explosion and then youth and then it's done and it stops and then it spins the other way around to listen leave it to the crafty Asia always hang out something that's unbelievable cuz they amazing they really like take sex to another level like they try to figure out the most pleasurable things to do to you and then they do them you know you're a fucking human being
