the Joe Rogan experience David Seaman who's on the podcast last week had a really interesting take on Bitcoin that I thought was kind of funny he was saying that if if like Bank of America for say if they were smart that they would get involved in Bitcoin he was like you already have this established name brand like cryptocurrencies are gonna be here they're there they're here to stay this is his take he's like why wouldn't you capitalize on the name brand that you've already built in on and getting on the mark and quick get in on it now in the early days and established like that Bank of America like still has like a footing in in this as well as in regular money and he was like it would be a really wise investment I think you're gonna see that happening in short time really we saw this with the Internet which was at first the telecommunications companies fought tooth and nail they could not believe that a decentralized packet switch network like the internet would deliver quality voice and quality video they wanted to build highly controlled and structured networks and they tried to fight it because it threatened the long-distance market which was very lucrative it threatened many other markets today three-quarters of all international calls have known skype 3/4 3/4 that's that's a market that a few you know a two decades ago was 15 20 billion dollar market and disappeared and essentially they had to restructure operations now they made up for it the smart ones became very good as Internet service providers and created whole new businesses that replace those lost revenues so so what happened there is you have these telecom companies trying to fight it until some of the smaller ones some of the ones that don't have solid entrenched positions and can't take advantage of size think you know what I mean I'm gonna cut off from this herd and go play with that Bitcoin a bit and as soon as that starts happening there's almost a stampede because everybody tries to rush into it that's what happens with telecommunications the smaller providers started peeling off from the herd and instead of fighting it they started trying to build service providers so it's really just a matter who runs first right someone's gonna start running and then right and then the herd breaks apart because until the first one breaks everyone's like wow we're too serious for this Bitcoin stuff and they're looking over their shoulder trying to make sure that everybody else is also staying away from it but eventually the market dynamic changes so it's just essentially it's just human nature like with human nature there's two certain rules that are just always going to be into place play hard-to-get and follow leader those are two big ones yeah and Bitcoin threatens some business structures within the banking industry admits gonna make it difficult for them to charge exorbitant fees to do international wire transfers when you can do it cheaper just like if you have Skype you can't justify three dollars a minute long-distance calls right and but at the same time the smart banker is looking at this and their thing yeah but if we have a cheap efficient secure payment system we can build some really interesting things on top of that and creates whole new businesses that are very competitive that can actually give us a lead so we outrun the herd the you know disruption in a competitive market is actually very very enticing to the to the second and third tier players because they don't have an advantage they're too small to compete against the big guys but if they see this disruptive technology I think well maybe if I hitch a ride on that I'm gonna overtake everybody and you know I can be the blockbuster or I can be the Netflix I can be the Tower Records or I can be the iTunes and we've seen this happen in technology races before yeah that's fascinating how people some people just don't want to buck the trends they do they don't want to go along with the flow of things or they want to buck the trends they want to somehow or another figure out a way where you know they can prove everybody else wrong and VHS is making a comeback and you know renting movies is still valid you know there's there's a lot of those fuckers out there that just won't let it go radio companies change is scary yeah it is scary but that's that's that's the nature of the beast especially today we were involved in the craziest time for change the world has ever known yeah um there are at the moments being on the top of an industry especially an industry that's involved in technology is a very precarious position you know if you talk to Kodak a decade ago do you think they would they would realize that suddenly the largest vendor or manufacturer of cameras in the world would be a telephone company nokia nokia within three years became the world's largest maker of cameras and suddenly the entire industry changed right and how do you compete against that they're not even in your industry they just came out of left field it's like you're suddenly the horse buggy manufacturer and Ford is taking your business and you never expected that was gonna happen well nokia has a camera phone now a Windows Phone that is some insane amount of pixels it's like 40 fucking megapixels or something some crate 41 41 megapixel says Jamie Jamie's on top of that shit 41 fucking megapixels on a phone I mean this thing I think has of the note 3 I think it that's 12 or something no it's better than that you familiar with Moore's law yes so so for your listeners too Moore's law it was created by Gordon more processors right processing speed and yeah and what he said was that he estimated because of the way silicon works every 18 months the speed of a computer would double or the price would drop by half and that has been true now for more than 25 years and and that thing then plays out in camera megapixels in storage on SD cards in the size of the of your smartphone in the number of sensors you can put into the smartphone and it's battery battery life is the one that's lagging behind and it's the main thing that's holding back this technology Moore's law also applies to things like Bitcoin it also applies to networks like the internet and what it means is that if you're in an industry that's established then suddenly you have a competitor that's coming at you with the power of Moore's law you know better watch out because you're in it's not a matter of whether you will be able to compete in a decade it's a matter of whether your industry will still exist in a decade right right yeah that fascinating that whole industries can just vanish 150 years of Kodak and then suddenly film doesn't exist God in the decade do you remember when you used to have to pay money for a long distance you know long distance calls don't exist like you didn't call New York right now on your home phone it's regular call on your cell phone it's totally normal like if you used to call long distance on a cell phone it was an exorbitant amount of money Saturday afternoons London payphone when I was a student I would go there with a stack of coins that was probably about $10 worth in today's money I would sit in a payphone and my family would know what time I was gonna call coordinated I'd call in they'd be a line of 15 relatives sitting standing behind the phone on the 8th and side nav hi mom I love you very much hi dad I love you very much hey sis it's all awesome okay next aunt aunt Maria Julie aunt WA you know London's awesome and I'm stuffing coins as fast as I can into this payphone and then you know four or five minutes later ten dollars down the drain and I've said hello to the entire family and that's all I could afford Wow that was my experience and now you could Skype for hours for free and not crazy look at a video of each other talking to each other through your laptop for free Wow fascinating fascinating times when you put it in that kind of a perspective you really sort of understand the change they just the ability that we have to reach out to each other it's just unprecedented in human history it's never been even remotely close to what it is now I saw somebody walking down the street the other day skyping with someone while they were walking on the street and they were talking while they were walking down the street they like yeah so we're gonna and then the other person on the other end I'm looking at their phone I'm like this is crazy they're doing it through a cell phone connection I'm doing that all the time now yeah walking down the street through a cell phone connection streaming video back and forth to each other it's amazing amazing
