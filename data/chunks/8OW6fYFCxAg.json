willed into existence to doot-doot Sturgill motherfuckin simpson and his band just let's introduce everybody okay yeah you do it alright next to you is my my drummer miles chuck he plays the bass down on the end is bob he plays the keys and this is our head of security this is justin he's a you know we weren't sure about this play so we brought it's a sketchy joint um mmm you guys were fucking fantastic last night we had a great time thanks so the Troubadour is such a great place to see you too because it's so intimate man you know it's such a it's a really interesting place it's so tight you know yeah so old-school and a fucking million shows have happened in that joint everybody everybody mm-hmm yeah it was interesting for us we didn't feel like it was a good show I think we kind of woke up about halfway through but also now first time we've been this close to people in a while it was a great show man I enjoyed the fuck out of it and Suzanne from honey-honey Suzanne Santo she came with me too she loved it it was great man we had a good time what a bad show oh come on it was amazing we had a great fucking time and it's just uh it's such a treat to see someone in such a small venue you know that venue is so like everybody was like jammed up on on top of everybody so when people went nuts for the songs you know like you felt it like you really realized when you're in a venue like that how much that contributes to the experience you know intimate event a venue can ruin a good show sure yeah anything we don't really like the amphitheater like the outdoor ampitheatre yes to the tin roof sheds I feel the same it's not it's there's no connection because everybody that is close to you is sitting down and then there's this giant picnic going on behind them up on the grass it's all just a weird separation what happened Jamie what are we doing oh I thought you were trying something new up [Music] yeah the amphitheaters are weird I mean they could be great oh there others the picture from the truth our last tells fun man nice that place I mean how many people is that seat like 400 I think 500 I'm stuffed in there that is a fire hazard sure someone someone Bobby's organs a fire hazard it was a good time though it really was I saw Everlast perform there recently he was there like just a few weeks ago I met that dude once he's awesome he is a chill guy man he really is the best where it was at mode this got Dawn's like a skate it's like a skate shop my buddy Ian took me to this skate shop there's a bunch of sneakers I was looking for some sneakers and it's just this little sleepy skate shop and and then he's like hey let's go out back we walked up back there's like 12 X Games champions back there just slay in this halfpipe I've never really seen that shit that up close like that just like you know thrashing and it was intense and then we're sitting there hanging out and then fucking Everlast it shows up from how's babe crazy he was so cool he's super cool but I remember the one of the first times I ever met him it's one of those weird ones were you like am I really hanging out with this guy this really ever laughs from House of Pain right you know jump around was such a goddamn gigantic hit I was like one of the greatest hits of all time like one of the greatest I mean I guess you would call that a hip hop song right but it was it was a giant hit with like my generation so just be hanging out with him was super surreal I'm sure he's had a very interesting journey fuck yeah yes he was the first guy ever smoked a joint with with inside a casino - he just fired her up I go where he one spoke that he was where they just start smoking it I was like alright I guess we're gonna do that that was a pretty album I think I wasn't like seventh grade it was written too furious I remember that yeah the ferris is a good word for it you know a rip shit kill it yeah cut your gut and spill it treat you like a gas tank take that ass and fill it yes that's nefarious go for a ride to where I reside but you face them a pillow and have you weeping like a willow it's what it is y'all it's prolific yeah that's intimidating right for sure that doesn't that doesn't freak you out a little especially if someone says it with uh with his voice you know I'll smooth engine of Larry Bird Jersey you've tried a lot of different forms of music do you ever think you would ever do hip-hop oh god no that would be a weird stretch uh well there's just so many other people that should do it other than me you know I would love to but no I would love to produce a hip-hop record with Bob I think we could probably make some fat fucking tracks and just get some rappers to do the actual art yeah you know I think I know what you're saying I know how you feeling but I think you could pull it off I think yeah I think you could stir Jill yeah no bullshit I spit on the bus a little bit truth be told all right yeah you'd have to be lit but you could do it you know who can fucking rap for a white guy Shia LeBouf me yeah you did some radio show years back out here in LA and like it was actually impressive Wow yeah as freestyles was fired if for a dude who was a white guy it's a risky choice right it's gonna risk each I thought it and you gotta figure you got to decide whether or not you're gonna go with our gonna use a Shia LaBeouf album rap oh there you go open up the doors manifest it make it happen yeah white guy rappers have to be real careful with their accent like got to figure out how you gonna yeah that's always weird hey gonna pull that off I went to high school with a lot of those white guys that like did that tried to like talk like they were black and never could understand what was going on it's a weird one it's a weird one Myles Myles and I went to the same high school he gradually learned 15 years after me so he knows about the wharf Oh what for caddy the what I'm talking about I'm sure it was still very much a thing oh it still is we were just talking about like how few white guys come successful rappers like what that what if all the things that people attempt to do that might be one of like there's only like a few there's like you know Eric from ever ever last from house pain there's a mmm there's um Phoenix Miller Mac Miller yeah third base third base for sure those guys it was great Eminem of course yeah Eminem of course you might be number one yeah he's number one I think he's a just an all-time great rapper period yeah white guy or not mmm-hmm but like white guys that want a rap boy the white guys that want a rap versus white guys were successful rapping that fucking numbers too pendency those are not good odds that's intimidating right there's no denying that some white guys know yes in four months like he had like a whole yeah yeah yeah talking to Mike brother yeah sorry I just said he did the patois thing yeah yeah yeah he went Jamaican on us right but it was really good he's from Jamaica Oh was he yeah that just keeps getting better nice as hell up there how did he yeah go to the mic goes from Toronto yeah are we looking down yeah that's like a good call good call I loved that one song though that Informer song was badass that's insane would be no what I would say what's the city but he's from Toronto born in Toronto yeah born in Toronto 49 Wow there you go yeah he went to Macon and no one else even ventured to step in his footsteps it was like a successful hit song but it didn't like open up a whole door of like Jamaican it didn't even open up a door for him man that's the only fucking song anybody ever heard that good that always freaks me out about your business is that there are a few cats that come up with one song that just fucking smash well that happens because whoever is in charge of their career as one of us there's interest which is pushing that single and then it does its thing and if they can't come up with the identical thing again they don't know what to do and then they just stick them on a shelf and you never hear from them again I know but it just sits off it's so final like if you're a comic and you have a shitty special you can get your shit together and come up with a good next special there's nothing like a huge hit to destroy your music career how many I mean really really good songs if you stop and think about history we're from a band where you heard like maybe two of their songs ever I would say 90% of them so many so manma pop in that in that world you know if you're like it's radio songs yeah in syndication yeah this is usually how much is that changing for you guys because the Internet I mean you when you first started your career like how much of an effect did the internet have on like promoting things or getting the word out on things versus now huge because we were not on radio even now when did you when when did we a triple a play now things like that but you're not gonna I guess I'm early on touring blogs and reviews press and things like that gets circulated word of mouth from shows people come to shows they get their mind blown they talk about it on Twitter you know and then it just it's organic grassroots kind of thing and you sort of realize at a point you don't really need any of that other antiquated shit people but but to make it happen like we did you have to go out and do the labs you have to put the time and earn your medals you can't like just sit on YouTube right stuff all the time that's a big part right you shows like how many live shows you guys are doing well now it's already out there so people just do it for you really spreads easier and faster now but like you know miles has been with we've been playing together since he was 19 and like you know playing for people sleeping on one side about two weeks ago and then he drives seven miles and or some sort seven hours and you hope 13 people show up so maybe buy a t-shirt and shit so you got gas to get to the next town there's a lot of life questioning nights out there in the early days you know you know Roy Wood is Roy Wood jr. mmm really hilarious animal comedian he had a really similar story when he was talking about his beginnings as a comedian that he would get these gigs and he wouldn't have enough money to get home that he would get gigs and while he was there he would take a job like a day job like a day laborer he would you know we're fucking hard hats and gloves and shit work all day and then do the stand-up at night it's like that those guys who go through that kind of stuff there's no substitute for that no there's no there's no other way like to really get that there's something about the seasoning of the unsuccessful or barely successful early years it seems for all my favorite artists it's it's so critical like they all have it whether they're comics or whether they're musicians does that fucking grind in the beginning where go left or right like you can make it or it could completely fall apart and you have to be almost delusional and a little crazy you know I was I mean I had a great job that I quit to go do this shit finally like give it a go I was probably 35 years old you know there's a lot of nights where it's like what in the fuck am i doing you know I mean it worked and yeah that's why last night so fun because nobody else well I wrote a song about turtles and drugs one year and nobody else to so I just I feel like yeah whenever a country music song comes out with DMT in it you got my attention psilocybin LSD that was a great song though it was a great song to introduce the world to a different idea you know it's just music man you know like whether it's country or psychedelic or psychedelic country if it's great it's just great you know and you switch it up this new album is so weird it's great it's great but it's so interesting if you go back to like your first album and then listen to this out like that's not the same fucking but it is I know they're all different expressions or interests but that's really exciting you know when when someone mixes their style up as much as you do and you guys put together these albums you know each one of them is they're uniquely you but they're all different it's a it's a you've got a real weird thing going on man like if you went back and listened to your first album and then listened to the they're all awesome but they're awesome in like all these different ways man you know it's so cool to see all this experimentation like this anime thing you're doing with this and it's really bad that that was really just sort of a a lot of things lining up out of my control that that that movie we only started on that literally a little over a year ago and just the way it all came together and how many people were working simultaneously is the only reason it got finished as fast as it but it definitely delayed me releasing the record for at least a year but it's such a great idea yeah well I mean you know if we're here well the whole reason we went in the studio made this thing is because we reached a point of burnout if I definitely did and then you also reach a point where it now you realize the only way we're gonna survive and make money as musicians is touring so why wouldn't we make this as fun for ourselves as possible and you know you play these festivals and then you're rocking out three or four songs and the people are jumping them and I just kind of asked their why why can't we just go do that for two hours and make music that people can dance and have a great time too and still you know miles has probably been listening to me talk about making you know fucking dubstep rock and roll record for five years and we probably did it but it's it's great that you take those steps you know these guys helpful lot too left we were touring in 2018 the music was just sort of going there anyway on stage how is it how's it going there anyone's age like you guys we're just stretching out more abandoning course fundamental structures of the songs like I don't want to be a karaoke machine anymore I got like I just got so bored and burnout with Stanford and playing the shit the same way every night and you do isolate some fans but at the same time like if we're not inspired how the fuck is anybody else gonna be right so eventually you will find your audience that wants to go with you and music you know and one of these songs were turning into 10 and 15 minute just me being high and I was having a good time you know yeah that's what I caught that the brace for impact on Colbert somebody shared it yeah you know I hadn't seen it basically since we did it in 2016 and it's almost a completely different song right like you could literally the changes from 2016 to now it's amazing yes we made this record June of 2017 and had to sit on it couldn't play at any of it you know you go out and you do the other thing so now almost two almost two and a half years later well from the time we recorded in the studio and I was writing those lyrics we were making this music and in the moment we'll go out we've been rehearsing for two weeks and it's already at a point like shit what I wish we could have recorded it now because you have all these ideas that you just don't have in that moment and you get a year and a half later on a tour playing that material it's a whole other animal you know because you just found all these little idiosyncratic nuances and things that you can flourish that you just don't think about when you're in a control room for 18 hours a day is that a common tactic the way you're always changing your songs you're always fucking with them and continuing I hope so yeah so does it comment with other artists it should be it should be me if they're you know worth a shit but is that a normal thing like when you guys get together and talk about how you make songs like comedians talk about how they make jokes we don't really talk about it you guys don't write lyrics and stuff or maybe have like a rough idea structure and form of these guys are all like bonafide musical geniuses man they're all like they're flavor that's why you know like on this record I've never done it before but at a certain point anybody that's in the room is contributing whether they're right and the songs are not just their presence the energy they bring to that track like they're if you got a guy that plays the perfect thing the first take your what are you really producing you know your heart you're hiring someone for what for as a tool and you know the Nashville there's all these session players so in a sense it's just this giant toolbox and there might be 10 guys you could call it a day to do this thing but act 2 of them might be way more perfect for this specific thing than those other 8 mmm they're all badasses but you know you know you can flavor I mean I just found the right the right flavors that I want to stand up there with because he's got I could make 10 records with these guys and they're all gonna like 10 different bands now is this because you guys don't have I mean how much of influence do record companies have on new bands like when new bands are coming up and they're trying to put together their music how much influence the record companies have on the creative process it just depends that they discover them or they already are the or they jumping on board with something that's already working well I mean someone like Anna as an artist like someone looking at you as an artist to go yeah you'd let him do whatever the fuck he wants you know let him know that's a very rare thing it's rare well you're exactly with record companies right yeah yeah I had I got it contractually written into my contract that nobody could tell me what to do so it's common that you get fucked with well everybody's gonna have their two cents employers are gonna here's what we really want you to want to do right because probably I would think there would be executives to go stop stop fucking with it right there just leave it right there trust me put it out like that those would be like actual record men the guys that used to run the record business like they knew what the real shit was and you don't fuck with the real shit but there's very few of those people actually working in the record business anymore it's all like 25 30 year-old bottom line quarterly report motherfuckers it's all about the money yeah but wouldn't you think that excellence would bring money especially today in this Dainius with the internet it's a way to sell excellence yeah then they have to work and find it as opposed is like formulating this tried-and-true Mrs Butterworth recipe proven yeah you know just give me 17 of those I get it I would just would suck to be in a business with art you know or like you're thinking about it like a business yeah but it's art mmm it's a product any but you're amusing those people involved anything turns into a product right yeah but it's just the the business aspect of it like someone trying to think about what's the best way to sell it what's the best way to what's the best way to push it what if we changed this and added that I'll put some gospel singers in the background what if we did this what if we you know mm-hmm yeah but you've avoided it what get this person to like grab reverse on it how'd you avoid it what did you what did you do to avoid most of that bullshit still figured it out I don't know man just didn't do it I say no a lot I think that's the thing to say yeah yeah I'm lazy shit I got to really want to do something yeah especially you don't have to right right man what were you doing at 35 when you quit mmm we're gonna railroad where I was the operations manager a really r2a intermodal yard out in Utah Wow we run on a rail yard uh just overseeing the switching crews that when the trains would pull in from the east and west side of the yard we would break those trains apart and like look at other manifests and drag cars off of the rails and build them into those trains and then crew him again and get him on Milan I was working like 90-hour weeks mostly cleaning up train wrecks and derailments or likely blew a switch and put three cars on the ground we were the central artery in the Midwest or really that that corridor is kind of the cross section of the entire country's shipping Commerce so if we fucked up and tied up the main lines then we kind of shut down the railroad do you know what's fucked up you could never tell a kid hey you want it you want to make meaningful music this is what you got to do you got a struggle and like difficult jobs till you're about 35 and but you know barely get to where you want to be where you're really kind of freaking out about your future and then pour yourself your heart and soul and then find success after that that's a good move if you want to have impactful music it's but if you if you get into music like early on in your life and make it career early on in your life you miss everything that you did by being an older like you're you know a 35 year old man that makes it jump yeah that's I mean an old move that makes sense but there's been a lot of incredible artists that made some truly visionary shit at 20 you know for sure but there's a life experience aspect to your music oh yeah I mean I wouldn't know what the fun everything this shit's right about if I'd done it yeah I'd be righted god knows what I'd be writing about probably pussy yeah for sure for sure yeah and you're young well what are you thinking about you know if you're talking about stars and horoscopes and shit you're probably bullshitting people the podcast got weird real quick unless he does that now thirdly talks about stars and horoscopes now what do you think about horoscopes you think that shit's real on astrology what do you think of a horse ghost I'm actually interested but he thinks about whores good yeah what do you think about that I mean somebody's just making shit up for other people move that mic so you don't have to break your neck yeah yeah you're just making stuff up if you're if you're reading the horoscope or someone's trying to plant like give you some sort of indication of what's gonna happen serendipitously or by fate either way it's just someone making the shit outta source shit people's looking for patterns I think I'd have to learn about like the astrology aspect if they're turning there if they're using that I don't know numerology is the only thing in that world that even remotely interested me well how's that interesting is based on like mathematics and universal equations and she I don't know basically like don't write some people you can get a little loopy with it and they will like they won't fly on an airplane they'll have their numerologist look at the flight numbers number on the plane and and how these things all correlate with her this is a wise decision or not you know that that to me is just like what you know Nancy Reagan was all deep into that really she was deep into astrology actually and she had like some famous astrologer who would read do the readings for them and she would dictate whether or not Ronald Reagan should go and do shit based on the numerous aced on based on astrology it's not the same right numerology is just no no astrology is but she didn't she is that the case I'm pretty sure she was like balls deep into it like really industry ology I've turned the assassin should be noted up what's that yeah we're looking at like Jamie's always on it yeah you got it what do you got here it goes Quigley was born in Kansas City Missouri she was called on by First Lady Nancy Reagan in 1981 after John Hinckley's attempted assassination of the president and stayed on as the White House astrologer in secret until being ousted in 1988 by ousted former chief of staff Donald Regan she said I was responsible for timing all press conferences most speeches the State of the Union addresses to take off and the landings of Air Force One she claimed those she claimed a bigger role in her 1990 book so what does Joan say well yeah interesting that's crazy interesting yeah people love to believe in pattern so that's but then there are patterns so maybe there's a thing you know maybe maybe there's a reason why we like to believe in patterns but this I agree with you this idea that someone's gonna be able to like when were you born Oh Tuesday 7:00 a.m. okay yeah yeah stay home tonight fuck out of here bitch you can't you don't know what the hell's going on this is guesswork but also statistically you're gonna have patterns 330 million people yep the same thing they hunt earlier yeah a hundred percent don't really notice patterns and people also fight they find a way to take what someone has said and like make it seem like oh that's he means my brother my brother my brother and I have this problem we really have to work it out that's what you say yes I think it is your brother in fact what colors is hair it's black yes what do you make everything about my brother please like have you ever been to an impasse no I have not no what do you think about that exactly what is that means they like they I don't know I guess that's what they call psychics now so you don't have like you're getting ripped off oh really they call and pass hats they're very pathetic I feel things how's that what it is you're dead you're dead family and I don't think that anyone on this planet I don't think there's a an equal ability to perceive anything I think some people way Mart acceptive some people were smarter they see patterns better they see trouble coming they see problems they see things better than other people do and I think there's feelings that you get sometimes like weird feelings then someone will call you like fuck I was just thinking about that dude that is weird like someone sends you a tax you haven't thought about them or talk to them in months and months and months and all sudden you think about them and bam attacks comes through or they're calling you I don't know what that is one time we were all texting by jean-claude van Damme in five minutes later my Netflix recommendations are full of jean-claude van de I've never washed the jean-claude Van Damme movie on Netflix in my life got a tow something treats yeah that should creep you out that should creep you I had a meeting with Netflix what about this anime thing early on and I brought this shit up and asked on Point Blank they said no maybe they just get results maybe it's like they have a cleaner and they say to this guy listen I don't give a fuck how you find out what these people are talking about but you could find out right oh yeah maybe I will say just don't tell me just do it just do it and this guy just like this thing is just listen every goddamn word you say I'm providing suggestions for things you could buy an Amazon maybe but I was thinking about psychics though is I think some people are probably better at that I bet there is moments where some people have a weird sense I just don't think it's consistent enough for anybody to pay money for it right I don't think anybody's ever demonstrated a real like provable psychic power but it doesn't mean that I don't think that that's look we can smell why can we smell what is that is some shit you can't even see and you can determine whether or not something's terrible based on it I mean you could smell rotten meat you're like oh what the fuck that's your whole body what you don't even see anything where is it how do we not know that there's other senses that we can develop like our ability to perceive good and bad people our ability to perceive whether or not someone's like a truly kind person or and with someone's sociopathic maybe there's ways to see whether or not people are compatible with your way of thinking maybe there's ways to see weird shit that people are thinking like if someone's planning and they're angry they're about to hit somebody maybe you could see it maybe you could feel it you don't even know what the fuck it is but it smells like the same way rotten meat smells like whoa I gotta get the fuck out of here there's feelings you get from certain people that is just a baby sense ID sense yeah I mean it just sucks just like early chimps were really bad at talking you know and then eventually they became people to talk for a living you think you know fucking chimps a couple fucking noises that's all they have you know they lie to each other monkeys do I was listening to this podcast afraid I forget what they were talking about but they got to this thing where it was deception with primates that they'll pretend like that there's an eagle coming so that everybody dives down then they'll steal the fruit they'll make noises they'll make noises like different animals coming to get you and they fuck with each other like they have noises that equals Eagles and they'll duck down I can they hear you fucking Eagle saw Jesus they have a word for it the word for these monkeys like there's a certain screech that they make that represents something coming down from above my miles just things take it easy on the bus I'd do the same thing it's your favorite song I gotta sing it yeah he loves I'm like for somebody after Joe Walsh there were a different band right yeah yeah this is like pre Joe Walsh Eagles Joe Walsh makes everything better John Ross is the Savage yeah victim of love anybody doesn't love that song fuck off it's a great goddamn song this is uh oh do we even we didn't introduce you properly no okay how's Justin I think we did introduce it's Mike Tyson gentlemen I'm hanging out with these guys because I'm a green beret and I got heard and you saw the show last night so I'm speaking at the shows because Sturgill on his own well let me back up I got blown up in March I was in the hospital previous year I'd like come off of a deployment had like 11 months before the second one was bit down in the down the dumps got divorced had a dude die on the first trips it was kind of like it was real rough to deal with and then was listening to these dudes quite a bit and then let into the next deployment I was there month boom almost died pretty hard teammate saved me and we had blood on the ground like I got blood on on target and then they made a hellacious movement to get me to medevac long story short I'm eating dinner in the hospital one of the first meals jamming out to these dudes and I was like mom Easter Simpson and then she tried to get ahold of um SOCOM eventually did and he came hung out for like two hours I made my friend now general bud wait like 15 minutes so that we could finish talking about what you're talking about which when you're when you're an enlisted dude you don't make generals wait but I was on a lot of ketamine so it's sweet but uh then startled had I was gonna had it on his own accord to like donate to the foundation so this little tour going on that coincides with the actual album release is donating to the Special Forces foundation so that helps gold star families which are the families that remain of remained of the friends that got killed on this trip so there were four Green Berets into yo D techs and so that money's going to them and that's that's what I care about I don't like I'm alive I don't have any legs below my knees for those I can't well I can't see my legs on the video anyway but and I know how my testicles either so that's a different set of challenges but I don't care about getting taken care of other than the normal army processes but I want them to get taken care of from the foundation so I'm grateful to have these guys as friends now they're awesome they're amazing musicians but amazing people and then I'm grateful to be here and just to push that out and so people are coming to the shows all that money goes to the the foundation and then people can go on the foundation's website which is Special Forces foundation.org and yeah I appreciate it that's fuckin awesome man yeah it's really really really cool that's really cool that you're doing this and and thank you for coming here and telling everybody is you know it's is um it's a great way to it's a great way to help out and and your music you know to connect it to that I think that's it's just a fucking incredible thing it's really cool you know when you send me the text messages telling me that you were going to the hospital you know it's very touching that's it was like yeah yeah you were you know you could tell you're seriously moved by this and you know for someone like you who truly understands the consequences war like the physical consequences in a way that none of us will understand you know it's it's very not just it's brave of you to talk about this but it's also it's so so valuable so valuable for everybody that that hasn't served to understand what it really is so thank you for that well I always say I really like combat because there was in a lot of it relatively speaking bunch of guys have been in way more combat bunch of people treated more casualties I'm a medic but I was in a fair amount almost got killed on the first trip of good handful times and then so just don't like the war aspect when you see your friends get killed and you're stuck in a hospital bed on top of all this stuff that's you know I didn't shit for a week I piss blood for a week I've had tons of nights of excruciating pain it's the life of an amputee or they're guys that are worse than me so I'm just grateful for having what I have and yeah that's the beginning of it like especially on ketamine when you're going through all that and you're just like I was telling like the people that took the trash out in the room like hey I'm grateful for you brother like right on brother what is uh what is ketamine like after a catastrophic injury like that does it relieve the pain does it just put you in another dimension so ketamine is a an MDS sucker right yeah just and ketamine is a NMDA antagonist in the brain so it essentially is a dissociative so the way that it feels because we learned this in class as a medic and everything but the way that it feels is kind of it takes your perspective and it's like Shh it always felt like a whirlwind when if I was getting of it but things it's like you're starting to get your vision masked and your present you're still there but you're dipping into like subconscious because you're still conscious because unconscious would mean that you're like you pass out and you cannot have a gag reflex depending on how unconscious you are so ketamine I would close my eyes and immediately trip the most insane ballsy you could imagine and open up and I'd be back in the room and I'd be like what the fuck oh and then a friend of mine when I left my first rotation he was an Air Force CCT that got blown up in the same village I had a few casualties in he stepped an ID he's an above-the-knee some missing fingers but when he was on ketamine when he was awake and looking around he'd see the walls on fire and then there'd be like women like white pale skin in the corners peeling the skin off their back and he was like a wake and I was like Judith yeah like whatever I don't know it must be like someone's psychology when they go in like set and setting type thing but I was in it when I got a lot of ketamine my legs are bawling off I'm getting worked on I'm telling dudes how to treat me I cut my own shirt off and then I get the ketamine and I'm like in and out and I see these visions back and forth and like I was convinced I was there are two distinct moments I was like I'm not gonna make it and had that conversation so and what's surreal about this right here is that you were talking to him on this show and you guys talked about combat medics and you were like I and I just singing key and I was like right on they're talking about me and and then I got all kinds of jacked up makes you appreciate makes you appreciate life and I've gone through a huge development last year through depression and then this year after this blast of like being grateful and like int do an introspection and communicating and having empathy for other people and being compassionate human which general mattis has told us a group of us on the way back from my first trip it's like don't let this experience of or make you more hateful human being because people haven't experienced it let it allow yourself to go through post-traumatic growth and become a better human being and treat other people like you want to be treated in tree and I would add on to that which came from Tim Ferriss treat yourself the way you treat other people - that's not a side of Madison you ever hear in the press huh I suppose not that's what I think that would be very valuable for people didn't know that he thinks that way that's a it's a very powerful way to view this inevitable you know inevitable consequences of war that that started scraping me off the bottom to focus on that after that trip yeah that ketamine shed is a weird one because a lot of people do it recreationally and apparently they they blast off and go into other dimensions and shit and they go in a k-hole something I never did sorry I knew it dude who died from it he was really into it it's doing a lot well what happened men don't like an infection he I know he he probably was doing about a bunch of other things as well but he was getting treated for ketamine for addiction and then he wound up time you can dose the shit out of ketamine yeah you didn't it doesn't kill you you can give a kid 300 Meg's of it and they will fucking trip balls but they are going to they're not going to die like the opposite of all the other drugs I think he was doing other shit too yeah I think the ketamine was just something he was treated for I think he was doing a bunch of speed and stuff too which it's ketamine was originally like isn't a cat tranquilizer or something like that they give it to my wife's best friend's a veterinarian she definitely was like jacket animals with ketamine on the road it's it's increasing now and like civilian hospitals was started as like a veterinarian drug which I mean it works great and you can combine it with some other stuff do you know what John Lilly is no John John Lilly was this scientist that he was a pioneer in interspecies communication did also work with dolphins and he was also a big acid freak and he would like to take he would take acid and try to communicate with dolphins he didn't allegedly give dolphins acid he was a part of his long-standing program try to get dolphins to talk to him but one of the things he invented was they're not a movie about this there is altered states no way altered states based a lot on John Lilly because he invented the sensor sensory deprivation to give the Dolphins ass of the movie no because it just was loosely based on him because in the movie the guy experiments with a bunch of different types of sensory deprivation tanks and everybody knew that this guy he was a legitimate doctor a brilliant guy but he was also a ketamine freak and one thing he would do is like you take intramuscular ketamine and then get into the sensory deprivation tank yeah that's a double whammy sweet yeah a double whammy so is that stuff difficult to get off of or do you have to worry about that is there like a withdrawal symptom the issue would be with the pain like when you have something that's controlling some sort of level of pain and then coming off of that you usually will wean off of it but they're not a physical addiction issue you know I should know the answer that definitively but as a medic yeah but uh I haven't heard of anything that works card to come off of they had you on other stuff way harder to come off oh yeah I was on methadone and Sturgill French shooter and Duff McKagan came to the hospital and Duff was like methadone is worse than heroin because gene our guys were rocking it the 80s but that was like I mean one one week I dropped down tawny MiG's instead of the ten and it was like being a junkie like for nine hours I just like rubbing my legs like whoa because they're just lit up with nerve pain it feels like there's daggers in your leg or some sort of electrocution and you look like on a movie with like it someone cracked out or something I was just like rubbing my shit we used to see these guys that would come into the pool hall when I used to play pool in White Plains they would come in there was a methadone clinic down the street and they were all her heroin people and my friend Johnny B would call the methadone Ian's because they would come in they all had like this is like sort of like dull shuffle to them all slowed down and I can never understand it it was like I was like is this like a culturally like did someone agree did we make some sort of agreement like this drugs okay this is it's got you know it's got some some stamp of approval so we're accepting that they have to get methadone every day but they can't get heroin anymore why don't we just give them heroin like is how much different is the methadone is the methadone get them high let's synthesize so it's easier to control but does it get them high I didn't have any of while no it's just fighting off the physiology yeah so it just fights the physiology they're not you know you'll never get high low for first let's I'm spiked early houghton narcotic yeah for like the other the adverse effects but don't people have like the best effects with like ibogaine and things like that when it comes to opiates for getting kicking opiates yeah I mean if you want to go through that I would say you know I would probably be your best but it for a for a quick solution if that's what you mean leave the method don't like it is actually bad for you isn't it yes it fuck's yours I didn't sleep I don't have deep sleep for four months and those I'd go to a get in bed at 9:00 not fall asleep till 3:00 in the morning that fucks with everything - yeah it's a pretty shitty year damn and how long does it take you to get you off of the methadone I mean once you're off of it there doctors were saying that it stays in your adipose tissue which is your fat for like two or three weeks because I'd have random nights when I was off of it and just get lit up with nerve pain and like I'm getting hit with a hammer and my toes so probably for two they're probably like six weeks of weaning that and then I went another drug lyrica I mean for you it had to fit me because you were there at Walter Reed the whole time you had to feel frustrated but for somebody like my first time I came to see you it was only what I'm about a month after the blast at most so you he was still in a lot of makes more pain than I could even comprehend somebody being in you know from their pain feel how many how many surgeries on each leg it's close to 30 surgeries total which yeah there's a lot there's a stabilizing we're back to yeah before they taken I mean you you describe just man just like how can anybody you know and then he was still as he said the first time we met he was highest giraffe balls on Academy but like I was I was profoundly impressed by even then like how clear-headed and articulate and I was obviously those guys are so brilliant you know I mean like you just through the fog and awareness of everything going on in the room despite the faint the pain he was trying to pretend like he wasn't in I just and then that place is full of guys like him and everything then when I went back it's like all new faces you know these people but then when I went back the second time I went to see him was there a couple days and it was like just in a matter of short time it was leaps and bounds and you're using the gym on one leg like fucking busting out 20 pull-ups and everything you know just kind of like there's got to be something we can anything you can do to help in whatever way and these guys since I've known him I've never once ever heard him asked for anything his only concerns were like for the families of the guys that that didn't make it you know so it's just like really were around an album release if I'm gonna have a bunch of attention on me I thought it would be a good opportunity to put attention on what other people can do to help these guys families because they're you know the sacrifices is especially sitting in these rooms and looking at these dudes man I can't even you can't you know what do you what do you get what do you call that yeah well I want to help so after the show let's figure out what we can do to jump in and I wanna I want to help so I'll help with the podcast help with some comedy shows maybe two just whatever we could do I think that I'm you know it's listen I'm blown away by all this as much as I think all these people are listening and watching this is um it's beautiful that you're doing this man and I think that you know I mean it's inspiring me to do something I think it's probably inspiring a bunch of other people and that's that's those things that people talk about one thing that you might experience are here in life that sort of changes your worldview and moves you in a better direction this is this could be one of those things you know well you're a good man I thought well I'm not thank fucking anything man he's so I'm just a dude I said oh you're just an awesome dude all you guys it's cool I'm very happy that you're bringing awareness to this I'm real happy that you do on that makes me feel great listen you know like Justin said the war side of it is the the tragedy I guess so it's not like you know right or left it's just like this is the reality of it and people are making these sacrifices for you and when they come home what do we do for them you know it's a hard thought for people to accept that war is inevitable it's a hard thought and it doesn't seem like it's inevitable because it's not inevitable in this room I mean if we were the last people on earth and there was a bunch of food and places sleep I think we'd probably not kill each other I probably wouldn't go to war right it's like what is the number where you go to war is it a million is a two million is it separated by oceans is it just mountains or boundaries but the fact that no one thinks that war can be solved like no no one that I know thinks that in our lifetime there'll be no war there's never been a period where someone on earth that's human hasn't been going to war with each other it's a horrible truth of being a person and nobody nobody knows it the way you do so for you to come on and tell your story the way you just did I appreciate the fuck out of that man and I would just want people if if they hear that and it moves them it's more of like I just be grateful on a regular basis for what for anything yeah I mean Steven Pinker was on your show I ended up face time with him as a result of all this but like he has that book about basically the enlightenment worked and we still have war and then there are people still fighting it but overall the world is continuing to improve and like steadily getting better and fewer people are dying from genocide or war but it still exists so I'd want the respect for war if someone is wanting to go to war you know if someone is gonna be a commander-in-chief and that's it that's a heavy thing to like toss back and forth yes it means that I may never have kids because I don't have my balls you know like like that you there's sacrifice like I and I'm the one that lived and I didn't have any kids but like my friends have four girls my other my other friend has three kids so like one year if you're gonna move the chest piece to war then we need to understand the implications of what that means and try to do everything in political power in state strategy to avoid overt war because it yeah especially nasty of near-peer I mean that's Russia Russia nuclear war would be the worst thing you know it's so much world war three mutually assured destruction is a strangest thing on earth that we all have enough weapons pointed each other to literally nuke every fucking man woman and child off the face the earth many times over and that's what keeps us from using them but yet we still have them and we still haven't pointed each other I mean remember when you were kids and we were worried about Russia do you remember that shit yeah I mauled my guys and I'm worried about people walking in the target with a suicide vest yeah yeah ones that coming right yeah you did all of it because Europe's been dealing with that shit for decades you know we really haven't tasted that yet I going on a widespread habitual scale so it means a lot of people are working very hard to make sure we don't yes like how how does anybody ever fix that how did how does any country how does civilization as a whole ever fix that I don't think you really can cuz it's a it's an idea it's like you have to change somebody's mind I was gonna say mushrooms but the Vitamix took mushrooms I solutions the Vikings love taking mushrooms and fucking people up ketamine in isolation tanks we were pretty much put everybody in a good place yeah it's weird it's just it's the I mean most people most of the time are never not thinking about killing somebody but we know that there's a just inevitable part of being human that groups are people gonna get together and fuck up other groups of people yeah it's always been a part of us it's one of the strangest things about human beings it's truly strange because the consequences are so awful and yet it's inevitable I had to make that decision this year I found out I'm not a psychopath it was very reassuring yeah you told me about that story yeah yeah that was I don't know to be honest I'll tell the story but uh before I forget the thought it was everything else associated with what happened after that I found more impactful and yeah and the stuff that lasted or stays with you it wasn't what actually happened it was seeing the aftermath and like the system and how it all yeah pans out um yeah we had a we had two home invasions within 36 hours I guess the first time the guy came in in middle night about 2:30 3:00 a.m. and our back door add the sensor aren't made a very signature noise and if you live in your house you know the noises in your house and it's for whatever reason it just woke me up from a dead sleep and I knew what I heard and there only thing that would make that noise so I kind of sneaked my way out the hall and down to the top of the stairs and when I hit the top of the stairs I heard the dog growl and the door closed back so I knew that was somebody leaving we have a huge fucking dog um basically useless but he did growl and he made a very primitive noise I was proud of him and the guy didn't come in because of that and I still went out there to kind of swept the ground floor then he was gone I didn't want to freak my wife out so I waited til the morning a teller and then we called police of course one of the neighbors got it on like a ring cam in the back alley the guy leaving and going down the street so I had a very clear view of him and for whatever reason my wife and the kids they had to go on down to where we actually live I was working that week in Nashville probably mixing a record or something so I just stayed behind and as a result of me being home alone that day I was cleaning and working on a firearm I'd recently purchased and assembled and so went to bed that night locked everything up and you know because they weren't home I put the gun on the floor on a padded case next to the bed so I'm letting the next morning it's like 7:15 a.m. like sun-shining neighbor is going to work and I hear the back door open again and I was like this can't you know what the fuck's that the maid who would be here that early and I guess out of paranoia or whatever reason I grabbed that gun and just went to the top of the stairs to look I still think it's the maid and when I hit the top of stairs and looked down staircase same guy same clothes just standing in my living room rolling the cord up on my headphones and I was saying alright I was almost impressed one that he came back was just like a complete was happening at this time you know so I started down the stairs on him very quietly and I got about halfway down by the time he like turned and saw me and I was looking through his fucking head through a red dot like a videogame I'll never forget that image this guy like probably thinking he's about to die and the back door was thankfully still open the only thing I said to him was what are we doing here man and I hit him with a strobe which kind of like probably to his brain was he thought was the gun going off because he kind of liked seizure and then I sawed the adrenaline spike and he turned went out the back door and jumped clean off my fucking porch like never hit a single step and ran at the back gate he had latched it and I saw this on the video later when he came in he shut the back gate back so he hit that back gate on a dead rant on a dead run and just like blew it the hell latches and wood splinters flying it like took off down the alley and I was I'm still I was standing on my porch with the fucking you know yeah looking like a jackass like of a neighbor's literally walking out of the house going work and shit I'm just like okay that happened and then so then the next thing there's like eight police officers in my living room all they wanted to see was my gun and every single one of them asked me why I didn't shoot the guy and which was I found very interesting as a well I mean and I thought about it finally you would one when I'm down going down the stairs you would not believe how much shit can go through your head in like four seconds like I had this whole conversation with myself as to like wife and kids aren't here you know this guy doesn't even know I'm here yet I'm holding a fucking assault rifle and he's not a threat to me but if I put one through his dome which I have every legal right to do right now there's gonna be News vans on my lawn this is gonna be on your fucking Wikipedia page today you know really all of that I'm just like this guy is not a threat yeah and thankfully he chose to go out the door with all those it was just so weird they were all like why didn't you shoot him I was like and I said that and they just kind of looked at me and I was like by that you know literally by the time we engage man two seconds later he's running out the doors where I might shoot him in the back and then you put me in prison and they were like ah fuck man twice in a week you've been finally to figure something out finger time and who wants to take that chance oh yeah yeah with a life in prison or not yeah roll the dice I mean if he did turn to ran at me we'd probably be having a different conversation yes but he didn't know or if he reached for a gun anything yeah which he didn't yeah was he a junkie no no he's like 25 honestly I saw his whole fucking life on his face you know I mean it just like got probably hard times just a masked punk kid probably like I was I didn't do any shit like that when I was his age but no his toxicology came back clean he had like one prior for possession just hard times desperate yeah so I got subpoenaed because I was the only one that actually met him and I go to the court case and you know it was very interesting and telling experience for him because I've never really been to anything like that and he was one of maybe eight or nine other people on the docket that they all assigned the same public defender who literally shows up 15 minutes before they start the day to familiarize himself with every single case and you just saw this factory like these young underprivileged black males just getting pumped into the system the DEA came over she was just like thanks for being here yada yada and you know there was unluckily for him he broke in like 13 other houses then they had him on tape and a lot of things so we had 13 or 14 aggravated burglary charges which is pretty fucking heavy you know it's a every one of those Class B so he was looking at 12 to 15 I think he sang like a bird pleaded down got six and then if he does a successful rehabilitation program and prison he could be out in two and it's usually yada-yada and I just realized like wow they're just just throwing this kid's life away because he you know granted he came into some people's houses and he probably and he almost got fucking killed and they called him the next night like three streets over in the act doing the same thing but he had no priors he wasn't on drugs it was just like no direction probably no discipline no guidance no heroes and I struggled with that I was like man who's got to be like what if I gave him a job it depends entirely on who he is right which I never got the chance to sit down and find that bond that I never got to talk to him faced it might turn out he was just some punk fucking kid I'd be like good luck man you know like it might turn out awesome it might turn out terrible it's depending upon the person but there's so many people in this country that are set up to fail so their circumstances their life their environment the way what they're surrounded by all day long they're set up to fail and I've always said that if we really cared I mean if someone really have this plan that we always sort of impart we put X amount of money toward this and Y amount of money towards that but if we wanted to make this country we want to really make it stronger you would want less losers so how do you get less losers you prevent them from ever becoming losers but you help them when you're kids during the developmental period you mean spend more money on education spend more money on cleaning up impoverished neighborhoods and crime-ridden neighborhoods they it's not impossible it's not like fucking breathing on the Sun like it can be done like neighborhoods can get better they get better right but the idea that there's so little time and effort put into fixing those parts of the of our own country I mean we have the most resources we have this fucking spectacular country filled with amazing people and some of them just don't get a chance because they're stuck in a rut from the moment they come out of their mother's body they're stuck in this rut you've been assigned your lot you got fucked you got a bad roll the dice and that's a lot of countries man yeah a few countries were like anybody can just put the fucking boots down and make something happen like one of the few lot of claims you know Japan you pretty much know of a second or third grade what your Lots gonna be by your test scores already you know if you're gonna be working class or if you wanna university this country we applauded when you started out poor right we love it like people who start out poor and then become successful that's like our favorite shit this is right like what do we what is this country like more than a success story you know like he started out eating bread and oh yeah oh yeah his money to barely get to school and barely get home but he keeps showing up every day everybody once hear that story that's the fucking story rocky heart yeah bro how many shows you guys doing we're doing six of these just as a conversation starter and within the real tour will be oh I should probably announce that they told me too while we're here we're gonna do a us full us to her starting mid or late February and with myself and a young man named Tyler Childers opening I love that dude yeah we do - big fan of that the arm so that's happening next year and those will also tie into a fund raising Ticketmaster and they EG and everybody participating that's gonna I was listening to his purgatory album on the way over here were you yeah and miles and I both fucked around in the room when that got made it's great shit miles played drums on it's really good most records right yeah I just stood in the control room and pretended to do stuff I could confirm that yeah that's uh so when you do a show like The Troubadour is it like knock the rust off let's fucking well definitely we haven't played in over a year right and we're going back and like working up material we literally haven't played since we recorded it two and a half years ago and just to get we don't really rehearse we just sort of knock the rust off it takes us about three or four shows to feel like we even know what the fuck's happening so you guys don't get together before you know Chuck and Bob both live in Detroit miles an hour at Tennessee yeah we oh we hadn't seen these guys since October we we get a lot done at soundcheck yeah basically but you're all still active as musicians even when you're not together touring I don't know what they do and I am I'm a freelancer in Detroit so when you say freelancer like what is that involved like like what he was saying if someone needs yeah I've been in the area for like 25 years so I play with a lot of bands a lot of friends who's a big group of people Detroit's a great city for musicians so you can stay busy you know if you know the right people and you're not a dick so dude just I mean I have zero musical talent or never it never pursued any of it so I love you music it's one of my favorite things to hear stories about people because I I just loved like the idea of you going out and and you know hey we need a badass bass player and then you send you over to this place and that like a fuckin gun for hire like to me as like a kid growing up in Newton Massachusetts used to always listen to music I never thought about doing it so when I see people that do do it it's like wow that guy is making a living making music it's one of the to me one of the coolest forms of art because everybody gets inspired by almost everybody loves it and almost nobody knows how to do it you can always tell the people who do it better than others to me yes there's levels to it man yeah I mean there's there's so big Susanne Santo and I were talking about Gary Clark jr. last night like this guy he's got some weird thing going on with his fucking guitar like it's it's a Gary Clark jr. you know I mean like I said he puts out he has a certain sound that's like you could hear it like I hear a new song oh that's Gary Clark jr. song like by his guitar sound yeah there's like something to the way he's got like this he he did a cover of Midnight Rider with Suzanne and honey honey at this like little hole-in-the-wall place in downtown LA it was like maybe maybe a hundred people in the room tiny ass little crowded like midnight on Tuesday night and I mean maybe I'm exaggerating maybe there's 300 people but it was fucking small shit and he did his Gary Clark jr. version of Midnight Rider fuck it was amazing it was amazing it's like there's there's like a guy like him he could pick up any guitar yeah and plug it in any air beneath it's still gonna sound like him yeah yeah yeah I mean I don't know that but I believe it I don't know shit about playing the guitar but that makes sense to me it was the yeah he's got a thing yeah I think it's awesome that a guitar driven act is headlining huge rooms - yeah theaters and they played they played the Hollywood Bowl yeah that's amazing you know he's undeniable you just gotta get the fuck out of the way you know he's undeniable yeah I mean that kind of music I never I've never met any well we played a festival once he was at and I just saw him walking across the grass backstage I was like that's cool motherfucker right there he's nicest guy ever love him he's so nice he's a really really cool guy does any of your family play music or do well my oldest daughter does yeah but no one in my like my mom's side or my down side like no one in that part of the family played music but everybody loves it I think it's it's there's some kind of music in everybody you can you can repeat rhythms back for sure and then yeah that counts conjunction junction and what function you're a musician everybody everybody has music in their life I mean everybody it people don't like the only person I know doesn't like music he might have changed his stance on his Doug Stanhope oh god I fucking hate music hate songs but I don't know if that's true or he's just working on a bit I mean it's hard to tell but he's the only guy no it's even espoused those ideas that he doesn't like music do you ever do that do you have conversations with people and they don't know you're actually working on material no because if I'm saying it I probably really do mean it right you know or I'm just trying to be funny and then it turns out like oh I could say this on stage but it's never like hey I'm gonna work out my I hop joke on Sturgill today well waffle houses so no that was a better choice Waffle House is synonymous with fucking knife fights and brawls and Virgil Simpson 24-hour food actually I used to work at IHOP my loyalty's go back you know sing for Waffle House no one's totally relaxed at a Waffle House at 2:00 in the morning fuck no no some of those interesting people who ever met my life were in the wee hours of the night in a Waffle House oh for sure yeah for sure but you got to take a risk well yeah you're taking the risk of that delicious ass food delicious oh man did you take those big slabs of butter and laughter the shit out of that waffle I just don't even worry about your cholesterol count just pour that fuckin syrup on it gives a fuck about calories tonight we live and you cut out that ham steak and eggs with that fucking waffle with thick like a half an inch of butter and these guys we do the shortstop's themself sometimes two three more than him and some of the others younger do they go in hard and brave me or like what the chili with the family well now that was uh who did that Dalton Dalton yeah don't shout out the dog was dalton yeah it was he born before or after Roadhouse that's really after but he'd never seen the movie we started calling him Roadhouse or double douche and I finally had the see it he's like man this shit was fucking wack I was like you know nothing she's got the wrong content she's dare to talk bad about Patrick Swayze that's an all-time classic terrible movie but in the best way like you get super excited it's exotic Keith Langley homoerotic looking back now I mean that whole fight scene with him in the guys I got I used to fuck guys like you in prison what was going on there yeah I think that's just bad writing that's off God talking about Swayze so handsome everything with him was homoerotic right because he's beautiful beautiful guy man yeah he was a he was literally a ballet dance yeah he moved like one yeah when he's like the karate expert and shit like you said just a right amount of muscular it down brother that too man this is one of the worst fights in SoCal bad this is like in terms of movement ha dude the speed of his techniques the impact of these strikes look at this yeah boom boom oh the double headbutt move oh the bottle over the head there he is oh my goodness Sam Elliot we've actually seen a guy take a bottle to the head so I can test for a fact that you can still fight after taking a giant full unopened bottle Raghu's to the head oh fuck but only in a Mexican discotheque in McAllen Texas after a Dwight young he had a big white cowboy hat on he looked like a bodybuilder and he had two ladies at the table and he was flossing hard and I think he turned around in like this fit a little game at somebody else's woman and miles away oh yeah I'll be back up that fucking story there's the first real tour we ever did we finally got a booking agent and we went out we did two weeks opening for Dwight Yoakam which was fucking awesome like felt like an actual huge break you know I mean we're like went from playing dive bar shit holes to 12 drunks to like standing in front of 4 or 5 thousand people so Texans Texans with that and we were down in farore Texas with pH a double R which is right on the border and we went down did the gig and it was fucking amazing because it was in this giant auditorium and they had these long tables like you would have in like a school cafeteria but they were just they were rows of them as far back as I could see and when they had it looked like it might as well been 1955 man and we were playing the hayride or some chicks it was those white cowboy hats just an ocean a white cowboy hats whites and Hispanics and like everybody was exceeded and sort of like turned sideways and joined the show is a very civil little vibe and then after the show the promoters these guys were like you guys want to go to a club you know I was like not really but you know the younger guys might have there was basically babysitting you assholes at fucking kids in our so they round us up and take us to this fucking discotheque and we're the only green goes in this place man and it was like there was some serious Mochis boat being thrown around it was a little a little threatening and the guy starts telling it they get on the mic with a DJ and they're telling everybody that weird Dwight Yoakam x'b and I realize like oh shit this guy or a promotion tool you know I mean to make his club look cool we don't play for Dwight Yoakam but they said it like 50 fuckin times you know and finally we're just kind of sitting in the corner not speaking in mine our own business so we don't die and miles and I were sitting at a table and some chairs and all sudden it's just liquid and bro conglaturation and i kind of turned around to see this guy sort of stumble and the dew is still standing there holding the bottleneck and it was like he had these big unopened bottles of Grey Goose like big-ass Grey Goose bottles on ice and the dude just came up to his table behind and like fucking next one it took it to the dome whoo and the guy kind of kind of stutter step he turn around he took his cowboy hat off and he went out I'm gonna beat the fuck out of both of them when I told Maas Lee I think this is where we leave everybody laughing yeah it just cleared the whole place out whoa I couldn't believe it I thought like would kill somebody it depends on where you hit him and how you hit him how hard you hit him you could definitely kill somebody with a bottle though right I mean it certainly happened I was reading some horrible story about a 13 year old kid who got sucker punched and wound up dying yeah I mean you get you could kill somebody accidentally even if you didn't mean to you hit somebody they fall they hit their head they die it happens all the time like the dead at the hockey game oh that was horrible man this kid would watch that happen o-over nothing over a hockey / kids hockey yeah man people get real weird Bob's being awfully quiet I just want you know he's fucking Bobby's bob was so high last night you could say anything this is probably Bob just was hitting that joint so hard I didn't have anywhere to put put it down you know I was playing so I thought you're gonna come over and take it the path wasn't quite as clear as I thought it might be yeah I noticed that right when we walked down Justin introduced and it was like where do I walk to get to the name was it what was the instrument that was facing the crowd like to your left well up there well the keyboard there's a Hammond b3 and then on top of that was a clever net and what was this one that was face like it was facing you but the back of it was to the crowd was all exposed wiring a cell b3 oh yeah yeah that's trip to look back into the gears Bob's like a gearhead kind of a reverse engineering genius and we only use like primitive audio gear and I'm pretty sure now I've known him for since like 2011 I'm convinced he only does ik e buy shit he knows a little break so he can fix it that's it right there yeah there's a picture from my Instagram yeah it looks cool I mean it's supposed to have a wood back but it looks cool looks cool as fuck there man but it's it it's it's very revealing like there's a lot going on in there you can surf from - I've seen him do it on top of it you mean oh yeah Saturday night Saturday looked over in Bob's fucking plan Teen Wolf are organized all right absolute joy at the same time when I saw that symbol fall off and I looked up like what was going on and Bobby was standing on his Oregon oh why not why not hey man fucking do whatever you want just keep doing what you're doing do whatever the fuck you want if you guys can keep doing what you did last night I love it I'm in it's only going up from there really you know that was the first one so we were we were very like critical and unhappy but it was fun as fuck man it was fun as fuck here we go no that's when he did on SNL oh there it is boom we uh it was the first time we played that record last night mm-hmm you know damn that's some good shit right there man I was a lot of adrenaline man as we're all literally everybody made all the horns with us but everybody in the band you know you hear as a kid you dream about that shit right there from the time you didn't think about playing music you know I mean yeah be one out rockin SNL so before the second song there we go yeah we were backstage and I just told everybody like you know this is most likely the only time we may ever get to fucking do this so don't leave anything out there you know yeah somebody wrote a great article about it saying that a musical artist named Sturgill Simpson just snuck in a song about the illegal heroin trade on SNL yeah yeah yeah that happens it wasn't like I didn't think about it that way we just knew it should be fun to play with yeah it is kind of a I mean that's good yeah I mean that's what it's about do you remember you ever see that video of Geraldo Rivera got walking through the poppy fields where the military was guarding the poppy fields no yeah the military was guarding the poppy fields because in order to get information from the people that lived there you had to get them on your side so the way to get them on their side was to protect their heroin production so got the United States military walking through these poppy fields with her all de Rivera interviewing them and they're just explain suspect it's the craziest thing you've ever seen your life feel like what this is a movie mm-hmm this is not real this is a movie Geraldo Rivera's interviewing soldiers and the soldiers United States soldiers fucking machine guns out are guarding poppy fields you know like what wait a minute they're guarding heroin what where Afghanistan it's a fucking trip if we play it we have an issue right if we play it how does it work we'll get kicked out towards it's not as easy to find it why would you get really I mean I'm just looking and it's hard to find now we've played it on the podcast many times they might be trying to wash it from the internet Wow they know dude it's a trip yeah it's around the Rivera interviewing this guy yes old clip it here it is so raw we don't all play the volume because otherwise we'll get kicked off of youtube but when we're watching this Geraldo Rivera is interviewing these soldiers who are talking about how they have to guard these poppy fields so they guard these poppy fields so that they can get information on the Taliban and that these these guys who are the farmers would be on their side you have to see it if to see the whole thing it's a long video that plays out what was it was the Taliban would they burn it down or do they just control the money from it so good question I don't know are you protecting the heroin or these farmers like means of income that's a good way yeah I think it's the farmers needs politically I guess you're gonna raise important question everything's about money it sounds about right was it the Taliban anti-heroin do we know that I don't know a heroin has ramped up since since this time period heroin use well from that time period of that video yeah yeah it just keeps ramping up right yeah ramped up in Vietnam free or - yeah what a coincidence crazy there's no way that the United States government back then the 60s when no one was accountable would ever be involved in heroin trade I admit it right he's two elder gentlemen in my life randomly in bars who claim to fly airplanes for the CIA in Vietnam I just assumed they were both full completely full of shit who knows did you ever see that see a CIA drug plane that crashed in Mexico with like a ton of cocaine on it they ran out of gas and they would let him land in Mexico to refuel because they knew what they were doing yes guys like you know there's way too much weight and they crashed and it's the craziest fucking series of images they look at this plane all fucked up strewn across the field but all the hair or the cocaine is intact it's all stuffed into this airplane wow that's what they recovered often this but there's there's pictures of the wreckage oh you can got to see the wreckage in the background there yeah so in the wreckage like as these planes crashed it just plumb full of cocaine ah that's a thousand pounds man that's so heavy oh no one is not a cure but it is all memes that can't be right 400 straight a lot edge did you ever see that uh that Tom Cruise going to be about Barry seal yes it's all about that it's all about a few Cowboys rogue CIA agents that decided tried biting Kalin's in that movie for like five minutes and he steals the whole fucking thing well who's he places his wife's younger brother oh yeah they're like little degenerate dick shit yeah I he was awesome he's a great he's a funny dude that's a lot like the bluegrass conspiracy you know about that what's with that bluegrass there was basically it was a Lexington Kentucky police officer oh man it was all the way up delivers the governor's office yeah and it was it was deep in Kentucky politics for years and years and years and he he was he was flying a plane little prop playing with weed and like money millions of dollars in cocaine he crashed in Knoxville Tennessee and they found on everything they didn't know as a police officer until he died and he was like he jumps out of the plane with a parachute with the coke strapped to him the way the fuck to shoot a hootchie loafers they found him on the ground with this chute half open I'm just like yeah like a powder coke yeah and a bear also ate all the cocaine and died right a big strawberry shortcake just laying there in a horse farm field you know there's pictures of all well not all how much coke does it take to kill a bear it says how much he ate I don't know if top my head oh poor thing I think they have it stuffed in Lexington that's a really good book you should read that book bluegrass conspiracy again wanted the true story but it small state level corruption at the utmost level and there's Kabira story the legendary cocaine bear of Kentucky I said Wow is that the bear they mounted him Wow that's inside his Nexus cocaine bear that's like a gold chain looks like he's a rapper look he's got his hat sideways he's gonna fuckin sign rise next his cocaine bear it's all gold no bluegrass I gotta redo that I definitely had heard about the bear eating the coke the Barry seals one is a terrible one because the reason why they found out about is because these two kids found the coke drop they found the coke and they wound up murdering these two kids when they went to achieve the coke and they put their bodies on the railroad tracks and they told the parents that the kids got high and fell asleep on the where the railroad tracks but the parents did an independent autopsy and they found stab wounds and the kids you know it's really fucked up also we'll give that away I've seen that when like transients or bums get come in on you know it's always a part of art we would have to find like young kids and shit playing hop or you know doing the gutter rat lifestyle and $1,000 fucking North Face parkas and shit usually you doing man you're gonna die right they like bums would come in on the trains and this didn't happen our yarders over the north guard this guy he thought they were done with the movement you know you took 5700 foot steel with fucking 45,000 horsepower on the front of it like when it starts moving it's very sudden and hard so you just go to stand up all that thing all of a sudden when it starts rolling and then you you lose your footing and you fall down the tracks from the cars but when you get run over by a train it's not bloody and messy because they especially if it's been on the mainline it's rolling really hard and hot you put a limb on a track or a body or a corpse all that weight and friction and heat when it goes over it just cuts it like butter and Carter Rises everything like pisses you off like sausage so we find pieces not a mess just pieces oh my god unless you hit a fucking cow or something stand in the middle of track and going 70 miles an hour and then you just ass hold and guts hanging off the front of the train does that even slow the train down no never not at all a cow doesn't smell like it's less than a bug on your windshield whoa yeah could you imagine being in the fucking seat the driving seat I've done it have you've actually seen it operated locomotives I've never hit a cow but I've definitely driven a train what did was the biggest thing you had I don't really hit anything nothing no I mean imagine though being we were switching I only operated one within the yard so I'm probably like 35 40 miles an hour tops but on the mainland when they're really rolling they're doing like 70 72 miles an hour like I said it's 50 you know a mile and a half long train with five four or five locomotives on the front of it all 30,000 horsepower each so look I mean you'd it's a bag of fucking blood man you're not even gonna but it just like do they have special fronts that are designed to hit things like that yeah it's a big giant steel plow it's designed to push ten feet of fucking snow out of the way it has to whoa yeah so like essentially like those things that semis used for deer on the the middle of but it's actually a big steel shovel with like a ax wedge and it Lo and it just kind of just hangs and it's it's about six inches off the rail itself and its whole idea is to just splatter every push anything out of the way and destroy it so you keep the train from derailing because the only thing holding those things on the rail the inner flange of a wheel set you know it's there's like a little three quarter inch lip that kind of hangs over on the inside of the rails yeah so it's all just gravity and downforce keeping that thing going so you could put like a brick technically you could take anything a piece of fucking metal or a car jack and just lay it on that thing when that train hits it at 70 miles an hour it's coming off the rail and everything behind it is still going 70 miles an hour stacking up behind it and I mean you go you don't think about every time you pull up to a crossing in the city and you see a train go by ten miles an hour and there's like 20 tankers on there full of raw chlorine you could really fuck some shit up if you knew what you were doing you know kill the whole city you derail that train we have dos we'd have to think about that and like Homeland Security would come out and we have to have courses and shit but you have so many miles of track oh yeah you make sure that nobody does anything are crews that drive that track on daily basis and and repair things and dude you freaked me out fuck training that's why I quit the job if we had watched enough of those things happen right in front of me and I was my job to clean him up and get a crane out there at a fucking cot in my office I would live at the yard for three or four days until we got everything repaired and back together and rolling but like you know two or three times where he'd be sitting out there in the middle of switching leads this happened where I being a pickup truck at night or during the daytime like with one of the guys I work with you know maybe it's a guy you're tired you're trying to get done early and you got a bunch of empty cars on the back and the dude puts the throttle down before the air goes through the system always rear of the train so you know you got this dead weight and thinks I'll fuck it I got three locomotives I can push it'll be okay until the when they designed the system 100 plus years ago nothing has changed since then it's a very primitive functional air brake system design you hook all these hoses up from the front to the back it runs air through which allows the brakes to release so then the engineer can control those brakes well if the air doesn't go all the way to the back the brakes are still on those cars so when all this horsepower pushing rolling metal hits metal that what does not want to roll it just buckles up in a teepee almost instantaneously goes off and you won't even feel it if you're thirty cars up that you're pushing shit into the dirt and it's all just piling on top of it if it's self and like I wasn't like two seconds I watched this train go from being on the track to literally digging out a 10-foot trough of earth and just just placing it and I think like every day me or one of my guys is standing right there I was like I'm gonna go write songs dude good thinking yeah yeah very good thinking it's a good job but somewhere someone is on a fucking train listening to this right freaking out they're just about to go to sleep I'll just listen to Sturgill Simpson let's go write songs brother Aarthi trying to do some bullet train is that one of you on must ideas wants to do a train that goes all the way across the country in 30 minutes or something I get from here to Vegas first and then mmm-maybe went up to Sacramento yeah and I think people would use it the Americans would use a mass transit train system they don't use the one we have really much welding sucks down here we don't slow it sucks we ride them in Europe cuz it's awesome when you come you don't ever want to get on a fucking train from DC to New York be the worst day of your life really yeah man I did it once never again I did a whole tour on the East Coast by myself by train awful experience why is it so bad self-importance lack of compassion or understanding of considerations of other space on the part of Americans Oh we'd only don't function well in crammed spaces okay that's very specific and then when I was in DC I came what what stays at what stations a big one in DC Union is the Union no that's that's a good name our station oh okay yeah you trained the train got delayed they announced this delay because of weather there's like a downed power line there's a fucking winter storms nothing you do and we travel all the time and as you do so if you travel all the time you don't get the same anxieties about travel that most people who don't travel all the time good you can I would rather ride a bus for 20 hours then go get on an hour flight in a report because that anxiety is just fucking palpable right and she's like visually we kind of like you go to this like calm weird place like when we were out in the bubble on a long tour where everybody's just sort of like not not talking at the airport or whatever it isn't you're just in your little happy zone and I'm at this fucking terminal in DC and they announced his cancellation and this place just erupts and it's like thirty people live over screaming at the Amtrak employees like it's their fault pregnant lady get pushed down in front of me like when they finally open the doors and people are like trying to get up on training straight up just knock this pregnant lady down no you know it's just like wow you go to Europe or Japan everybody rides the tram it's panic be like more people than you've ever imagined in your train car and nobody is touching one another it's like sardines yet no one is touching you there's so considerate for the space and privacy and existence of everyone around them that you feel somewhat less crowded somehow isn't it interesting culturally that they have that whereas China has very very different China yeah it's so we're easy and then you know every country has their own way of interacting it's it's so so interesting Japanese it when I'm when I've only been at Tokyo once but I was like if you told me if I didn't know about Tokyo at all and someone said hey I'm gonna take you to another planet where human beings live and there's so much like you but their city is very orderly and they have like beautiful neon signs and great architecture and they're all like there's millions of them it's one island but they're super considerate it's this weird parallel universe that's what it felt like it's like if you didn't know about the Japanese culture and then you went over there you'd be like what is happening here why is this a real place like what is going on it is about the most foreign or alien experience as it as especially as American life I was gonna tell anybody to go anywhere to feel like a mindfuck that would be the one yeah that's what you told me earlier it's kind of the place to that you can go drinking at night and go in bars and there's people passed out drunk right there on the floor on the street on the street with their cell phone and wallet nobody's gonna funny what yeah yeah where does that happen yeah it's a such a unique country and you think about the history and their contributions to the martial arts in particular just I mean the the warrior ethic of the samurai like that book Miyamoto Musashi's a book of five rings that's a great book for your life just to just to think about excellence in your life and pursuit in your life and how all things balance out all other aspects of your life like his idea of being a great samurai you had to also be created calligraphy had to be a great artist you had to be able to write poetry you had to be a balanced human being in order to fight correctly you know this fucking guy was like sixty and OH in one on one sword fights mhm and became a pacifist yeah as a leader life and that book of five rings is fuck man it's an amazing book man we got a Musashi quote at the end of the day anime film that's him yeah that's him my mom yeah just that whole the culture look what their contributions to martial arts like what they've been able to do with design alright it's a interesting place even their automobiles you know I mean they make like bulletproof cars that last forever like they were the first people to figure it out just make cars that don't break and go really fast yeah there it's a fascinating culture so what what connection did they have to the anime thing do who like who was making all that animation for you well we I had the idea for the record first and we played Fuji rock in 2017 I have a very good friend a Japanese friend who grew up in Kentucky on exchange program with with my wife and he later moved back to Tokyo for college came a radio DJ named Shunsuke oh yeah and he did the radio thing for a while then he got into voice narration for Marvel over there he's just a good dude and we were talking I went over for a couple weeks before we played Fuji Rock to hang out with him and my buddies and get some time on the ground and when the record was recorded the month before I was like man it'd be really cool to do some animated videos for this out if it's like 1 or 2 and we were we were sitting around his place watching a lot of old animation and anime films and the textures and the color and everything is just stuff you don't really see anymore and I was just thinking about like some of my favorite cartoons from that especially the older stuff the seventies and eighties that came from that world so he we decided to start taking meetings with producers just to get an idea like what would this cost how long how long will it take is it even possible would they do it and just kind of trial and error for a while we finally had a meeting with a guy named Hiroki who was very understated in the meeting sold himself short you know just like a mid 50s guy on a track suit but we come to find out a week later he's the fucking man and like all his buddies are the man too and those guys are all so used to working under not her so restrictions but if they take a project on its from a big studio the story is already dictated the parameters are dictated like basically they have to stay within someone else's lane with their vision and so one of the first he asked me this what what kind of animation I was interested in so I named off some of the references of the things that I loved was looking to sort of get in terms of aesthetic and texture and he just went straight to the guys that made those things because they were drinking buddies with all of them and June pay me Sasaki especially was the one director who I think shun translated all the lyrics for them because I wanted them to know one what the record was about and so they could gauge interest and he just sort of said at dinner one night he's like you're talking about the same things that I deal with as an artist he's like a you know I feel like this is this could be me talking we deal with the same things in terms of dealing with business and commerce versus art so he just sort of reacted passionately to the music and he just said I want to do the whole record he's like this is kind of a dream project for me and I said okay and then there was like well how are you gonna do the whole record in a year because we've already been sitting on this thing for a year and a half now he they assembled four other directors who were running teams or project teams at the same time simultaneously and breaking the songs up into chapters so even though there's somewhat of a lunar a linear narrative told out of chronological order and then two little sad vignettes which are sort of same universe different world just to give a different perspective on some of those songs because some directors were doing one song other teams had to and he was overseeing the entire thing but had them all working simultaneously on it so we could finish on time so I went over six times in the last year and I realized about the second trip those visits were very beneficial because those guys don't do half-ass you know what I mean and they won't they definitely pride themselves on the work and they all wanted me to be impressed so every time I would come back they knew I was coming I could tell that was really motivating them to go outside the box and everybody wanted to be the guy that blew my mind the most you know what I mean and they did every fucking time was just like some of that stuff I know how they did it and I don't know how they did it where can anybody see the whole thing Netflix oh it's all ins on Netflix right now well you put some of it on YouTube well yeah it's on to the label has to have a single because they go you know they got the relationship Spotify and all that shit so they got a which is also frustrating because we make cohesive concept records that are meant to be consumed as a whole right and then like if I'm not going radio why do I need a single you know what I mean just put the fucking record out skip the lead up the whole traditional set up because we're not we don't fit that model right just by making records were antiquated you know hmm but they put a single out so they put one section of the movie up on YouTube which I think we'll take down now that the whole films out but yeah for people they'd be like what is going on here yeah yeah we basically made a you know heavy metal or the wall but with Japanese animators I love it I wouldn't compare to the wall but same idea just a visual it's a visual age it's beautiful to the the the animation that they did for it's really it's incredible did you was it weird seem like their vision connected to the to your music no I mean I wrote the initial story the the main by Alliance green play and then told Jim Paley we were trying to do an homage of specifically a Jimbo and then a couple other famous samurai films like Takeshi Kitano Zatoichi and a lot of Kurosawa things like very reoccurring storylines and we were watching Kurosawa films in the studio making the record on silent in the control room just to kind of keep our mood right like to keep everything kind of dark and ominous and no second-guessing so but yeah it's kind of like a futuristic dystopian Yojimbo which which is also Fistful of Dollars where you got one town of people being oppressed by a couple rival factions or gang leaders and sort of using them for their own building so in the future now we just jump and I talked about it well sex drugs and weapons and war are really the main drivers of the economy so let's just say that those are the only economy you know those are the only things that have value anymore at that point and you got weird so I give him a rough script and then they just I said but you know I want you guys to do what you do so feel free to add or take things in any direction you want at any time so then you get thirty women with their tits out dancing and which which was I that was June pays idea I told him there was a very old famous samurai film called Zatoichi and at the end of it ones this blind swordsman conquers this evil force and the townspeople celebrate and there's this very famous scene in the end of it with his traditional dance and they're doing this dance and I said you know can we sneak this in as a dance sequence slash homage and anybody that has to be like a film buff geek like me would get it anybody else just be like it's a fucking cool so they decided to take the gimps and the sex trafficked slaves so to speak and then just make a big chorus line but then they had a woman a traditional Japanese dancer come in and they put her on motion capture and green-screen and she did the actual dance from the film and the animated everyone to that well I was like that's pretty sweet I wouldn't thought of that but he did what I wanted he just gave me what he wanted to do with it now how long is the whole thing we're that same like the audio is the album it's 42 minutes Wow it's a fucking brilliant idea man it's really cool I just love the idea that you're experimenting with something like that just trying it out but it had to be a long stretch it was like that was the hardest part was sitting on it so long and yeah hyper-focus gonna mix the record I think three times and mastered it twice and then we had to do a surround sound mix for the movie so I'm pretty fucking burn out on it I'll be honest I'm ready to go play live but I don't ever want to hear that shit again [Laughter] does that contribute to you the way you get creative with the sound when you perform in life you change out absolutely yeah do you think you're gonna do this in the future again like this kind of animation this or is this a one-off oh no there's already talk of doing I see I wouldn't do the music again I would certainly I might if they want to run with the story I'd be all about it either prequel or sequel action but I wouldn't want to make this sonic signature again I would probably like traditional Japanese musicians and then contemporary production methods and they actually have dialogue and sound effects and make a story you're gonna get into the cartoon business I got three kids that would be fucking awesome and it looks awesome I got to watch the whole thing I got to check it out it's really fucking weird man it's super trippy light a big right like that big Mike Tyson blunt when you get home tonight at midnight your kids are sleep and watch that shit and then think about what a weird motherfucker I am now when you when you think about like doing another storyline like that like following that story alive and thought I haven't thought about it'd be pretty easy though she rides off with the two robots and there's like an AI monster on lift dealt with or you could go back in time to the origins of the the two slick and slims feud with her dad and while they show up to the dojo and kill everybody I don't know there's all kinds of that just right and making up shit pretty straightforward yeah now when you when you go back to writing new music do you are you constantly working on new music like when know when like when do you decide like when when you have an album release like when will you decide to try it because you've been pretty consistent like every what how many years will be hot off and meta modern came out like nine months apart from each other sailors God was 2016 now who are 2019 so but we recorded their record 2017 no I mean it's like there is a tread water or drown mentality now everybody thinks you have to be in front of people all the fucking time or you got to be like blowing air into your brain balloon on Twitter and showing everybody L funny and enlightened your to be a musician but like I think sometimes the best thing you just go fuck away and process and recharge and like look for holes that aren't being filled and the exercise other interest and you know what this like I said these guys I don't want to play music with anybody else and the only reason I would need another band is like if I made a bluegrass record you know so you just get the hang down and the people you want to be around and love and have good time with like we keep like I said we can make 10 records it's all going to sound like 10 different bands because they're all these guys having extremely broad and diverse influences and ability so I just don't you know why I don't want to be in a box I don't want anybody to put a lid on it for me and we love all kinds of music so it's not really saying we're gonna make this kind of record we just went in and made fuckin noise and this is what happened with those tools it's it's interesting to see this cut your conscious decision to sort of just check out and recharge well yeah I get you got a certain point you just realize you're not in charge and I'm a very controlling personality I like to be I like to feel like I'm getting control these to myself and with music I've learned like you can put ideas out there but they decide what they want to be you know I knew I didn't want to put a wanky fucking noodley guitar solo on every single song two or three of those on a record you're pretty good to go especially now on the you know the guitars kind of dead what bob is an amazing keyboard player and we had this badass hold mode Model D synthesizer that does the dr. Dre shit and we did it on one song and we just kept going and cracking it out and like putting like higher and a lower octave and then running it through it amps and blowing it out and getting it really dirty like a big cracked out laser beam I was just like that's the fucking sound man we got to put that on everything and like cohesively tie the album together so most of the solos are Bob making this fucking sweet ass like cent thing over some Black Sabbath and I never heard that record growing up you know so we made that record Wow so when when you're torn with this music now and you're fucking with it and you're switching things up like when we you decide that it's time to write some new shit we just tour and then stop touring and then well I'm always writing poetry do I anymore I used to sit down with a guitar and like I'm gonna write this song you get like a part in words and you find meter and phrase I've discovered I'm really just a poet it's easier to write the words out and craft the meter and phrase to those words musically in the studio I would say both all the other three records I would probably wrote half of them while you go in to make the record you think you have the songs and you realize that those songs are not supposed to be a part of this record I would go home at night and write songs that fit that record where I would come in with parts like sailors gotta had a lot of parts of music they get pieced together in the studio and these guys probably all thought I was fucking insane for a scared verge of death because he usually I want to hear the song is like I got some notes you know but really the music happens you lock yourself in that room with the right people for a matter of days and you just keep going until it's done and you have ideas in the moment but now I don't even pick a guitar up to write I just write what I want to say what I'm feeling and then these guys you know push and encourage and motivate me to try to do the other thing as well as I'm able go sorry are you writing longhand are you writing on the computer no I write always write it it was right right your hand again I have notepads and I'll go through and just scribble out sections or pick this can fit with this this record was varied deconstructed I guess we did some loops and we were like record riffs on a certain key and then record that same roof in the real key so I could take it and chop it to a loop and make it super precise like a hip-hop album and if some stuff was just live as fuck you know and you just have fun we had a lot of fun mm-hmm the improvisational part of it sounds terrifying but awesome that's what Austin's what you want I mean sometimes you get something if it's a mulatto kook or something the first take it's usually the one you keep you know yeah when you go back and try to make it perfect it sounds cool we'd and we knew that having done this before so with these sessions we win it that was the only rule there was no second guessing or indecision hence the samurai films on the wall hmm cuz like in a sword fight you got one fucking move you know I mean that was like that was the mo for these sessions like the first thing is that matters the right thing it's the thing so when you're doing that new recording things do you pause and go listen to it and play it again how do you how do you guys do it sometimes it depends you know if it sounds cool like Bobby said then you project keep it and if you're like didn't really work trial Mills most of his solos on the record really first second take I mean Chuck I don't think I've ever fucking punched a single thing in Chuck's life Chuck is perfect he just kills it he's the man the Bob I've got a bunch of video somewhere computer Lee I made him record all of his solos with a jointness man like the intro thing they're like we need a thing for this and I was like well I needed I need a doobie and I smoked it and I just played them I have some of those videos too of myself that point on every time he played he had a jointness mouth so he was like not just thinking about the music it was like so you know anything to just settle it was it was pretty fun I mean we're kind of just we were fucking wasted you know just kind of like doing the Arsenio yeah can you get to I and play music only if you sir I'm still trying he's always what did you say so you said you want to get so high you don't even know what's court your pleasure yeah I don't know a song were playing I was like yeah no the problem is like we get so high when we record that and then we have to remember that live or relearn it and then if you get high live you can't remember what you played high when you record that is an issue so then you go back and listen to recordings and go what yeah I mean we had to look I had to go back after before rehearsals this was a really weird thing that's never happened I went from mixing and like processing looking at this film for the past year to now we have to like learn these songs so you're actually like paying attention to what you did there play these chords I was like wow fuck did I do that you know just so weird that and we did it so relatively quick quicker than the other stuff that we did shit you know we yeah we had to learn it all over again cuz I did we didn't remember doing any of it it was just so creative and quick like that they hadn't heard any of the songs since we recorded them until I send them the record three weeks ago yeah yeah is it surreal going and listen to all of it after it's all pieced together a little bit yeah yeah for me it was yeah yeah it's like riding a bike though really you know especially not playing in a year we know each other you know just jump back on yeah I'm still catching things and the recordings that I have don't play live I'll hear little bits and things still so Wow I got a question when you're when you're in the studio with them are you in producer mode because you've produced other artists or you kind of are they kind of producers with you and you guys are finding it together oh man I couldn't I couldn't tell these guys to do what they do why would I mean I don't want to work with you I want to work with the guys that just do shit that amazes me but no I'm not like I have a rough structure in my head of what what it sounds like you know there I guess I don't know you might maybe you guys should answer that question yeah I mean you said it but you have an idea of what you want but you you kind of give us the reins yeah if it sucks I tell them tell us you know but your opportunity to not fuck up like you know a wu-tang vibe or so yeah and then you know boo tang why so there's definitely I have liked the idea of the sound I'm chasing and it's hard to articulate mm-hmm but with this it was just I realized like maybe by the end of the second day we were doing something I know I hadn't really heard before or maybe I was hearing like 15 of my favorite records all at the same time I'm just like okay is what this is gonna be and it's probably gonna destroy my career and that's okay because this is fuck I like it know everyone brings such a different clothing to it you know and uh I'm obsessed with old records and equipment and getting sounds like oh what's this sound it's this piece of gear in this I'm just like I'm obsessed with it you know I'm just like we can find those things and put them all together in a big party - to be completely honest was like every other record I've made even the ones that these some of these guys have played on it was much more like I came in you're the songwriter and like it's session musicians you know and then you go out and you're the commodity you're the singing head you're the star and I think maybe around 2017 there's a big part of me that really rejected all that the newness of it and like the responsibility of it I just all ever want to just play guitar and band you know as a kid and maybe I wanted to feel like a part of something that wasn't all about my fucking head right I mean and I realized like I was finally in the band I've always wanted to be in since I was 13 in my bedroom you know it's like why wouldn't I make those records right it's funny cuz we'd imagine I mean think about the first one that we made together right opposed yeah Bobby I've met I actually met Bobby before I met Miles Bobby played organ on my very first record I'd never met him he got called down by the producer and we instantly I was just like okay this guy's cool shit and then I think like we were hanging out for like a week and we were going out we were both going pretty hard in the paint still back then like we Bobby and I would go out drinking and they come home and wake my wife up at 4:00 in the morning eat all ice cream and that was like yes and I think it was one night in particular in Nashville I was working at a fucking grocery store he was sleeping in his car you know we're both just like pretending we're not miserable and enjoying each other's company we went got real shit-faced man and we were walking up the Mondrian going to the only place that was still open to get some food at like 3:00 in the morning so all these meat market bars are letting out and we both look like a couple degenerate scumbags probably and we walk by and there's this group of like four or five obviously Vandy fucking football players like just huge dudes young men and pretty needed and we're walking by and I hear one of them say oh look it's The Strokes he's like I love your records man you know and I blew it off what everyone groan asked me and I kept walking and then I got about ten feet I don't know why I could just tell Bobby wasn't with me and I turned around and looked back to see this motherfucker standing in the middle of the circle of all of them like literally eight inches from this guy's face with his hands on his hip wearing his LoJack and Bobby's from Detroit man you know fucking play you know and I was like all right well I guess I'm going to jail Bob tonight and I turn around early kind of walked it's over there and about the time I get to the group of dudes one of them was eating a street hotdog and I will never forget this as long as I live Bobby like snatch the hotdog out of his hand and kind of crushed it like a paper wad and bounced it off his forehead Bobby was like well now I'm definitely going to jail a bobbin that you know so Bradley Cooper's and you gives yeah the Bradley Cooper's we called him Bradley Cooper's because just like this swarm of like dudes that had pink shirts on their leg as Bradley Cooper's and I don't know fascinating to watch them all immediately knew that they were dealing with something that they never experienced and they wanted fucking none of it I was like I'm gonna I think I this is my new best friend move your friends was God rest of my life just hotdog destroying man it's not to be fucked this just died this David Lee Roth organ playing motherfucker we were just walking having a drink father and no body their dicks total yes and then we went back need all of this ice cream out of the same container with it and now we sleep on a bus and have our own hotel rooms the bus things got to be a trip huh it's a lot like a like a being on a ship yeah it's just like Navy sleeping bunks and you wake up every day and wonder where you are and but no shitting on the bus where I can't poop on the bus no my sort of thousand dollars you know you can poop on other people's yeah you don't poop on our bus right so what do you guys do just tell the guy to pull over to a rest stop yeah you find a nice pilot somewhere in Omaha and shit on the toilet the same 38 truckers have today you know it's already warm whoa it's Old Glory the beats being in a van though by far oh for sure right so you guys listen to music playing music what are you doing when you're on the bus movies movies movies or you know watching Chuck cereal very few comics travel like that birth crisis is one of the rare ones he travels by bus honestly man face on it shit having at the end of the day and at this ant we are very grateful I want to touch on that but like the bus thing it's a quality of life issue as you will know touring is all about quality life there's no way to make it not suck other than the show's themselves right but everything else that 22 hours a day it's like just trying to see if coups 1 or some kind of circadian rhythm so you don't get all serotonin weird and shit well that nightly adrenalin blasts is the hardest thing on me I find after a tour that I have to like figure out what's going on in my brain and not be you get home from that after six weeks Yuki I can't get off the couch for a week it was like this weird strange fatigue I've never experienced in anything else but the bus we kind of I'd rather like I said I'd rather ride the bus for three days then go to an airport it's just you're in a cocoon it's your home on the ground miliar it's a safe haven they're all just chilling yeah we hang out we're all around each other more than we are our families most the time when we're in this little motor home hmm and if you get off it's just like fucking Joseph Conrad man don't get off the boat you step off the boat that's when weird shit happens you know right honey but when you guys go out how long do you go out for like if you do it well the first couple of Tours one of those records were pretty brutal we played about 300 plus reader straight and 300 nights a year yeah well you know I got a problem we're like I felt I had to I felt I had to do that my wife and kids on the way it was like this is it's gonna make this fucking happen you know and then you makes you happen and then other people are making you do that now because it's making so much money they can't afford for you to not be out there doing it and you reach a point of like exhaustion and burnout you're not even aware of because you're still doing what you love every night right but all the other shit catches up and you caught up to me pretty pretty hard around the second kid and I just realized like there's a smarter way to do this that will still provide for my family and all these guys which is like less is more and now I'll never tour like that again just there's no need one but two this is not healthy you're making a lot of people happy but like it's not healthy no it's not and that's where a lot of guys get into substance abuse exactly yeah James Hadfield just checked himself back in a rehab yeah cuz those guys at their age they got fucking more money than God and are still out hitting it harder than ever yeah you know after the live well that actually when I get me sued I better not say yeah no need it's a that's a tough call man yeah it's a real tough call yeah those guys like the great things about comedy is you only have to go out for a weekend you know me really I sometimes I'll travel somewhere for one night and come home you know and most that shit I do is around LA that's like the practice stuff just to stay sharp but I have friends that do the long touring and they start to go crazy it get a little nutty man I mean if you're single you don't have children yeah but even then it gets a little nutty but they feel even more dangerous if you were single have no kids it's real easy just to stay out there forever yes lost in that cycle of like especially if you like coke well if you're partying and drinking you don't realize how tired you are right and then where you do so be really cool we should yeah right yeah foof yeah it's it's the greatest job in the world like to be a professional entertainer but there's definitely some pitfalls to it just like everything else there's a balance mm-hm and those those guys that run it too hard they they run that engine too hot they should I think anybody that really cares about it is gonna be accused of that at something I definitely pushed things too hard I sing really hard I learn like singing very hard and physical it it's just like it's I don't know it's like you're tired from the outside in and then back out it's a weird feeling man comics always talked about it the same way that when they're on the road too much the word stop meaning anything they're saying these things but they don't have a connection to it anymore they lose their connection to the material and the only way to get around that is to constantly be writing new shit because if you're doing the same shit for too many shows in a row you start to go bonkers yeah is that that's the it seems to be correct me if I'm wrong but looks similar to why you guys are always changing your songs you're changing like there was a few songs he did last night that I recognize the song but it was like a totally different beat right a lot of it was different you can't say the words but I crimes the notes I can keep it inspiring for me but I like focusing on the notes that I'm singing or playing I don't even read music I don't know what fucking notes I'm singing I just know like he can probably tell you more about that theory Master when I was a kid I used to hate live albums because I felt like they went too fast I'm very few of them actually were alive really yeah they're faking it they're faking it I kiss alive too it's totally not a lot of it oh.what Frampton Comes Alive that's real no no what are you fucking oh yes records definitely studio record with all really yeah maybe we should get up that's marketing genius come on is that true yeah whatever so maybe we should look it up are you looking at mostly Wow I'm pretty sure the kiss record was a fucking but they sound they were like this you can tell by the sound and it sounded well I'm a moron I don't know anything about music but to me it sounded like they were performing the songs faster which I always attributed to them being like hyped up because they're in front of an audience the tempo is that out that's exactly right the adrenaline because everyone's going crazy you just yeah that's what I assumed because I won't listen it would sound different on some of those records that might not even be them playing they get ghost players and they have two summers and stuff like donkeys which those records are incredible you know because it's all the wreckin cru playing the playing the music those are good songs they're never there Harry Nilsson and Neil Diamond wrote at 90% of that shit that's why they're great songs you know it's like the Beach Boys The Beach Boys exactly and the they were all cut out here with the 18 musicians the Monkees made some killer records I saw her first porpoise song almost psychedelic things I've ever heard yeah they got they got dismissed because everybody knew they were kind of an artificially created well they were yeah that they were put on television they were singing it yeah they were actually singing it who do you guys think is the best singer of the Monkees Oh Mickey I don't know who's the best I don't know the best singer I think so I wouldn't know one name I know Mickey I mean Mickey Dolenz Davy Davy has the cleanest voice I think I don't know but if he was my cool well the other monkey's Micky Dolenz Mike Nesmith some Peter Tork my Nesmith and Peter Tork Peter Tork was Mike and Peter with real musicians Mike made the best soul records I think yeah I think Mickey's a good singer Mickey was a good kind of sings it's kind of annoying Louise some of the R&B stuff on like head or something you know it's annoying yeah it's a little much have a scene head I don't remember it no oh man you gotta watch the movie it's what is it the Monkees movie The Monkees made a movie it's like psychedelic has like Brian Brian Auger and like Julie Driscoll its head yeah all these like guest musicians like as in your head like like feed your head like Jefferson Airplane like do drugs really it's it's an insane like a psychedelic what in the fuck oh my god those are pretty incredible it's a I live in an alternate universe I didn't know this existed do you think that's on Netflix please check was an event footage Ellie's in it whoa powerful in that footage Ellie just Sonny Jack Nicholson Sonny Liston's in it the boxer yeah oh my god look at Jack fucking Nicholson man western desert saga war film musical or a film science fiction it's memorable if I have the things on Netflix might might have to recommend that people and we should have a fight companion where we just watch head which is unusable it's it's on YouTube okay good good to know that's what we'll do we'll have a fight companion where we watch the monkeys have a list of movies Oh Jefferson wrote the screenplay did he really yeah Wow Bob Rafelson yes nineteen see what does it say 68 eight big box office $16,000 it meet bro it made sixteen thousand dollars in the box office somebody got fired for that fucking movie when did they try to make it 68 when was the monkey when was it over for the monkeys was just like their their attempt at 67 68 was sort of the peak right I don't know probably after that movie man when was the TV show late 60s 60 they had to make they got a cancelled so they could make room for Joyce DeWitt chieftain Three's Company yes Chuck and I have the official Joyce DeWitt appreciation fan club if you want to be a member we could talk about it I think I'm ready in alright I have my own chapter yeah but joining these guests yeah it's different you know how do you guys rock it I can't say it on a five-year-old fetish obsession level maybe I don't know I used to be a Mary Tyler Moore fan that was my gal she's no Joey's the wood no but it's not suzanne somers no Chrissy can go home really why do you think that do you think she's too needy mm-hmm what happens with Chrissy did she's just not used to it that's just your thing yeah you feel like she was overlooked sort of like ginger no not ginger Mary Ann sort of like Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island Janet overlooked seemed like it Mary Ann was definitely overlooked yeah everybody was in a ginger area looked like a giant painting I mean I mean ginger rather look like a giant pain yes it was George that's not her is it everybody gets old come on is that a mugshot yeah that probably looks good hops DUI yeah sorry sorry Joyce but when she was in her prime what a doll and she very kind of God's creation you know what it says on her shirt No do you remember when they took suzanne somers off the show yeah she had a call in she was like calling in it's like hey it's me I know I'm still on the show but uh wanted vacation I miss you guys by like that was her being on the show mm-hmm did they'd have a phone call with her and she wouldn't be interacting with them cousin Cindy took over yeah and then they fired her right it was like contract negotiation that was the first time you realize like even people on TV are never happy right they're on TV they want more money and their wolf the Regal Beagle oh I remember that remember when they switched the the old folks - yeah I went for mr. Roper to me yeah that's right mr. Furley was a decent not no I was a good feeling our guy at Dan Tana's last night it was basically mr. Furley really that's mr. Furley never our mr. Furley never broke the wall though the way mr. Roper do doesn't mean you get a zinger in and like look at the camera yeah mr. Roper had a special sense of humor and he was also like a lovable pervert right remember he was like really into the girls mr. rose right was it done not sir but I thought the other one was kind of a perv - he was married this is rope - the girls yeah yeah yeah yeah guys can be way more pervy on TV back then oh yeah that was a player remember believe that I met John John Ritter John Ritter was on an episode of News Radio super nice guy real real nice guy like everybody loved him I always as I got older I always wondered about that guy because I'm always been fascinated by people who do a lot of pratfalls mm-hmm like those those guys get really hurt yeah like that that pratfall shit it's like it's so it's like you're playing rugby with yourself you're throwing yourself into chairs to the ground you're falling down the way somebody falling down falls down yeah you're falling down and taking the impact on your fucking back and a lot of those guys get like significantly injured and if you read back on like ancient movie stars like a lot of them got like really badly hurt was Buster Keaton got had the broken neck we showed this video of him he did these crazy stunts and one of the stunts he did like you had this water come down from this thing and hit him in the head who told us about this was it Penn Penn Jillette and he broke his fucking neck from the water hitting him they didn't anticipate the weight of the water and the water was so powerful that slammed him to the ground and broke his fucking neck and he continued at the scene and then later when he was older the doctor was examined it was like when did you break your neck he's like I never did the fuck you didn't like you bro you broke your neck your neck get even now he's running around a broken neck different humans back then son they made people different well the cliff booth yeah but him Jack Tripper John Ritter was he did a lot of pratfalls man a lot I was wanted about guys like that I'm like how much pain is that dude it like you're like what's his face Chevy Chase that was a I gotta think that was a contributor to him being cranky because always people always say that Chevy Chase is cranky but there was some recent thing where he's yelling at somebody for something guys probably in fucking pain all the time from falling down like guys with back injuries from doing a lot of those those pratfalls like they're always throwing themselves up in the legs up Pam bouncing off the ground it hurts being Clark Griswald yes that's right all that shit he did right he was always falling down right he was always falling down oh yeah now getting fucked up man yeah that's right he did fall off the villa or the Attic I wonder what they did with that how did they have they set that up he's done guys you think it's hard to say man I don't know I ventured in the thespian a little this is a little bit more soulful but they know I was not really the stunt guys to do the crazy shit but like you know you can still get fucked up stunt guys get fucked up a lot my friend Tate just severe concussion from doing some stunt work in a movie you have a hard time looking at lights yeah I fell on my back and some rehearsals for a movie last year we had to go to New Orleans for like a week and rehearse this scene because it was gonna be one like 12 minutes shot and Daniel Chloe and I had to like body slam each other on the pavement about 20 times one day and I guess I landed on the pad on a curb wrong and I got home that night and it felt like my kidneys were on fire and then I had to piss like every three minutes for the next week I had some blood tracing so of course the next week is when we went to actually film the fucking thing in Cleveland little polar vortex we're out there in the chute and the whole time I'm just like I felt I got a bladder infection from just from falling down one time wrong and you have to do it again oh we did it like a hundred 50 times for this moving through the for one scene in the movie it yeah I'll never like question how hard those people work ever again man did you get an MRI did you get I went to a doctor in New Orleans and she checked it out and said there wasn't like there was trace blood but nothing was she said don't be a pussy don't yeah pretty much I was like all right only be a pussy oh yeah that kind of impacts not that's no bueno yeah it's a weird way to make a living I mean you guys probably have a every single person that does your job after for at least a few years probably has sustained impact and stress injuries that would imagine oh yeah dudes are jacked up all the time these are jacked up while they're active duty like the guys that actually walk in here and are on your show like they're they're probably all jacked up and then they're probably the better off ones cuz they took care of their bodies a lot of people don't do that that's like becoming more of a thing like the tactical athlete but knees I mean my knee was getting janky before the foot blew off of how much that was from squatting eight thousand pounds all through your 20s like I would say that was a preventative measure really like you're maintaining like same like you train all the time like you maintain going through full ranges of motion and take keeping structures loaded and pliable strength training and new conditioning endurance based stuff and maintain mobility that's like you lose mobility you start dying yeah for sure definitely with when it comes to like anything that's gonna be throwing you around or battering you into something the more muscle more strength you can put into your body the more you can protect yourself but obviously only so much but would you know when you think about wrestlers or anybody who does anything when they gettin slammed to the ground a lot you know they're mostly doing it if they're doing it as a competitive wrestler doing it on mats you know they're cushioned you know if you're doing it on the street like and they've got you doing some sort of stunt maneuvers like what kind of pads they have underneath you like that's like a basic martial arts like a big thick bad boy real thick little blues and ones real answers that fold up because they want to see your body actually hit the ground correct and then when when they actually shot the thing the only thing that we didn't what the actors apart were I definitely had to like judo flip his ass off onto a pad and we did all that but then like the stunt guys came out and did that shit for real onto frozen fucking concrete and negative twenty degrees I was like oh yeah y'all have a test you know but they for real like dude straight up suplex this motherfucker on the pavement they had knee pads and elbow pads on everything but you know it had to look real those are the guys you wonder how that how long that career lasts that's where I can't wait for robots to get really good at body slams you know you see what they're doing now with the parkour robots and shit that's what we need just robots body slamming each other or just get it to where CGI doesn't offend me you know right now I can watch the avatar the other night again when you go back and like look at all those old Jackie Chan movies knowing what that guy is putting his body through oh my god for sure yeah no doubt about it definitely was slammed into things left and right but if you go back and watch avatar it's fucking first of all it's awesome I mean it's fucking awesome it's really good but the CGI it's so obvious that's not real people so the guy who invented the software that James Cameron used to make avatar did the video for the number four song on this Michael arias she's still a great Freddie guy was so fucking genius he couldn't articulate senses it was like the driest meetings I've ever been in his brain there was so much shit going on on levels we could never comprehend that he was late so I thought seriously Wow you know but he's making computers and shit I can't that was ten years ago than ever I came out too which is crazy I didn't know it was that long ago some fucking great scenes in that movie man people got depression after that movie they got a think they're called avatar depression because they wish that they were living in Avatar they wish that they were on Pandora they wish they were the Navi like living a spiritual life conviction connected to the mother earth what would they call er a WA right if they only knew they are hmm yeah but you know cell phones and shit they really want to be flying around on Turtles me shoot girls and housing people you know see I need to be on Twitter in the coudé like that but that's a powerful movie where people actually get depression from not living in the place where the movie was taking place I've never seen it never seen but I haven't seen you knees either though so let's not again you know have you never seen the Goonies born in 1992 yeah but have you not going back avatar that doesn't make any sense when that's 2009 what did you get abused as a child no just I'm just waiting to go on the road so we can watch ideas dude you gotta watch avatar man it's a three-hour masterpiece you might tear up a little bit yeah we now I got something to do dude it's a dope movie James Cameron can direct the fuck out of a movie he can do just about anything he wants to do it basically if you can't do it he just invent some shit so he can go do it but I forgot how good that movie was I haven't seen in forever and watch again I was like fuck this is a good movie it's fun people go out it's like an alien version of Pocahontas save it save that shit keep it to yourself I enjoy it it's a trippy fucking movie man it's fun but every story is like a version of another story that's always existed classic archetypes that are unavoidable doesn't mean it's not an awesome movie fucking pain in the ass goddamn malcontent out there there's always somebody avatar is fucking terrible he's like that movie's terrible you have no soul there's nothing inside you it's a lolly Roadhouse exactly this if you were you sober when you watched it yes yes I was how dare home brother how dare you for the insinuation um there's a lot of colours to be like white again you know when you can't be so before showgirls the showgirls might be the ultimate bad movie with elizabeth berkley Oh remember yeah she played she played a girl trying to make it as a choker on Vegas and it's just like cartoonishly ridiculous and they have a scene where they she's having sex with Kyle what the fuck's his name what's that dudes name Jamie guy from Twin Peaks Jamie anyway she has the most preposterous sex scene in the history of film where she starts flopping around there having sex in a pool and she starts flailing just flailing like you would you would have to be an asshole to keep fucking her like a healthy person to be like this girl is having a psychotic break I need to step away stop thinking about my deck and and help her she's my friend and she's fucking she's having some sort of a psychotic seizure she's flailing like flopping back and forth and flailing if you were dating a girl like that book oh my god dude she's so annoying she everything she does just to throw her body around flail you've never seen that scene your about it up on here before but it's Turtles never seen it oh okay what what year is this movie 95 oh I was thinking it's right when I first girl this is how it is out here huh I've seen you try to block it out David that still from our still remember that billboards on Sunset I was driving down sunset first year living and I was like looking at shit what the fuck up piece-of-shit movie is this these people are into but it's one of those movies where you watch like people forgot how bad it is it's the cocaine days of films when they were making these movies they where obviously someone was on coke someone making that movies on coke is there but do you have a video yeah you see you see her Tatas - absolutely seen the same before you've never seen it stir it's off no I've seen that it's awful it's awful but if you get really really high it might be good again the sex scenes not good it's so much worse but that's what's good about it it's how terrible it is the other movie you have to get

that's the open parts of a novel that it was terribly wrong he had a miniaturization technique for clitoris he took the patient's penis and turned into a clitoris apparently guaranteeing his clients full sexual pleasure he presented his work in the 1973 medical conference where his technique earned him the respect of some of the world's most famous surgeons without surgical qualifications Brown had to perform his operations the most unlikely in inappropriate locations one early patient remembers going to his office assuming he would do a checkup but awoke from the anesthetic to discover that he had operated in the office he turned his garage into an operating theater and the more operations he did the further his standard slips oh my god the concerns of his peers many of Brown's patients appeared to be happy that's like if you bought a really small book it would end right there one of his early patients Elizabeth had been delighted with her surgery and your later things started to go wrong her vagina started to tighten and close up tight Brown was abandoning his patients and leaving them to other surgeons like dr. Jack Fisher to pick up the pieces he says it's hard to imagine anyone worse than John Brown he didn't care much for any evaluating his patients before surgery or for post-operative care he was totally focused on the technical procedure itself and he didn't do that very well Jesus Christ man puts good shit out in the world oh why have you done this to him buddy right there yeah you got to do head this and then watch a shucking buck Johnson man what is shocking buck him why do I not want to look what the fuck he did sure play games yeah hey Jamie look up well you want to play a game what's Chuck and buck was awkward fucking film ever made wait a minute more awkward than that what was that one with a dude they made the room where they made a movie what's-his-face the fucking Bob Joe made a movie about the movie being named remember the room you guys know that movie the room where he played the you know it is the James Franco actually made a whole movie the movies so insane James Franco made a movie about the making of the movie about how insane it was it's a guy was like this dude who's like an actor and things weren't going so well so he put together enough money to make his own movie but it's terrible and in every scene he was like making out with girls yeah Tommy yeah it's it's hard to watch it's one of those movies it's so bad like you think you're gonna get schizophrenia from watching it like it's distorting reality in a way that does not it's not compatible with your senses it's confusing you watch scenes in the film that's the that's the movie called the room and he bought billboards around town when I first moved to LA there was a billboard around town for the room for a long time I were to get the money I don't know somewhere terrible that's just not cheap yeah I think that movie was what they move across we're watching truck and bus trailer in case there's anything worth oh you think this is the Chuck and buck trailer and what is chucking buck about oh you just keep the scene what is it is there a scene called let's play a game so what is Chuck doing here he's messing with some dials and he's laying back and then this guy's packing up his gear and he's getting his car you know tell me what the fuck is this movie about man find out what am I gonna get it from watch it is that Ashton Kutcher no who's that guy that handsome bastard well yours this mm that might be ashton kutcher bro that is Jack Black's roommate from school around it yet oh that guy right there so if we can't listen to this I have no fucking idea what's going on and there's no way you can listen to this know someone have to do this offline I'm gonna have to just like I said go home kids were sleep spoke blunt force our anime film and then right after that watch Chuck and buck yeah I'm gonna don't want to definitely watch your anime film first yeah Chuck and book I don't know if chuckles buck is yeah I think I gotta go with head naps you might actually want to enjoy fury to end on something positive and cool and good yeah but I might be wrecked listen sleep the ameba what's in your bag Joe Rogan joking buck head doctor yeah that's a good description right there an oddly naive manchild stalks his childhood best friend and tries to reconnect with their past genius all right gentlemen thank you for last night it was fucking awesome thanks for being here today the album it's out Sturgill tell these people what it is where to get it sounded fury I don't know where the fuck you would go by that probably works or iTunes itunes record store or you can steal it on Spotify and just come in the show your call well open invitation special forces foundation.org get that shit get that shit all right thank you gentlemen it was a lot of fun cruciate times thank you thank you my pleasure bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
