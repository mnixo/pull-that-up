good here we go three two live boom we're live gentlemen Joe right Fred Hey good to be here good see you guys it's happenin not much were in sunny California yeah it's too close to the Sun a little bit yeah barbecued over the last week and a half I've been hiding in a hotel for six days how proper that we're here to talk about surviving the apocalypse a your book is Joe beef surviving the apocalypse a cookbook for surviving the apocalypse what is that what's the purpose of the the title just a goof we haven't written a book in years you know we I don't think we really wanted to write a second book when we started getting a bit of pressure to write a second one we kind of you know laid down the gauntlet to the editors and said we're gonna write what we want are you in or you out and they said well you know show us a little bit of the framework of that this is gonna be I said I want to talk I mean no cooking doesn't define me or Fred it's not all that we do like it's you know you see some people they seem to like eat live and breathe cooking I said no I'm into the outdoors I'm into mushroom picking I'm it's a fermentation of berries I'm into you know canoeing I know all about canoes I love swimming in lakes I want to talk about multiple subjects I want to talk about the native Mohawks of Quebec I want it you know so I said let us write a book about the multiple subjects of which we're into you know a Joe if we're not cooking we're building first-aid kits and like survival kits for real really yeah if it goes to like LL Bean he has a lifetime membership there and I have an off-grid cabin up north like north of Montreal about an hour and a half you can only get there by by boat it's eight kilometers from the landing you know two thousand watts of solar power completely off grid you can't even you can barely walk in because of the jagged cliffs all around it behind me is an old-growth forest that's protected federally and I have a suture kit and saline my car always I do fitted like he's got shovels on the roof and propane tanks on the roof two years ago I drove to Alaska down south Arizona back home 20,000 miles I grew up in Boston and I did stand-up in Montreal for the first time I think in like 1991 or something like that and I remember thinking Boston was cold until I went to Montreal and I want oh this is a different thing we had we had a polar vortex last year come roaring through I think all the pipes blew and all the restaurants I'm sure like January 2nd you know but what I was gonna say is do you think that living in such an extreme environment in a beautiful city amazing city but it's an incredibly harsh environment in the winter do you think that makes you more more cognizant it's always the need for survival it's always in the back of my head I have three daughters like it's always in the back of my head they said this is incredibly cold if the power goes out for 48 hours I have to start a plan B where am i bringing my babies what are we gonna eat where are we going yeah sure city over the last couple of years have been talking about a complete ban of fireplaces and wood-burning stoves inside of homes condominiums and home and houses the the laws governing wood-burning in the city of Montreal or stricter than the ones in California and we diet man it's all we die like oh this is irresponsible you know by the government to do this I said okay make sure we don't use them but let's all have them just in case same goes for because if the big yeah what are they worried about it for they're worried about their particle emission particulates yes correct man but it smells good like a nice wood-burning doesn't like make amazing yeah this affects everybody this affects restaurants and grilling food this affects barbecue this affects our you know traditional bagels stores traditional bagel stores cook with wood isn't what you said of course you go into my land st. viateur bagel Fairmount bagel all the other ones you smell it it's a massive part of our culture as well you have to understand that food wise the province of Quebec in Quebec City in Montreal see the first place is populated in North America this is you know the Europeans to get to anywhere in North America came through Quebec first New York afterwards the food culture in Quebec is over 400 years old you can't say that about over thousand years old you know yeah absolutely and then would would what is detrimental to that if it wasn't for burning wood I'm not saying we should do it for a historical purpose but like man like if we run out of gas there still would give you a ticket you know two grand because you're having a fire a few years ago like about a decade ago we had this crazy ice storm in Quebec you know the perfect storm of rain and then cold and then rain and then cold all the power lines without the pylons yeah everything got thick with ice right yeah for two weeks yeah two weeks there's a baby boom right after that because people stayed home no television and no heat and and procreated that there was a true baby boom nine months later those a ton of new kids born that's hilarious do you know that the deep freeze it also like cleans the city in the winter so from your perspective the shit hits the fan and come and see us because it's a pretty good city to survive anything you know it's a pretty neat place because the winter just like sanitizes everything you start again every year yeah yeah as opposed to LA where you never really get that clean down yeah yeah you do like a whore's bath you just get like you're in a restroom somewhere with paper towels that you went down and sort of get your underarms or whatever that's what the wet towel it's yes yes so you just wanted to write a book that kind of covers all of your interests not just with food but one of the things that I really enjoyed about there was an episode that you guys did of Anthony Bourdain show where you are ice fishing and you had one of those ice fishing huts and you know cooked it Tony told you it's notorious and they show that they never caught fish yeah and whenever he had a gun he never anything so we knew that and we knew that there was not a pike and there was not a walleye that was gonna bite so we're like okay option a we sit there and we like take some fake fish and we fry it up in cornflakes and shortening in a hollow cabin or we just went like Joe beef crazy and we brought all the old cookbooks we had all the spirits like Cuban cigars all the copper where all the stuff and we made the menu from an old Leon a restaurant Paul Bocuse that he did a show at after and he knew nothing about that day and we just went from fishing after he asked us about like strippers in Quebec and like I just a few funny banter and as we just went in I was like magical it's a it was seriously 1/10 1/10 of the size of this room here you have a tiny tiny little Shack he tapped out that day yeah yeah he was having a good time and we hit that we brought some fine wines and fine spirits some some really rare oddities some old chartreuse and stuff yeah that Fred that lying around and and Tony was it's up on the screen right there he let it go a bit you know he just he calmed down and enjoyed us and let us do our thing I'm a bit fatter eh oh god those in the wine drinking days too right yeah correct look at that God that looks good is that fog wah and some sort of mashed potatoes or something yeah that's a wild rabbit it's a French recipe it's called hair a lot Royale where you you cook the hair for a long time and hair yeah and you serve it with truffles and you think you keep the blood this hair is snared so it's still full of blood and you keep the blood and at the end you thicken the sauce with the blood whoa it's very good and I bet you you know it's funny I bet you it fits all the principles of nutrition now you know like blood and all the organ meats and all right same with cheese look this is like the my cheese probiotics right there isn't it that is interesting right that no one thought of that until recently that that was what it was people just thought of it as cheese and now people think of it as there's live cultures on it and organ meat is much healthier for you and people are so much more aware look at the the cheese thing too it's like now they love the probiotic makers are doing like lit lipo deliveries they coated in fat so it resists the stomach acid right but that's fat probiotic from cheese is covered in fat you did after your dinner it lives through you and and it all in a perfect world it comes from right around your house right so you eat a cheese and the probiotics are the same one that you're gonna encounter later so you kind of get immunized in a way yeah that's the benefit that's what true local is right right yeah is there's a benefit to eating cheese after meal yeah sure it is and when it's a very pungent advanced alive raw cheese it'll be seen ultimately as a non-alcoholic DJ Steve what is it DJ Steve the tube to help stimulate digestion ah no kidding so it's almost like an enzyme yeah like a probiotic but mostly now they're they're figuring this out that the problem of the low fat diet and the you know like brown rice and chicken breast you know the bodybuilder diet nothing triggers your fullness because they realize that fat actually makes you full quite fast right so if you eat a bit of cheese you're done you tap out after you don't need like a full plate of cheese or layer it on a hamburger but just a little bit of cheese after just cuts you off and then you have spirits and cigars are not that healthy but yeah I've been talking about that with a lot of nutrition experts where they say that your body when it eats a lot of carbohydrates you can consume carbohydrates far past what you actually need whereas if you're just eating a lot of fat and protein your body tends to regulate itself much better they she ate yeah yeah yeah no you guys how long have you been in Montreal and there I have to tell you and I've said it before if I had a say my all-time favorite restaurant I think Joe beefs my all-time favorite restaurant I don't like to say my all-time number because there's a lot of great restaurants in this world but damn if I had to choose one I think I might choose you guys know you're very kind but we have to take you out to other places to change your mind man you guys are the first kind of if you're a horse lover turn your head plug your ears he has the first people that ever served me horse and I was like what when he brought over a hole it was a horse tenderloin and I was like what the you guys are eating horse up here and horse tartare but it's a stigma you know it's a cow and Elka buys in a deer of course it's four-legged animal and you know what if I put if I put a bison tenderloin on this Nick and I serve you a beef tenderloin and a cow tenderloin and that deer tender lights at the end of the day it's you know it's just has a couple of degrees of separation from the other it's all flesh really and it's it's very subjective that we base our nutritional choices and how pretty or how cute an animal is you know it doesn't make sense you know and we're lucky now we're able to choose where we eat well you know like it wasn't like that a hundred years ago you know the purpose of the food guide until like forty years ago was to make sure you had enough calories now we're in an age of restriction so you we say like I don't want horse I'd prefer deer or I prefer veal or a chicken yesterday can't have twice in a row but like all this is a bit of fluff what we do in a way because we're so fortunate to have enough food to decide my friend remi warren was on a backpacking horseback elk hunt and one of the horses fell down and broke its leg and they had to make a decision they were deep in the backcountry they had to shoot it and it was just wasn't gonna get out of there and after they shot it he decided that really this is it sound was gonna go to waste so they took the back straps off and they they cooked it and ate it and anybody said there it was a really weird moment where like this is an animal that was like everybody's petting it knows you were you know you're riding it and it just it was a working animal but it was an animal that you loved and then all sudden it's down and you have to kill and he's like well it's gonna go to waste he said it just felt wrong to let it go to waste so they they cut the back straps off of it you know the reason I think we don't eat horse culturally is really based ultimately on the Battle of wolf between Mon Cala on the plains of Quebec City you know there that was a decisive battle in North American history whereas if the French had won that battle everybody North America ultimately would be speaking French you know they didn't win that battle so British rule imposed so in England you did horse by Royal Decree but in for the Franchi doors the Belgians eat horse the Germans eat horse you see so yeah it's very old history you know it was mining it was a boat in an Anglophone world to eat horse and and in all the mining countries half my family's from Belgium and its traditional there because they'd bring the horse and the mine the horse you know it's sad for a horse to live in the mine in the dark but they wouldn't bring it out when he was old you know they would just eat the horse most cultures eat Turkish eat horse you know what was a necessity I mean you couldn't pick and choose back when all this was instituted we're very limited in the proteins that we eat especially in North America Quebec less so you know Quebec has a very open-minded dining public very advanced dining public very old dining public and of course Latin French dining public the amount of proteins that are served in a Montrell restaurant are numerous compared to let's say even when I go to Manhattan if me and you and Fred are in Manhattan tomorrow night say let's go have rabbit with mustard sauce it's gonna be a tough sell we're gonna really struggle to find rabbit mustard sauce we're gonna struggle even to find you know let's go have a couple slices of liver tonight with onions it's gonna be very different with lamb neck you know lamb liver deer is a hard tall order you know ultimately Manhattan or America it's a limited scope of proteins beef chicken so forth whereas you know French culture Quebec you know we have all the proteins I have young dining clientele that have no problem eating kidneys medium-rare liver or lamb liver deer neck deer heart tartare it's not a thing like it's not what other restaurant people are eating just part of the registry you know little girls like your daughters raised eating you know the food that their dad hunts and the food that their parents buy some people have lesser means eat pork liver raised on it so when they see liver on the restaurant cute little you know nineteen year old girls that are about to go out to the club later but have a slice of liver you won't see that in New York City are you allowed to sell venison here that you hunt no not that you hunt you you have to but by farm-raised stuff and oddly enough most of its from New Zealand most of stuff that we're getting here in the United States is from New Zealand and if they call it venison it's most likely some sort of stag or you know and the elk that we get if we buy elk in a restaurant it's yeah it's all from New Zealand well you can't harvest you when you do a kill you can put it in your freezer yeah okay perfect yeah well all I have two freezers back here all of the elk that I get I get from myself that I hunt and I give it to a lot of my friends and I make sausages for my friends and I sent you know but that's the only way they're gonna get it unless they go out and get it themselves it's not a place in Los Angeles where you can go buy elk meat yeah new in Newfoundland that they're they're allowed to hunters are allowed to sell moose back to the restaurants really yeah moose were introduced onto the island of Newfoundland from Maine and there was no natural predators on Newfoundland so the Moot and it's a perfect environment for them so they just propagated so that's why they take drive slow there man are we shot with Tony they drove slow like we drove four hours like full days to go like 300 miles because you can't drive fast because of the mooses so you can have a restaurant like in the hotel we stayed the restaurant had a permit by moose so they would make like moose curry sauce days in kind of vibe like yeah not a great restaurant like a hotel you know a hotel restaurant serving wild moose burgers but it's pretty cool that they do that that is cool but if they did that everywhere else then we're just reinventing the wheel you know with rolling we're going back to market hunting which is what almost wiped out almost all of the animals in this country and if some chefs in Quebec would like to bring that back and I you know I said with us we can barely manage our roads or infrastructure we can barely manage like her and that's the risk of foraging do it like eventually you know like people go for mushrooms it's like you heard about the fights between the mushroom pickers and Oregon and stuff like that where no oh fuck like the the people who harvest clams do a that like between the communities there's huge fights for territories and they'd hijack like trucks of abalone at night and GUI dock the giant king clam mmm I've heard stories of a guy on in his Econoline van with 500 pounds of gooey duck going to the Victoria Airport to send them to Japan get hijacked on the highway at night and they steal the clams because they're worth a fortune in Japan and same for mushrooms mushrooms are as well another famous white it's called a pine mushroom and in Japan a matsutake mushroom the closer the shape of the mushroom to a penis the more expensive it is you know so they'd like they'd actually hijack people on their way to like the patch and like undress them and make them turn around so they can never find the place again Wow yeah it's competitive morel mushrooms you look at a morel mushroom it's a you know how much fred for very expensive 44 bucks a kilo and let reality just keep it about a fist from your face yeah the morel mushrooms i buy online they're very expensive i buy them dried and they're so delicious i mean people who don't like mushrooms like one of my daughters does not like mushrooms but she loves morel it's my favorite it's a number one mushroom good with salt with garlic salt and France sauteed in butter they're sensational great much room yeah it's a strange flavor one of our favorite there's a great recipe for that in the book is like you poached chicken legs right until they're ready and then in the the broth very little broth you know you strain the broth you add cream and saute morel mushrooms in there and a little bit of sherry wine any of oxidized wine and you just add the legs in there and you let you let that simmer man that's good we have a picture in the book of some RL mushrooms of the size of these water bottles I've had morel mushrooms that are about the size of my hand you can stuff like half a chicken leg inside of them and serve one stuffed morel mushroom and broth for one customer it's brilliant aren't they they're a strange mushroom right where they they pop up after burns yeah and they also a spring mushroom which is weird because most of the other mushrooms are later on them damp right and Morel is like literally quite quick after the snow that's the first mushroom that appears in the forest so it's a very different than all the others are they commercially cultivated they could be but not I've never seen it my face I tried growing mush we tried everything at the rest I tried growing mushrooms and like you get everything but the mushroom you inoculate you know it's very difficult to keep the proper conditions and stuff that's why I'm not against the fact that they're expensive you know it's a good way to regulate a market price you know it's like yeah you know bluefin tuna is going extinct but just make it three times the price it's gonna regulate the market you know I guess I wish there was a way to reintroduce bluefin to the wild it just seems like the appetite that people have for those things is just untenable give you a look at any given night in a city like Manhattan how much red tuna is sold on the island of Manhattan Oh any given night of the year it's it's it's scary I almost feel like it's like killing the last giraffe and I heard you know like like fishing a giant tuna like that it's it's and again you know that they're big they're feisty they're majestic so that shouldn't guide my choice my decision and to protect them but like I that's heartbreaking the problem is there's complete lack of regulation in the open waters when these guys have these enormous ships filled with huge Nets and you just drag them across the ocean floor and capture everything bycatch you know that's the biggest joke it's like they call it bycatch so you didn't set off the fish for tuna but that's what kind of bit you know like yeah come on you know you go fishing for what to catch a bluefin tuna in the first place you know place oh so they're there pretending they're not fishing for it so we're saying allegedly yeah well you know that whole thing with Japanese whalers they've found a way to work around it and the way the words are just it's research boat so the these science research where we're gonna do research on these whales that we kill and then they chop them up and sell them and sea Shepherd has been tracking that down and they they you know hover over them take photographs of it and report them and you know it's it's ugly business yeah eighteen is ugly business we've worked hard at the restaurant to ultimately avoid it to be more seafood sustainable seafood focused you know the oyster is a great thing to eat we should eat more oysters right see more clams Florida oddly is an amazing sustainable seafood scene just the work that they do with the the Florida stone crab right you know that every year they just harvest like the left arm and they put the crap back and the next year it's the right arm and they put the crab back really yeah it's a brilliant fishing industry yes they don't kill the animal the core the claw grows back right and it's a they all fit nicely in the plate side by side I don't like that you're telling me something good about Florida they have a great shrimping scene a great you that they're actually leaders in sustainable seafood well the seafood and fishing is such a gigantic part of their economy it makes sense that they would do that that's a smart thing yeah the grouper fishing down there is a giant giant part of the earth there's a good book that was published a few years ago the big oyster I think Marco Lansky he wrote a book about history of the oyster yeah the New York in the history of the oyster and it incredible super interesting because his his thing was like you know we try to portray our history as like glorious and we herded Bisons before for protein and that's how we started or like modern farming but in fact we probably farmed oysters and snails and clams because they don't move and they're the most prolific and the most abundant source of protein in that book orlansky brings up a premise and i'm loosely interpreting it now because i read this book a few years ago but think of this for a second right the island of Manhattan is a perfect all the rivers around it all the water systems around it is actually one of the greater oyster situations on the Atlantic east coast right the reason that the population exploded in Manhattan at them in the early days was that any person could literally get off a boat walk on to the island of em of Manhattan homeless broke and sleep in an alley and walk down to the river and picked five oysters a small oyster is five grams of protein right a medium or Easter's got ten grams of protein so a completely destitute person could just eat six oysters a day you know three oysters and live again another day two a job so the population ultimately you know New York City and his population was based on this readily supply this huge supply of oysters Wow yeah it was a free available source of protein that will make you live another 24 hours so if it takes you three days to find a job four days to find a job 20 days to find a job you're not gonna die because there's Auster's look at this and yet and they they they found ways for him what is this from Harlem River oysters crap oh yeah there's an actual island that they thought where like geo geological formation that are made of oyster shells this layers and layers of oyster shells the article the Jim you put up is from Thrillist is that what it's from pull up to the top so utopia with the order of the derivatives why orders are ridiculously important to the history of New York City and it's just showing all these ancient photos of mounds of oyster shells there's an amazing program today you know some of the area's a there's a they take these giant cages one Easter if I'm correct one Easter filters four metric tons of water per day from what I understand I might be wrong with my math so take this for instance you know a cage a caged box of thousands of oysters there it is there's a single oyster can filter about 30 to 50 gallons of water bath New York's waterways are exact it cleans the folks behind the billion oyster project are trying to change that by recycling shells from the partnering restaurants and getting them back in the water to build easter reefs the goal is to add a billion moister x' to the water by 2035 so far they've restored 1.0 one acre 1.5 acres of reason what don't say 1.05 did you got an acre oh that's you just add in those extra two numbers 1.05 acres of reefs and count 11.5 million newly grown oysters but the oyster will clarify the water it'll make a murky river clear again Wow but in effect the taste of the oyster they don't eat those oysters I think those are pulled back into landfill after or mulched into garden or for the shells of em to be put for more reefs but the oyster is interesting it doesn't move right a noise it opens its shells to feed showing how they do it this is incredible and the oyster you know that the oyster has a it will change gender according to the density of the population so it'll go from male to female in order to balance the flick of the liner that's incredible we're watching a video where the what is it the oyster recovery was it I'm sorry so it's a time-lapse but it said what does it say it was from yeast your filtration right but there was a watermark on the video there in the corner it was showing yeah always the recovery partners yeah so the watermark is so what they do is they have this horrible green water they chuck these oysters and it turns it completely clear that's amazing I did not know that I did know that they used to eat lobsters and they thought of lobsters as poor people food sure yeah yeah in New Brunswick they used to harvest the lobsters to feed to the prisoners and keep the shells as fertilizer this person was one of the first presidents to bring the lobster into the White House cuz it was seen as a servant's food when did it switch Jefferson so when he started doing that that's what people realized it was so delicious no that's made a lot socially if we changed the whole thing the lobster spaghetti that's that's off the chart you know so the child labor laws we're in stored primarily because of the kids that used to work in noiser shucking plants really yeah yeah we had a one of our best friend if not our best friend passed away like six months ago john bill he was a great talker you helped us at the bar but he's like deep into sustainability and history of oysters and everything and he was like the source for oysters for everything he wrote a beautiful book yeah almost send you a copy it's an incredible book they're a good food for vegans to consider too because they're more primitive than most plants yeah no small ESCs john used to call them ocean cupcakes well they're delicious it's a great source of protein but it's also they don't have any nerve endings and they're not feeling any fight it's a sea vegetable yeah it basically is we an issue or some people not myself but some people have an issue with things that are capable of moving yeah for whatever reason we just decide that don't eat that but if you want to talk about something sustainable like mollusks and seafood net mean they can be commercially farmed they actually do have a positive impact as you're describing on the environment incredible source of protein as well yeah yeah and really Oh a complete source of protein not like a very bioavailable source unlike a lot of vegetable proteins so maybe we should do a protein powder out of dried oysters just bro I mean a lot of people are eating cricket protein if you guys ever serve any insect dishes I got a letter last week that someone found a bug in their salad in there you know sometimes the people are a bit they want the cake and they want to eat it too because they people want organic right and we support that we love that but there yeah organic is no pesticide so that's okay bugs aren't bad it's like the idea of bugs being like roaches are bad okay most other bugs are not that big of a deal yeah it's like quite you know if we're sir if we're serving a hundred people a day and maybe you know that arguably being 40 salads you know some kind of crazy work to really look at both sides of each leaf we try our best right you know but you know one one will get past us every year I think you're better off the people that that they're freaking out about bugs you don't want them coming in there just let them just give them their money back and get the fuck out of here yeah I agree with fallacy but when I was in Mexico they we checked into this resort and they had a bowl of fried crickets in the hotel like they had some sort of a flavor to them they added some flavors yeah Rene Redzepi and Noma arguably one of the world's best restaurants is obsessed with serving ants really loves them lemony fresh how do i things I think they're crunchy they're delicious you know he thinks they're fine you know of course and he's doing this wonderful Nordic cuisine and there's ads and when it went words and they forage mushrooms and you know there's also ads so why not forge those too and it's a homework they do for the rest of us you know it starts that they're doing the right thing you know people pay a lot of money and fly there to go eat there but you know he's doing some good legwork on how to prepare them how to raise them how to you know I'm not saying his food is based on that but I'm happy that somebody did that part of the research and he'll bring the point up and that'll you know ultimately by osmosis the other younger chefs will try to do that I know they'll normally sit a little bit more so you know expect ants at Nordic restaurants interesting so this is the new trend get ahead you heard him Los Angeles I know you trendy folks are out there thinking about what's coming crickets are a weird one like crickets seemed to be like universally accepted like cricket protein you see a lot of protein bars you don't see too many other insects being like commercially harvested David and I were in New York for Anthony's a memory thing Memorial thing and we worked in the Bowery and you know middle of the afternoon Hudson this is a good know and there's like a little store no refrigeration and there's buckets of clams and you know like mesh bags like you put onions in this big mesh bag and a bin and it's full of giant bullfrogs like looking up at like a hundred little bullfrogs but like like oranges in a box like one two three four five live their little eyes just looking up like this and I was like sure we have frogs in the book but I was so hang on Fred and I've been cooking for years it's like you know 25 years arguably not if not more i processed repository okay okay so of course we can't we just look at the frogs we don't say anything to each other we keep on walking and I go hang on a sec Fred walk me through this because how do exactly this work I know how to do a rabbit I know how to do a hare I know how to do a duck I know how to do any fish any seafood long as you get a case of frog in the kitchen what's your first move right now what's our first move so we take the fly frog do I put it on the cutting board do i hack its legs off and what do I do with the 60% remaining of the frog this is a tasty broth yeah is it is it ground does it end up in dumplings where is that other part of the frog going is it soup is it broth you know that's how I'm phibian right it was fascinating did you experiment no no no I'm mortified and after that we went to Tony's memorial it was in a Chinese restaurant and I was just like I couldn't eat because by default everything had like frog in it in my head so you were freaking out just because they were alive staring up at you no because I know that the legs are delicious right I know that you know if I cough the legs off and I peel the skin and I dredge them in flour and I fry them and I serve them with garlic cream that they're delicious there's delicious chicken wings what I'm worried about is the frog is so big and you know the the discarded part of the frog is the size of a softball right so yeah it's like eating the stem of the Apple and leaving the apple in cooking we don't throw stuff out right right so I want to know what happens to that part in Chinese cookery or French cookery well did the place that you guys were at was a Chinese market yeah one of those hole in the door kind of lighting supplier and it was like I we got it there were climbs there were wink periwinkles there were like all like I've never processed frogs in my career really you know when I've gotten fresh frogs I was working in France and it was just the frogs legs and a button and a basket but even then I would wonder in France where does that other part go I know this is a very disturbing what seems like there's got to be an answer to this maybe I don't know these are people that I would call wonton stuffing right I'm sort of boiled and grown I'm hoping they're discarded the video is graphic let it go let it roll okay I'm not gonna put it up on you put it up for us so we can see it here we go okay oh no they don't even bother killing them first they just do it on the fly legs off Fred that's exactly like Brazil ease okay so they squeeze it out once they cut the head off they they squeeze it out like a would you describe that like they're peeling it now right so then they squeeze the they squeeze the innards out like it through the neck cabbage like the last of toothpaste yes that's a good way to describe it yeah okay so then they take it now it looks like a man because it's headless it's like a headless man that's like one of those two mannequin that you you used to draw bodies there yeah I would I have a what point you put the batteries to the hind legs batteries you know in like high school all right you you put the little battery in the back cigarettes in them in the boughs he's chopping him up it seems like he's leaving the bones on is that what he's doing yeah okay so you know what it's really great that we're watching this because I'm a lot less horrified by the whole prospect of it so he's just hacking it up bones intact and then and chucking it into a basket so it doesn't look like they're missing much other than the guts so it seems like the innards and then they seem to be boiling all that stuff and okay so they put it in a soup with the bones intact and you just sort of I need that yeah it's funny if I had to make a dish with that I'd make the soup with daylilies inside water lilies I mean like a soup with frog no leaves look like lily pads right those are hot right now in cooking do you guys try to do that like add some of the ingredients of the native environments of yes yes yes tricks to cooking one of the best tricks are cooking when you have chef told me this a long time ago in France he goes well chef what should I cook the lamb with he goes see see what would it heat if you had a lamb what would be growing around it mmm and it automatically just scrolled down if I had a lamb and an acre of land what would be around it there would be turnips there would be carrots there would be onions there would be apples there would be pears there would be time there would be basil there would be garlic there be so just there you go you know more idyllic environment yeah the problem is is when you have lobster and you cook it with mangoes right where lobster is where it comes from there's no mangoes so the recipe doesn't cents might be delicious but it's dumb but butter lobster and butter they go together lobster butter potatoes what else grows their onions and clams Prince Edward Island okay small island in the Gulf one of the provinces of Canada we have cows so you say no and lobster the rich three resources no not the actual environment it's a rabbit if you have a rabbit in your backyard or you know in the line of sight what can you see there rabbit with apples and carrots make sense yeah but what if lobster and mango is fucking delicious yeah but it's in it you know it's for other people to do we have our principles academically incorrect academically correct that's fasting one of my favorite pizzas don't get disgusted at me don't hate me pineapple an inch off pineapple an anchovy that's right pineapple and a half in there pineapple and anchovy it's goddamn delicious I fucking love it I don't care what you say who does that that's like you'd invented that I might have that's good now we're gonna try I want to drive frog soup with lily pads and pineapple and anchovy with both hard with the pineapple and hard with the anchovy do you want to write a book three with us no I'm good at elk steaks and I know how to order pineapple and anchovy pizza I have to say that when I see your the picture you posted your meat cooking not bad it's always on point thank you very much because there's a lot of hunters that post up pictures of their dinner and it's not because in like you can take pictures and they look beautiful with like of anything it's not the quality of the picture but the food is a little bit mmm yeah some hunters don't know how to cook we have a lot of hunters in Quebec and sometimes you know the hunter will bring by the because I shot this beautiful moose David it was a 2,000 pounds or 1,500 pounds and he shows me a picture on his phone and then he brings me a jar of the spaghetti sauce he made out of the moose really that's what you like you shot a majestic moose in the forest and you made spaghetti sauce with it and I put Kiwi in it because it tenderizes the meat well listen spaghetti sauce with ground mousse is delicious I'll give you a tip you gotta have you gotta have a high everything I eat the whole thing right I mean I'll I know how to make the roasts and I use the ground for a bunch of different things and I just think that if you if you do it properly or if you if you want to handle it properly you've really got to read up on how to cook wild game as opposed to how to cook anything else there's a very little fat content it's a tricky kind of meat to cook there's a tool it's called a lock block in French it's like a big needle with a swivel tip and what you do is you cut long strips of fat and you poke him through the meat oh yeah you don't inject you put like Loreena get you're threading your piece of meat like the loins or the fat that the back straps it's it tends to be leaner so you put long strips of pork fat inside and you cook it slowly enough that the pork fat will melt inside so in every bite you'll have a little bit of fat to knead saying it's an old French cooking track yeah sounds sensational or what we do actually like for the wild rabbit which is extremely dry we'll put a veal foot with the skin so that'll give off the collagen and we'll put a slice of pork belly with it that'll give off the fat when are you guys going back to Montreal tomorrow tomorrow yeah I can't give you meat right it wouldn't no it couldn't get through the border wouldn't work not this way the other way works yes it works if you hunt it and brought it I've brought me back but uh damn I'd like to give you guys something see what you do with it they're wood it's a lot of things our favorite meat but you know it would be sooner be caught with bricks of hashish then then venison as restaurant owners you know like like you know it is not you cannot have any wild game in your restaurant even if it's just for your own personal consumption not really a sturgeon to to is a problem and I've in Quebec caviar you know we have a lot of sturgeon in the Gulf Saint Lawrence the laws are ridic lights out ridiculous hmm if you get caught with like a gram of caviar in your boat you don't have a license oh freeze your bank accounts it's easier a house kind of thing yeah there we go it would go south quick what is the concern is it is such a commercial market for sturgeon caviar is that what it is yeah exactly yeah Wow so people just go that far out of their way to get caviar that they had to just make these it's like a fish right now is worthless if you can't use the caviar right we're allowed that there's a fishery for them they fish leave that sturgeon in the Gulf of st. Lawrence when they catch them they have to gut them they have to remove every egg and dump the eggs into the water they're allowed to bring the meat back to smoke it and salt it and to sell it there is a commercial commercial wild fishery for sturgeon meat but the salt you just put a price tag on the fish let's say it's worth 200 bucks but all of a sudden if you're allowed to harvest the eggs and the fish 15 grand yeah it would just be yeah because they produce a monolithic amount of eggs what's crazy is now you're making it useless because you're throwing it away something that's incredibly valuable and delicious the quotas are very small though let's say if you had a sturgeon license I imagine you're allowed five or six or something like that and the first nations like Mohawks mmm the Iroquois have the right to fish you know we've been on boats where a guy was fishing you know he showed us the traditional technique and it's not sports fishing like the soup they did they like they loved it that's great fish and themselves need the eggs and make soup they put the eggs in it they like are they catch sturgeon 20 minutes from Joe beef Wow Yeah right there downtown like it's a dinosaur yeah what a spirit Wow yeah it's a crazy animal and when you see them in the water yeah you see the scales on them so bizarre that I mean how they're from what a hundred million years ago they look like dinosaurs they really do yeah and the guys that we know that fish them is quite the characters and interesting guys of he's a mohawk and he told us that the biologists put underwater cameras there to look keep track of the fish and they said they see like 16 layers of sturgeon swimming one atop of the other he said I could walk on the fish you know there's that many yeah there's a ton Wow there has been again you know the people don't really even struggle with it at the restaurant but for me to sell a plate of smoked sturgeon tough sell you know I'll sooner sell other things than that you know people aren't interested I think it's a tough sell as a fish let's say as a 200 gram or a 4 ounce piece of fish thing that is so crazy mmm is that the same River that's right Columbia River sturgeon it looks like Fraser yeah Fraser NBC look at the size of that thing that is so ancient looking it's like it shouldn't be here yeah it's a fish that's a bit muddy too sometimes depending on where it's caught and everything so how do you how do you handle it like if you're gonna cook one of those we make Jamaican patties with it we did an old French cookery one of the ways to cook sturgeon is ultimately you apply cooking a piece of sturgeon loin as you would a piece of veal loin of pork loin meat juice even is acceptable you know roasted carrots roasted onions roasted celery roast the sturgeon and bacon red wine bacon mushroom red wine like Fred said so you treat the sturgeon as you would meat it's possibly the best way to treat it as you would fish is not the best you know people got to expect we we were overly fortunate to have you know 300 gram you know like a pound of fish seared in a pan and served with a little sauce was common thing right but it's not the right thing to do if we want to keep things in the water you know for our kids or whatever so people got used to this like a piece of fish that tastes like nothing that you can eat for like an hour and a half because you have so much of it and that's the standard but a fish like sturgeon is great if you have a little bit in a sauce like David made this talks about over like buttery mashed potatoes or like with like egg noodles or something like that it's a great way to do it and it's a great way to look at fish we're like you need actually 75 grams of protein not like 500 you know what is the is there a comparison that you can make in terms of what it tastes like yeah veal loin a little bit I guess somewhat you know braised braised veal collar why do you say blonde ket I do a larger piece of stew like not a small you know two inch block of stew but let's have a bigger piece of stew with a chunk of seaweed in it yeah it's neat it's neat it sounds now I'm hungry for it we do like Fred Fred got the made think of the mcnuggets molds you know because you know the McNuggets have this like no they're there's like four or five different sizes Fred made the mold in the first book and they precisely exactly like the McDonald's McNuggets now we used to do sturgeon McNuggets or eel or eel McNuggets same fishery right we have yields where we get sturgeon it's kind of fun of them at the restaurant it would literally be a Joe beef and you'd get on your plate what looked to be like six McNuggets with a sauce and the little paper cup on the side people what the hell is this I said he is sturgeon Nuggets he'll is a weird one and when I used to go fishing a lot people would catch eels they'd be upset like and then it would go to buy sushi later on in life and there'd be eel sushi like what the fuck is going to different wolf that will feel it's a different failure it's not it's not a true eel in sushi yeah right yeah I mean like the real I'm I can eat bits of it but if we were to like take an eel eel and and just like first you have to put a nail in its head and a nail in its tail and like skin it and then cut its head off and peel it and put it in a cast-iron pan with butter and it's still moving like a snake and the smelly creature it's like it makes you choke you know we had like four we had a little trout pond at Joe beef that I built you know really yeah and it was a bad experience because we had a refrigerator thing to make the water cold you know a cooler and we had a pump but every time it rained it would turn the breaker off and now the fish like drown drown no oxygen Tampa card gave us Emile's and we found him the next day in the parking lot like all the food on the other side of the parking lot in the baseball field where the bleachers right shit they're cooking it and it's swimming at a right side no head and no skin at this point this is a grill what does it say it's a shocking clip of cooking and eel alive in Seoul nobody it's got that's that eel has beheaded and skinned because it's still nervous system is still very intact what is what are those things in the bottle there was his legs that's probably its guts oh look at that and it's like that's real stir-frying I caught one once in Nova Scotia and a hook and line and when I caught it the fisherman next to me said don't reel it in so I just held my fishing rod I wasn't reeling in and the eel reeled itself up my line to the tip of my fishing rod and started reeling down my fishing rod towards me I was a kid I was horrified ever since then I've had an issue like eels I worked in a restaurant in France in Dijon and in the fridge right near the the cook of the hotline the cooking line there was a wooden box with a cinder block on it it's the first day I worked there I was helping out on the fish station and I hear in French and on Gyan come on the 101 you'll ordered up and then the the fish chef says go in their fridge there's a wooden box you take the cinder block off it you just lift the lid a little bit plunge your hand in there grab an eel and bring it back to me I was like kidding right so I literally do that going to the walk-in fridge I pull the wooden box out I take the cinder block off the top I lift the hid it was just literally you know 50 eels writhing together and that's like Indiana Jones you know no they live with it out of water no problem Martin Picard at Pierre de cochon in his restaurant right now I was there last week he has a lobster tank right in a doorway I think they hang your coats right above it and in it there's like eight seals that all shakes them when they come at work in the morning they reopen the restaurant they'll find them like in the cash register in the coat check it's been they have like cinder blocks down now on the top they got a plexiglass top with holes in it so it oxygenates and they're literally pinned down in that tank but even as you're eating and you just see those giant eels and a tank of size of your flag here it's just horrific you know what's the best thing about eels talking about it now what about the flavor mmm I like it super smoked super salted down with a good sugary salty brine they have to cover it yeah like in nuggets like we did but like even like plating that a restaurant David was talking about if you take a fresh piece of eel and put it in a cast-iron pan to smoke it does it's like mustard gas oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's good like it's super I'm a little bit allergic that I guess not all fish but some fish and I when I used to work at that restaurant we would literally like put a knife through its head and into the cutting board and then another knife through its tail so it would be straight on the cutting boards we'd pin down the the left side on the right side of the yield then we'd lift the fillets skinned them score them and then pan sear them with artichoke and country ham and as I was pan searing them I was breathing in the vapors of searing the eel and my lungs would cease you know I'd have like kind of like it would give me an asthma attack somewhat it was wild now is this a popular dish in France because of necessity because of a lack of all right a lot of a lot of old French cooking would be based on what you had in your neighborhood you know French cooking was very different pre Federal Express pre roads you know so eels in French cooking would come from the Bordeaux region ultimately and you know it would be like mcnutt's dungee so it would be an eel stew in red wine of course carrot onion celery exactly like a beef stew and I think also the the thing about it is a it's a dish that you wouldn't make at home so people would go away on Vermont Longhi let's go and eat heal because that's what there was you don't want to have the cinderblock plexiglass case in your house and then they imagine your house with your kids or my kids hey lampreys there's you know in Bordeaux there's some you know some of the famous iconic dishes of Bordeaux is lampreys this is like an animal from dune you know it's like a big hole with teeth they're the ones that cling to the bottom of sharks correct no that's a Remora okay the lamprey is a problem actually now even in America they're coming up in some rivers and attach themselves to fish with their suction cup head they're just horrific suction cup head yes tooth it's like dude it's like that Emily don't yeah what do they taste like probably the crappy like eel we did a dinner for Tonio and he did his second book I think at Liverpool house and I was I we were much younger and I was like let's buy some like daring food you know just Tony Bourdain let's buy something like fucked up so I ordered like two of those eel and I try to make soup with it I try to make everything and again you know the classic joke the best thing to do with it is to put it in the garbage like that was that you are you make stock you reduce it then you throw it away I'm sure there's a recipe that's good and I'm sure in in case of Apocalypse after the winter sub seeds will fish for that and will eat it but until then I'm I'm you know I'm okay with like cutting my Big Macs in half so they last for two days it was a cool company that I've been following a company online and I think on Twitter Instagram it's kinda called American unagi they're up in the Atlantic Northeast are I think in Maine or Massachusetts somewhere they have some really they're raising eels I think releasing them into the nature and they're selling eels commercially it looks like yeah and like horrific work raising them and raising yield is there like some sort of a environmental benefit of having the heals is that like sting about the lobster and put it away in this freshwater river there are weird animal right again loosely based my facts are old reading but from what I recall eels are cool because they all the eels every year go back to the Sargasso Sea is it true that that's what I remember I is that folklore you think'll tration volume yeah yeah yeah Easter's filter eels yeah so they all go back to this one area that supposedly there's a breeding area for them called the Sargasso Sea great place for swimming and where's the Sargasso Sea it's kind of a southern middle Atlantic from what I recall that's pretty that's pretty safe bet right where the run of the we're right where the mythical plastic patches oh the plasti that's the Pacific you think that's mythical I don't know I've never seen really a giant a real true picture of yeah there's a Sargasso Sea ochio the eels in our last lake in their way wow that's so creepy look at that fucker making his way beautiful video - it is pretty cool Wow there's a guy named boy young slots this his name who is a young fellow that figured out a way to filter out the Garbage Patch and he has been he developed this device and they recently started implementing it but he's been he's been on the podcast before and when is a great detail about it the garbage patch is real see that's the American who knows hey whoa those fuckers just flopping around yeah so they're an American unagi 'he's instagram page we're on right now they're in maine yeah our aquaculture DeMars caught us great oysters there - amazing what about have you guys ever cooked or eaten blueberry bear no we don't mart-mart a in Montreal Marty Baron he's hunting bear he goes and baits every weekend and then he goes in Saxon what's up blueberry bear though my friend Steve Rinella it's is described this to me apparently when bears eat blueberries when they find like it's towards the fall in particular when they're trying to fatten up before they go into the den they'll find these massive fields of blueberries he he shot one in Alaska and this bear had eaten so many blueberries that when they opened it up it smelled like blueberries the the actual fat had a purple hue to it and it's supposed to be a spectacularly delicious meat I thought it'd make sense but you know that it's funny you say that because I was thinking about that with venison before we have some friends who had a venison firm and what they this is it right here this is Steve cooking it on the show show is called meat eater Steve will actually be guest on the show here Friday but see how the fat do to it amazing but he said it's it all smells like blueberry so he rendered down the the bear fat and then because this was all in the field and then cooked the bear meat this blueberry bear meat chunks of it in the fat well if the pigment is a lipo soluble then it would make sense that you find it in the fat but they made they made experiments or friends with the deer farm and what they did they wanted to know if the the taste the venison was owed to the fact that the diet of the animal or the way that hunters traditionally break down the meat in the field the field dressing of the meat you know so what they did is they put a beef like a steer and they shot him and they they prepared him they dressed him the way you would a deer or a moose and then they at the same time did the same thing with a deer and then they did the slaughterhouse treatment like a commercial treatment for both animal and they realized once you you wait a little bit even on the beef before you got it before you skinned it and everything that funky or that like gamey taste will come even to beef you know in fact sure that's what yeast in nature it's probably also they think that you might lack the skills to properly extract the guts you might perforate the gut sometime you might perforate the the bile pouch there parts of the might come in contact this skin will be on too long it's not bled properly as well yeah it's not blend properly and then you know it's not chilled super rapidly may you kill in the morning this the whole Sun is out you know you don't have a fridge with you you have no water and but on the other hand when we have the wild rabbit they taste like juniper like a very very very strongly like juniper and that's that's in fact the challenge is to get rid of some of that juniper taste yeah it's like The Partridge that we shoot at the lake and in fact it's it's like spruce spruce tips and instead of when we cook sometimes we'll cook meat and then we'll we'll even had add a partridge or at home I'll had a partridge or a wild rabbit just as seasoning to the rest of the pot you know if you look at all the traditional french-canadian dishes of hunters they're all like all the games are mixed up you know so you never have this is a modern cuisine yay like culinary fancy thing to have a breast of Partridge seared on a bed of cabbage you know those things are always treated with like I said earlier with fat with like all the spices with wine with cognac with layers of like you know even like organ meats in there and you put a crust over it and cabbage you know it's like that's like we said it needs a lot of skills to eat like good games yeah I've never had gamy venison I've been very very fortunate that I've first of all I've learned to hunt from people that really know what they're doing so we didn't let anything sit out in the heat and make sure we opened it up and cooled it out quickly but one of the things that they do do when guys are deep into the back country and they have an animal and they they kill it and it's even in the summer when it's warm out what they do is they hang it and give it a lot of air circulation it develops a crust on the outside and then they cut that crust back and then the the meat underneath it is sort of tenderized in a lot of ways and a lot of hunters say that it's even more delicious that way yeah it's protected by that by the carrot but across the air is created once it probably starts the bacteriological work starts to work in that crust there's age to process right by which the meat gets tender the first one is the rigor mortis right like the meat rests and the rigor mortis like all I guess all the cortisol and everything that like stiffens the meat at death well the meat will rest and then it's an enzymatic reaction where the enzymes where it can break down some of the meat fibers and the tougher muscles and stuff in French the word for a resting meat that's called phezzan d and phezzan is a pheasant you know because they used to hang the pheasants by the neck yeah until they fell it's a when the beak falls off the skull then they're ready to eat yeah I've seen that before that is so strange it's hard to eat I've had it a couple of times it tastes like death warmed over guys it's a you know a lot did people love strong flavors like blue cheese like Munster cheese in Germany you know so this is because ultimately if you just eat it fresh it's chicken of the woods really right so good yeah by letting it go a little bit letting it rot a little bit they get these like secondary tertiary intense flavors maybe two are talking about probiotics you know you don't those traditional ways you don't always know what you why you do them right but maybe initially they're like you incubate you know you immunize yourself a little bit you know it's like the taste is you got to love it after you're used to it but initially it might be a way to have some of the bacterias I think you talked about soil based probiotics before I read about that like we're realizing that like okay yogurt probiotics are not the whole thing you know so maybe there's soil based probiotic animal-based probiotic maybe we're completely wrong about with flora we're ingesting and maybe that was like a way to get your flora yeah makes sense I guess there would be some strategies for taking that stuff in but I would think flavor-wise it would I mean because pheasant if you just eat it fresh it's delicious it's light it's very nice like I would think that unless there was no other way to store and they didn't have a refrigeration which of course they didn't when they first refrigeration is a super modern invention if you look back I worked for chefs in my apprenticeship that told me stories about their apprenticeship and it's like night and day they said when we woke up in the morning we used to have to fill the ovens with coal you know and go down to the ice locker and drag an ice block and through the what's that stuff called the wood sawdust sawdust shed and but like I was like what Wow you know I said a lot of these old French restaurants that are famous had coal-fired ovens and ice block fridges and the apprentices would live above and they take shift you know one night it'd be you that would make sure it doesn't die because otherwise it'd be hard to start again you know it's real cold and burn everyday all of it all the time the restaurant stove was ultimately was also heating the whole building as well the hotel was heated by the restaurant Wow well it makes sense I mean it really does but there's not a lot of animals that they would let get that funky other than shark the shark oh they're in Iceland or a double shark there's a Korean dish that I'm actually curious to try escape wing that is fermented but until it gets that ammonia flavor you know like you smell a camembert and applause and you smell it smells good funky cheese then you you go a bit deeper you know bigger width and then you're like wow Windex you know you got like the ammonia and some people look for that different cultures are in two different flavors a friend of mine Andy went to Calcutta three weeks ago and came back with the number one candy in Calcutta or in India it's just weird candy called pulse if we had one right now all three of us it's a repulsive candy that tastes incredibly of sulfur and fecal rot but in in India that's the candy like people love it you know as well in American winemaking and French winemaking there's things and winemaking called fly you know using the flaws of wine in France and natural wine making organic wine making will always be volatile acidity and Burton oh my seas volatile acidity smells in the wine vastly of vinegar and Brettanomyces smells vastly of fecal matter barnyard fecal matter you know these in North American wine and even in French wine are considered as flaws you know in Japan they love natural wines from France that have high volatile acidity and Breton oh my C's smells what would be ultimately considered a flawed wine in France in natural wine world is considered a delicacy in Japan in the natural wine world Wow so do they purposely take ones that have that funky smell and ship them off to Japan some winemakers you know that the wine agent will come and visit the the cellar and usually the winemaker will point him in the direction and say maybe you this might be for another guys yes yes this is what we like I figure like nobody right now will come up and say it outright but I believe so and there I don't stop this there are Japanese winemakers now all through France that work in a very funky way and are more or less you know pushing those wines into the Japanese market ok disgusting so tell me what the name of the candy is again pulse to spell that pul se it's a green mango candy yeah it's originally it's a classic snack right where they use the sulfur salt it's called black salt and they put a bit of chili and sulfur salt on mango and I have to admit that when I had the the real green mango with the sulfur salt is not that bad that candy was like pushed it's like the mega warheads you know that we had as kids I wondered too sometimes like the gamy flavor of the pheasant the cheese that is the eel that that is I see it sometimes as a bit of a like you know the ghost peppers a bit of a pissing contest between yeah you know like right it's like no one could possibly enjoy the taste of ghost pepper no no it says it doesn't even have a taste I mean you even responding to that taste I won't even try it you know who you know who loves that you know Olivier yes I'm like those guys they have like well they watch like Game of Thrones they get together and they oh yeah and they have like their Olivier album mercier whose fighter in the UFC yeah and they'll have like Ghost Pepper parties you know and then the next day they'll go to comic-con and dress up as superheroes and then play some online poker and then eat more ghost peppers it's also a UFC fighter he's a very extreme human being he's a funny kid he's very very very nice guy yeah guys brilliant know that he was a trained killer you would have no idea have you talked to him it just seems like a joke yeah he's a sweetie yeah yeah good kid and it's a good for us it's interesting you know we we actually have a bit of a chapter in the book where we talk loosely about those guys in that relationship well you guys sponsored him or something before before the Reebok thing right yeah because I remember one one of the fights that we did in Montreal we went to your restaurant afterwards and livia showed up after his fight and you guys are congratulating him yeah yeah his his fiancee is his wife works his girlfriend works with us at the restaurant for a long time now and you know we met because these guys it's interesting hey they're super into food and they're open to a lot of things and they're curious and a lot of them get aimed in the wrong direction you know like the brown rice and chicken direction mhm and and you're responsible for in big part for the awakening the nutritional awakening of these guys you know a lot of them go for their gun license now just to be able to hunt they go fishing on the weekend they go for like two hours hike in the wood and like little fishing rod they come back with trout's and we get a phone call he's like hey Fred I go fish for trout so you know what do I do that you know it's it's a great thing and yeah we did we did sponsor them after but then what we do now is we we cook for them post weigh-in yeah oh did GSP at the last fight at Madison Square Gardens they were the boys were there for a week we've done Tim Kennedy for a week and just hung out and cooked meals we send the kids Marco and Fred goes and gap goes Gabriella Pro they go they rent a suite and they prepare all of the meals up to weight cut and afterwards and do they have nutritional requirements for the weight cut and like like the week they do they have a nutritionist there with them but then they they have the cran but my take on that is if the nutritionist writes a plan and the foods not good and you don't eat it then it doesn't doesn't work right they can be but right on paper but if you don't take the pill then you you don't say chicken and kale this much grams this but but we can a professional cook will make the kale delicious or Brussels Brides and cook the chicken properly because the kale could be bad and the chicken and the dry thing too that works that guys are already suffering the thing that works the best in that case is that all of a sudden you have in the room we set up a little table with so it's not like Playstation dirty underwears like pre-fight vibe it's dining with its dining with friends and and whether it's Marco gab me we know we don't talk if you don't want to talk where you want to talk we're here you know and we'll we'll hang out but then you feel like your eggs in that tortilla you feel like your eggs with potatoes or is like it's it's mellow and it helps a lot with just a context of not being like ordering pizza for moom service you know George used to tell us all horror stories you know before some of his biggest wins years ago with George say eating like room service rigatoni and pizza before like a major fight you know so now it's different and it's fun because like David said earlier we have many interests and it's great to be able to explore them like that you know because we couldn't we couldn't do this job if it was for like 12 stoves in the kitchen a bunch of pans cooking pieces of meat writing books about the seasons and tomatoes and starting again like I couldn't do it like we love that being a chef is like one-dimensional really you know and that whether it's like I live here whether it's like going to visit an eel farm and you know like it's it's it makes it worthwhile up to this point well you guys have a great philosophy about that and that's one of the things that really came through with the Bourdain show when you guys were in the ice shack is it you you enjoyed living well yeah everybody has to live better take care of yourself man huh you know turn your phone off sit with your kids listen to things brilliant things you know find your phone off and come with stories I had friends I I have all my children now I'd love to sit at the table and I'm quiet I just let them talk and ask me questions and watch them and it's just the best it's better than my relationship with my kids better than any relationship I have with any of my best friends and my kids are more interesting my family is more interesting and it's work to stay and you know contact with your family and even the staff you know I enjoy very much working in the restaurants that we've built some I work five days a week with people that I've been working with for 15 years these are important relationships it's not employee-employer it's if you quit and you tell me you're leaving I'm gonna be so I'm gonna go my car and cry I've been working with you for 15 years my relationship that I have with many people I work with is intimate I've seen their children boring I've seen them go through breakups I've seen them their parents die I've seen you know like we go to war every night at six o'clock 150 people are coming to eat in the next three hours in four restaurants we you know it's a job that's so good for high-stress environment for five minutes for two hours it's week we got to walk properly we got a we're we're knowledgeable of each other's space there's a ballet you know when you're washing the glasses and the food's coming out behind you you know we have a sixth sense the know to move not to get the plate to burn your elbow and you know this is ballet we dance every night with these people and for us to think that like and most people still think that we're behind the stove cooking I've got more phone calls to get help finding a doctor therapist whatever you know nutrition is for the staff then I got calls about recipes or food you know our job is I'm an expert in drainpipes artisanal plumbing artisanal electricity artisanal refrigeration I know about three pouring now you know like Sarah Mary decrepit old buildings and you can't you know we're running a restaurants with employees and a constant burden of payroll and we can't just call everybody all the time oh so you know they default any good cooking school today what fred is saying and fred is the example of what a great chef should be to be a very good cook a very good person with people's skills but should also have a minor in electricity plumbing and refrigeration technology aid you know even even now like we both we both don't drink we both I wouldn't say a health kick but just like want to be there you know mind and body we want to be like president and that's that's we built something cool I want to appreciate it not because I overlooked that that's that like people don't think about that when they get into this job you know they they think that's this warrior thing this we're savage we're gonna drink we're gonna party we're gonna do this know if you want to do that till you're 60 and then get a little cottage and write paint watercolor by it but buy a sailboat you have to think about it you know it's like you can't live that life of drinking and you know why do you think that life is synonymous with chefs we've been promoted and taught ultimately that you will get paid you will make money you will persevere if you understand how to promote excessive eating in excess drinking you will be recompensed if you build a place where people come and eat too much and drink too much and that spend too much then you will be able to have a life a car a house and raise children okay so it's all good first you have to learn how to cook then you have to learn how to run a restaurant then you have to learn how to what a restaurant looks like and how to run and you know how to host how to host what the playlist should be like how to fix a plumbing disaster how to fix an electricity disaster how to fix a staff situation disaster how to run a clean house or people are working together with all their different idiosyncrasies but for my whole apprenticeship alcohol was a reward you know you did a good job tonight drink you know and then it went from reward do oh shit there was like a bloodbath in the restaurant you know we had to pick up this guy at the hospital okay it's not a reward let's forget about it let's drink you know and it was it was always there you know that's great service let's have a drink you're in the food industry but you're also in the wine industry because 50 percent of what you're doing is selling food to people and the other 50 percent of what you're doing is selling alcohol to people so by default you're part of the people that sell a liquid drug hmm and dealer in that you're in that world every day you go to wine tastings you talk with people that sell alcohol that bartenders you talk to people that sell wine you're partaken eating and other your colleagues restaurants and drinking wine X thing you know you have a little bit of celebrity you've been open for 15 years and you look back and you go the seven days in a week seven days in a week and I drank six of them I don't feel good on Sunday I'm just kind of recovering and then what happens is one week turns into two to four and then you kind of look back and you realize in 2017 that you may have drank 48 weeks out of 52 you know and then it goes quick then it's ten years near a ten-year restaurant and you been drinking five days out of the week for ten years and then all of a sudden you kind of have a problem you realize that like my day-to-day is based on food and wine right now I don't want my it's not making me happy I've had all the wines I've had all the foods am I better for it not really what am I better for restriction eating less eating clean drinking all that spent very special occasions do you still drink especially I don't I'm completely sober no did you make that decision based on the idea that you weren't able to control it or but just that you I'm one of this decision would be to just completely eliminate it textbook case of a person who couldn't drink yeah I tried several times to stop I googled it I read about it it didn't work I was intervention by Fred and my managers of the restaurants in January 12 around their 16th I think we figured and of this year yeah I'm eight months sober something congratulation thank you and really good thank you thank you look health I'm happy man I like the skin every yeah it's amazing when that happens conversation like I was angry for a long time you know I had a like you know it's not only alcoholism you know I think all alcoholics are codependent somewhat you know like it's just it had been part of my whole apprenticeship not being sober for so many years it was all under control and funny for a very very long time it was always a big part of my life drinking wine eating food until it wasn't you know then one day I was you know 45 my relationship with alcohol changed I became dark I became unhappy I had success my beautiful children I was not happy you know I tried many different things nothing worked I was intervention by people that I work with that are dear to me that I love very much I guess that loved me they're tired of watching me you know make bad decisions and I just went to a great rehab called Chatsworth that educated me you know I was sitting in a classroom with a pad and paper for six hours a day learning a about the disease called alcoholism learning about a disease that 30% of the population has you know and how and why I was an addict you know at first I was an addict with food then you know at a young age after a traumatic event then I was an addict about with beer then I was an addict with marijuana like we know all drugs and then I was an addict with wine follow up a couple more traumatic events into my you know horrendous apprenticeship and the stress of leadership in these restaurants and you know one thing led to another my relationship with alcohol became not positive with help I understood through the education I understood and now everything's great it's funny too because I started as an example you know I don't like to tell him but maybe it's a little bit of mentoring you know I was the canary in the coal mine for Fred I decided I was like fuck you know after Tony passed I was like you know I was I remember I was working in a new project doing tilings and that's like I heard the news in the morning I went I went to tile all day and then I couldn't wait to get home and have like two bottles of wine and I was like why and we were the same about that it didn't matter like what we loved at a point look for example we loved MMA right we loved going to the fights we were like so fortunate we'd go and see you we met the Fertitta brothers they we discussed like we we sat with them at dinner table we met you we met all those guys David loves winemaking met all the winemakers we met the best people in the field that we loved charmed life not happy not happy like ungrateful fucking little pricks well you know I think part of the problem is that alcohol is a depressant correct just you you get down it just it brings you down it brings you down it brings your energy level down it brings solvent I'll cause a solvent and it destroys your soft brain tissue you know I was taught that in rehab so would you drink acetone I don't know well it was made by a lovely French vineyard with barnyard Roma but do you do you miss anything about the flavor of wine with a meal or anything you ever tried nah I don't even know I go to wine tastings I was just at raw wine and lots in Los Angeles I went to taste all the natural wines beautiful natural wine festival and you can taste them still I taste them I don't swallow I rinse my mouth out I'm very much involved in natural wine and the and and that and viticulture reading and all that stuff that's gotta be so weird to have a mouth full of delicious one just spit into a bucket no it's the same really yeah it's like cuz that's why did I drink wine I'll factory the nose the flavor understanding the winemaker his philosophy the the geography of where the wine comes from his work with you know with using organic and biodynamic viticulture not using sulfur just making this amazing organic beverage with a very little intervention natural wine without side effects is I don't have to swallow it because the drug is the same drug that it's in that's in all the other ones right that they can't change the flavors what's different yes you know and what I like is more of the story the guy the vineyard the varietals this you know would you eat at a fine restaurant and have a delicious steak and we do a wine accompaniment and then just spit into a bucket I've done it goes to the bathroom I was really worried shut his mouth and he goes to the bathroom I was worried oh what a mouthful of wine I'm Raj Ryan Ryan grave our friend from Elena that worked with us for years Ryan goes to a restaurant asks for a bucket people in the wine business and they all drink wine and he tastes the wine and he has discussions about wine and he tastes it and spits it and you know he's an alcoholic yeah he's a recovered alcoholic three years but he's a wine buyer and he's very much involved he was my mentor when I got out of rehab because in rehab they were telling me you may never be able to go back to the restaurant what yeah and I saw a risk of reoffending yeah and I was like I can't like I go I don't know anything else like I have no education I've been in kitchen since I'm 17 way too late for med school and we don't do well on adderall so don't want a clean iceberg lettuce at the fruits and vegetable store and try to make a go of that and you know it's funny to like even like the alkalis beer non-alcoholic beer it's better than alcoholic beer Heineken zero zero man Chris Chris outstanding really Heineken zero zero oh it's that it's really good that's fine well I've only had like O'Doul's no it's not good okay so so Heineken does it correctly the the order of non-alcoholic beer okay my head is Heineken zero zero Carlsberg zero Grolsch zero roll back oh yeah zero and then everything else is not good after they let me add to that because I'm also celiac right and there's a gluten burg they make in Montreal that's no gluten and no alcohol now you can insert any joke you want people are signing off the part about meat though eat meat I'm sure I'm sure that this is that's fascinating though that you actually still taste it and still it's almost like if you're a herring a heroin addict just scratching the skin with the needle we don't yeah you know you know they don't recommend that no my you know my therapist and the people in rehab do not recommend that I taste wine and spit it well sure they don't but I have friends again I know a lot of Sommeliers and even I I know winemakers some of the most famous wine makers in the world I've met in Burgundy Adonai abt that are completely sober Wow cuz they wanted to break this cycle of my great-grandfather was an alcoholic abusive person my grandfather was an alcoholic abusive person my father was an alcoholic abusive person and I didn't want to take over this thousand-year-old winery the legacy of my family I didn't want to work here and I'm sure like you know what all the epigenetic stuff if you don't drink when your kids are young and like there might be a thing where you can stop the passing of the gene you know but you did so brought it over how'd you do fine yeah yeah well I did no I was the realest sobriety wasn't this was a very crazy sober October because we added this insane fitness challenge so I was literally working out between three and a half to five and a half one day six and a half hours in a day yeah it was insane one day I did five and a half hours and I did another hour at night six and a half hours in the day it was we were trying to kill each other to see who could get the most points we had a fitness tracker we wore this heartrate monitor I heard that Shane would score up the amount of points you would get who wouldn't I want right there if you get a 70% of your max heart rate you get three points per minute this is how crazy got 70% of your max heart rates three points per minute 80% and above your max heart rate is four points per minute one day I got a thousand points so just think about that think about how many minutes you have to exercise at 80% of your max heart rate to get a thousand fucking points so you think sober help you with performance or recuperation I think I was on drugs the entire time this is what I think I think I was on the endorphins that come from long range cardio there's there's there's a what I was called that don't I don't give a fuck drug there's you get this this feeling when you do car like everybody was talked about runner's high and I never really experienced it even though I worked out really hard my whole life I'd never been into like long range cardio I had never done hours and hours of the same activity just droning on you know either on a bike or running I've never really done that I'd run hills for the most part and I'm sure a benefited me and making me made me relaxed but it's at a totally different level when you're doing it for three-and-a-half hours four hours a day it's true survival mechanism the kick said it's that but it's also you feel wonderful you do you have zero anxiety and you're still benefiting from that oh no that's what's interesting like I've been out of the house for a week now because the fires so we've been running around and the kids aren't in school so they're here hanging out with me and they you know we haven't had a chance to get our stuff together it's it's been very stressful so I haven't really been working out much I've only worked out like once or twice this week so I have more stress I feel like a little bit more tense a little bit more take a deep breath calm down during October I had none of that know that I felt great I felt like I was like if you could take how I feel and put in a pill form and give it to people everyone would be hooked on it because you feel fantastic and I never understood that I would see these people running every day and I thought they were just exercise fanatics like they just want to be leaner or they want to just kid maybe their body obsessed yeah yeah maybe that's what it was but I think they're drug addicts there are natural drug addicts but in a very positive way I shouldn't call it drug addicts endorphin junkies that's what they are it makes sense to that you would every cycle in nature it's like feast and famine it's like running and resting you know if you follow if you're a hunter-gatherer you don't hunt every day you know you follow a cycle you suffer for a month you'll hunt you'll drag back the meat the meat home you'll eat a lot and then after the next month there's you'll be quiet you'll eat less and then the next month so there's this very little exercise program out there that look at it like that but if you were to look at it over a year maybe you'd see it like I see no October's more quiet I'll do my my month in October November will be quiet busy with other things after that I'll go back to it in December it's better for the Soul too you don't have this obsession looming over you that you have to do it tomorrow morning and at night and like you know well my take on it was a little bit different my take on is that everyone's anxiety levels and all the different stress and all the things we deal with a lot of it is because your body has capabilities and you're you're not using even a small percentage of those capabilities so it's always like what are we doing we're going go we're gonna go oh yeah and we're in traffic you're moving quickly so you're constantly aware of all these cars around you and there's all the stress and there's very little physical release that the body takes part in and for most people I mean the great percentage of our population lives a sedentary lifestyle they sit in their cars until they get to the office they sit in their office until they get home they sit in front of TV till they go to sleep this is a giant percentage of our population or the number is yeah whatever it's very normal and occasionally they work out and when they do it's a struggle when you force the body into rigorous exercise on a constant basis your bodies all the needs and of the this capacity the capabilities that it has all those needs are satisfied so what I found is incredibly low anxiety levels and I didn't think I had anxiety I'm not an anxious person to the point where I thought about taking medication for anxiety like I'm nervous or but I didn't I didn't know how anxiety free I could be until I did this exercise program for a month see I found that in sobriety the anxiety I was I suffered and Fred suffered from anxiety our whole careers every day 200-300 people are coming for dinner my you know it was there at my head crippling yes is there staff there's 300 people coming it's never goes away there's always people coming for dinner it's our throw happy 400 people every night but you know when I was drinking that would just keep the stress going now I'm fine it's gone there's this magic number it kept on hearing in rehab and it kept on hearing through theracords 16 weeks man 16 weeks I was like yes shut up fuck you know what's this fucking guys always telling me with these 16 weeks they're like 16 weeks man watch 16 weeks the morning 16 weeks that morning I woke up that morning at my phone said up to 16 weeks and I had this peace and this joy and this childhood innocence that I hadn't had in years on the day 16 weeks not because I'd been premeditating in my head and I was looking forward to the 16 weeks I didn't believe in it but it was literally 16 weeks of an sobriety that brought this I was clear that the drains clogged that had no problem I'll be there in half an hour yeah but guys it should be just don't work the lights are out in the restaurant and five tables are unhappy mmm coming down do you think that some of the anxiety was just your body responding to the fact you were poisoning correct no I think it's the psyche creating reasons for you to drink your mind is telling you you're stressed I have a quick remedy for it yeah why don't you try drinking's that makes and you feel this way what's your go-to I'd be like I could taste sometimes when I'd fall into special situations at the restaurant three tables I don't like couple of criminal elements behaving badly at one table you know maybe I'm the border of lacking respect of their waitress I might have to get involved and I could almost taste Chardonnay in my saliva glands yeah your brain still plays the trick my brain was making me high before the high I was like why do I taste Chablis in my mouth I think it's the same with sugar addiction too you know where people eat you eat sugar lots of carbs mostly carbs then you're like oh man I can't I have to go for three hours without eating I have to bring something sweet with me because I'm gonna get shaky and then yep it's you it's like you're feeding basically you I don't know if it's your gut biome that like changes but you're like feeding a monster inside of you you're not feeding Fred or David you're like feeding something else you know like you're planning a weekend at the cottage you're like the kids are gonna be loud I'm gonna have to bring like two more bottles of wine you know I have to make sure that the wine is cold and have to make sure we have that or like you have to you know have friends like that I have to make sure I have like four granola bars because I have to eat all the time and you know that if you don't have breakfast you have like a quick coffee you can go till like 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon and not shaking and getting cold and sweaty yeah you know what depends especially if you have a good healthy diet if your body's not like sugar sugar dependent I think it's funny a every time you know sometimes we fall off the wagon and stuff now it's pretty solid for a few years I think that two weeks of drinking more water having walks and not eating ice cream and fries in two weeks of home-cooked meals and water cutting down on coffee because that do will fuck with you anxiety you know sure we noticed both of us all of this like so many diseases based simply on overconsumption mm-hmm yeah just period overconsumption cigarettes overconsumption of alcohol overconsumption of sugar overconsumption of meat carbs like mm-hmm restriction brings clarity yes in but restriction diets are one of the best remedies for people with autoimmune diseases oh really yeah yeah they cut down almost everything out of you like one of the things that people are doing today that's very popular but keep talked about this unfortunately is the carnivore diet because Jordan Peterson made it very popular when he was on the podcast it's really fascinating there's a spike if you look at the Google search results yeah carnivore diet it's July of 2018 it goes like this takes off because that's the day that Jordan was on the podcast so he's in the podcast you know fucking whatever amount of millions of people listen and they exhaustion water and because of his ranting and raving about the positive benefits that he's experienced so I go on the carnivore diet people really got into it so I got into it as well what is it about this so I started consulting a lot of actual nutrition experts and scientists and what they believe is what's going on is calorie restriction that because of the fact that you're only Jordan is only eating steak with salt and drinking water that is all he's consuming and he feels fantastic because it's not a lean steak no realistic yes fat so then you can't do too much because you have the fat yes you're feeling full yeah yeah yeah that fat is important yeah and because the see quite a few autoimmune issues that he had went away he's having receding gums that went away he was having severe depression and anxiety and all these different issues that went away you know it's a tremendous amount of weight his body leaned up and scientist scientist that I've talked about you know this is a very new thing for people to embark on this and do it on a mass scale cause quite a few people doing it what they're attributing it to is the calorie restriction is that because the fact that you're you really can't eat that much steak you eat a steak you know it might be a thousand calories whereas if you mean a full big thick steak lots of calories it's takes a lot of steak right yeah but I mean he might be eating two of those in a day whereas if you're eating french fries and soda empty calories your your Gary shape here like way more than that like what do you think an 18 ounce ribeye is if you had a guest calorically 11 1800 817 hundred calories a day yeah because he's not putting cream and coffee he's not having a water when steak when I started eating no gluten right it's fully diagnosed right I'm not making this up I started I stopped eating gluten he gets like every day what does that mean everybody gets crazy about the gluten so he is we don't want it like what I said but what does it mean it's like no but what does it mean no gluten it means that you don't go to MIT you don't know drive-through you know slip right there's no options out there in the fast food world there's no so I have to plan my day sorry like I'll eat a piece of meat for breakfast with poor eggs or whatever and then I won't eat until like show up at work or at home later and eat so it's what you've excluded that counts yes it's not that the steak is so good for you right is that you're not eating all this processed food anymore because you can't eat it anymore that's what the scientists are saying but the people that are pro meat it's really fascinating because they're just as culty as the vegans are the people that are the the real Pro carnivore diets they want you to think that it's the meat that's healing them the meat that's helping the meat that's making them lean to meet them well it's not hurting you I mean it's it's nutritious I mean there's a lot of real nutrients in red meat and this is also a problem with a lot of studies that people have a lot of vegans love to sight about heart attacks strokes cancer in relationship to me these epidemiology studies that whether they're essentially is they're saying look when you look at people that eat meat five days a week these are the people that have higher instances of cancer higher instances of diabetes all these different things well they're not taking into consideration is they're not just eating meat they're usually eating a cheeseburger with fries and a soda and there's all the sugar two minutes before dinner and all bullshit that's it that's involved with the meat there's not any studies that show that people who eat only water 12-ounce grass-fed steak with a good plate of sauteed spinach and olive oil and garlic that these people are getting cancer no sure there's no not on that it's nothing can't make a nutritional study it's impossible people fundamentally lie so you cannot have people you cannot say like this is cocoa fat and beef tenderloin I'm gonna give you a weak portion you go home then you come to report we do blood tests you get anecdotal evidence from people they talk about their own personal diet but yeah it's it's it's very difficult and it's also very ideologically based I mean whether it's on one side with the vegans or the other side with the carnivore diet people I find the same psychological characteristics in both groups they want to convert people they want to proselytize they want people to think that their way is the right way and they they are not honest about health issues that they're having you should make like a conference on the deserted island you know a rich man's castle like a Bruce Lee movie and you you invite the vegans on one side and you don't tell them you're also inviting the other you know when both groups you just have like a kumite well both just think the other group is gonna drop dead any second now the proof is in the pudding if somebody is on your podcast to talk about eating meat he's alive and he's not dead so it works you know like white look any further well none of us are getting out of this alive no that's for sure when it comes to meat do you guys prefer a grass-fed beef or do you like corn-fed because I had this discussion with Tony and he was telling me he actually liked corn-fed beef he's like it's a fattier there's this two schools of thought and then there's two schools of what is quality beef right so one school say yeah quality beef is organic animal pasture raised eating grass flavors different it's not as tender but it is high-quality beef okay then the other of course is you know a cow USDA prime grant corn-fed incredible marbling ridiculous fat content restricted motion I'd say a lesser quality beef okay then the other but they also started eating wise they'll pestered at first eating wise you know grant pound-for-pound the corn fed steak will be more delicious okay for some people and then for some people the other one will be in my my mind the grass-fed organic pasture beef with its different flavor for me as a higher quality animal I prefer that taste correct I feel it's a richer taste it's a denser darker medium or the iron taste yeah I just like it better and I do like a corn-fed steak I do like but there isn't in the general public the steak eating public that come to restaurants encounter more corn-fed beef that and the their first judge of character to the quality of that meat is turning its tenderness its marbling it's not tender it's not tender that's a reoccurring thing that we fight with every day at Joby well this is juicy and tender to see the 16-ounce fog walk I know just what tender I know teeth work well we got a snake set back it'll be because it's too tough yeah exactly it's not always usually go to this steakhouse and it's to more tender because you're bringing your serving of grass-fed serve a grass-fed a grass-fed steak that's not as marbled as its non-organic well it's an it's an but you can also have it's another great salad so it's like the natural wine versus conventional wine fight right then we're having yeah but it's also your we're calling it binary now it's like it's only corn or it's only grass no I think the solution is maybe a little bit of a corn a little bit of barley but mostly grass-fed you a brief finish in like quality grains why not and then there's a whole other point like I'd like to braise giant feedlot I like to sell beef in my restaurant that comes from very close to my restaurant you know yeah when we opened Joe beef at the beginning when that first book the first book was written beef was a problem back then you know local beef was kind of difficult and you know we were buying beef from larger coal sailors and we if we didn't know how to read the barcodes on the boxes they would say was Canadian beef but it might not resonate in beef it might be North um you know northern USA beef but we didn't know because only a professional could read the barcode but they were saying it was Canadian but one day I had a professional come into the restaurant and he said no actually this beef is yeah from a company with investitures in Canada but this is from Western Australia and I said I don't want to serve anything in my restaurant from Western Australia that's super far like like you know this likes remove beef from the menu or seek alternatives but it's a business that's complex because there's pastures and feed lots slaughterhouse and Packers right and and it's not like you we have lambs you get a baby lamb that come from the parents lamb and then they farm they raise the lamb and they bring it to the slaughterhouse themselves and then we get a lamb beef is like I think it's like tracing Bourbons you know it's like trading and brokerage and stuff and we're not it's the most sketchy item on a restaurant menu like I know that I bought lamb from you and I know I bought rabbit from you know Beatrice and I know I got goat cheese from this family and all of the products and my restaurant I know exactly the farm the farmer beef is always dicey because beef always goes to the Packer beef always goes to the distributor beef all you know take and the general public only really eats two cuts of beef in restaurants you know three cuts the tenderloin the the the what do you call in English that also coat the other loins the lawn right that's what people eat but in the hamburgers beefs are not that you know there's two big humps and there's two big shoulders and there's a lot of braised so you know it's a it's difficult this is we see that documentary on steak yeah yeah we're in it we were in that's right yeah you were in it right yeah what did you think of that know their conclusions and mmm what was the conclusion well just basically were saying that Peter Luger steakhouse in Brooklyn is a great a steak in the world USDA prime corn fed protects maybe it's good it's good restaurant good good story good history great restaurant yeah I ate there just a few months ago very good yeah very good yeah but but again it's a subjective thing right the right flavor in terms of like what you actually look for and they as they were talking about like your customers saying they're accustomed to a certain type of meat like they were saying that their customers are accustomed to this they're not interested in grass-fed anything I understand that you know they've been doing that for a long time and creating that beef that way and I don't think they should change ever not based on anything right what's a great place we get consistency I mean you go there you get this fantastic steak it's I mean it's so old worldly to and you get in there that I mean how long is Peterloo has been around for God forever forever yeah it's a hundred 20 years or something something insane like that they get the militias is like that at Montreal is very old steak restaurant Moises is a famous restaurant in Montreal and they should you know they do have their beef program and they should not change because there's new conversations happening he knows what he's doing Lenny Leiter and he should do you know keep on doing that in a small restaurant let's say that fred marginal characters like fred and i own i always see it like it's not a those restaurants maybe over public places my restaurant is my restaurant which i want to do what i want in right it's not yeah it's not at I don't we don't listen so much to the public you know I serve at my pleasure not you know because other customers always right it's the customers off and wrong and I'm always right you know cuz we can do salmon play the music and certainly food we want to when I serve the wines we want to and if you don't like it you don't have to come it's art but it's this restaurant for us that's one of the things that I learned from watching Bourdain's original show the no reservation show and that it changed my opinion on things because I didn't have a strong opinion on food before that other than that I really liked it I didn't think of it as an art form and watching his show and seeing the passion his his appreciation for food and for the way it's the way it's grown and brought to table and the production of it and and then ultimately the flavor of it and the taste and and his admiration for chefs and and you guys as well his his adverb Mauritian for it and his appreciation for the way everything's put together made me realize oh this is an art form it's a craft and and you know Tony did something Tony was the most faithful most like we were so lucky to be on that ship with him you know that he took us aboard and you could see he had the same apprenticeship we did you know like suffering and like big Bistro kitchens and stuff and you think about it the guy he didn't make the promise to himself that when he'd get rich and famous he was gonna buy a big house and not talk to people he helped every cook not walk out of the kitchen and get famous but get a voice you know when I was television show the work he did in private is not look like a dirty guy that makes the pasta in the back you know all of a sudden it's like yeah the manager in the suit and the owners but who's the guy in the back yeah you know no he had appreciation for everybody and he had a real passion for the process yeah marginal characters you know there's lots of commercial restaurants in the city of Montreal in any given city that he went to he's able to isolate let's say the marginal characters in every city that you know were you know we're historically bound kind of fred and i practice a weird faction of French cooking called cuisine bourgeoise and only kind of tony and a handful of other guys couldn't look at what we do and go huh fuckers they're up to that knowing something you're rated really you guys are the only people like the last of the mohicans that do this kind of food and we know ya know we can't stop we got to keep on with like what a great guy to get it yeah because nobody does right nobody understands like you know the rabbit-hole we're down Tony did you know the cognoscenti yeah he mean he really did deeply influence my appreciation for food the way I think about it and again treating it as an art form which I just thought it was just delicious I didn't think of it it's like oh these guys are making temporary art to making art that you're gonna you're gonna enjoy now you know and you you you you can't put it on film I mean you can but you're not gonna get it all you're just gonna want to go out and experience it yeah ultimately food is you can't we go and do like we were asked to do like demonstrations you know you can go in a big stage is 5,000 people to talk about food or make like little crackers with smoked salmon onstage food is not fit for a stage food is for a table for us to enjoy you know what a fork and I if we talk about it and go hunting that's that's what food is people offers food shows all the time and I mean I can't doesn't work and it's like what's the concept well you guys can be in a pickup truck and you go and visit your suppliers and maybe I have a bottle of wine with them after I was like dude like we worked hard not to copy or like fellow you know culinarians yeah you look at for a second SARS TV producers are out there just like blatantly proposing the previous show to you again you know well that's one of the things right after Anthony died there was some talk about Thank You Ramsay doing some very similar show and the outcry against it was enormous I mean he was just getting assaulted online it was crazy that everybody that I was talking to our agent who did represents us for our book and she was saying like that was the same all the big production companies like are being paraded people pitching who's gonna be the next Tony right you know I don't want to say that but one of the character and you guys and you could take over yeah you could do it because you guys Trent you know the way it went in West Virginia and it wasn't like Republican Democrat he went to places he's like yeah sure I have my views but let's break bread you know and I always said that that like all our countries are divided on issues but there's nobody that overlaps them with a coherent vision everybody loves each other when there's delicious food on the table man yeah and guys like you with like a clear view and irrational and science-based and evidence-based view on things and like Tony just have such a voice now in our countries that it's I could see you doing a food show food I don't I'll never do a food show and I just can't imagine because you ask questions I like doing shows I mean I love having guys like you want and talking about food but it takes a special type of person to want to travel 300 days a year you know and that's essentially what Tony was doing and I think that has a massive toll it takes a massive toll on your body it takes a massive toll on your psyche I don't family everything it's not healthy there's not enough melatonin or like CBD or like cleanses to help you with that I traveled more than enough already and I've cut my traveling way back I'm down to only ten UFC's a year now and I do you know comedy around that and stand-up comedy but I consciously make the effort to travel much less because I just don't think it's good I just don't think it's good for you and and also that road life you know the the drinking and all that other stuff that comes with it that accentuates all the problems that you have with with travel and I think that's also one of the things that was was dragging Tony down when he would talk about the sadness and the loneliness of being on the road I can't help but from knowing him and partying with him I can't help but thought a lot of that was probably accentuated by the alcohol consumption and you know you guys could speaker that now that you're you're you're clean and you're not experiencing those rugged hangovers every morning I was always worried for Tony that way just said you know that Hotel living planes trains and automobiles constantly and it wasn't like for a year it was like hey it's 12 years it's a sad life it to watch River Monsters at 11:00 in the morning burping Jameson and I'm referring to many occasions in our lives where you're like you're traveling in a hotel room and you are in a beautiful place but like just you feel weird yeah yeah yeah I've taken steps to mitigate some of that one of the big ones is I travel with friends I bring really good comics to work with me on the road so that when I'm in these cities I'm in these cities with friends and we just go it's like they're family so we we go we'll go eat together we'll go work out together you know and try to keep the unhealthy shit to a minimum plus I'm more of a marijuana enthusiast than I am a drinker anyway it's legal in Quebec now which stores it's the entire country Canada as usual we got a little bit the special treatment yeah everywhere else French never on top of it yeah you can't grow what do you call it in cannabis cannabis you can't grow can't grow no and you have to only consume the government's government so you know what they did right yeah it's like you know we have a monopoly liquor board mm-hmm so we have like stores or commissioning or Commission yes now we have the cannabis Commission so what they did it got legal on October 17th at midnight the stores were opening October 17th at 10:00 in the morning the cops were giving tickets to people smoking weed during that little layover time because they knew that there's it was impossible they bought it legally so some people get ticketed for smoking illegal weed line for legal weed hey we just drank the kool-aid on that one I think you know thanks good we'll part more money into Medicare well I think you know ultimately to relaxing of people's opinions and ideas about marijuana and what it is but I also think that marijuana just like alcohol can be used as a crutch and it could eventually overcome your life I like it but I like it I like it every now and again you know and one of the things that came out of last year sober October was taking a whole month off of it realizing that hey I don't need it I can I can function fine without it but it made me more apprehensive about regular use like instead of using it everyday I'll use it a day a week or two days a week or something like that and I and I appreciate it more when it does happen when I when I do get high with my friends you know on Friday night or something like that it's like it means something like we're we're it's almost like a sacrament like we're experiencing a little moment together and just having fun that's the proof that what you just said is like the proof that you don't have addiction issues you see I couldn't be able to prove that I smoked marijuana responsibly once in my life that I drank alcohol once in my life that you know that I did drugs responsibly so I'm fascinated I brought some some of our cooks that were here in LA with us to a restaurant and we had a beautiful dinner and I ordered them a bottle of wine and they barely finished it and I didn't understand the first only I was like what do you guys want more as I think of it I would have paid for nine like right and they had one and I was just sitting there I told Fred I go I don't really what is it like to be in that environment and watching people glass over like si si don't hit them they don't get drunk we used we say that all the time we used to think that like everybody when you driving was smashed no there's only me like that beer goggles realize that like everybody at the restaurants generally like nine out of ten times drink quite responsibly otherwise it'd be just accidents everywhere and violence everywhere you turn right yeah and I realize a lot of the people that I'm friends with drink responsibly they can have a glass of wine with lunch I've me and Fred opened a bottle of wine at lunch we go till 10:30 till we couldn't anymore and then that was it you know the week look what we did last time we came to LA we did the Hell's Kitchen okay we're a judge for showing ostriches who's disgusting ostriches yes burger before Fuddruckers sirs ostrich burger it's actually delicious it's really bloody right yeah and there's that thing for cooking shows like that it's regulated by the Gaming Commission so they have to keep the camera rolling and they're not allowed to touch the dishes because they're the object of the competition so you take your break you go to the green room you wait there cleaning up the kitchen now the food sits on the past there like for two hours and you come back you sit at a table and there's like rare ostrich tenderloin that's been sitting for two hours yeah then they just cook yeah yes and thank ulis in you you have to like judge like wait a minute you you're judging food that was cooked two hours ago TV that's so fucking and and and I felt like again that's insulting nice for you for guys like you know but the thing is like if I felt so bad because there's people who put like a job on hold they left their kids at home yeah I made it I'm in the casting I was selected you know to be part of hell kitchen and then we say something and the guards gonna hate us right now right no this shows great but I felt like I felt sad but that all that to say that whenever we came we stayed by the the airport you know we we say that just at the hotel bar 11 o'clock we're in the whirlpool of the Radisson Radisson or like sysadmin having cocktails and encounters that hotel life can be fucking sad man I know I get it it's like and now we're like completely not drinking they got us a room I wear a sting in the Chateau and I never did I never thought it'd stay there I would really love to get drunk at the Chateau Marmont than you did once but not this yeah that's like a spa you know I've been here forever I've never even gone in that building it's beautiful maybe I did once I might have I think it was there once for like a TV thing that I had like one of those party things in like the 90s I think I went once but it's funny because there's like really like you know like b-list Hollywood stars like hanging out at the pool pink champagne cocktails trying to be cool smoking blunts and try to pick up girls Tony used to stay he's gonna build there when he was writing he used to stay there he told me loved he just loved everything about the feel of it the whole that the dirtiness the Raleigh hotel with him in Miami he loved that place too likes dirty spots the other Riley was fun don't that that's how Tony was you know he's like guys I like old food like you do what if we do a dinner based on like old transatlantic ship like boats like dining room you know yeah so yeah sure gets I Eric repaired and yelled blue bunch of guys he's like put you up at the Raleigh we're just gonna do that one dinner but we're just gonna hang out for a week after you know and we're in the pool and the pool every taking cigarettes oh Tavia was like there with the kid in a rash guard all the time we went to a cyborg Roberto Abreu mm-hmm we went to school there and I was just like starting in killer how long have you been doing jujitsu no I did it for a year solid and I stopped because at a back surgery Oh discs yeah yeah well what's uh what's going on it's totally fixed but Mikey Strausser surgery what did you have wrong it was the nose it was the gnosis so yeah shortening of the disc yeah and then compression and then they they went in and chip some parts out mm-hmm in retrospect and I spoke to some rheumatologists and it's interesting you're talking about like Jordan Peterson because the autoimmune thing can be everywhere all right and now that my doctor says like maybe celiac causes inflammation and yes so many places that's what I would say and all that like maybe the drinking to that it's inclination towards abuse you know this inclination towards depression this you know back problem this it's all related to that and again the proof is in the pudding I don't eat bread I don't eat sweets very little I mostly meat and I feel hundred times better I said I don't give a fuck if it's in my head so sober now four months five months well so it works I don't think that it's in your head but it's definitely been proven that all those foods cause inflammation but I do think that jiu-jitsu in particular is ruthless on your back because of the torsions yeah well it's just you know big people on top you're moving it back at very and very few people strengthen their back that's a big issue and after we're done here I'm going to take you into my gym and I'm gonna show you some machines that I bought specifically destruct in my back I've had some disk issues too and the doctors are pretty adamant about putting me under the knife and I I just didn't like the idea of it I've had many surgeries I've had both my knees reconstructed I know when you need surgery when you don't and the more I looked into it the more I realized that there's doctors that they they have a hammer so everything is a nail yeah like oh that's a nail and we just fucking whack that thing they're not like oh you're gonna have to change your diet you're gonna have to lose some weight you're gonna have to strengthen all those muscles around your back and if if you do do that I find that the results are superior in many cases yeah it's a combination like yoga works wonderfully fantastic yoga decompression of the spine is critical because you're always compressing you're always like well these chairs were sit again these are chairs from a company called fully and they're called capisco z' and these are ergonomically knows we've been sitting in this place it's two-and-a-half hours in the podcast now we don't my back's aren't hurt yes they're they feel good too they're comfortable as like so I knew there was a solution how to find the solution luckily this car this company contacted me and sent us these chairs this is what we needed I try to fucking shitload of chairs before that but it was the same thing with exercises I I knew there was a solution I had to figure out what it was I tried decompression I tried a bunch of different forms of decompression I figured out the best ones you know I have those those things yeah will you hang by your ankles those what the fuck is the name of that company hooks know the upside-down thing yeah god dammit they're a sponsor the podcast sex swings tea Teeter Teeter makes those like just relaxing in those Hank we have one back there you clamp your ankles in just touch back just stretch out again and then there's a bunch of different exercises that I do with yoga that stretch your back out as well we're in a constant state of compression right constant gravity constant pushing you down and with garlic me I'm always lifting weights to some get these heavy compression compression pushing up and I've got a spent as much time lengthening as you do pushing down and you also have to stretch everything out because the more your hamstrings are tight it's gonna pull down in your back a lot of people that have back pains it's connected feet angle looking tight hamstrings yeah I have a theory to that like a lot of things starts in school you know because you look at kids I have two boys and one daughter you know Henry Ivan in Eleanor and they 5 7 9 they can do monkey bars pull-ups muscle ups you know like they do judo they play hockey they're very active but school the way that physically as classroom is designed is wrong it's like putting them in a cast for the next 15 years and then they're gonna come out of high school like I was unable to climb a rope unable to do monkey bars unable to do anything right and then they're gonna go to more school and sit down four more times ya know so it doesn't get enough physical activity and not even close no and not even the education towards it not even the education nutrition it's right and they get graded and evaluated on how well they listen and gym class you know which is completely insane yeah it really is I mean it just that's making them sit down for all that time during the day we're just preparing them for some job that's gonna be unnatural in the first place making good little taxpayers oh and look look at it - this is a model of school that was based on like religious schools you know and and like all Catholic schools let's say in Quebec how did you keep them from like being distracted you know the ruler and the fingers you go to the corner the leather strap now we haven't changed the classroom the schedule and the curriculum barely but there's no more strap so like okay we we haven't changed anything like it's normal that if particularly little boys don't listen in school that well we have to find a way we have to redesign school from like the schedule the design of the classroom the hallways the introduction you know like they have to bring restaurants back into school like cafeteria and all that no but like cafeterias and I don't know if it's you to talk with Jeff Bridges about that because he's in the liked school lunches thing and the problem with school lunches is that if you subsidize half the kids then you have a kid with like a badge here that says like poor you know yeah so the only way to do that and I know some people are a bit anti-socialist but you have to feed all the kids it's like crucial I mean the idea that that's a problem I mean Jesus Christ we're talking about food and and also the sense of community that's established when everybody eats together you're gonna know you're gonna create this rift between students where you establish that one student is poor than the other one's just gonna fuck them up already you know it's gonna already make them insecure let's yeah yeah yeah the labor force with the kids yeah like not to say that we're made the kids work but it's really be a learning experience and people can take their turns preparing family meals inside of the school system is a valuable tool and if it was done and handled with respect and appreciation if they have classes perhaps that showed how important food is I mean maybe even show an episode of No Reservations or you know or parts unknown and you know show how people can appreciate food and what food really is and then how great it would be I mean and also it would open their eyes to the possibility of food is a career of you know of getting into the same position that you guys are in I mean this is something that's never discussed me what was the last time a kid was encouraged to become a chef you know it's like a stand-up comedian you know you never get encouraged a comedian they just call you a fuck up and try to put you on drugs it never comes out when they do a survey and you know 90% of our labor for us inside the restaurants is you could anybody who cooks inside the restaurants is someone who didn't work inside the traditional school system you know we we employ dropouts yeah yeah but brilliant you know we've there's brilliant people on the team they just the school system did not work for them well that's the same thing with both of my jobs whether it's the UFC or whether it's stand-up comedy every one that I'm close with is a fuckup in the traditional sense like we didn't none of us fit in there's very few people that get into stand-up comedy that were thriving in some other career and most of us were extremely frustrated with traditional environments and most of us didn't do well in school because we felt confined and just what couldn't wait to get nightmares about going back to school do you have a BD as a child I'm sure I got it all whatever the fuck it is whatever it is that gives you energy that makes you better at stuff and I got that you know you think they'll call it a bad thing and say like you can't concentrate well I'm fucking bored you sorta sit right nut you treated me something that I can concentrate on give me something that I actually enjoy I got a lot of energy it's not that there's something wrong with me said I have no interest and what they're selling and it's being sold by some underpaid under motivated person who really is just following some sort of a curriculum and they have to do that because they want to keep their job this is what kids are being subjected to all across the world in the most fertile time of their life in terms of their imagination their creativity and their free time the frontal cortex is a sponge they're ready to take everything in the league yeah I mean it's just no one would ever say to some kid who's cracking jokes in class and running around being a fool no one would ever say hey you ever thought about being a comedian like no one says that yeah this never comes up but meanwhile everybody loves comedians people love to go see comedy but nobody ever says to some fuck up kid hey man you might be a comic you know it just doesn't doesn't come up it'll do the test and like David was supposed to be a travel agent I was I was supposed to be a golf pro and won something ya know and then according to the questionnaire and one of my friend who flies planes suppose I think to be a you know a folly artist make sounds of horses with coconuts and stuff ease like yeah yeah that's right that's it they told them after the questioning what the fuck kind of questionnaire do you guys have in Canada the success of restaurant though you have to think though is due to a lot of very sad people that have gone through the academic process I have a disproportionate amount of lawyers and professionals and people who wear suits that love to come to the restaurant and drink why and let the dogs stop barking inside their heads because they're really fucking miserable yeah you know when you spent your whole day in the 72nd floor of the IBM tower downtown and your cubicle punching data into graphs and taking a licking from your boss who's also a suit just a constant you can't wait to get to Joe beef and you know relax or like the Michael Douglas movie there enough Oh enough with is with jell-o jiggler me know the movie with JLo where she he avenges some ex-boyfriend that like dramatizes her and she bet it's great I love those movies what okay there's something about airplanes I don't know the Attic the altitude and the plane that's like stupid movies are great in the sky nothing lasts two days Discovery's quite the movie buff he loves the awning he'll who's like that's a beautiful movie I was like what I don't even know what that's about what's Notting Hill about that's the movie with you Grant oh Christ I wouldn't I can't remember what it's about you know what I love I love the night that the Roxbury start drinking again man we were just you know the Chateau is right by the Roxbury yeah it was yeah I couldn't wait to just get out of the car go walk there take a picture of it and just like try to show like I sent a picture to everyone nobody reacted dude it's the Roxbury mmm you see you saw that movie night at the Roxbury yeah yeah and for me to travel there is do you like that did you like that movie yeah I loved it really yeah yeah interesting same reactions yeah what else is your favorite movie alone in the wilderness Nick prenta key that's great you saw that movie the guy that whittles uh hinges for his house in Alaska oh that's a watched view really just like once a year you watch really alone in the wilderness Nick prenta key can you bring that up on the thing what is that do you know Jimmy the guy runs away thanks thing no no no no I say Alaska the guy who just moves and lives in the woods with the rest of the French love Jerry Lewis now they plan on Vermont PBS as a fundraiser every year Wow Phil dry pod and films himself and he he carves everything you need hunts everything oh okay okay okay I did not know this guy's name see I thought you were talking about a movie this like a documentary Oh myself made dropped off there with an axe and then he builds a house and then he kills a goat and then you know yeah I do remember this guy in interviews that I think I probably saw on YouTube but yeah he builds his own house and log cabins and shit yeah yeah this guy yeah it's like such a beautiful like did you guys ever see that Vice piece about the guy who lives in the Arctic hind mo hindmost Arctic adventure no no fuckin amazing man it's a vice guide to travel peace where this guy got a very small cabin in the Arctic in like the 1970s and he's been there since the only thing he's ever seen from 9/11 is some photographs he had no idea what's happening when it happened he is he still loved Michael Jackson I don't know but this is it this this guy lives alone in Alaska with his wife in the Arctic national refuge and you have to get in with a floatplane and he just hunts caribou and lives with his family his wife is Inuit and they they have children together and children leave and eventually went on to college I mean it's fucking crazy one of their kids was 2 years old died in a canoe accident the canoe fell over in the kid fell into the river and they revisit the spot at the time of her birthday and it's really intense but this guy really believes that people are there there's happier and healthier when they live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and calorie restriction I mean all he does is eat caribou I mean the guy is out there eating caribou and during the time where they're filming this his cabin and his caribou stash gets attacked by a grizzly bear and he shoots the grizzly bear on film he chases it down to the night and blasts it one of the grizzly bears and he eaten one of his dogs I mean this motherfuckers out there living but he like he's a very smart guy he's not what you would think when you think of someone like this you think of someone who is some weird kind of inbred half-wit who's living up there no he's very intelligent very slightly introvert baby maybe introverted for sure what he doesn't seem to have a hard time talking to people so I don't know if he's introverted but I mean he's definitely restricted his is access to dialogue I mean he's out there alone in the forest by himself but he makes a very compelling point that there's a natural feeling that he gets from doing this where everything kind of falls into place he's constantly getting exercise because he's hiking and chasing after these caribou but there's natural human reward systems that are in place in his DNA for hunting and gathering and cooking his food over an open fire and the way he lives he just he just thinks it's the way people really are designed to live we're absolutely not meant to live piled on top of each other within you know 10 a million of us in a square mile in the island of Manhattan you know yeah absolutely do you remember when there was the floods in Manhattan yes all the money in the world couldn't get you out right you have to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to leave Manhattan yeah and everybody else yeah you know yeah and there was a word real worried because of climate change that was gonna be happening every year now people like is this the new normal I'm over Shane Smith that some piece of that's a walkout yeah yeah yeah yeah Shane had to walk out he had some piece on vice where they were detailing the inside of his apartment building like the fucking thing was completely flooded like six feet high and water you know and people weren't worried like this is going to be what's happening on a regular basis now like this climate change thing has changed I've heightened the sense of a you know sense of three kids I it's something that I think about it's something that I have ready you know I bought a generator I have yeah I checked the batteries the rechargeable batteries for all of the equipment that I have I own solar panels I own a duffel bag full of everything that I need to throw in the back of my pickup truck grab my kids and I know which way to drive away from the city to go to the cabin yeah it's something I've planned just because I'm the ward of these small humans whom I love yeah you know it's funny you talked about like restriction again and then and the thing just I'm thinking of preparing you know and the most common thing that people prepare is food you know and they prepare cans and cans and cans of food but still they eat so much of that food that the best way to prepare the best way to prepare would be to start to eat less and and learn how to live at 1,700 calories you know and learn how to live with the people around you because if you're gonna spend like two months in the bunker or in a bug-out location or whatever you're not some like asshole to your kids and your friends and the family and people with you one of the things that happens to people this is really fascinating when when disasters do strike is everyone gets a lot friendlier you know and this is one thing that I've experienced myself this week because when we got evacuated it was 2:30 in the morning on Thursday and there is fire rocks throw from my house and I'm not talking a little bit of fire I'm talking just hundreds of acres of fire I mean it was just roaring over we start to see houses excited see the gas lines explode houses burst into flames and it was right down the street so we're seeing this and you know where we got outside we're in the driveway the neighbors come over everyone talking what he gonna do I go we're getting the fuck out of here and he's like have they given the evacuation orders I said no we haven't but I go it's right there man I go we gotta go I go if it if we're wrong we come back in the house is still here that's okay but you want to get out of these things quickly because they can turn south quickly but there was a sense of camaraderie and community that that happens and then quite a few of us all went to the same hotel including my friend Tom Segura and his wife and his family went to this hotel too with some of my friends from this neighborhood who were all there huddled in together and but there was there wasn't people were a little extra friendly there was a in this is like there was the same kind of feeling after 9/11 when I was in New York City there was people a little bit more friendly we felt that during the ice storm back in the day people were like assessing the street that we live on and then they go well who's got a wood-burning stove I know Roger does come on and then people would go to Roger's house and all of a sudden all these neighbors that just wave at each other were all at Roger's house by the wood-burning stove going back to the houses to get blankets planning sleeping arrangements planning food arrangements and assessing each other giving each other their personal space and learning to how to speak to each other in a respective matter that we might have to do this for several days yeah through the best through tragedy a sense of community was built somewhat or reinforced for a brief moment in time yeah which made going back through our regular lives on that Street better yeah you know yeah yeah if you ever rid of Sebastian youngers tribe no no it's a great book and he kind of talks about that about how in part situations of extreme stress and when people are really pushed those people bond together and they find that these are the happiest times of their life people that even go to war they find that they miss the camaraderie of the bunker they meant to miss the trenches being in the trenches they missed the camaraderie of being together huddled up not knowing what's going to happen in the future but depending upon each other for their very lives that's a thing that happens in very very very busy kitchens yeah you know a bunch of no education guys out of cooking school working a difficult restaurant line you know we're working six guys on six four burner stove every night a difficult menu with a difficult chef and a very busy restaurant those those hours you know from 6:00 p.m. until 10 p.m. at night like it's intimate its intimate like you know you're bending over to get into the stove to get a chicken out I'm grabbing something out of the fridge my nose is in your butt your nose is in my butt you know I need your knife you need my knife it's very very very close quarter is often like some of my strongest relationships some of his strongest relationships are you know the bond that I built with guys that I've cooked on lines whether in Europe or here are unbreakable you know these guys got your back Tony talked a lot about that you know yeah I think people are better off when they're struggling no I really do I mean I think they're better off when they're there they're you know when life creates challenges and there's there's things to overcome and there's difficulties to get through and there's real pressure involved in these and there's physical activity involved these pressures rowing on the galley yeah Centurion and the cat-o'-nine-tails looming over you well all the years you guys have been in business now what what do you look forward to now like what what keeps you going now you have this established restaurant this amazing menu and you know you have fans of your restaurant like myself what keeps you going tiny restaurant where David and I cook you know like you saw the movie the French Connection yes you see when gene Hackman's on the other side of the road it's like freezing in New York he's in a deli with a piece of pizza and a shitty coffee is little leather shoes on the icy pavement and then the French gangsters are in the bistro in the eating like snails and eclairs and like all the food that comes in the little crock pots on the cart at the table if we could open a place like that for like 16 customers that we have the key only we decide to open whenever we want and we don't lose money that's all I lied like I want to build with Fred a tiny little French restaurant that we do what we want a 16 seats yeah all right I can take a 4 or 8 or close it or just a toy to just practice this skill that we've learned all of these years to do this very very weird old forgotten food that's not cool but that I adore you know what what are you like what is in the back your head that you don't bring to Joe beef up you know a one that everybody would know but to do a proper lamb wellington served for two people and a little trolley they still bring out that 12 cheese's on the little trolley to have a trolley just of DS st5 you know crazy I'll call to do crepes tableside to do a duck Lombe - with orange sauce tableside for - you saw with Tony we went to the flambe place in Quebec City in the first show and the first parts unknown and it was wonderful like little land goose flambe and like there were skills like we want to be able to like this this morning we'll do tartare and only makes tableside and that's it or Dover sole so really practice hospitality at the level that it used to be back in the day to bring out the very old porcelain very beautiful silver not ostentatious way just almost in like a kitschy romantic itchy romantic kind of nostalgic nostalgic sense what you know to build a restaurant from the 20s you know do that food handwritten menu flowers on it you know like yeah the appreciation that you guys have for it is very contagious it really is dining is great like you know candlelit dining you know it's you know heavy velvet woodwork silver trays copper there's a hemingway-esque who's the other big guy with orson welles never see those Morrison well interviews at the hotel Pierre in Paris those are just brilliant like you want to just eat yourself to death at Hotel Pierre what he did exactly it's the only way we could build a time travel machine right like read about it it's fun then you go to museum when they see you you see like silverware from sunken ship yeah that's nice but you'll never travel back in time nor do I want to get polio you know there's great great benefits to living now and then now in here well the art of it yeah and and the beauty of it it's like we've grown up watching like this old house Victory Garden all those shows on PBS right we're huge fans and the beauty of this is we can build a restaurant like that put our hands so we it's just a matter of like this is it this year is it next year you know well yeah we're doing it now by the way yeah are you yeah well I bought a farm and he's gonna read I bought a farm I bought a but Fred a farm for me the gag is do it I think down in st. our mother I bought a little farm right on the Vermont border but there's a summer kitchen part this has beautiful brick wood burning oven situation and big window an old factory wrought iron window the room is just begging to have like three tables of four or three tables of four and a little stove and a zinc bar and I don't know he's been cracking out he's talking about going down there in January and starting to build it this is the polar opposite of the theme restaurant in Vegas TGIF yeah I'm not just that but like the the celebrity chef as you're going down the escalator at the airport there's a giant billboard of this latest did you ever hear this story about the first either brothers well no so they called Fred one day and they said we're coming to Montreal we'd love to meet you guys yeah okay what's going on you know we're not open for like it was this that's just last year last week after they sold I think that but they bought the palms great guys love those guys it's fast okay it's wonderful you get a hold of you so they got a whole fly into privately to the to the airport Montreal three Escalades roll into Joe beef at noon out of Tuesday all the boys get out plus help and you know the crew that surrounds them citizens yeah we make a table at 10 we all sit down Lorenzo starts off first I'd like to let you guys know that Joe beef is my favorite restaurant and I'm like what you know this dump you're Lorenzo Fertitta like all over the world you live in Las Vegas everything is at your beck and call like you live in you know so that was flattering you know and we prepared a little dinner for them a little lunch and do we talk then they pitched us to take over one of the rooms and the palms I'm stairs and of course I was flattering we had a wonderful meeting but we knew right away as we were having the meeting that that was not for us and it was never gonna happen we have young children we're in a bad place to at the time tough in our life you know still drinking still yeah it was pretty dark but it was nice and flattering and I think Fred moved them on to Marc Vetri who eventually did the project from Philadelphia and in retrospect yeah I was nice flattering but we wouldn't do that right there's no way we couldn't do Joe beef anywhere else you know people don't eat the dining public doesn't exist unless unless it's on my street so Montrose is such a difference whether the idea is like when before they offered any room there I said is there like a decommission laundromat in the back that's where employees only that we said all the wrong things about 800 square feet that we can make a five table french restaurant there is no hitch against the top floor of the pods and we're asking for the door next to the garbage container in the alley with no windows and they were looking out it's like we were insane you want a five table French restaurant yeah yeah Lorenzo get his brother and his brother was looking at Lorenzo like what did you bring me here we sent them some books now whoa I'm sure they're happy it's such a funny funny way of responding to that we want to give you the top floor the palms in Vegas do a fuckin 800 800 square foot room in the back alley that nobody can access I want to make it so expensive but basketball players think it's too much money yeah well that would be a very interesting spot and I'm sure it would if you did create something like that or someone did an unbelievably exclusive spot that literally has 20 seats available in a night and they only open for one sitting right and we want to build the what's the movie the Roxbury another.we what about the French Connection that restaurant oh the other one with JLo what's that one deeply enough if Star maids made the Manhattan yeah I mean I guarantee if someone did do something like that particularly because of Vegas it's all about who you know and who you I mean if you can get in you know you can get into Joe lambe oh it's Joe lambe is in Vegas right behind the garbage container the leaky one next to the grease trap yeah girls and their Jimmy Choos have to step in these puddles of grease love Boutin yeah on their way to the back then it would i rana CLE enough it would be probably the hot spot in Vegas I know Joe what Lorenzo didn't get it obviously well when they took over the Palms I was excited I know that nine Steakhouse there was excellent I haven't been there in years but I used to be a great place but Mark who's there Marc Vetri's an excellent cook yeah he's really involved in like solid charity things I think he's also brown or black belt in jujitsu really yeah yeah yeah resourceful dude yeah so is the restaurant open I think this week it was wow that's fantastic that's awesome Wow and his food is delicious I try it out you know yeah batteries in Philadelphia is a an institution we opened like there was one thing when when we what was it what was the story of the lobster spaghetti you know we took title kind of like there was a story in Bon Appetit magazine about love at my Marc Vetri doing a lobster spaghetti and fighting with his dad about removing a table to put a meat slicer and I think they have 24 seats and he bought a nice red slicer and he said we're taking out four seats and now we're down to 20 seats his dad thought he was insane and but he insisted that you know they have 20 seats instead of 24 we that story was endearing to Fred and I and he was doing a lobster spaghetti in his Philadelphia restaurant at the time so when we opened Joe beef one of the first items on the menu was our version of the lobster spaghetti that Marc Vetri was doing and just a simple homage to that story that's great later years later we met him and we told him the story and became friends that's amazing so why did it take four seats what did this thing look like well you know you seen those big Italian red Burkle meat slicers no so did he do it just because it would add to the ambience to have this cool thing yeah and Italy this is a pretty standard piece of equipment that you'll have on the bars as it varies it turns slow it's a big blade then rotates slowly it's very very sharp so it doesn't pinwheel yeah it doesn't melt the fat of the hem right so you don't get this white film so it makes like perfectly thin cool slices of perfect hem are their gorgeous objects like we have a couple now we have a blue one and we have a red one gorgeous John one for me Jaime if I wanted like cutting meat that was nice yeah oh you know I saw one of these in Italy yeah sure they're all over the place yeah when when I was in Italy I saw one of these they were they were making sandwiches with it yeah but that's a ten thousand fifteen thousand dollar machine yeah so when you when you remove four seats from your restaurants and put one of those in you kind of like you know you stepping up there on the wrong side of business joke but you're in Joby points you're on the right side of business you guys have something going on tonight right no no no no we did last night we cooked at animal last night Las Vegas cool yeah those guys are grey is awesome and a little weird I've never been yeah John and Vinnies know things yeah they're good boys they have John and Vinny's across the street animal is a restaurant I kind of opened around the same time Joe beef we were friends from back then they can't have too much you all a bunch of times I brought them to all like the weird we're all kindred spirits it's like the same yeah I say we process the restaurant business like we practice the restaurant business the restaurants so similar to ours and weird ways and their relationship Jon and Vinny is like very Dave and Fred it's strange like it's a la job Dave you have these sort of connections with these fellow like-minded chefs all the Pirates on Tony's captain Tony's pirate ship man yeah yeah well he was the one who introduced me to you guys yeah he told me about you guys listen Joe beef surviving the apocalypse is it out now yes sir yeah in a week 24th right forth so November I have it already you fucks sorry but you're gonna have to
