we give zero fucks here at the Joe Rogan experience Canada's rough if you get a drunk driving in America good luck in in Canada oh really oh yeah yeah a lot of a lot of Fighters have issues getting in Canada for fights a lot of comedians have issues a lot of comedians have had issues getting into the Montreal Comedy Festival which is one of the big events for stand-up comedian because of drunk driving yes because a drunk driving conviction any domestic violence yeah anything like yeah Eddie Bravo had an arrest for having a gun on him legally okay he was working for a check cashing place and he used to have to carry large sums of cash in his car to another location and so he would leave with the check cash company and he had a registered concealed carry permit for a gun and so he got pulled over for something and he had to tell the the cop officer I work for check action company I have a legal registered handgun in my car right now it's loaded and then they go okay hold on a second we're gonna put you in handcuffs we're gonna run this so they run it they go okay checks out they let him go because he was not even supposed to be on his record because it was all legal it doesn't matter every time he goes to Canada they sit him down tell us about this you have it gone on side you all right now you take a gun you should to go for the border no no no no no no no no no I was I was working for a company I was I get cut he's got an extra hour every time he goes into Canada that happened to me and quickly on immigration going into Canada would you get a what it was your issue well they asked me if I'd ever been convicted of a crime and I said no and you know I go sit down and then they call me over and they said the guys like you said you'd never been convicted of a crime correct I said yeah he said is there anything you'd like to say about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983 and I was like yeah I got busted in Fairbanks you know for eating a Snickers bar in a fucking grocery store and not paying for it and but I did three days it was Memorial Day weekend I did three four nights in the prison and then the guy said you know 20 hours of community service and this will disappear from your record and you know if you don't get arrested in a year so I always say cuz that's I wasn't convicted of anything right and and they said it would be taken from my record and the guys like no the fact that you were not Alaskan so you're from out of state meant they couldn't strike it from your record so and it's on your FBI record which is what we get in Canada he was nikkor thief yeah I'm a sneaker thief so he's a cool guy I did four days in a FET in a federal medium security prison with no underwear for a Snickers first Snickers what do you mean with no underwear were you wearing anything or just naked I was wearing yeah why did you have pants at the grocery why did you tell us about because it makes it more harrowing come on man I was nine years old that yeah we liked very Twinkie I was Twinkie I was very Twinkie yeah so you were worried it was all gonna go down I didn't worried if I were wearing you know what anything isn't that under the amount of money that they can even bust you for someone he's not in the eighties Reagan wasn't president they were trying to fucking be tough on crime just say no yeah and also I had a I mean what happened was we got in from this 10-day hitch with these two guys I had met on the ferry coming up the Inside Passage and we had this long hitch through the Yukon Territory all this crazy shit and and we get to Fairbanks so the first place we go is the laundromat because we stank right we didn't have that special soap defense though defense so and so we went to the laundromat we put everything possible in the washer so all three of us were wearing shorts with no underwear boots with no socks and a jacket with no shirt and then one of the guys was like he wanted to go to the grocery store because there was a payphone he was gonna call his girlfriend to let her know that he'd arrived on time and I was like hey I'll go over with you and the other guys gonna stay with the bags our backpacks and all that shit you know watch the clothes so I went with him somebody was on the phone we started pushing a card around we were like you know Soviet immigrants like oh so many kinds of you know fruitier because we'd been living in the woods eating nuts and chocolate and LSD for the last ten days and so he opened a thing of kefir his first time I'd ever heard of kefir which is like liquid yogurt yeah and drank that great for your body and I for some reason ate a Snickers bar even though I'd been eating chocolate not much imagination there and then we he used the phone we ditched the card and we left and so there's some security guy had seen us and turned into a thing this cop showed up and I had a knife in my boot and some grass in my pocket both of which were legal at the time in Alaska but it was enough to make this cop not like me at all and he was like this you know eating a poliana cop kind of situation and he didn't like smartass college kids from outside coming into Alaska in the summer and you know Snickers bar walking around yeah fuckin around with Kieffer so he took us he handcuffed us and took us to prison Fairbanks Correctional Center did you not have the money for the Snickers bar yeah we had plenty of money he just didn't want to pay for but it was like well you tell it to the magistrate oh oh you mean for that now that was just like I don't know what the fuck you're just young and we're just filling home and you know and maybe there was a line or something I don't remember right we pretended we were shopping so we put like dog food and shit in the cart you know and we ate our stuff and put the package like we were gonna pay for it when we checked out right right right so I don't know what we were just being dumb but yeah so we ended up being taken to this prison and I have pipe to yeah cuz I remember we were did the intake the guy that liked the prison dude who booked us and you know did the whole intake thing I was joking with him I was like yeah I'm not gonna get that pipe and grass back am i and he was like I don't think so man I was like well you know it wouldn't bother me if it just disappeared and was never even registered because grass is hard to come by in Alaska right wasn't that and so we sort of had a little understanding like cool you're cool cuz he was like what the fuck you have Snickers bar why would this guy yeah what's wrong with that cop did you like hit him or something no it you know he just had a hair up his ass right so this guy was cool he saved us cuz what he did was he said look I'm not gonna put you guys in with the general population you're gonna sleep in the gym at night help you got some cots you sleep in the gym you never let the other one out of your sight the whole time you're here you go to the bathroom together you go the showers together you watch each other's back and you'll get through it all right well and we did anyway it was wild and this was like 83 I guess and so that there's a lot of money in Alaska right from all the oil so the prison was plush it was like every meal was all-you-can-eat really salad bar whole wheat rolls white rolls Wednesday was prime rib day where the cops could pay a buck to eat with the prisoners yeah yeah but the catch was the only 20 minutes each meal so I remember like one day we're sitting there at this table we're like 19 maybe 20 maybe 20 something like that we're sitting at this table and the guy across the table looked like Charles Bronson you remember him Ashton the tats and all that and we're just like this dude was shoveling it in and he looks up at one point he says this is the best fucking prison I've ever been in likes a laundry list of prisons that don't don't meet that criteria standard yeah he his story was he founded dude with his wife and he beat him with a lead pipe and he didn't know if he was dead but as soon as it happened he got in his car he's from like Mexico or Arizona he got his car and drove to Alaska because he knew he'd get picked up and he wanted to get picked up in Alaska because he'd heard the prisons were much better that's hilarious so he might have beat a guy to death and said the way to deal with this is to go to a place that has awesome prisons in that place just happens to be on the exact opposite of the continent
