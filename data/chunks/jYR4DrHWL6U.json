quotes what is a train question fantastic that's fantastic we live in a fucking dream and we really do this is so to see Donald Trump smiling like if you like knocked me over the head ten years ago and put me in a coma and then woke me up today and then and then I was like what's going on who's the president anyway we'll check this out of like get the fuck out oh yeah yeah it's like you remember that scene in Back to the Future was like who's the president mention any time for Ronald Reagan the actor you know exactly what it's like it's crazy yeah it's crazy it everything sure put that picture back up I can't so much going on there no one's ever done that and you know like before this he's like we got to do a photo with the black you know like he said it was like a kind of thing he says we got to get more images of the blacks out with me because every time really important really important every time he takes a photo into the Oval Office it's like you know 12 white guys I'd like to do an impression of him I mean yeah there's a lot but I did yeah to me it's just talk like it but I can't though I don't my voice doesn't make that noise like whatever noise yeah his voice banks area like if there's coming a travel or something I don't know what it is yeah very bad things dad dad's said very bad said that sad thing it's hilarious said the word sad after tweets because fucking everybody's doing it now so funny though the Internet is funny man the Internet the internet you have like I was just a comedy like music you know and I always say like like I know how to do and how to play acoustic guitar which is like stand-up you know I mean and out of like right I've written for TV shows us like playing the piano Instagram Twitter like it's like that's like the saxophone man and I'm like I'm trying to learn the music but it's funny man like are you some kind of common yeah and people are good at it like yeah we were just good at it and like you said you see a meme every now and then like my girlfriend sometimes will be in the you know like whatever it's you know in the bedroom or something I'm you're hysterically mad and I come in and she just shows me I'm like that you know what that's pretty funny and it's still image with three words on it and it just works well memes are a new form of comedy these images with text attached to the image that's just so perfect totally and there's a way to do it and there's a way not to do it because you can't be meta about it you can't be like oh you know you have to like embrace it you can't think you're above it like you can't go like bow here's my me my name's about how me and your stupid it's like you know everybody hates you I mean I I've only made one Instagram thing that like did okay which was uh it was a picture of Ivanka Trump and that silver dress and I was like right when she released it I was a god I got to do something about this and I said to my girlfriend what does this look like she's like a chipotle burrito so I found my shirt I started to pull a burrito wrapped in tinfoil and I and I was like who wore it better yeah it really it was like the only time I did something on Instagram because a lot of times I'll put a joke on Instagram and like get ready Internet I'm about to break you and then nobody like I said but that was that one I actually saw other people posting without crediting me and I was like ah what do you mean right you don't ya there that dress is rude it looks like it looks just like she looks like a burrito he's an odd-looking fellow - there's nothing about the man that would have been jarred cool a low in the beginning yeah you know like somebody does models yeah pick my battles dude you'd have to kill somebody immediately you have to find the first person in your group the weakest person and kill them and for everybody else yeah like you can't just stand there can't it be like yeah you can't Excel some dudes well think about that man you can't stand in this be in a comma you know he's chatting the group huddle and everybody's like you got to take somebody out right then because that's going to show your dominance a hunter Brill maintained at least going to show like this dude is going to do something I see what you're saying but I think if you think ahead you would think well no they're going to think that he's arbitrarily going to always kill the weakest person eventually it's going to get to no one because there's going to be the next weakest person that guy's dead now and then actually like who's to decide whether or not you're weak or you're not weak if you were going to do that the person would have to be either a terrible person who is victimizing the other people right or they would have to have attacked first it have to be so or they would have to been such a piece of shit that people are rooting for you like so chatty and you just ask them dude there's no way I'm still trying to survive like a like a you know the second coming of the universe and some dudes chatty and my group bro that's not an especially is like he fucks up some hunting parties you're out there was sneaking up on pig and he's like oh my god so hot out fuck the pig runs away and everybody's hungry yeah he had he we made it first man I think about that kind of stuff like if a plane crash I already know I'm playing the head dude I'd eat a Vietnamese guy mom because it's easier to start or move if you attack somebody bigger if you eat somebody bigger in front of other people it's kind of alarm people but you get to eat a small person so stature is important I think if you gum down a Viet people are going to be that upset at you what enemies people are going to be super upset what are you talking about they're like dad and there's sacrifice or more understanding of things dude is this a character you're playing no but if you eat a black dude you eat a black lady and her family's there they're going to be pissed so you think it's Vietnamese person we let you slide I think is they be much more forgiving over a couple of day period I think koala relatives you don't think so Ollie one thing no I don't think so I definitely think it'd be super pissed at you especially modernized one but what is interesting is like Vietnam is one of the few places where Americans can go back to Vietnam they don't seem to hold any grudge at all exhibit a they give it a man honestly yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
