four three two one so we get here and young jamie is obsessed with about Leonardo da Vinci is gay and so he says it to Callen and then Callen says as I said the Mona Lisa the Mona Lisa has a mischievous smile on her face and apparently according to art historians I believe that is a self-portrait and that was da Vinci himself in drags this is a conspiracy that's why he is looking back at you with sort of a wry smirk I don't see that rice much junk Jamie please pull up this photograph no this is I think this is real I think this is at least being brown in his book The Da Vinci Code actually talks about it but is standard time at the Tomic movies yes I think it's a professor of theology in at Harvard or he or something like that okay I don't see a sly smile I see there's a chap who lives in a place where the food sucks and her teeth are probably all fucked up a bit soft that softness that dick smile bro these are the Spurs here's an interesting thing do you know that like people did have bad teeth back then of course but the majority of the teeth problems that we have in this country have to do with sugar I thought is the in the water the floormat on the water now Florida in the water that fluoride in the water thing is so sketchy have you ever looked into whether or not fluoride should be in the water well there I know I know that in 50s Colorado had a high concentration of fluoride in its water and apparently the rest look sweet in turns to find out I never forget my poke around I'm going to spoke at the at the board I think it came out of Colorado where there was high concentrations of fluoride in the water and then what happened was they go well there's a cluster of people who are not getting cavities and so apparently fluoride is effective at keeping cavities bang and I grew up overseas my teeth the fucking I had fucking wheat sugar what not so much overseas but I I definitely didn't brush my teeth a lot and I didn't have fluoride well let's let's Google whether or not there's evidence that fluoride is good for tooth decay do you think it's all marketing hype from press I don't know man I've read too many hippy articles the problem is the hippies refuse you because it'll say like natural news letter breath like colons you don't know Matt because there's people that get like all homeopathic on you and you're like okay is this guy right like I'm reading I'm gonna go through 5,000 words here and my busy writer is this horse shit am I gonna ok now I gotta look up the actual studies ok not gonna read this three times cuz I'm stupid yeah and I can't figure out how you lookin for it no evidence that fluoridated water causes cavities reduces cavities rather but that's from dr. Mercola now that's a one though I've posted articles from Mercola calm if people go oh that guy's amazing and then other people go that guy's are fraud it's tough to figure out I've read some stuff on dr. McCulloh maybe read just like the same kind of stuff and he seems to be pretty like he's a doctor but that doesn't mean he's an expert on dude the gay or on looking at the hard evidence behind go to the American Dental Association Florida in water a feeling they must have some seven years of scientific research you guys are lucky yet he's not here he's on an evolution kick now more than seventy years of scientific research has consistently shown that an optimal level of fluoride in community water is safe and effective in preventing tooth decay safe is a scary word why why would you be worried about that by at least 25% of all children adults simply by drinking water Americans can benefit from fluorides cavity protection with another homework of school Centers for Disease Control Control and Prevention named community water fluoridation one obtain 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century okay now go to the one that says there's no evidence because I got out who the fuck is right here well I would suggest that it's been around that long too long says it has but now it's not does it mean remember what the food pyramid used to look like cavities in a review of every fluoridation study they could find it was a Cochrane I don't know the Cochrane that's what we do bro the view of every fluoridation study they could find only three studies since 1975 look at the effectiveness of water fluoridation at reducing tooth decay among the general population and had high enough quality to be included the studies found fluoridation does not reduce cavities to a statistically significant degree in permanent teeth in the two studies since 1975 that examined the effectiveness of fluoridation and reduce reducing cavities in baby teeth no significant reduction was noted there either you know what I'm thinking right now read you know what's going over my head was behind my head right now as I go I'm thinking this is why Google is not a place to go for information to be discerning you have to give - this is why peer-reviewed papers are so important this is why is like really valuable journalists scientific journalists especially are important that's right that's correct fucking morons like us we don't know who's right we just said something to people going we'll know what so I feel like we have to get to the bottom of this look at general trends like I said to my analysts metal in my teeth right and my dentist because you know leaks mercury and he said I know I was on the I was on that study panel and if you look at the massive the massive number of people that have metal in their mouth you'd have you would be able to draw some pretty broad-based conclusions because you have such a huge human ya pool and they just haven't they looked at the don't do a lot of comprehensive studies that's the same dentist who said your teeth are straight no this is a different one and I'm wearing my Invisalign so I'd appreciate if you wouldn't be mighty they're amazing weird at night I'm wearing them right now and you can't tell remember when Tom Cruise is like 15 he got braces sharp it was like yo sure what are you doing they came in there he's like you're not my bad he also changed his voice wait why did you do that he went with vidneos they're brilliant stealers so veneers are amazing that's what I'm saying amazing yeah I had a friend she did it one of the girls that I did Newsradio with I almost say her name I'll get us the three for one deal up in a four-for-one Tammy wants more lives if you look at the good ones see like god damn your teeth or fucking fat-ass leave that damn Tom Cruise what look what bastard honestly I don't know if that is veneers or braces because he did wear braces look at dude look at the left I think there is real teeth and I think the one on the left is just it could be photoshopped I don't remember them being that yeah I think I think those are his real teeth go to him before braces little sciency go to him go to him smiling in the color of money because he was really young in that movie yeah taco Tom Cruise color of money smiling she's such a beast than me Tom Cruise is a mom I just watched the color of money on a flight it was fuckin to create there the far left far left holy shit yeah those are his teeth bro yeah he just got those front way those front ones have been knocked down those are fake well there's no no this is a long time ago man this is this is a color of money this is like 1986 yeah I'm saying the rest of the teeth are the color yellow and the middle ones are white but that's hard to tell you seen dark shadows all over the place you can't really yellow right there look at that it's so hard to eat but teeth look like that I've seen all my ladies and gentlemen you can't even see his right eye right he's judging whether or not that's his teeth color you really can't see his right eye because he's in so much shadows teeth don't look super suspect right there no they look like teeth right there you're crazy this his teeth his normal his teeth were you're judging by today's standards that's the problem yeah make those teeth perfect like that dude if you had bad teeth back down if you had fake teeth they look fake as fuck that's true his teeth say this his teeth were off-center like you know where the middle teeth they were all kind of pushed over to the right now they're way better i smiling crooked 56 still doing action-movie still does his own stunts jumps from building to building breaks his ankle and filming have you seen that shit no apparently this Mission Impossible movie is a motherfucker and he's killing it they said it's killing it it's awesome yes mission impossible yet me too yeah he's awesome yeah he's ours yes

boom all fucked up dude you ain't ready for that B you want to be a worldwide action hero I can't do that look at that watch out yes what so it is I don't quite make it snapper Rooney oh that hurts dipped to the metal he still finishes he's still yes look he's still jumped over the tongue still and seen hopefully can slammed that concrete into his dick bone hold off he hobbled off when he got up that's why you have to have a stuntman cuz you're gonna get worse oh you guys are hardcore man but he likes everything he does all the car driving stunt things out the helicopter does all that shit I didn't know that shit Dante's a free country he might have a dark wish for the end of one of those movies you might have a dark wish I had people discredit him because the Scientology stuff they do lutely 100% do and but listen the Scientology thing is just how he gets by yeah there's a lot of people that have their own ideologies yeah so they believe it or not it might be radical left ideology there's a lot of conservative former like actors that are really super conservative they're on Twitter like they're in it they're in a cult correct yes correct yes they're all right everyone's wrapped up in this one little thing his thing is just crazy as fuck by a guy was a science fiction author a war a fucking captain's coat on with a bunch of travels himself but they have some legit buildings you driven by actors they have legit dude Tom Cruise is fucking legit John Travolta has done some silly nonsense but he's just walled up he's also done pulp fucking fishin he did Kerry when he was like real good actor face on dude he's a very cutter knife that was a terrible movie face off when they cut the face off and put it on the other person sure magically changes and Nic Cage looks like no way bro okay what happened to Brian put it on you I would think you were like laughs good yeah there's a monster here no like first of all your head's way bigger so your skin a bit like some 60-year old lady from bel-air oh those are 60 year old ladies where their mouth looks like it's so big and to eat your head because they've been pulling they're pulling their skin back to their mouth Joker they lose fat in their face as you get older you may what used to make fun of me of for taking acting class and I stayed in acting last for eight years longer than I needed to because I love a train wreck and these two guys did a scene Jeffrey Tambor was teaching and these two guys did a scene from face-off and you the curtain comes up and and one guys hanging for a chain and the other guys torturing him and is like and he goes do my family goes yeah and so he's hitting him and it's crazy and at the end of the scenes like scene everybody's like and then jeffrey tambor just takes a sip of his coffee and he goes what was that scene and the guy's face off face off what is that because it's a movie it's an action movie charge both in an occasion and that scene is banned forever [Laughter] but I heard this gaudy movies terrible it's like doors most all-time theaters already yeah why don't I saw that I saw that no I'm trailer and I got into it okay let's let's just Google how bad is the gaudy movie it's I mean there was amazing two out of ten is insane okay that's great that has to be correct he's great he looks good he looks like a bob he looks good he looks like a good guy can act his father on FX he played us right yeah he's great he's a great actor he's created everything man he just does a lot of bad movies yeah Geordi he just does has not done a lot of bad movies no no Thomas is done from end of days even like all those moves kind of mazes fucking fantastic do his best move you know what else is good with that what what is that is that the one the tomorrow again he dies he keeps dying that's it that's that end of days dad oh no I'm thinking of a different one he did like two science fiction movies I'm thinking of divergent tomorrow yes that was what it was called but shit it was called edge of tomorrow originally and then we talked about this before James that's right because the marking cuz it came out because their original marketing was edge of tomorrow whatever the fuck it came out and then and then people write guy that no one showed up to it but the people that went right that's like the greatest movie ever so then it's starting to gain traction then I hold up we need to real able this thing then they relabeled it and that movie's fucking that might be his best movie it's a great fucking mood I mean a great fucking science fiction it is one of the most underrated science fiction movies ever and if you're a sci-fi fan and you avoided it just because you're all it's a Tom Cruise movie yep you fucked up it was amazing it means I did a reading with him one time and and he in the reading was just literally me him Eric Stoltz ami smart movie it was a movie I never got made called men and I was reading I was reading all the parts opposite him and the Welland they were target Owen Wilson so I was right next to him and I you know spent Bala know maybe three hours with him it was a small nobody was out nobody else was in the room like just Todd Phillips Nikolai was he in the reading like in the reading as you're just doing it acting full out and and amazing and and just loves it and almost like his eyes were watery at one point where everything's like all the chips are down the scene and ever and I was just like this fucking dude is okay and I kept staring at him and I believed everything he was doing and just sitting at a table and we get there he's a little late just a little late profusely apologizes he just guys I haven't eaten just give me a second I'm Donna and he's just talking he's so nice and he had five pieces of sashimi with a tiny little pepper on each one like you know and some Penta water you know and he was like thank you so much it was great boo boo boo and then we went out read the sink and then he wanted to hear what all of us thought of the script what our suggestions were and when he listens to you his eyes sparkle his mouth moves in an O like you can be like I think I was a little confused in the beginning he's like hold on woody what do you know he's zeroed in on you and I was like this guy loves me man we're gonna be best friends and then yeah we dated for we can't put you in Michigan pause for some shit I talk I spend time with him dude you're not Scientology well we could get you to join I think he could get you to join yeah I wouldn't show up and I'm like yeah of course I would get mad that you weren't showing up but if you didn't show up and you charmed people there and just rub backs I know a lot of them I was in the class for 10 years that is cited in the book by in going clear hmm that whole class that that I was in that class dude I remember you had me come to one of those little sweatshirt a went to an event a thing that was going on watch the guy sing we we watch the guys saying while we were so high and we're in like a neighboring dimension watching reality through a dirty mirror in the Scientology building I want to get over there who's near there was a theater we were a barbecued I mean barbecue no freaking out watching us that they're singing it was so musicals and it was not good and Joe was just like wow this was amazing have so much money yeah I drove by the one in it's kind of like the Silver Lake you're a Hollywood man they get a lot of money yeah did you please go it's there's a lot of what's good about crazy what's good about crazy and about being like if you have a fucking purpose in life man it doesn't have to be rational but if you have a purpose if you've like a clear directive in terms of you know l ron Hubbard says this so I'm just gonna listen and I'm gonna push forward and I'm gonna stay positive and I'm gonna avoid the negative people and I'm gonna use all these tools in order to maximize my performance all good shit work yeah all good it could be do your thing some made-up nonsense and by the way if you read anything about by the way when Callens around to start saying by the way by the way that you read anything about l ron hubbard they essentially think that he was self healing and he was creating his batshit crazy he was having a janitorial how his brain works like that's what he did he took a detailed inventory over many years of how how every had the minutiae of his brain worked and he really category he catalogued it that's why a lot of some of it he borrowed a lot of like old yeah stuff but some of it works I love you made everyone wear like Navy fucking yeah like the commanders were like in a fucking out but if you think about it Christianity's focused the European and American mind for a long time yeah everybody was on the same page and it was very easy to kind of move things forward as a uniform body nobody kind of disputed what the truth was that's a recent like with with Hubbard I feel like with Scientology I'm I'm I'm pretty sure their sign ups are going down because of research and with everyone yeah oh my god yeah yeah like if you're like oh sorry sir your hand sound just fucked up today like beat your ass legitimately kick people's asses yeah look currently it was a who's that said that David Miscavige his dad is that his dad I think his dad and then also on the documentary talk about how abusive yeah the book is crazy he goes into detail about David Miscavige yeah Tom Cruise Canyon then I'm sorry what was his dad's name Ron Miscavige sorry Ron he died on a podcast right made me sad yeah I talked to his son you know me that that's the thing that made me the most sad that the dad and the son don't talk to each other over some nonsense the best thing I ever heard was a guy I knew who was a teacher and he was a Scientologist and had been for 23 years and somebody said are you a Scientologist and he kind of got caught off guard and he said well let's examine that for a sec Jesus I've taken classes there for 20 years and I found an enormous benefit from some of them and some of them and I've paid money for some of them I found cro benefit from so and and i and i put into practice some of the costs you know some of the courses and stuff so if that makes me sound tells I guess I am it's kind of a good answer that's a very good answer yeah yeah I mean that's you can get that out of a lot of things sure there's a lot of things that are like that that have some nonsense in them but I think people operate really well when they have like a scaffolding like a structure that they have to fill out Brett yeah and then they have a purpose they think there's a positive action to their directive and that there's going to be some grand plan that they fit into perfectly because of their work wrong with that either listen man if that works for you it's I tell the contract breaks up but it's just if you bullet yeah right and they said look at Leah Remini I mean Leah Remini says she is the worst fucking person fuck and she's she likes being that girl that's good that's her she likes that role it's almost like she was designed cuz he liked it didn't make sense that she was in Scientology to begin with when I met her right because when I met her she's like this take no bullshit East Coast I'll check it was also beautiful so I was like huh she's a Scientologist I always got along with her I wish she was always very friendly but there was always this like be careful don't same thing stupid job like all right Jesus yeah I feel the same way I would say so the bill she had so much power so here's the thing if she's got all this was she in that yeah she's got all the auditions like she's got all this like brass and this the way how does she get sucked into that well he was a little kid grew up in it she got sold a bill of goods and so she was like wait a minute boy they should have kept her but how Tom liked Tom wasn't that young very young he was very I saw they get him and John Travolta well I think people want something that makes it look I bought the book I bought Diane yeah me too I bought it through a late night 1994 son pre-internet I was at home chillin in my apartment in North Hollywood and I was like damn it sounds like they're making a lot of sense here but some of it does that's right what are you 35 yeah okay I'm 50 15 years older than you so you got to think you don't really remember before the internet you're like an infant okay I was here as a grown man when the internet hit in 1994 but before that but you would get late-night infomercials you'd be buying fucking squeegees and shit pre pre cell phone bro yeah when I'm older I was telling you this is Dianetics was something you'd see on late-night television it was really compelling because you call any research dude there was no Google there was no there was no YouTube Eddie Bravo would hurt his boss Eddie we have full knowledge no but sis it with all of us no one really knew this is how a lot of things snuck through this one you were curious oh yeah all the way no I never went we never thought we never thought that Arnold Schwarzenegger or supposed to Stallone writing those people were doing sterile shut up I didn't I was when I saw Rambo - I just thought that was from weightlifting no I knew it did steroids when I was in high school you think I didn't know that Hollywood I didn't know when you see demolition man I just thought well I was like how'd they get so fucking god I gotta start working out I didn't know that maybe because I wasn't in the workout world but I mean I really back then all of us were naive to steroids we were swearing as fuck here's the thing is man we you could find out like okay what is Scientology based on you could find out you could find in okay does chiropractic medicine work you could Google now and you could look okay does fluoride cure cavities we we didn't get an answer but we might be able to just get a sense sure and you also get a sense of like here's the critics of Mercola this is what their perspective is here's the critics of this naturopathic site that might say some unfounded things about vaccinations or about something there's always some it's you can get a sense yes but you at least you have a chance in 94 dude like imagine you have a chance not Anthony Robbins cassettes I had a fucking DJ vinyl thing and you open it up it all these different cassettes and I would listen to those by the pool in my shitty apartment and fuck that was a bunch of people just a lot of shots all bunches Tony Robbins knows how the human brain works yeah I found him enormously but there's guys that it's the same thing as like with musicians or with carpenters or with comedians there's people that are just kind of bumbling through it and there's people that kill it yeah and when it comes to like the self-help personal growth type shit yeah he kills it here's what's interesting people are so goofy that you know he does those cold walk things these dumb motherfuckers are trying to take selfies while they're cold walk and they're burning their feet off because these stupid fucks actually believe that they're the the power of their will is keeping them from this is how it works the idiots okay coals this isn't I only found this out a couple days ago coals are not very good at projecting heat that's why you put a fucking frying pan down you put it that's a conductor of heat and what that metal yeah the metal is gonna cook well things don't cook that good on coals yeah it's not the same it's wait like a really hot pan will fuck you up way quicker than troll so you can run on coals if you move quick you just got to go quick at the end you like ha ha but you can actually do if you have some calluses on your feet and move quick enough you won't get burnt soul but these dummies didn't even move their fixture like Oh pictures I'm fucking cold the power of now that's so inconvenient because you can't walk anywhere okay over bro you know Shane Mouse the stand-up comic now he was hiking at night and jumped off of like a cliff and landed on his feet and broke both of his feet fuckin'-a he jumped and landed like ten feet below in the mountains here to figure out how to get downs and he was just fucked up he made a mistake I forget the exact story do you member the exact story it was like a very like normal jump it wasn't anything crazy I couldn't jump somebody just like dropped her like oh I might become fleeting him with someone else there was another person I know that fell at night and they did eight it might be a different story I'm thinking of a second guy who also fell on cliffs either way Shane Mouse broke both of his feet I think he was in crutches for like six months oh I think I think was the book blood meridian and he talks about and this apparently was a practice and as there was a tribe this cowboy gets captured by these Native Americans and their neighbors killed his whole posse and then they take him and they take his feet his shoes off and they just cut the first layer of his feet off they kind of give a nice shave so that just the soles of his feet are taken off and they and so he would have to crawl back into town to explain to them who the fuck was out there she had to crawl like ten miles and shit okay he says I said I'll and that I knew I broke both my heels my left foot was in really bad shape the right foot wasn't bad I could still use my right toes so with the help of my friend who had to hike around the other way after we decided to jump may not be the best idea I had to spend the next two hours scooting down the mountain on my butt hands and right toes until we got to a flat enough surface where he and some stranger's could carry me to his car he and his wife then had to go a couple of hospitals until we found an ER that was not too busy to see me Wow my favorite part is you know it was my birthday quick hike have some sushi catch a movie pretty low-key night a shortcut I'd want to try involve jumping off a cliff that was about 11 feet I was wearing some barefoot running shoes that were not appropriate for landing and I thought it would be too high of a jump we looked into for a few minutes and talked about and then we decided to go for it because we were dumb guys and that's the sort of thing that dumb guys do not this so he jumped 11 feet onto fucking rock in barefoot shoes here's my here's my question this is so crazy to do here's my question before colonists Asia for anesthesia and x-rays when you did that well you got back to town even what would they do gonna set your ankle cuz that's a that's not a complicated you're fucked right so fun you're just a cripple think about how tall eleven feet is and then jumping from that down to rocks with dude I don't even like running in those barefoot she's hard on your feet I do I run on them but I gotta be careful like where I step yeah I have to be careful like you got to look what you can't step on a jagged rock coz it goes right now whereas if you wear something like these these are these are trail running shoes yeah I run these I can step on anything with these fucking Yelling's so I alternate when I trail run I alternate with shoes like this that I could just run on anything and then those Vibrams or the vivo barefoot ones but you got to be careful with those things fuck jumping from crazy that's why guys chose craziness right that is such a dumb thing to do breaking your feet or your ankles or your legs break your elbow you're like shit broke my elbow still good though you're gonna be alright yeah you're gonna be alright you can get a blister apparently in the wrong place when you're hiking way up the mountain it can kill you just when waar got a blister on his foot or and as he Leela had his heel cracked yeah got it infected he was in Thailand it infected and he missed his daughter's fight and had to stay at a hospital in Thailand and get IV antibiotics it must been so bad cuz John's at night he's a fucking animal and his daughters fighting in Thailand I mean you know he basically he started you know his whole career in Thailand practically dude crazy his foot was all swollen up but you got to be careful with your feet now oh yeah yeah jump off whoever had an ingrown toenail my brothers were so bad when we when he's in high school I went with him he was kept he just they kept growing into it they had to take needles numb his fucking underneath this toenail and then jank his toenails wow that's a problem and and then cinch the top so the toenail doesn't grow back why so it just looks like the bottom this foot looks like the bottom of you so he doesn't now there's no nails oh my god what but but that was because they were in kroner there was a who's vote no he's born like that they kept growing in it kept growing in so what he has no nails no nails thanks they took him ginger it's very creepy cuz cuz softest shit though feels like koalas nose my dad's got some nails and under those nails told you it's about 78 years of fungus toe jam and earl well those are some thick now so he's gotten else I mean it the baddest thick is the lid of this table right dudes toes in their ass yes heal that are all crack size 14 shoe too by the way got a dick it's got a piece on so I opened up for Brian in Chicago and I do like this dirty bit put in the back and his his mom and his dad I'm like oh it hit me right when they walked in on it oh fuck I just

Washington DC as America's rat capital okay here's the problem with this rats are prom I don't know how many rats are out there they're just bullshitting I'm not doing a detailed fucking analysis don't know where they live yeah well how do you know how many how do they really know how many rats there are New York are they just guessing I don't think so I think they can actually don't they can't they tell by like like my buddy what's up bitches scared of a fucking rodent bro Who am I gonna call about a rat that's why L is none other than come on - my buddy had a bought a building in New York and he had to clean it out Oh in the basement Jimmy Burke told me my buddy Steve shucker was coming out with when they were killing them they had this they were poisoning them they were coming

Annette graduating at flicks is insane amazing nice clean rap though I like man cutie pie yeah a little cutie but someone's got like is that cool tell I carry the bubonic plague like the white ones

you know what the most depressing thing was we went to one of those tiger sanctuary things over there I'm like dudes I'm chair drugged the fuck up for sure you know why how you can tell because people get in there well first of all because the the babies they'll let you touch the babies first there's like different packages you could package the baby package or the young lion package or the giant lion that's be pack I'll take this I'll take baby the babies are adorable these little cute things but they're super like playful and active and big and then you get to like a little bigger and they seem to be behaving normal and they have a bunch of trainers in with them and then you get to the big ones and the big ones are fucking doped out of their mind like they just gave him a bucket of heroin so just laying there like this like looking at you I believe it dude they didn't none of them got up they just lay there and people lay next to him and hug him and you know Tricia's god damn dude but it's weird like your kids and wife dude no no I mean fuck that when the lines like oh fuck I feel better the woman got we were there we didn't know what it was until we got there I I got super depressed like immediately but when we were there the the oldest we got to is like nine-month cat and that cat does not seem like it's drugged up at all how they young a pretty big man like a mastiff the fuck job yeah still fuck well they're trying Oh Oh a hundred percent fuck you up dude but it's like a seven-month eight month nine month cat in there like big like a dog yeah a big dog yeah enjoy that's right like you ever see a mastiff it's six months it's very yes yeah that's bigger so this thing is bigger than that you know probably 175 pounds so I'm like that 200 pounds and it's just hanging around and they have all these trainers that are just like around the cat all the time we're like what in the fuck are we doing anything gonna do if they can't think you know what fuck this well they have guns and stuff they have like sticks with them they keep the cats are listening to them for the most part but then it gets to an untenable size yeah and the process amounts yeah and they have these things in these cages and then there was other ones that clearly weren't drugged up yeah let me pass by one cage and this one slice walking back and forth and pacing and looking at you and looking at everybody much okay he's awake he's legit he just got off his meds it's not snow yeah and these other ones are just dragged down like this is your wife bummed out too everybody was bummed out everybody was bummed out it's a drag man they found one that was selling tiger parts people are poor they're making money taking risks on ladder and shit not good the other bear gall bladders apparently such an issue that like some Asian countries want bear gall bladder some people like it it's like some sort of a delicacy it's supposed to have some weird properties to it probably probably rhino horn type projects but it's so bad that in British Columbia if you hunt bear like say if you hunt a black bear you're not allowed to open up the body cavity okay you have to take the meat off the outside oh I can't even go into the body cavity Wow yeah they have a law against it because they don't want people harvesting bear gall blasters bad they don't want people killing them yes we get bear bile does have medicinal uses but there are cruelty free alternatives bear bile has been used in traditional Asian medicine for thousands of years contains high levels of good luck this word ursodeoxycholic acid known to be useful for treating liver and gallbladder conditions so it does have some medicinal value but I had friends that were bear hunting and people were asking them for the gallbladders and like it's illegal he's like I just get I get it for my grandma you know this really likes it Wow fuck out of here man that's like it's it's a bad thing to have like if you get caught with it it's like you're good you're getting caught with something here it's not it's not legal to possess a part of an animal that you're it's legal for you to kill it alright what's crazy stop and think about that yeah you can kill it you can kill the animal yeah you just can't possess a part of its body yeah you're not allowed to get you're not allowed to open it goes to waste you could use it but you can't use it because so many people want it that they made it illegal to have it Wow cuz bile has always been used apparently it's at one of the compounds or derivatives it's just controlled it's in your mouth nobody's used for like medicine you know some medicines like ant disinfectants rhythm yeah bile was always a traditional medicine that actually worked I mean if you mix things how were the elephants down there though I love that was way different the elephant was a really positive experience because the elephants are in a rehab center what they actually introduced him back to the wild and we see the way these people first of all they're not contained they roam yeah not only do they roam they there's no fence bro they come out of the forest yeah the people are all there with them like taking care of them feeding them they're constantly giving them sugar cane washing them cleaning and when you're there like they document they're trying to explain how all the money that you pay for to experience hanging out with these elephants for a day goes to rehabilitation they talked about all the different it goes to food and they Bri introduced seven elephants into the wild through this one facility which is giant so they live wild so the entire Lambs yes there's a lot of elephants again and so where these people are the de Forest is like super dense man and the elephants just wander through the forest eating whatever the fuck they want it is it's crazy to see men so they're kind of wild they're wild they're wild but they're not along with a lot of you from zoos a lot of them came from circuses but they could be they look they're basically living like they would in the wild so it's not a giant stretch to take them and reintroduce them to a place as long as there's food a fairly tame the well these big do yes they do whatever the fuck they want gathered their fucking trunks are they soft no it's hard as a rock there's 600 muscles in their trunk alone and no bones 600 muscles just in the trunk this sizable strength is so insane dude it's so hard you when you around them and you realize like oh god yeah you shouldn't I the riding and was sketchy like it's sketchy because you worry we're good if they fall like one of them slipped a little bit and run itself and one lady did fall off and she was okay but it's it's a possibility that you could fall off of a fucking elephant which you are you're 10 feet up yeah I mean these are some of them this one lady had a I had a female that I was riding there's one lady and you're only riding it freely were you in a basket were you in a basket or just on are you just on it really holding on to a rope they put a rope around the waist maybe you hold on to the rope it's like loosely run that you've barely on man yeah you're barely on you know they just and if they wanted you off you're off instantly it's like you weigh nothing to them or feels like oh my back itches kamo so what I had was and the one this lady had next to me was literally thirty percent forty percent larger than hers it was so big and it was a male and when it trumpets when it just decided her like right next to everybody everybody went home so loud you just realized what it is I think it was it was raining every day there rains constantly this is a rainy season - and this elephant is moving through the mist and the forest and just eating whatever it wants are these giant white tusks and I'm like that is a crazy living being that has a crazy majestic animal have you schooled it was dope have you seen the video where where there's a bull elephant hitting a Mack truck oh yeah just oh it trucks it over into knocks you know he's an innovator bunch of them in India where they get tired of being a beep abused they just go nuts but with this thing that these animals were loved like you could really tell like first of all you're rushing them with your hands you know that will be giving them sugarcane you're so scared cuz this mouth is giant but you put it in there and they're just super gentle man they don't snap Matt and wait your tree you soft nothings yeah yeah yeah it's soft I mean it's it's not like bone but the trunk is insanely powerful they just grab shit with that thing and rip it out of the roots of cool and snap things like such a bad shit with their trunks and they say they can feel like what humans feel like when one dies they mourn shit of it yeah well they definitely have incredible memories because there was one video of an elephant meeting an elephant that had been separated from for 20 years and they met each other and they run to each other and they're bouncing around yeah they recognize each other they're like this really calm weird animal that eats everything dude you realize like one of the things I was thinking I was like imagine if you had one of these that lived in your yard you had to have no yard now this is the problem that people have in Africa yeah okay I'm a giant fan of elephants but if you're a poor farmer and you live in this white powder crop yeah right you can't do anything about it you're starving you have children imagine you you have your little boy yeah your little boys gonna go hungry now cuz these elephants just want to eat whatever the fuck they don't understand killing them throw this we don't elephant on well this is the argument for controlling some of the populace cause we always think we say Oh elephants are in danger but they definitely are in some places but in other places in certain areas to call large populations you got to really saw big Africa is I mean if you ever see like the map where they take America and they put it inside no they put Asia inside now let me see I've not seen that oh my god Africa's giant yep but do we have to kill and can't we redirect these folks a lot of money to do that's the problem the real problem is the money because you could maybe could grab them and capture them and move yeah yeah that's how they do it and they put them in a zoo there has to be some very short distance with that that's not true yes it is broke is so big dude is that true yep it has all of China in it all of the United States yep yep come on India I'm amazed at that all of Japan all Spain do that's not to do all of Italy Heine dude does have Japan it to make them a Japan's over no I made it up it's real that's that's insane man that's so big so okay so imagine the United States imagine if we are over here in California and we're like you don't sweetie fuckin olifants meanwhile in New York they're just getting trampled up and down and we're like don't kill the offense bro they're nowhere look you look well Calabasas yeah you don't see a single fucking elephant man don't be an asshole meanwhile your granny's getting stomped continuous very little continuous habitat for the migrations apparently I think there's a lot of problems with with you know the places where they're under populated the places where they're overpopulated it's just it's you know it's just it's a crazy amazing animal it would be really nice if people could figure out a way to live in peace with coexist they were they were saying any animal to be around they were saying how I was watching this on a mobile and some shit but you know how they take out the bull elephants and people are cool with it I go cuz you know they kill the smaller ones or they ends up there saying the problem with that with elephants is those older ones know the path to water and where to go and when you kill the older ones the other ones don't know where the fall so teach the younger ones happy hey so they watch their like pass once you take out the bull and there they're fun yeah well they're saying the older ones have so much knowledge to drop on these little bastards we have certain animals that we get Superman if someone kills an elephant is one of them and a giraffe is another one fuck it because they're they're not you know they're not they're not predators you know what I read about that giraffe that that lady killed and she got in trouble here's a problem one it was a giant old 18 year old giraffe it was killing young males yeah killed three young males they were gonna have to kill it anyway yeah so that's how they get a person like that to do it you know the only other option is they could take it and put it in some sort of a zoo but it was a non-viable male and when non-viable males around young males apparently they kill him they also don't mention that that that revenue she paid you pay a lot of money to kill fifty thousand okay a lot that revenue goes back into the community there and I guess there's no such thing as a black giraffe it was like that's a girl's like no yeah but it's really rare that an animal in the wild gets to 18 years old again huge but again when you kill off that big male he had a lot of knowledge to drop on these other little donor he was dropping any knowledge she's killing him same thing see they're different does that's the reason why that Corey Knowlton I think though his name he got in trouble for shooting that rhino it paid two hundred fifty thousand dollars to shoot a rhino it was it was they heat they were gonna have to kill it because it had killed a male and it killed a female killed a male breeding her and it killed a young no killed him a female breeding her and it killed a young man this thing was so old they paid I think three hundred ninety one thousand dollars or something crazy is he just scrooge mcduck rich wants to kill oil he's balling anyone to kill the Rhino that bad hunter yeah I talked to him we had on the podcast really smart guy but not what you think when you think of a guy who you know does something like that but his nature not gonna take care of itself with these rounds in the drought they're they're so in danger because riders are the rhinos are so in danger that it's very dangerous to just let nature play its course out because native animals have gone extinct you know if you really go over the the list of animals that have been extinct just ball will we've been alive you don't think about it but there's been a lot and then if you look over the course of human history fuck man a lot of animals have gone extinct the should have I'm not living in a natural habitat anyway they're they're happy has been so fucked with to begin with of us and there's so few years back in the day yes it would nature would have found its way but you have the thing is this guy's 300 grand or whatever it is that's gonna go directly into keeping those other ones alive think I get money for the scientist they're gonna money for it's gonna help Africa it's just it seems counterintuitive instinct when they post on the gram like God just fucking kill this black draught that goddamn bitch right and why would you why would you want to shoot a giraffe yeah why would you want to shoot a rhino I did I get it man it's uh but it's do it though it's more complicated than you think it is you know you know what I'm suspect of you know those poachers that were killed by those Lions yeah I don't think that happened I think they got shot your conspiracy guys I think they got shot by poachers and the poachers like it's a lot easier just to say that they got eaten by lions well I will tell you as a fact I know people that have gone over there to hunt and they just shoot at poachers just shoot at them yeah and obviously we're talking about Africa it's an enormous enormous place well so I mean in my you know for certain hunters and yeah and kill poachers it's entirely possible did that happen so hunting you know I'm saying that the people that are the professionals that work on those giant ranches like there's a lot of these private hunting ranches they're like hundreds of thousands of acres even and they're all fenced in and people get inside and they poach what does that mean it means they're trying to eat right you know it means they're starving a lot of times and they're trying to do whatever the fuck they can to make money whether they can make money by chopping off a rhino horn or they make money by selling meat from some antelope that they shot they weren't supposed to shoot but my what on my point is that people have told me that they know of these people over there shooting at poachers just shooting at them like you would shoot at a rat or a coyote or something that was trying to eat your chicken of course you shoot him the lines and come along with ya for my fury my friend who was over there said he couldn't believe it they just will shoot at poachers damn yeah oh just sayin poachers no that's right they're also part of some of them organized gangs and man you know it's one of those things you're like what would you do if you were in that village you'd be in that fuckin organized gang - and price stay out of Africa well if you're born there I'm sayin us well how about malaria which is killed half of the people that have ever died ever if you get all those shots my wife's doing that right now she's going to Kenya first class first class Safari I can't make it I've got to go to China Beijing there's no matter which one's worse yo here's the thing about China we had a stop in in China they have a different sense of personal space like as far as like getting in between you and a line they don't give a fuck you're walking through a thing and they're just like a merging thing there's no merging son they're gonna go right in your kids right into you your wife like well they drive like that they're not they're not rude it's just a different way - there's so many people's I have to figure it out exactly there's a billion they're not they're not in polite people but they get misconstrued as being employed because we're not used to that navigating that kind of numbers like they are it's crazy to see though man watch them even if you're just watching them deal with other people just walk in front of people and smoosh into each other okay when I went to Australia a lot of Chinese and Japanese and Koreans were on holiday in Australia and I was with Chan who's Korean my producer and they've kept their super we'd be in line they'd bump into me or something I'm like dude what the fuck is like no no no they're not being disrespectful it's literally just how that's how they that's totally grew up they just kind of sit out stupid numbers of people we get used to people bumping into each other anyway there's none of them behind you really closely this is the art I mean like this is the trend right the argument is that you get too many people and then the people lose their value because they become a hindrance like I was thinking that yesterday on the I was at the 405 at 6 o'clock yesterday you've been there it is a crazy thing to experience because I was let's get into it after this but yeah it also makes you think like if there was an end-of-the-world type scenario and you were trying to get back to your family yeah you got zero chance correct you go you know you're gonna walk way quicker the 20 miles of your house I see what you're taught you wanna get a helicopter bro bilberry has one he flies on around well he doesn't have his own hell you took lessons bill knows how to fly Bill's own a helicopter he flies all the time right yeah he flew down to San Diego for a gig and flew back really that's insane that's cool yeah I flew from San Diego to LA don't ask me how and why but it might plan how to stop over in San Diego 26 minutes that's a hilarious flight to make six hours well beam that traffic yeah six hours you got a plan that motherfucker correct you guys at the Comi store at la jolla at a thursday night show eight o'clock cuz like oh dude if i leave by 2:00 we got this all day I got there right at 8:00 really took you six hours there's accents all of them oh right when you get into San Diego accident row Orange County Orange County has so many people and it's like a little China it's gorgeous though it's okay it's beautiful but it's so crazy you go there and like just the density of people and orange kind of like wait a minute how many people are here I think this is a crazy spot but then there's some dope spots like Merman and the girl oh yeah Chicago to go 11 miles took us an hour at Chicago where traffic every month no dude it can't be worse than going through Orange County at five o'clock it's fucking bad I asked I said it does I says it always like this and they said it's like this because of the construction right now look at that in 2015 3 point 17 million people just in Orange County and that does not include Mexicans yeah it just does not they don't know they don't have a fucking clue and when I say Mexicans I should say people will let you in you're here all right that's that's what they should say hey you're here you get in but the point is all these these numbers are inflated like how many more illegal aliens are here on top of that now I can live in Orange County have to work in LA I'd live in Orange County I would I would live there all day oh they'll love new tourists what do you think the numbers are I don't have any people how many illegal aliens do you think are in just I say I was three mil okay with 3.17 million people how many people do you think are ill Elin 67 million like I feel like it's one of those numbers like the guys did they're undocumented it fluctuates probably I don't want to compare them to the rat study disrespectful thing I just mean in terms of a study do we are not actually monitoring and how do you how the fuck do we know how many they think are they estimating across every year yes question I think they do do we have any idea Jamie because then we could I have no fucking clue Darnell you imagine if you were living in some shit country and you realize that you could actually get a great job if you just get across the river it's such a bummer yeah what's so heartbreaking what a shit we got a but meanwhile there's some sweet spots down there like why don't we gentrify Mexico well that's the thing Mexico City's getting there yeah Mexico City's economy is doing a pair Mexico's economy is doing pretty well from what I hear goodness you got Nicaragua this is James this is in 2014 so triple it it's two thousand two million three hundred fifty thousand just in Southern California we could del or just in California uh Noah but that's the entire state of California that's off by a factor of ten by two point three million to Orange County there's no way they know they don't know the economy though they make up a lot I'm saying 11 million total agricultural economy and everything else man we we need those right now they're entrenched it's heartbreaking when they have to the past the the rivers in the body of water and it's like kids and women they die in the fuckin yeah and they got to put together you know the average is $3,000 $3,000 to them they come from nothing they save all this money it's per person yeah so you got kids yet the family here Rob you get together they get robbed they go they get robbed all this shit you know it's some of its fake they don't know who to deal with well I'm sure you've seen videos of Syrian refugees Washington I'm sure you can handle it's hard yeah you got a you know and it's so easy such a trash it's so easy to like look at them and they speak a different language they follow a different religion it's so easy to not compassionate Syrians are so cosmopolitan to the Syrians were not religious Syrians were entrepreneurs I mean Damascus was a huge city I mean it's beautiful place very very cosmopolitan but it's not to let them in because we're scared that you know the tears stuff like that that's like not letting talent in because the Mafia yeah I get such a fuckin percentage it's not necessarily but not to see no I'm saying though like that to assume that all Mexicans are in the cartel yeah or all all Italians are in the Mafia it's fucking insane it's a similar so similar yeah but it's especially like the the thing the difference between Syrians and Mexicans is Mexicans a lot of people would accept them easier because they they practiced the same religion like if you found a guy was a Mexican businessman in Mexico City and he speaks English and Spanish and his children are well educated and he want to move next door to you super nice guy makes his own wine you know I mean but but if a guy's does Mexican food is part of the American fabric percent you know what I mean so we're not is threatened they're our neighbors there's a history you threaten well people are threatened by Muslims they're threatened by radical Islamic terrorists they're threatened by the idea of people trying to be like some Manchurian Candidate and get into office and well a lot of these school the school shoot the mass shooters a lot more white to man I'm scared of the most of them are crazy well do you remember when people were absolutely convinced that Obama was somehow some sort of a Mexican plant or excuse me a plant and that he was a Manchurian Candidate Trump said he was from Kenya that was Trump was a birther people forgot about that he had to show his yeah yeah I want to play him but in truck in he might have actually believed that but it some might have been that Trump like fucking with Obama because Obama like fucking with Trump true and that's one of the things I got that press corpse dinner when he got up and said here's one thing that I am that you'll never be his President United States and he got this giant laugh with Seth Meyers roasts him - yeah he was like he's like oh really oh that's he going that's cute guess what fuckin president but he so when he says Obama it more than likely was because of a personal feud and less likely that he actually thought Obama was a granya he was probably fuckin hurry back because he's a powerful guy and if they treat him like he's not a powerful guys like Oh Ria's resources this is like what this this is my problem with anti-trump like when when when people go too far with it and it's not that he's not doing terrible things it's not that he's not like just the idea that he lies all the time that you have to check them on his lies you have to figure out what's the truth what's very dangerous but separated by the immigrants my issue has nothing to do with that my issue has to do with it's a terrible way to interact with someone whose ideas you don't like because it just makes the people that support him more aggressive everybody gets more aggressive you get more aggressive at them and you like this is what we're gonna do we're gonna shout them down we're gonna stop them off from speaking we're gonna we're gonna show up at their their restaurants and yell at them you're just creating more conflict this is hope this is not helping because they're gonna bolster their resources not persuading their defenses no you're not relation people yeah and you're gonna make people arm themselves and you're gonna make people escalate their rhetoric and it's gonna escalate on both sides and it's also evidence that you're unhinged so they can point to the fact that they're right because you're harassing them in the parking lot of a restaurant and you won't let them get to their car without you yelling at them they're there now saying you're unhinged and there's evidence to prove that they've got a point like no no it's a this is a never Trump movement we're a part of the movement and we got together you're harassing a person you're making them angry and they're gonna harass liberals now and now we have this giant conflict instead of just communicating about important issues instead of just like trying to figure out how we all get along nothing how to solve problems how to solve problems how many you know you digging your heels into one team or the other you gotta try to solve problems but it's easier persuasions the hardest thing punishment destructions way easier here's the thing if they get him out of office here's the thing if they do succeed in getting them out of office those even more emboldened but my point is they'll be even more involved in that this is a correct way to behave yes I don't think it necessarily is I think all of the things that are calling out that are like ink whether it's I don't understand the Russian stuff I've tried to go over it I feel like if there was like if there was clear enough evidence that he had committed a crime they would have already done so he'd be out yeah this resource in time going into but there's many indictments so there's other people around him that have done something that was illegal this is this seems to be very clear right or at least have been accused so where it goes and far lick let that play out but this is that is a very different thing than all of the the like the hatred and the fucking going after people like you have to figure out where where the the line gets drawn where you're causing internal conflict that can literally lead to civil war but but it's trickled down into our economy of everyone's lives now like you're on Twitter or entertainment or with the the me2 movement like it's trickled it's a trickle down effect well you know George Washington said one of the most important qualities for a society to have a civility and what a civility mean the founding fathers did not agree on a lot of stuff I mean Madison didn't agree with with you know Hamilton and and and Jefferson they were very much at odds about how to go forward with this republic but they talked it out they compromised nobody nobody got violent besides Aaron Burr and fucking Hamilton at it but for the most part they compromised they talked and George Washington said civility the ability to listen to the other side even though when you don't agree with them and put your ideas together that's how you move things forward and we just don't have that anymore you just don't have it I think that's a really good point and that's what bothers me the most about this is not not that they're not corrected there's some real problems it's the way everybody's going about it that makes me say like do you understand what happens when you yell at people like that you can't just push people there's there's people that don't understand violent consequences there's people that don't understand conflict and they don't know how to to gain it and they don't know how to like be calm and how to figure their way through a situation there's dangerous levels of aggression that get reached when you have like an Tifa feuding with these people that are trying to do some sort of a speech somewhere and there's the supporters of the speech and then there's an Tifa and everybody's getting together and screaming and there's fire and by clocks and people beating the shit out of each other all this stuff there's there's plenty of videos this are happening this this doesn't have to end here okay this wasn't here five years ago understand this that this could escalate in five years to be significantly worse than it is now and me as a person who I'm I don't want violence around me I see that shit coming and I go oh these guys are fighting let's get the fuck out yeah you don't want to go get close to them I hope you catch a stray bullet and I see that the problem is that 5-10 years like the problems that cop that comes to you yes I mean it's unnecessary it's not how we should communicate with each other you know and I think there's also people that are emboldened by movements right they get it they become a part of a movement look and then they want to do something to commit to that movement it's very similar to joining a fucking militia it's very similar to joining resistance media makes it easier to social media isn't made it easier to find your tribe surround yourself with people who see the world exactly like you do and organize and attack the other shot know that they sit with social media that's what makes Isis kind of so yeah so violent and also so scary is because social media the first ones kind of mastered social media my my bigger worry is also the fact that people can't even agree on the validity of their sources so if I say well you know according to the United Nations or the Bureau of Labor and Statistics and you go that's bullshit so now I can't even get off the ground because there's too much of them right so I'm going to my go to mainstream sources you go that's mainstream and that's bullshitting they're brought up by corporations they have an address I can't even have an argument well here's something I'm trying to get better at and I've worked on it a lot I try really hard to not be connected to whatever I believe in and I try to not try to win a conversation those are two very important things behind it Joe yes but I'm trying harder than I've ever tried in my life and I've been on a path trying to do this for years now and getting better at it because of just listening to podcast listen and having podcasts and having conflicts with people and trying to figure out why I had those conflicts and how much of it was my fault how much of it could have prevented how much who I could have done a better job as a host or as a person who's trying to relay the information and through time I've tried my hardest and it's something I concentrate on all the time to not be connected to my ideas to argue them if I feel like there's merit but argue the merit argue my connection your emotion emotional connection so when someone does that I get I get exhausted now because I know where it's gone like we're gonna waste a lot of time with this because you're not willing to even think about the possibility to I said to Theresa those podcasts they were Jordan Peterson I said do you feel like you're winning this debate because at this point he'd become so famous and he said I don't want to win this because I'm going to create resentful people who feel like resentful losers that's not yes that's not the point the point is to figure out a way to present ideas so that they are accessible to the people whose minds I'm trying to change this is exactly what he said about Trump supporters he said if you disagree with Trump supporters don't insult them make them feel like they're losers exactly know what that doesn't make anybody feel good and you what I'm not true he also says how do you think they're going to react to that you think they're just gonna give in to you and he's a clinical psychologist so you understand how he understands how human brains work we do that immediately what do we say about Trump supporters a lot of people this I really think they're racists their axes their their sexist transphobic they're they're Mexican haters and all this stuff whereas maybe the Left presented an alternative that was unacceptable to them they didn't like this conman or this guy was an egotist but they were like let's give it a shot right I have 300 bucks in the bank I got no other options there's also that give people the benefit of the doubt most people are not assholes yeah there's there's both of those things and there's some people that are asked sure that's part of the problem is that you run it enough of those those hurt your feelings and you think oh all Trump supporters are assholes Dority though right but that's necessary I feel like it's all negativity bias - it is also something where our brains we gravitate towards if I can scream if you have a thousand comments and nine hundred over positive you'll see the one that ya know if you have nine hundred and you have a hundred that are negative you're fucked super fun you're gonna read a hundred negative like you'll have a million right or wrong he comes I think about how amazing that is that you have ninety percent positive in this crazy world oh I know everything's all good right so if you have but your mind looks like you know your mind goes towards the name yeah but what I'm saying is that the numbers as they expand they get more and more ridiculous so if you have a podcast the podcast gets a million downloads and you get a hundred thousand negative comments and nine hundred thousand positives have you this is exhaustive have you looked at how many people alcohol kills versus guns for example oh you know I'm saying I mean but nobody's talking about banning alcohol you could really go into all these details right well very expensive obesity shortened lives because of poor diet gels way more people and terrorism it kills a lot of fucking people and then there's also shit that happens like we were talking about this recently about Chicago the violence in Chicago the numbers are so crazy and no one seems to be flinching like if those numbers were in Beverly Hills if Beverly Hills how Southside Chicago if Beverly Hills had a thousand people killed or shot in a year we'd be like what in the fuck you talking can we accept it like at Chicago it's fucking crazy it's over there becomes accustomed to yes girl chooses Charlie Sheen of like spitting on her and doing coke off her asshole like yeah that's what he does of course what he does so have you hear others violence in Chicago like yep that's what they do hearing about that side yeah south sign we just like we like the map to be discernible okay I know what this is I know what that is right it will go to keep it stat especially like though if it's something horrific like there's a serial killers freaky fuck that's scary shit that way but they're also things that scare the fuck out of you and that's where like I will I will not go into the ocean and swim where I can't touch the ground just don't listen and it's stupid it's ridiculous smart move fuck that place especially the Pacific was great how abou run overrun with Great Wall correct sir San Francisco is a fucking breeding ground fucking this guy this guy this guy del Rey he's he's swimming and he's got his hands like talk to the side like a seal and he's going like this he's diving in so I'm like bro you you are sealing out you look like a giant smooth delicious right now Zoey saying yeah I mean if there's one badass way to go that's pretty sick yeah I can see an end for sure say bye Brazil got his dick bitten off no yep the crotch right the crotch the dick the balls asshole died bled out on the beach well he bled out after the shark pit his dick I'll take that I'll take that car hey um eat me in half yeah I got a peek I did a podcast on the kid comes back we're gonna talk about actual fights over hey there's a lice hold please holding please get p2 but I can leave you by yourself I'll go after I'll just talk about the Constitution guys um not gonna have a minute your time you know the history of the Ottoman Empire's very interesting actually we have to go all the way back though can you imagine you're so fucking reading out of a book mm-hmm once you plug your dates plugs anything worse than someone does that now that Joe's gone hey I'm mostly Austin first week of August [Music] now you're taking a break from the road you should come I mean surprise some people maybe pick a city I do that come out and just open for you what about Vancouver one night when is that September 13th if I'm not shooting my thursd by 2 TV show so I thought you were shooting in October so talented I forget I'm shooting I'm shooting some of the Goldbergs I think August September the last season of Goldbergs I believe so and then I go and then I think we start shooting I shoot one episode of schooled and August than the rest October why just wanted to like your pilot I don't know yeah no no just the way they do this schedule it wasn't figured out yeah yeah writing and stuff writing and then when do you think you go back on the road for standup I'll get restless I know it'll happen right now I haven't thought about you that's the thing like out like I'll go on whatever I'll be gone for every weekend of the month yeah I'm like I need a break yeah then I get one weekend off like I get back I think you miss it it's beautiful there's nothing like sometimes sometimes it's beautiful yeah sometimes if sometimes it can be you mean in the city and it's terrible but I just sometimes can be a little rough yeah I was talking to County well you can't what you'll be doing the same thing cos count shot its best rights and I didn't take a break from the road to shoot in the show yeah and I was saying there's some times like a month going this month coming up I'm on the road every weekend that's rough it's rough but and then I'm like I need a break and then I get a break I have like a week or two often like I get back on the road but you it's weird you miss it this is my first 12 years yeah but you two weeks but when you were let's say at my level in comedy you were grinding right cries yeah yeah yeah you got got to do what you got to do in the moment you know you're on that stage where you're just trying to get those reps into but but I'm just saying like that you missed the like I'm like gotta you fuckin break this road and hotels and lessons I need a fucking break now get back and like I didn't get back out it's like this weird love-hate related at all but it'll hit me and I'll start to freak he gets tired you're tired of waking up in hotel rooms tired of flying it's lonely yeah dad your body not my routine yeah that's what I hate much right your home routine yeah hate it yeah I don't like that either but there's no alternative if you want to do big shows and you want to go on the road you never study yeah also I don't think there's an alternative in terms of like creating material I think you need a bunch of different kind you need Philly you need Boston you need Florida you need Miami to the case you need to be like oh there's some people that just don't pay attention and the time alone sometimes like just your you know you gotta you gotta fill that day but I fucking love it cuz I'm just thinking and stuff dude you're a poor fucking calf muscle oh it's the most annoying muscle to pull cuz it doesn't heal because you're always on it takes a while yeah oh it's so did you do that can can't count on elephants no no about two months ago I heard it and it's never gotten bit from running yeah it's still run I'll be right back it's weird you can still run yeah yeah I can still run but it's just I feel it I got no I just interesting that that and I wonder what the science is behind that I have a recurring injury right so I'll pull my lower back on my right side or I'll pull my neck there's a neck muscle from wrestling probably from years ago where I that sometimes if sometimes I'll do something whether it's play tennis a box or whatever I'm fucking around and I'm like I'll fuck I'm done for this is always the same side yeah I'm done for a week yeah I bet exact scores everything I bet it's a mobility thing I bet that's one of the things and I bet you probably at some point in time had a bulging disc and it's probably still a little fucked up and you never got an MRI on it so you don't really know right that's interesting and I think that's one of the areas of a lot of people don't strengthen is their spine you know I've spent a lot of time over the last few years using a bunch of different exercises and machines just specifically to strengthen my spine and my core yeah after having some bulging back I was doing that i cured my lower back as a lauren landau and my buddy leo who helped me kind of because my lower back hurt for twenty years and they give me just some exercise that I do every day and they're mostly strengthening the neck sided they're not stretching this strengthening your gluts and stuff I got no problems with my lower back I mean I cured my lower back which is kind of a miracle to consider that I did it later on in my life but my neck is you know and I do it I do next Assizes now you got to try this iron neck thing that I have out here oh well it's fucking best really yeah you put a halo on your head you just screw it on you like pull it on and then you pump it like a Reebok pump and like fits tight to your head and then you got a bungee cord that's attached to it that's 50 pounds and you back up with this thing and then you do rotation really really good phenomenal but the most important thing is that it's not dangerous it's just strengthening your neck in a way where you're giving it a full range of motion I want to do I'm gonna buy look next don't get worked out that much your lower back doesn't get worked out their house you got to think like all the other things are getting all these loads so when when you put a load on the we're back and it's not strong enough that's when things go go out yeah if you strengthen it you can prevent a lot of that stuff from happening like yoga's great for that Yoga is great for the back great for the spine it's like one of those things you realize when you do any like oh these are muscles that I hardly ever were like what you do triangle pose hardly ever work that you saw my jeans like the splash bro to worry about breath my piss piss it's a cute outfit it's just pee pee baby it's kind of very colorful yeah you're very hippie today left when it's back its back back I didn't know yeah no I do I got a Sean O'Malley shirt oh yeah how about a frickin Nick you're lost to get into the contender I read that I did not have a chance to my seat right there no idea I don't want your contender series but I saw that yeah which is a bomber I'm rooting for that guy holy well it's interesting that was the big story was that he lost not that the other guy won like I kept reading that he lost I didn't read that the other guy want I don't even know who the other guy is me neither but I heard he's a badass but it's like all right how crazy is that whoo-hoo busy crazy but it looks like you beat the guy with one arm but let's give the guy's name my thought was like how much bigger can you be with the rest of your body if you're like how much many pounds of the arm it's just his forearm right its way to say Jamie Alex muñoz Alex please shut out - a little razor blade man I heard is a tough fight but Nick Newell is a badass yeah I think he's in the UFC I don't think the contender says is right for him well here's the thing a lot of the guys that are in the contender serious contender series is fucking excellent a lot of guys that are in that series are gonna wind up in the UFC anyway if you lose to one of them it doesn't mean that you're not good it means there's a luck the talent level is very high right now I would say what's a contender series better than tough wave entertainment weisenheim close continued kills it it's way better talent wise not tired Oh tough got tired this is a style of coach exhausting all the reality practically they're doing it again but I think they have to contractually with Kelvin and Whitaker yeah I mean it's still the fights are worth watching it's still worth decided that some people like that reality TV people still watch Big Brother bro they love it I see people tweet about big brother I'm like what are you doing yeah the ratings I mean the very few people are watching tough these days the ratings are so bad what are the ratings that there's seven people that want just seven bro and they also buy for how many women in hospitals after what no I just think you know with the contender season saucily making this push like that's where you're getting your new young talent yeah I think that's that's what I want to see me I don't want to see all the reality don't you know what the thing is people that like reality shows like it because it allows you to have the reality break the differ well because the contender series is kicking ass tough is not yeah I'm just saying bro yeah that's a good point I think that there's some people that don't even know what's on the air anymore when the fuck do you hear about an ad for that show well even the UFC's like work hood we're not putting any marketing in that we owe this last season just put two fucking guys who will agree to do it then yeah you see how much but how much promotion you see for Dana White's contender series yeah it's all over yeah ratings are way better that's way better yeah well it's just they're out it's what people want to see his fights they're going through a divorce with Fox and then I got right we're just gonna slip here till December then we'll take our stuff get the fuck out we're right you can keep the dogs and then we'll figure it out weird it's so weird and then fox like posting stuff the WWE cuz they're coming over so they're flexing on their new side piece it's so pretty it's but it's how many carry over audience members are there from UFC to WWE cross I don't yeah I don't know Fox and give a fuck cuz they what they know for sure is you can control the narrative WWE on those Friday night or Wednesday night smackdowns where the fuck they caught bring in three million viewers every single night and it's gonna be chaos and but they end it can control the ratings they can control the Superstars and control everyone's destiny they know that fan base brings that no matter what you see is not that right yeah so it's if your Fox is kind of smart yeah it is smart it's it works for both parties Fox any of you just try to make money its way to go yeah if you're fox that's like care about race the way to go just trying to make money I think the the thing about The Contender series though is that it's a fight pass thing right so it's all just good for the UFC like well they don't know why yeah but also how many people are seeing that I don't know how many people watch it I think fight past is 200 to 300 thousand subscribers and Tuesday night contender series is only on five pass that correct yeah do they release it ever on YouTube that might not be a bad idea highlights they blast out and stuff I don't know but I don't know yeah it's that's a that whole world of up-and-coming talent he's gotten so different the levels gotten significantly higher I see guys coming into the UFC for the first time and I'm watching him flying mic wow this guy's fighting like he's been here for five years I see I guess in no Drive some of it I looked at your holding how many fights they have and they're like kids ain't like Danny's that good Jesus and then sometimes like you look at this Germany card which lasted seven hours which is a whole nother topic we should do discuss but when you in the eye look at some and you the difference between like say a robert whittaker versio Romero versus you know some different cards where it's an opening main card fight the the talent pool sometimes is so different well that just could be cards you know sometimes you get a card in the talent pool in that card is just not the highest level and then you get other cards where like you don't even know who the fighters are and the talent really has insanely high my point is when you watch other main professional sports you don't you don't get that no I'm saying no but you also get all you think about the volume of boxing matches versus the volume of UFC cards it's not even close the number of fights that people are paying attention to every card has 11 to 13 fights and I think that's our problem well the problem is it's popular it's popular with people that want to do it these young badasses that want to prove they're the best there's a lot of them you say it's Piper as far as contestants people signing people signing up for what's not popular is people tuning into all these fights no no you that's the issue you you have to make it special right but do you because here's the thing even if you just have a small number that are tuning in every week say if you have fights every week and 300,000 people watch what call there's a commercial disaster you still are building 300,000 people it's gonna be a different 300,000 people quite possibly next weekly alarm at least some of them are : you're going to have different narratives you have different fighters you shine and then they're gonna go off into pay-per-view events they're gonna go off into big ESPN events they're gonna become household names and that's where the money is going to be made and so the our argument is the more fights you have even if some of the fights aren't doing well you are still allowing a really high level of competition these fucking assassins merged through the top these Darren tails and these Yoel Romero and all these fucking killers come to these Bora chena the fucking eraser versus Yoel Romero amazing oh my first team all body both crazy muscular I'm not mad at you I mean superheroes joke to your point you back to your point where your saturation the saturation in the market and you're hoping that these superstars come out of there that's not working well here's the thing there's a cycle and I think there's a cycle the same way there's a cycle of predators and prey do you know if they have like snowshoe hares and Lynx there's a cycle where the snowshoe hares get to a very high number and the Lynx eat them all and then the Lynx get to a very high number and they run out of snowshoe hares and then the legs drop down again and the snowshoe hares come back up this is the natural cycle and you're saying the cycle is gonna be like a Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey or Brooklyn there's always gonna come there's always someone there's always someone who rides who's the biggest draw right now in the economy for sure besides besides him George st. Pierre if he wants to fight George sleep well broccoli just went be Conor Brock George those new youth recast yes Brock would not be Conor at this stage you have one two three right but if the UFC was around I mean if we were at the stage where Brock was like say before he beat Frank Mir like when when he was the heavyweight champion when Brock was just smashed he was a he could sell what was like the highest pay-per-view with Brock in it I think was like two million to third highest honor and Nate's first yeah so it's it's in that light wasn't as popular then I don't think as it is now but they did the Doug he had the wre fan base crossover but what's interesting to a lot of people don't you know there's a reason why but the demand for Nate Diaz to because remember he's part of the biggest pay-per-view of all time with Conor McGregor so Nate Diaz in that tear to you can go Connor Brock Rhonda Nate's four or five is he it's number two UFC 100 averse is Frank Mir 1,600,000 bars that's a lot it's only fifty thousand different than Nate Diaz vs Conor McGregor which is number one that's pretty crazy those numbers are crazy so and then Connor Gregor Nate Diaz Conor has one two three four five shooting what you'll see two hundred so you have got Chicago yeah Brock has a shit LeBrock as one two three are the top seven yeah therein comes in at number eight they're in their own during their own stratosphere right so is Nate Diaz like people want you know didn't they don't toss them in there Nate's right there yes number one number two that Amanda Nunez Ronda Rousey got a million million Nate Diaz but that's alright because he was fighting Conor McGregor right well and that's why it hasn't taken a fight because that's that trilogy is the biggest one money biggest that hasn't yeah I mean it is the biggest it's the biggest if con here's the thing if Connor comes back and decides to fight khabib that's a fight it's gonna be a gigantic enormous biggest pay-per-view of all time I think that's the but if they decided to do it in Russia very fucking insane and I'll be watching from here with you guys we're doing it's probably a sock to we're gonna do some big things in Russia I'd really like you to come like good cut to me my face full Eskimos I love it in Russia amazing yeah the problem is that trip the trip concise I'll be here with you got to be here with you guys anyway yes more fun Conor could be I really like being there live don't get me wrong I love it I love the job but I'm gonna be honest it's more fun watching the fights with you guys yeah for sure of course it's not even close it ain't even close drinking good wine yeah have a cheese get any pissed some people off because you chewing on the microphone yeah it's the most fun until we get into glue Menotti stuff keeps any I can take a sharp left are you gonna enjoy that I get beyond I'm miss Eddie but Eddie done now he doesn't drink he doesn't drink no he doesn't drink anymore and he's way more reasonable well like with that kind of stuff he's not in evolution I don't know if that's true I haven't really talked to about that just I'm just reading it was a fight didn't announce the big fight Mike Perry Cerrone whoo Mike Perry in den Bergh that's crazy that's a great fight that's crazy finally pay like freakin great yeah he's dangerous man he hits fucking ha plus his last fight against Paul filter he mixed it up he started fighting smart that was a real Cavs and Jackson is damn good yeah he said which means that Jackson Jackson Jackson Jackson crying Williams cowboy he said he was essentially running his own camp training himself before really yep yep and when you're watching him fight now he's seen what's my Woodleigh til that's the other guy but you're seeing him now in his last fight against Paul Felder he looked more polished he looked more professional and as a completely different still got all the marauder he's still a fucking killer still super aggressive knockout artists like controllers right control rolled right go up to 70 when he was just for that fight just they gave him an option he shortened look he would have done so tough he would have done way better in that fight if he didn't break his arm in the first place yeah I saw it I was like dude I don't like that role enough when it bounced off his head when it bounced off his head I was like dude that might be a broken arm I cry cause there's a lot of people like Paige Vanzant just had a second surgery in our arm because of that a lot of shit more surgeries than this the bone is not it's not easy to hit something with your especially a forehead yeah these guys efficient snaps man you know this is I'm really surprised we don't have more guys getting their forearms broken in blind and blocking kids yeah cuz there's some guys at house five look it's right break your arm no a little bit feller feller is is such a I think he's a high-level striker he's super fucking good man but look he is it he is a small guy yes in Mike Perry yes Mike Perry's a way more scary one strike artists even though Felder's really scary 55 you lose a little bit of that when you go up against the guys you just you just go until stood his ground toe-to-toe with that guy fell asleep highly skilled he's very smart we are yeah for sure we haven't seen his arms we've seen that version of Perry though and then we saw him like oh that was before right one of his most technical opponents like that Perry shows up against cowboy right it's like okay here's the fight that's like the island joband fight Allen Joe ban who's fought a smart technical fight outpointed Perry yeah and the way y'all point perfect he put you out boy to Perry that was more obvious it was a different Perry ain't hunting just yeah just more one-dimensional he was trying to just put those hands on yep but now you see a guy was trying to do that but with like some Winkeljohn strategies and he's young he's only like 26 right turn belt stun Hobie I'm see talk but Colby just had to get a nose operation for sinuses yeah and but this is the thing Colby goes and I smoked someone very close to Kobe Kobe goes dude I'm down for the fight I just went five rounds Willie's been out for how long do you me yeah I can do it in october/november just let me get ready I said I'm you have science that's fair and they went no stripping of the belt till you want it until like fuck I'll take it see that that seems to be a problem for anybody that's considering taking interim title fight in the future that Ortega Bryant eiga saw that and he was like listen they're offering him before that when his fight got cancelled cuz max Holloway was running to all those medical issues they offered him a fight for the interim belt and I think it was against Jeremy Stephens fighting this weekend they offered Frank Jaeger and Germany Stevens and so he Frankie everyone's crazy that doesn't make any sense that's what Brian said yeah and so then Jeremy and Jeremy Stephens is fucking dangerous yes he is talk about a guy who puts his sling dangerous for anybody he's doing such a good fight for anybody he and he is guns blazing he's fighting all those who again son I know that's a great fight so at 55 write something all those 4445 so they offered him all those offered him Ortega they offered Ortega a fight with Jeremy because Jeremy's already cut and wait for this fight or you know at training for this fight which is only a few weeks later and he says well it's interim title it doesn't mean anything I want the real belt fighters don't take it serious well here's why they shouldn't now right well this is a basic example like why would I fight for interim belt you just stripped cold now this is us assuming that we know the whole story right I don't know the whole story I haven't talked to Colby I haven't talked to Dana but I don't I think the conversation I'm not a fan of the idea of an interim title unless there's extenuating circumstances like someone's got a broken leg they have to be out for six months without it but it should be a year if they're out a year yeah do summited would lose out a year correct yeah so that's why it made rd8 made sense and also just to play if I'm Dana if I hey Whitley we need you to fight and you want these super fights turn down fights what can we do let's force his hand create this interim belt he's been out a year which I like I wasn't talking about that that's a norte go okay i was talking about brian ortega because max Holloway is defended fairly recently and he was getting ready to fight kabhi it's not like he's been out a while they offered him the khabib fight he tried to cut wait for it and he might have fucked himself that way is that what it was yeah it's entirely possible they're still trying to figure out what happened well one of the pieces of speculation is that his body started shutting down because he went through a real bad cut for the when he was trying to make the khabib fight at 55 on super short note that's the hard thing for him to make 55u is huge she's like 185 what yes dude max is a big fella Ortega's fucking huge 285 Emily I stood next time I was like how big are you he's always bigger how is bigger so this is the problems make these guys they need a lot of time to get down to this weight right so how all the way trying to do that this is one this is pure speculation Holly we trying to do that is what it was very hard for him his body broke down and then in cutting weight for this fight once his body started the water load his body knew what was going on and started shutting down this is speculation pure spec but here's my point you can't make me until you know that he's gonna be out for a certain amount of time it seems like an interim title belt is almost disrespectful yes like he's he's the champ makes no sense but I think I just like it was find out but I feel like was a corporate decision when they went okay we have to fight we need to fill this gap we have to fight will they ask to fight some of you of course that way we can you're talking about some different yeah but I'm saying I'm saying they go they go we won there's got to be a title fight how about you okay how about you have this how about you give the Kolbe retains his interim title because there's extenuating circumstances with him medically yeah he had to get nasal surgery he's out until November Kobe gets the next shot whoever the fuck yeah mrs. fight Kobe fights next yeah dream on see but you haven't talked your boy Danna maybe he's saying that maybe I stripped there's no you screwed listen fuck your belt but you will get the next shot whoever won this yet taking your quiet heard there was Ronnie did some well maybe was us Mont Guzman wants to fight till next and he's like let's do this for the real number one contender spot cuz Usman is a guy who has quietly been beating everybody they put in front of you his last what he has and I love him his last fight wasn't the most exciting but if you go through you know who Maya has fought you look at the way Kobe did he like prior to that you know you ceman would have the worst argument but he has the most potential probably like he said not no one wants to fight before the Demian Maia fight I wouldn't agree with you cuz both guys beat Damien right before that was not good I'm sick of their decisions right it's not like you he wasn't dare telling people I meant before the Demian Maia fight with Colby Colby didn't have a lot of big names on his resume he had one throttle position over Demian Maia yeah so like what do we got here we beat Damien Myers well in his last fight although there was a thing about that fight that bothered me two things one the referee chose to separate Demian Maia from Oman when he had him from behind any other wizard dude was a fucking compromising position it was look at your position that was I this is not loose monster fault this is just the referees fault I said I severely disagreed and agreed with Matt Serra who was talking about the guy takes the fight on short notice he gets to a good position you tell him to work you got to be careful not to lose a position you're talking about a super high-level wrestler in whose montt you can't just let go and it was for a world-class crap like damn you mine he needs one nanosecond for us when to make a wrong turn yes you can't get upset there's a situation that's happening with this guy has the best chance of winning and he's he's at the door he's at like step eight out of ten he's got the back but he might go to 9 and then loose maan might try to defend he might go to 10 entirely possible this is happening right now how is manga sound 70 by the way even with this huisman so goddamn good but you look at 170 what's where's the fire man why does everyone have to fight for the title right away let's not kill off all these I think one of the things is because they want that they need stars yeah they want that pay-per-view card to have a big headliner and you know and woodleigh's ready right you can create that with trilogies with great fights with I mean there's a way they seem to be a better strategy than the feed your dad's young but that's if you didn't have a schedule that you had a fill see boxing is different in that boxing doesn't have a schedule they have to feel that way who's making the schedule why did that to fill in that schedule I don't know 100 fighters on staff they well they commit to it you may have to commit to surmount of fights right with Fox and pay-per-view might picture a Vitor standing with Dana and from their fucking board of fighters and trying to figure out who fights who know I've got a headache I almost blacked out just looking at the board a hard-drinking about five hundred fighters you're responsible for putting into fights and holding prey Shawn Shelby and Mick Maynard and then running around Joao Silva's in his underwear rolling around with his buddies and Joe Silva fucking Virginia karate in my basement but he's reading books and chilling McMahon iord and Shawn Shelby with in fucking and you know Silva Joe Silva all the through them have one thing in common all more super smart dude yeah yeah those matchmake it's not like this like oh let's do this they're very very smart guys learned about a lot of books from Joe Silva look at look at that board and look at all those names on that board some that don't give us the top 15 that still gives me a headache really in every weight class look at it it gives me a fucking headache that doesn't give you a headache no yeah because they're not all call they get ranking dude all those guys if we could figure out the match it's not get long and then some of them take care of themselves one two you're up looking for I mean driving Ferraris and making deals you have time to make these matchups got improve your time to hang on bill on Instagram you get time those numbers team rankings bro yeah who's gonna play to what gets crib at cz part was really this many of those people have his phone number and text him all the time right now my god just taking my phone bottom no no that's see what's crazy if you think this is easy one to 1515 through fucking 100 is so complicated part yes we're it's the number 50 guys gonna fight 43 where they fight when you put them flat membrane you're not ranked right so until you crack that top 15 nobody gives a shit yeah but you still gotta get matchups for matchups yeah and how often you getting those matchups you get in a fight once a six months once a year you know it's raised on the left they have the pound-for-pound rankings hmm that's very strange mmm-hmm it almost Mears completely the website though like that's the very first thing Chris cyborg soon right now does yes they're supposed to December the other inside works pissed about it she wanted to do September but a man in new it says two we took this my put some weight on she said she needs time but she's gonna fight her inside Boyd's not happy about it why don't you want fight in September cyborg fights once every year she said let's go man but she also goes all right well if tonight give me that give me someone else I don't want wait till December you fight bold but like me if a cyborg does decide to like to leave the UFC are they gonna be able to get her fights somewhere else doesn't matter yes he's like in her fight right but who else is going to be able to it's not gonna be easy for her wherever she goes know where she goes no no - good yeah well - good and there's a lot of 45 I mean you saw big Megan Anderson looks Meighan excuse me looked when she fought Holly Holly Holm yeah I mean she looked a lot bigger than her good he gave her a warm-up and then had her fight cyborg that that would have been better I won't kill her off with Holly Holm who's this animal yes now you don't have a competitor for cyborgs right Romanian we've been a fun one for cyborg we did think that you know vegan is physically very big very strong likes to stand up and bang but now like at least a part of her game for that fights been pretty exposed this first finding of C fightin Holly Holly Holm I now say it's what she did get kind of wrestled and dominated and hung the ground by Holly's not you know what I mean so you're right mm that's but still that was a plan for that fight too yeah work needs but cyborg needs more like stars and competitors like stories why kill one off with Holly Oh hundred percent but the thing is like at least that's a fight where there's a name and a name so I can sell some paper views with that fight well for Holly at least I mean it's like Megan Anderson at least has some height behind her she comes in it's a good fight for Holly Holly took a big risk taking that fight you test you know what if she loses you know it's bad situation along and going up to 45 you know staying at 45 when she's a widget 30 but also cyborgs ain't gonna fight Holly she goes no you just don't be that girl and get a rematch when I beat you exactly so who fights are ya yeah so now you're in this situation we're like all right let's call up a man and nunez right Nunez fighting Cris cyborg is very intriguing to me we're more dangerous I think that's gonna be more dangerous than one way more damage but he should have fought anybody that anyone's cyborgs ever fought correct other than Geena and that Thai girl Sherina bars you know she she knocked her down with a front kick to the face I would say a prime Holly's now stronger because Holly Holly can get up to that weight a man in is me she's coming up she's smaller you know I she's smaller though yes Holly is awesome and super highly skilled and a counter striker yeah stylistically is more dangerous for cyborg and cyborg beat her pretty candidly yeah maybe if she fired me Holly is a little older she's like 36 man it's coming forward and cyber coming forward there are two Mac trucks one's a way bigger fucking Brazilian truck yeah what do you thinks gonna have I didn't know I that's a really good point because I didn't know I feel like Amanda Nunez is is shoulders why she just looks everybody she's not sir no and she does press forward like relentlessly here's the thing she doesn't have to fight that way we're assuming that she has to fight that way you tell me sure his footwork like Holly well she used a lot of footwork in great hands great hands she watches hard she punches my arms long arms and punches hard you know has longer arms and punches harder yeah sighs the greatest of all time I think Amanda says has more technique but I think when you come up like that in you have this animal cyborg it just I think skills you get Claressa Shields to learn how to sprawl you're seeing Jamie bring up Chris's shields in cyborgs barn yes she was a champion black black boxer black girl girl - nice a black Jose guy thank you said Gus a guy just made a mistake like sometimes I say Brian I really know she's amazing she can boring and they bang bang now now imagine it name another professional female fighter gonna get down the 0 oh and she's in one big metal is Brian yeah I watch this let's watch this yeah there's zero I would pay money for you to jump in there with either one of these girls I just wanna start look at look at her fucking skill level like the way she's waiting with a counter with straight shots and use that jab and go to the body and then up to the head there really chris is doing work oh yeah Landrus man she's fucking dangerous and Clarissa correct me if I'm wrong I believe she fights at a heavier weight yes no you're right I think she fights at 65 is that what her way she's happy yeah and she's the best female block to the world right yeah and look at her fucking counter strikes because she goes to the body into the head look at that to that right to the body and right over the top and she's on cyborg two men they're throwing down she's winning the rounds but cyborgs holding her own is my boy oh yeah and by the way of cyborg he pick is good cyborg could kick her legs claw recipe I'm just saying when we thought about the noonas fight we talked about her stand ups like I get that but cyborgs very big man and deals with high-level boxers for sure ready is my favorite female fighter mmm the only faces Clarice is standing right in front of her and pressing her and she's trying to put it on her I don't think Amanda noon is smart strategy would be to fight this way that strategy would be to use the aggression of cyborg and try to counter and guess what she can and get out has she ever fought that way before though Wow can she can't just smart enough that rounds a genius she fought real slick against Raquel Pennington it wasn't just my crowning in mauling what I say Mike man Mike's crush yeah he is champion in his own right great fighter himself yeah he lost you was Jose Aldo a lot of money Dan Lambert put a lot of money in American Top Tommy got motherfucker if it wasn't for him it wasn't for Dan Lambert and his contributions the state of MMA would be a percentage or two lower than it is now couldn't agree more it's a big no cold either no no a lot just go under their wing and brought them up and they just built a new place he put in dormitories built a giant gym like built it from the ground up bought a piece of land put a fucking structure up he's a monster I need to put him in the Hall of Fame no bullshit should be in some sort of MMA home and I mean if guys like these think about the amount of money that he had to invest the time had taken the fact he wasn't making any money out of it's a passion project yes he's lost a lot of money and he got fucked over by a bunch of people too but really no need to name names but he'll he'll tell you personally he got fucked over by a bunch and yes that he trusted and and over the over the years he learned who could trust and who you can and develop this incredible school and this incredible gym and I mean it's one of the best facilities on the planet Earth when it comes to MMA training and people my level guys yeah unbelievable yeah this is it right now I mean that's crazy phenomenal phenomenal gym but it's an investment the fact that he had the balls to put the money up for something like that long long last time with you first time I ever said Hector Lombard and I he walked across the mat and I'd never quite seen anybody that thick and and he was like Cuban Jeanne sauvé goes you all remember what she was he find out and they're like the time it was 85 and I didn't I'm just well Bryce and beans and playing with the chicken no Hector Hector every time you ever have that garlic chicken from dude they have a garlic chicken with onions during a lemon sauce a lot Cuban rice that's aside come on Chilean culture I love Cubans I love you I like the killer knows Joey dudes but I love no no I love that you Cuban baby Miami is great because of because of the Cubans it's a big part of it for sure for sure there's such a black people Oh best audiences I fucking love them I love I make the best cigars on the planet Earth everybody knows that and good-looking right so hard to get any where are they you get some fake ones too there's a limited amount of land they grow it on the most precious land I think it's something ridiculously small yeah yeah yeah I think there's the v8 Viejo a baja what is the name of the area there's one area where they grow yeah I don't care we're gonna find out here I mean it's this this soil there's something really special but what is so special something about the mineral content and soil yeah how is that way yeah if you you buy a plot of land here and the wines like 30 bucks a bottle for whatever reason because of where the Sun hits and what time just over here like the next plot over is worth like you know binds up yeah there's a hundred or Bothwell Abajo in the semi vol toe region so the Pinar del río province it's located the western end of cuban contains the view view view l went so well Tahoe the VLT Abajo is where everybody wants cigars nowhere in the world grows tobacco better than cue yeah so that area though grows these cigars like if you ever had a really good like hoyo de Monterrey double corona caravana now this is what you want to do bro you want to eat a fat steak like a fat ribeye and after you sit there with a double espresso this is such a guy in a ridiculously fat cigar that gets you high after to pop this Cuban cigar but here's the fourth one of those drug Tigers at my feet so I can squish my Phoenix car drugged up tonight we'll try it yes yeah nyquil the fucking tag all heroin Mountain hey guys you ever seen those guys roll those cigars it's brown Presley's it's a skilled thing on craftsmanship thing yeah it's not simple like rolling a joint I thought it was done between that beautiful beautiful Cuban these people doing it they they're skilled man they know which tobacco Leafs to take and how to put it together and what you put on the outside is different than what's in the inside and this fucking one guy I was watching at the airport someplace near the airport rather where they would roll cigars you're gonna go and watch them do it and it's like we stand in front of the windows dude puffing on Sookie this was in Miami I went with Joey way way way back in the day there was a place where you could go we could watch some people roll cigars and so they would they would roll the cigars in front of you impress them and put it all together just like this guy here only has like few moisture yeah but dude it's impressive because he's scale like that well this craftsman yeah they knew how to do it like he's trimming it and they're doing it all by hand and by feel and he knows how much to put in the cigar look at this so now he's the smoke yes so he's rolling this bitch up looks he's broken it all up by hand and he's getting his finger wet and wetting down the lead yeah dude it's seriously skilled labor and you got this beautiful ants I have a question I'd be rolling 20 of those in the same box and Lexia cuts it with that that thing oh fuck you I have a quickly pinches it down seals the end this is beautiful man where do you think he's doing extra cuz the cameras are there no no this is how they do it I wanna be broke and then this is the outside so that's the inside of the leaf then they take the outside so there's the outside which is what do they call that shit they call the outside of the leaf so they he trims it to perfect size and then he gets this bitch up there and it rolls that motherfucker - I get that okay it's a petit roll it tight you fuck look at how he's like backing it up and slowing it down add a little moisture here let me get my hand on my pants keep talking yeah these guys are skilled laborers I mean this is up you guys love cigars I do enjoy sir Garvey now and again but not like you're not doing every Friday night oh shit hey you're your consort I have a question you're a pot connoisseur um I was thinking about this they spray thou fuck got a weed right they spray it with lots of pesticides do they I believe Allah Oh kiss a lot it's grown in don't you should talk to Gino no I actually have I actually have it on good side serger organic pesticide because it's valuable and it gets moldy so they're gonna spray it to death then it doesn't really get washed your selected from from my when you're doing in bulk you're buying people who deal the stuff in big balls they kind of did moneymoney spray and then you smoke that I wonder what that does I wonder if you're going have fun yes everything yeah the weed fuck your past asking a question fuck your pesticide just come on smoke yeah but I think they must wash it I don't think they do they definitely don't you think those you're seeing how about this when you're counting million dollars when you got those money counters and they're in a room and they're kinder like they're because a lot of us is cash right yeah guess what yeah you might want to go in there with a mask why number one you can actually get a rhino's from the cocaine residue and you get sick because the the dirt that comes off money what do you say have you ever seen what they found on money they found shit on money first of all only should we every dollar bill has some residue of cocaine like every like not just dollar bill hundred yes yes but forget all that the they found that this guy did this now son a bunch of different dollar bills they even found white rhino horn powder on all fun I'm just a bunch of the bills because well it gets you know the number of times its but you know but they found crazy shame Rhino what they found cocaine they found all kinds of a weird party bro yeah the Rhino powders the weirdest and that weird cuz it cuz probably my soldiers were dealing turning back and forth here's the thing about the R I don't think there's nothing that shows that that does anything now we're talking about the bear by that Rhino thing to know just fucked up that's the craziest is soul it's killing rhinos just like almost to say oh this tea is made out of dead rhino you come have a seat right we're drinking rhino tea do you tell me if you're up it's always like dude we up rhino horn tear like well you know what man if you're far enough removed from the actual source of the misery you don't actually see the rhino get it shot in the head and his horn hacked off and you just think you're a fancy guy with a gold Rolex on drinking some rhino tea yeah you know I mean there's a lot of that inclusive you want to be exclusive they love it and and I think it's called the green hills of Africa I think it's called a Hemingway book and he describes killing a rhino and it was done back then did your second one bro oh yeah again nuts stricter honor in that in the fuck just flew from the other side of the planet I'm part of what a week why I went and bought all that weed last week is because the new rules came into place for six months which is I guess it started as so Jamie's like give me that pesticide covered feet son I don't want your bullshit ass clean we like it just now starting that makes sense we smell is what I've been smoking a lot lately is blunts with the tobacco on this out I just smoke the inside yeah poor pig lungs no great now I'm hooked on cigarettes thanks Joe well I got back into it again with Chappell Chappell smoked one with me and I was like dude I'm like elevated here he was this nice right I go it's weird I go it's like the tobacco mixed in with the weed I forgot about it and the last time I had really smoked one before that was with Charlie Murphy what does I say Jule users sue what over the addictive East cigarettes that's given too much nicotine so you fucking babies well that just stops last time I last time I saw you pal he was in the back he was using one of the fucking vapor pens yeah who's my doctor says this way Ben I want have you ever looked into that because that's not they don't know for sure if it's that much better for you vaping yeah yeah I don't know if it's better but I know a lot of people say it's better I don't like Coke it's out what is that you're you are getting smoked with a vape but it's but that's it right in that smoke like in that container there's alcohol there's all sorts of weird shit in that fuck that stuff yeah well that's the thing with those weed ones - I ran into some dude who told me he makes it with MCT oil yeah oh good well why not yeah oil I guess yeah you are ingesting in your lungs yeah yeah you're doing something yeah I'm getting in the second Alex I've decided you've decided I'm not kidding dude we did DMP together why do it again and I like that I want to do acid I've never done that I've done mushrooms many times admit you know what you know I like them in life cuz I'm going in the meditation store I'm getting in the meditation to zoom do you miss attention once use the tank I've done that my ego dude remember once right here for you that's what you want okay remember the one time we used the tank in San Francisco yeah I do bro not from hey get bad Brendan decided say say Brabham decided he was bored and he yanked one off both the jack my dick is the window so everybody else is calm people lining your cum deals that's yellow rude and you know that happens all time and that's why I'm never doing a public okay well let me tell you something this tank unless my short time is from fucking Good Morning America yeah unless he's jacking off in a tank right he's the only one who's been a don't let don't let don't let this degenerate in there cuz I'll tell you right now Jamie know this fucking guy will squeeze one off this is a big place I thought the filter the water I don't like being naked in warm water but I like is super exotic to me and jerk off before you go in there so you're not tempted does it the song floating yeah what if you're just Jack went off first then you'll be like man I wish I was horny right now sorrowful he came out he goes he's like this he he he I'm like how was your thing I go it was good it was actually really amazing kind of felt myself floating and I kind of he goes here what you doing shooting a heavy your goldfish skimmer well the salt kills everything but gee whiz whatever I want dead come on shout out to the float lab in Venice California and now Westwood they they have the best tanks and he's tick ulis about his fucking and filtration systems he uses water filtration systems for like like like you'd use for a city these giant fucking machines you should see the setup he put back here it's like commercial waters back here back here do they keep curbs to change tubro they keep everything out yeah and we film there's a one fucking time thing I was in the warm water I don't like be naked I get it I get it I get it look anytime someone says I was beaten off I go I get it yeah who doesn't I get it me too people are gross yeah especially men any other fights we should talk about to wrap this up it's deep a gonna get another shot at shit huh you know I mean this is no thinkin people thinking you know the guy fights wins more UFC title defenses than anybody in the history of the sport three becomes you know the most accomplished heavyweight of all time I mean you think about what he's done do you think about the fact he knocks out 4 BC over doom to win the title he knocks out Alistair Overeem defend the title knocks out Junior dos Santos stops beats Francis when everybody's terrified of Francis I mean he became the most accomplished heavyweight of all time right then he gets knocked out in the first round of crazy perfect punch by Daniel Cormier and a perfect strategy you got to go well he for sure I'd like to see a rematch it's like when you want to see him beat somebody first and then have a rematch I actually want to see that but for me Daniel Cormier I've always said is the most impressive fighter to ever step in the Octagon in terms of his stature I just think he's incredible right he said that to me the best I want to see him fight John Jones III know that John Jones this is hammer fellas so even without examiner cuts and all this 2:05 talk is like your marriage that's not happening yeah I'm retiring March broccoli ready to go Oh Kenny January worsen just ask for a title shot now after he just beat Glover and so you know he said something like hey you know like I love Corey omission but you know see music rock the fight is brought it's promised rolls the narrative goes can Brock pass tests look at me yeah yeah you know yeah how how long do you need before it's like the answers never Brian Gustafson open up on crazy situation taking them off UFC 227 those ears well what's what happened it's small injuries they won't talk about oh you won't talk about it then how is he opening up can well kiss people are like oh you won't find Anthony Smith but you fight DC or you fight a heavyweight presence officers are injured and then fight Anthony Smith versus Shogun was a fight that I was concerned about I thought Shogun retired yeah however he won three in a row if you would have won that yeah I want to see me get Tasha against DC because I want DC to get paid well Shogun is he was ranked I think eighth date for this fight but even though he's not that old how old is Shogun yeah hello courtesan fight work yeah just fucking Brazilian tortoise with a unibrow how old is show I mean exact 36 right he's my age is he 36 year old even though he's 36 like look when Bernard Hopkins was 36 is when he knocked out Tito Trinidad always been is in his pride his pride when he beat Kelly Pavlik he was I think he was close 40 or all I might have been 42 yeah so that's not our Kelly power yeah not for everybody doesn't mean that they're past their prime but Shogun I've been in so many wars and he got knocked out by Dan Henderson brother everybody's different nineteen came on the man Pride days too is different different world different world the drugs and probably don't like you now we snatch it's such a different environment yeah man you'd never know who was doing what back then Smith to some other fuck he's a mother now at 205 he's a council debugger let's not just propel him to fight Gus no no no dude but me the one he was ready meanwhile he was ready he wanted the funny looking here's the argument for it the argument for it is he knocks out Rashad on short notice he knocks out Shogun and then he'll say look I'll take this fight to that guys Roland he's ready to go he's a veteran he's got momentum you don't have fight the fight the most intriguing fight to me would be I mean it's not Brock and I like that probably like Brock DC because DC gets paid but for me the only resemblance yes but the moat the most intriguing fight to me in a lot of ways would be Yoel Romero at 2:05 so and deal with that wait cut with Daniel Cormier well Cormier was like nah nah nah you can't lose at this fight and this wait go yeah sure then you miss wait we're smart but then yo Ellison see you cheated when you made weight you know you're pushing down that towel at one time okay that one time that one time those real we wants about cheating for your l2d see what are you saying duel gate Oh still gay here's if you fucked my boy Tim over then coaches you're saying the coaches John McCarthy said it totally different when John McCarthy explained it to me and I think he explained to me off the air this is what was wrong the guy who put too much Vaseline on our yo-yo L was not in his corner the guy was a UFC employee and he wasn't coming back in and John was trying to get him to come back in and he didn't come back in and yo al sat down on the chair and he said if you had to do things differently would have done things much differently we would have forced him off the chair now but he said this clusterfuck that happened over 30 seconds was not cool because a yo Al's corner is because of a UFC employee then I take back what I said if John says that what John says his word it's work I will not argue with John about the effort he explained it to me in no uncertain terms he said but man he goes I feel like he got away with something he goes in and I never every fight after that I watched him like a hawk he goes I felt like he got away with something and it fucked him over no matter what stayed on his stool he did stay on a stool I mean there was yes if no one's getting this - I'm like I'm chilling 30 seconds is significant is 3 7 it's huge but then he had a good point he had a good point that could happen Tim at one point was holding his wrist he had cuffed his glove he was holding his what happens in a fight right he hit him with a punch and that was the punch that hurt yes so he has an argument you right it happens at every fight but it's not supposed to happen right it's not something you're supposed to do now Tim was in full barbaric rage when this was happening he's punched me because of graveling Club nicely he was grabbing some fucking throwing bombs he knows what he's fighting with the most athletic guy for sure he's ever fought yes I mean it was in a bad state in that fight I mean that was a like one fighting it was Jesus kind of writes another one yeah you are such a freak free such a free super freak else Henderson twice in the world champ he's super free you for this though he's a freaking I mean I think you won that Whittaker fight all due respect no not a chance Robert how dare you I think you want to be a draw no if you think you're ten eight rounds if you look at it if you won two rounds ten eight is it a draw what we saying one two rounds ten eight rounds right yeah yeah but one was like 10th around like damn it's ten eight so that'd be a draw and for sure but he didn't get it even in one which is fun there's an art that's a different better than two because in two rounds he had a badly hurt yeah the one was awful it was often a so let's say give them one tinning so let's say it's a draw whatever Robert Wiktor the first one beat him right we don't say be nice he did it with one leg and then this one he beat him with one arm Whitaker no he broke his hand that's right straight up beast that's one leg your right to eat you all yeah right that's a good treat say you know survived you a based on that clanging on his jaw yeah you know yo I'll hit him with some bombs you're not sick I don't have a problem the 10-8 on that was the fourth round four thing was the fourth round temperature yeah yeah wider crucifix and still getting better Whitaker is only 26 here's the problem though he gets injured all the time well who is he fighting he's fighting a brick wall I know but the problem for the brick wall literally a brick wall but the promise is fighting so he can't you know what I'm saying so you're going through that rehab me of broken bones you're not getting that much better in between yes but it's very possible that with a broken hand he can work his kicks he could work a lot of different things for sure with a broken hand he's not gonna have the same issues that he had with a knee see what the knee you got mobility compromises you have a real hard time training but with his hand he can do a lot of shit for sure yeah he's young he's young and he could still I mean look what he's doing in the fight he was throwing combinations with the laughter I love his kiss no his phenomenal well suck it by me with his kids all right any fuck his knees up really early in the fight like right from the jump he was using that oblique kick on the front amazed like side kick I got you over star park Bora Tina Tina I would never wear clothes if I had a body like then yes of course I got mad at I'm a boy Kelly Slater oh why Kelly was like you I don't think you pass the sniff test oh you mean ask Kelly I mean for every much of that Whitaker and Stephen Thompson well with Stephen Thompson just lost till so unless Stephen Thompson goes up to 185 I don't think it's gonna happen because Stephen Thompson is at 170 and then Stephen could do it he could go up to 185 and Q at welterweight the nightmare so if you want to get a quick title shot he didn't on one he did not rubber out but I think you can achieve that yeah I think you tribute some of that to the brutal weight cut you know what we're seeing these guys that are they're just taking so much out of their body to get to 170 there's why people get so fucking angry when someone misses weight by a couple pounds and still fights like Darren till so here's the argument against Darren till fighting for the title he beats Steve and Wonder Boy but how many pounds over was he a lot it was more than two right way more yeah I was a six it's crazy it's a lot I don't think was that much but it was a lot of weight it was more than two pounds that is a lot of weight to lose when you already dried out and he is an enormous welterweight so these are you manage the argument should be if we're in a fair world if you do not make weight and you win you cannot fight for the title next the problem is living in right the problem with that is financially that sucks because I want these guys to fight sure right and as a fan it sucks because I want these guys to fight but from the perspective of the athletes you got to think like men and so this brings me back to my original premise I don't think they should be able to cut weight I think what they're doing at one Fc and what Ben Askren detailed how they monitored his weight cuts move everybody's championship up a weight you've got the same champions you find out what fucking weight I did right wait for them Craig the roughest guy 70 nope your real weight is 185 for God's 185 you really would tell people with Stano No no no no they don't allow them to they do hydration tests through their entire camp they check multiple times they find out exactly what they way they find out what they really weigh plus hydration testing yes they're not cutting weight that makes sense they go up you go up a week so everyone just goes that last room went up to 185 he was fighting at 170 before I think I'm find that make make sure that's correct I know he was 170 years but I believe they made him go to by the title he kept his title so you don't strip the championship you just moved the champions up and it's healthy for everyone 100% and I think they should establish additional weight classes so was it say here result event day okay we will allow our athletes to come we will not allow our athletes to compete compete dehydrated Rich Franklin said powerful rich Franklin Franklin but if they happen to be overweight if they're hydrated but maybe half a pound over something like that we can negotiate a catch weight and we have parameters for that we have to at least 105 percent of their opponents weight oh they have to be at least 105 percent of their poems weight so they can't be more than 5 percent over is what he's saying damn ingenious he said we use an instrument to test the Pacific specific gravity of their urine which test how much solutes are in their urine he continued obviously the more solutes you have the more dehydrated you are so they have dehydration test so the established that a fighter is performing at a healthy weight they weigh in at that weight they're weighing in at that weight on more than one occasion they're checking it it should be easier in fact it's just better clear man but it's a lot about this t-shirt Lee does he was a big Toro fiber he was an 85 nad was an enormous 185 moly when he was the chance yeah he was so he knows a lot wake up and he was a fitness phenomenon man later he was like one of the guys that was one of the first super fucking conditioned guys right who just break guys with his pace and his will and collect him carries discipline he's a beast Rich Franklin does get enough credit he was a mouse because we see because we remember him from from Dave Anderson fights really god verse Franklin even but for most most of us heard about him when when we saw him just have to deal with that that the best solvable problem well back there his body though okay who's naked when he fought Anderson at that point in time Anderson was the best of all there's a ninja and I was they were like rich we need you to finance and I guess in do it again but when doing since they in front of all your friends and family he's an all the reasons I got into but you know Brown II think he had a different strategy his hat strategy was to be super strong super condition very highly skilled but not the same level of Anderson Anderson's thing was all technical yeah Anderson was all about technique and footwork and movement and he that trumps everything he's kind of a nerd I got tell us Albus told me that he said he's like the dude I was like what cuz he knew him really well I was like he's he was a martial arts nerve I mean martial art nerd he would like practice maybe that one weird thing where he did elbow up and laugh a guy out he's not practicing that apparently according to our hidden practicing that he was always doing this like I wonder if this would work I mean he's just really grating this worse than this his his fucking trainer told him to stop doing it because it's not gonna work he makes his wife hold a pillow for him so he goes home he's fucking blasting the pillow with this upward elbow he does it over and over again and pulls it off in the fight and knocks him dead with it it's a crazy crazy singer yeah you ever see his fight with Lee Murray and Cage Warriors now holy shit holy shit he was gonna retire to Big Nog homes like you can't stop come to the UFC he was catching his stride in England see he fought very well in Japan but then really came into his own in England he fought Jorge Rivera do you member Jorge Rivera he fought Jorge Rivera Jorge was teeing off on him he was letting Jorge punch them in the face and then he fucked him up yeah it was one of the scariest fights I've ever seen in like I don't know what the fuck he was doing back then but Anderson was on another side was it like this not a lazy suit but he was not that it was actually retired he was always skillful and yet you know it was never like crazy but I was watching him fight from the fights that I was watching from England so I I would you know as a hardcore fan especially back then I knew that there was a lot of talent that I wasn't seeing in the UFC when I was working for the USC so I was it's actively like trying to seek out all the guys that people that would hear about and I remember watching some of the Anderson's fights I was like oh this guy's hit a new place because guys do that man you'll see a fighter and they're really good they're really good they're really good and all sudden boom yeah they hit that girl what if that some of its like sometimes there are certain pockets of coaching that seem like a New Zealand I think things like this high level stress all for sure with style bender and with here's here's him versus what watch this he's like letting him hit him look at this he's holding on to him or he's hitting him or some Monsun hitting boom and he's like bitch this is not happening yeah ain't hurting me standing right in front of him I mean literally little let him punch him in the face and just rolled with them then how about when he comes to the UFC they're like cake Chris Leben fight this Brazilian this is like what but it's crazy how calm he was while Jorge was knocking people out man though he has big power the fact that Anderson was so skillful he was really able to just turn his face just slightly just standing right and move with those punches just enough to take the pop off of him and completely ruin his confidence and then he just starts putting it on and man he just started putting on prime Anderson you know how Elektra here is coming to the Octagon this this was a fight that really turned it around for me this in the leemarie fight there were two fights where I was like okay he's in a different place right now you know he just was so fucking talented and so good at judging distance and figuring out what to do and when to do it and he fought when he fought Demian Maia and Abu Dhabi it was a boring ass fuck but there was something in the first round that he did where I was like wait what he leaped and he hit Damien mile with a flying knee from about four or five feet yeah further away than I thought was possible dude I will I will never feet I wouldn't he launched himself to you so tightly and it looked it didn't look like it was much effort now when he knocked out beat Vitor that fucking front kick around first time we like kind of saw Soviet fucking start trying main event I remember I was sitting Basie Capeside my manager Lex was the mean he has bad eyes basically blind he can't see how his eyes and it happens I go that's the craziest thing I've ever seen sportiness what happened you wasted this fucking ticket like I remember shut up I remember screaming he fought kicked him in the face that was the that's the best sporting event live I've ever seen when King fucking vo crazy it was just this snack it was also one of those fights where you didn't know who the fuck was gonna win that fight that fight remember was beat or that was - that was pretty jacked up Vitor no no no no was it Vitor now it was embodied up the way he was it was it super he what he looked like well he wasn't you wait a minute you wonder what your L Romero he wasn't a damn but look at it look at his body's nowhere near the Vitor that Rockhold fight dude he looks pretty good no no no no no no no watch the fight back it up a little bit watch them actually move around before the knockout that's all it is now he wasn't he was a bit go to the weigh-ins no I remember very specifically that was the same look that he had when he fought like Takayama or sexy on for sure which wasn't terrible know what it was in comparison to how he looked when he fought Bisping like this with the t-tops wheel kick yeah yeah we look at the Vitor was a different Vitor what is this which one's this see very smooth this is not he doesn't look anything like TRT Vitor look at his neck look at his body traps are a little small yeah obviously he's all about 4,900 not even close I mean he's in very good shape don't get me wrong but he's got a TV tour yeah you know who beat TRT beater at his prime coach John Jones yes he did but John Jones just enormous so so much oh look at this hey driving thing with the hands Anderson was doing like wing chun animage remember people were booing cuz these guys would just move around and we're like come on let's do something then hit chow yeah he's looking for the move man he's looking for that opening he's looking for that opening and he's smiling smiling look at watch him look down - that's the other thing he did that old move that guys would look down at your feet and kick you in the head that's in 6 2 or 6 3 we think 6 3 X 3 yeah yeah he almost got starched here too man Vitor was throwing some fucking haymaker feetoes a monster asked a monster see this Vitor is very fit very good in shape Vitor but not TRT Vitor once they gave him the green light and then he'd have to worry about testing he was like.he he put a thousand horsepower engine in a Volkswagen drove off a cliff [Laughter] on Sun came out of nowhere then one to them look at again why is this they did not need the one-two but yeah look how he's looking at chest - oh yeah deceptive yep he looked at his chest front kicked him in the chin and that was literally the first time we'd ever seen a front kick to the face pale jaw-dropping there's only two moments that made my jaw drop that Anthony Pettis can remember when lyoto machida did the same thing to Randy Couture but he ended with a jumping front not castee kid that was disrespectful and then fuckin Vito's like this is your last round look at that same shit he's doing the fucking fact for you I got look at that Brandi you are ready for this fight the night before I told MIT's and mimicked lyoto machida wondering I didn't yeah that was the stupid thing he can fucking to them yeah you know disrespectful that is no and I said holy shit I go that he kicked his who that Tina goes well buy him some more teeth I said dude he's Randy go to her I want some shit with diamonds in this one when he knocked out Vitor this last fight that's the worst front kick you've ever seen what was perfect a walk-off home run and this is disrespect being polite he goes skip town and fucking Vitor just falls down and gets on his knees and pray yeah watch this but watch how perfect it is to watch that quick buck and right seat like stands over and then yeah my brother thank you for a long time in the cage yeah I'd rather you just walk off and jump on the cage with your dick I know I think samurai here that is a crazy front kick though and it's the same thing well you know Leon and Anderson our partners in crime back to back that up again let me see oh come on how cool is this yeah it's quite a few feet to us not joking the thing about the front kick is man if it's going to the face it's such a different thing than if it's going to the chest don't bow to me like that after you fuck yeah yeah it's not like good yeah and a lot of times when guys would take it to the body what they would do is kind of like almost like move with it a little bit try to move with it but that doesn't help you if it goes up to your chin Leo does just that career-ender like this is your last fight very cool Randy check this out Joe this is your last one let's try this is terrible that was terrible who knows we need to take this fine short no 25 and we've all been trained together Leo don't need one we're all trained just super jacked to can fly to London yeah was then that was the oldest first spin at 185 let's take a look at that I could say yeah he's a great guy he didn't he had a perfect opportunity first of all those two are the best men I know that event entered that right yeah they're both there for a long time both those were my training plan yup Danis three years amazing hey those guys were here that I saw you roll with that Liotta was such an unusual fighter so difficult to deal with he nice four years ago three years ago when the lock when we've done trained just had this brutal training session like us I go how much long I do this shit man and he goes six years I went fuck it yeah you have six years like we're like laughs and he's like no for sure I do I'm I forget what yeah well now he's in Bellator he's like a legit martial auntie yeah yeah you got a new warranty that's pumping keys on Van Nuys keep it rolling Chuck it's Chuck actually gonna fight Tito or is that comes that's happen in Golden Boy well even though they listened they said that it's gonna happen but there's no venue picked out they he's got a pass Bourdain is very very concerned about it yeah you know a lot of people are concerned like Dana said publicly that he didn't I mean there's a reason why he asked Chuck to retire nine years ago you know he doesn't he doesn't think it's right and he wouldn't he wouldn't put the fight on himself I mean whoever would put the fight on would make a shitload of money credit to them for not wanting to do it because Dana cares about Chuck but Chuck wants a fight so how you gonna stop them hey you stop because I want a fight and Oscar medically can pneumatically the thing is the the whoever the board I mean I don't know what his medical condition is you have to check how do they check that's a good question it's a good question we have cat-scans where they're gonna do it too that's highly doubt they doing in LA or cat or Nevada like Nevada New York those coming on like an Indian Reservation some shit like fucking Indian you know and obviously Oscar De La Hoya's long history of promoting he knows where he can get away with what and what we're gonna do but it's the thing is like will they do that or will they give them some real examinations and find out how chucks doing and hey Tito is good to go Tito's good to go he's been fighting recently he's been winning Reese's Margai yeah fine you talked to Tito I talked to Tito real recent lefty nominee like every week he's a hundred percent there yeah the best he's there he's a good guy we have an impression of Tito that a lot of it is based on his interactions with other people his fights that's so stupid but also that that's a product of the times with him because he was this badass the huntin Beach bad boy there was no podcasting there was no social media that's a change there's no podcast you need to know him know so Tito came on if Tito at the time as big as he is he came on your podcast he'd been even bigger can you go oh my god you did come on my podcast many many years ago literally retired yeah every time yeah I'm saying they've came and went during its heyday yes on a beach bad boy and you were as big as you are now with this podcast and you got his story out oh my god yeah have an idea who that person is like Kevin Lee is a perfect example great you've got this great guy super smart super tuned in superhero dishes fucking amazing fighter and young shit yeah massive massive potential but people saw him on the podcast got to hear him talk for three hours and he's super honest about everything about an articulate articulate mark outgoing and great control of his ego he's not he's not a maniac he's a psycho really yeah because you get a sound bites you get such a different impression of certain especially those interviews man those interviews of guys like told me what you can do to your opponent I'm gonna fuck him anytime I why when I rocked off the scale and I'm like energized just like yeah what are you gonna do to them you're all aggressive you don't care you know who would I think I would grow even bigger as a superstar if they did a pot get your podcast Oh Conor McGregor oh yeah sat down don't get well I'm just right no I think you'd get less hate I'll see he has all the accolades in the world but and there's the stool or the dolly all that shit yeah but as a person we sat down you talked to him you just didn't get all that you know hoopla over here and you sat down talked to him oh I think you'd be even when he retires I don't get that why we almost did it before there was some some trying to figure out times like before he became gigantic before the DA's fight before he won the title there was some talk about it it's just you know what man for better or for worse I don't chase anybody and I'm not saying you are own but I'm saying I know there's some great guests like I know III know there's some people that I would really like to get on but if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen I like having you guys on as much as I like some scientist who flies in France I really do I just like I like talking to people that are fun whether it's talking to you guys are talking to whoever the fuck it is I would like to get Obama on one day I would like to talk to him you combine your getting huge maybe sure I would like this are so a lot of people would you like to get Trump on I would talk to him yeah why and why not are you gonna get real answers though that's a fine the president you know you'll find out if you get real answers did you talk to me or have you ever talked to me about when he and Obama on now to submit a list of questions that the okay the questions it does and even you know he goes listeners great I'm glad to give me the time but that's not like a real podcast right like you that's me there can't be an agenda and I can't know what I'm gonna ask you next I come round like when we come on here fight camp and there are podcasts there I've no attend I have no idea what they have to be they have to be concerned you're gonna set them up and make them look bad there's so much on the line for everything and when Obama was doing this Obama was a sitting president he was about to leave office you know and they probably had very strict rules in terms of what they would allow and not allow in terms of interviews and this isn't the platform for do you think Trump doesn't give a fuck about all that I guarantee you he would be more confident and more open to just being able to figure his way through it because he wouldn't worry about them he shoot from the hip he doesn't prepare first I also wouldn't worry about me outmaneuvering him know like he's not he's not just our dude but also have you ever heard Trump before his present on Stern yeah there's some of the greatest interviews he's hilarious well he was great and but even but he's also older you know and then also the pressure that gig and then the pressure of everybody hating him yeah you know the whole thing is fun and I'm not saying this that he's the greatest guy in the world but I'm saying the whole thing is insane nobody should be President fucking thankless job nobody should have that kind of power and it's such a dumb move to take that gig at 70 it seems to me a decision you make you piss off 50 percent of you and you make 50 percent how much time you're not gonna win how much time do you have left we got twenty years left if every it's a nice cherry on the sundae for a guy like that was easy with his ego but also to say hey you have four years to accomplish all this I fuck for it this year do you know who that Gianluca bocce guy is he's that a Italian guy he's he does a lot of dancing on the Instagram he's a super millionaire super fuck go to his his Instagram video in shape he's got a video of him dancing and there's all these girls with no pants on behind him bent over with her ass up in the air so he's a Italian that seems to be doing when you've got Trump money what Trump should be doing is fucking be half-naked by the pool dancing on a but I guess sternest like this I'm watching to watch this real quick this is what if I was if I was friends with Trump I would say listen bro powerful wonderful dad like this guy he's my he's younger than me no he's died no Brian he's older knew I was fifty-fifty yeah he's he's in the neighborhood oh so he's a little wrinkled because he's in the Sun every day but meanwhile he's doing this every day - it's awesome ankle bracelets dude look at the bitches in the bag yeah yeah well this is the point this is what I would tell Trump to be doing do this and then lock the watch the girls behind them those are life goals however that's a moment I see that I see a lonely man I think you're wrong look he's happy a shit he's always laughing always smiling either it's a tremendous act or he is actually a happy rich guys getting intense all over the world fuckin peace too legit what sir and he's doing he's he's working as a DJ everywhere and he's got all these videos of him having a great time oh wow I mean dude he's out would you rather beat him or Trump that's what I'm saying yeah this guy's having a great time with his money all these people it's all love and happiness he's jetting all over the world doing stand-up even Elon Musk take notes bro Trump is just you know he's a guy wanted to win look mister steal yo colors oh look at that outfit Brian get some fucking tattoos I got here some tats Mallory brothers just wrote on when this guy's our marker he's got some bad tattoos - he's got a picture of his face on his back going like this shush it's the shut the fuck up tattoo he says dude it's a it's

when you're billing it it's - oh he's got water there yeah hello on his right to it cuz you need love on your right to it yeah dude he's kind of killed hey this is the thing man this guy's smiling every time I see Trump he's got a bigger and bigger round and he's aging yeah by the day he's aging like fruit just like Haiti my fruit ah yeah it's not fine wine no cheese the UM the P the fuckin most recent Cohen tapes Cohen's releasing tapes now of him negotiating about paying off a gal yeah well they seize those tapes you always not always and Eastham cuz he sees the nine tapes I believe just to do they definitely did that but I believe they said that Cohen released him the CN n is that true see if that's true did you see that his wife got busted watching CNN he freaked out she was on Air Force One watches CNN they call it hate watch enjoy dude come on she's got a it's tough when when the stormy Daniels and the other one comes out you know dude you know what that's true who's fucking her where's that dude he's a beautiful well she's probably keeping it together for a kid man she's got a ten-year-old kid here this is Donald Trump erupted with rage when milania's Air Force One TV was tuned to CNN says leaked email how crazy is the president is in a battle with CNN that is so kind of winning doing some kind of winning well what do you know definitely 100% done is damaged their reputation among some people I killed and she kind of dessert with sometimes like the mainstream media deserves because what happens now is to stay in business they've got it they've got a create a Clickbank really people is shitheads white house bands Network pool reporter from Rose Garden event whose just she asked him about the con tapes and days you got being from damn you can get banned if you ask him questions how does that work do you have is it like he's military yeah the fucking a list of questions I think the White House is always reserved the right to sort of you're invited into the press pool I believe and and I think intelligent that sort of that the president probably they're always little sneaky little be a little sneaky things that the executive power has that's kind of granted to the executive the craziest one is the pardon thing you can go yeah and they killed a bunch of people Brian but I like you we will smoke stogies together yeah did you guys listen to I admit it the new are Kelly 19 min so I haven't I've heard it's amazing is it Lee its omegas he talked about JC a fortune law and got away with it there that's supposedly what happened yeah but does he admit a lot of it I mean yeah no he doesn't admit peeing on anybody or that the videos him what's he admit he admits it's most of the song is just him talking about all the chicks e-banking about how they took all his money because the they made him sign contracts when he was young and he was dyslexic and he couldn't read gave away all the rights to his music and talk about those flaws that he has and how many girls he lied to and how many girls he banged and he goes over that whole story about him with the young girl with your senior group who said that who said that I don't know you got Ralph I mean I know he was 14 year was some just good someone gets off or summary of their peers doesn't convince me I thought who would the fuck knows yeah but it does not mean that he didn't do it have you seen the video no it looks yeah no I watched them yes on a girl it certainly looks like it here goes Kelly secretly marries fifteen-year-old Aaliyah yeah 22 years ago today yeah that was no no that was Aaliyah that was a singer I know that was a different thing yeah that's in the song too you know illegal in a lot of places right you mean everyone today I think 16 in Vegas is 22 years ago that was it I cuz that's when it was I think was always 16 right I think 15 seems very young they kept that under wraps that was in public knowledge I think the age of consent varies in the States and has been different over the last couple decades and I think 22 years ago what he did I don't think was illegal was it is it Mexico 14 in Mexico Mexico Mexico Mexico is probably really young is that where he did it I thought was 14 I would imagine that for it could be well if you that's a weird thing right like if it's illegal in the United States but it's legal somewhere else so if you go to Japan or wherever the fuck it's legal and you get married and then you come back to the states can you live as a husband and wife how the fuck does that work so it's 12
