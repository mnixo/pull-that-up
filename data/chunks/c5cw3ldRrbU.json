the Joe Rogan experience people this is how I picture Andre Rison went to work every day when he played for the Atlanta Falcons I don't even know that is just rolling well he's a Pro Bowl NFL wide receiver who spent just crazy some money like three blank cars and yeah like he blew through a lot of it he was on that broke special that they aired and he was just like somebody pulled up you know in like a Ferrari you're like yeah she's hot I gotta top that shit so then he would go like the day that day I got the Lambo with the brains blown out man like just to top each other guys just buy shit to show off you know to compete with each other on it they say that there's some ungodly number of people it's like 80% of all NFL players are broke and in bankruptcy within two years of retiring it's it's incredible I mean you know the older I get the more I understand the younger guys having no like zero sense for and also zero if like financial yeah I cute like they don't know no 21 to like here's three million dollars let's get this party started 22 yeah yeah it's crazy but it's crazier when they're like he played 10 12 16 years like Iverson and he's blown through like two hundred million dollars Iverson broke now yes yes and home does he know he's 37 something like that his body's not working right anymore oh he's out of the NBA yeah and he's he's trying to play but he's run through well into nine figures you know Wow I mean I you know and that's and that's you know you have to consider he made a lot of endorsements so nine figures nine figures dude yeah make seven figures yeah girls would be like wow he makes seven figures so tell me nine nine a blue two at all yeah shit raizy man whoopsies that's crazy but it's so much they interviewed one defensive like a guy on the on the special on the the broke thing and he was like I don't know why man but because like everybody had a carwash we all had a fuckin car wash man that shit that shit did not last like we all spent money on a car bought a car wash yeah man you ain't got your own car wash and Bart Scott had the bet he was like you buy shit that's unnecessary at all he's still playing and he's like I'm smarter with my money but he's like you know everybody's a stupid purchase I bought a coat I think it was made of wolf it was like thirty five thousand dollars you can wear a wolf cuz I think so man Christ that's admirable and you're loving it look at you you can't be happier it's not possible to be happier than you yeah I idol somewhere between that too pissed and somewhat pissed that's how you I don't know you bullshit you said that earlier it's like you saying that you're hard to work with you know I don't think I'm hard to work like down you know I'm not hard or that you're hard to change I bet you fight against someone trying to manipulate or direct you never have I remembered in when we were picking for a jury recently about a well a year ago um and they were picking for a murder trial over in the Pasadena courthouse and the fella says is there anybody here who isn't going to get themselves disqualifies there anybody here who's qualified to try this case and I was the only one who raised his hand really yeah so you know I'm willing to listen and the guy says okay sir he says I think I know who you are he says would you listen to everybody else's idea behind while you're deliberating on this trial I said if certainly he said but you would try to convince them they were wrong if you had another idea right and I said yes that's accurate and you dismissed me because charismatic you can do charismatic you'd manipulate it in your favor well Unilever who's on the bench certainly not my one my first time in the Pasadena courthouse you know when our first time was is Alex Van Halen and I had to sue the main field school of the Holy Child of Jesus Incorporated for 125 dollars this was in 1975 I think 1970 725 what was that about well it was in a contract we had played a dance and in the one-page contract it said there will be no smoking backstage there will be no marijuana consumed there will be no drinking etcetera cetera and one of the sisters of was nuns at the time claimed that she smelled pot smoke backstage and refused to pass our hundred and twenty five dollars for the band so hungry bitch was he/she right well no there was no pot smoke that she's made it up mmm she may have smelled Marlboros you know actually those were camel camel filters but Alex and I went and we bought clip-on ties so we could fool the judge if we tied our hair back and we went to small claims court and filed did you win um well what happened was sat in front of the judge we sat on one side down the other side two sisters two nuns came in and a family a father a mother and three of the daughters in school uniforms you know they played it up hard and the judge says why who filed here I said sir I didn't see no it was $125 and there was no smoke you know there was no smoking of anything illegal backstage whatever and um he had the one of the nuns stand up she said I refuse to pay him because I smelled marijuana smoke and the judge says what is your answer to that sir and I stood up and I said sister how do you know what marijuana smoke smells like $125 later they have the t-shirt yeah how would she know I've heard you say that you believe that consciousness is non-local right what do you mean by that well it discontinuity see you are already familiar with discontinuity now you want to know even the most most unfamiliar most intriguing you know they said this is like voodoo this is really like voodoo this we are now getting into real cracks up the most surprising thing in quantum physics that surprised even Einstein Einstein in his whole life could not believe this concept of nonlocality which he himself discovered with two other physicists later on how did they discover how to discover his theory you know understand what the Torah tition he never when I shouldn't say never he probably did experiments out in his young days when he was a graduate student I did talk but theorists don't do an experiment know what they do is this creative exploration of the mind by that day for they find new ideas new ideas and then then the predict stuff so Einstein's idea was and this is 1935 mind you I don't understand idea was that if quantum objects to quantum objects interact they become correlated and this is a new word that he used in the paper he and his collaborators Rosen and Podolski these people they really sound in with the theory that mathematics that if two objects once become correlated then even when they are not interacting even if they move away from each other even then they can communicate not in the usual way not interacting with signals and that's the usual you and I are interacting right now but we are interacting through a complexity of sound waves and electrical wires to these microphones that's all through signals but these objects communicate without signals so their communication used as a medium that can only be outside of space and time because in space and time I understand himself gave us a theory of relativity which says that nothing can interact without exchanging signals going through space and time but these objects quantum objects once correlated they have the capacity of signal less communication this is what is called non-local signals that local going through space taking and how do they how do they measure that these particles are communicating so the key is in that they measure the communication and they saw that there is no signal because the communication took place faster than the speed of light in all local signals going through space and time must travel either at the speed of light or less than the speed of light so if something can be shown to travel faster than the speed of light it has to be non-local and this is what physicists love discovered in the laboratory Alan hawse may in 1982 finally verified by Einstein was dead long time ago 1955 so he never knew that his theory will one day not only proved to be right but really revolutionized the whole world of physics by bringing in concepts of consciousness the girag an experience you
