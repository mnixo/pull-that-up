Network the timer's on all right we're rolling first of all before we get started I want to say thank you to Luis Jake Gomez for hooking this up shout out to the Legion of skanks without them we would be nothing yes what's up Joe Rogan's brother hey I'm alive you're a lot look man I've been following this whole everybody's been following you yeah but first of all tax should be its own you're very supportive Joe I mean that means a lot to me I'm happy to see you how healthy yeah you look good your face looks good yeah thin hey look at you look healthy you look like you're vibrant yeah now I I'm present I talked to Dennis he'll and Dave Attell came to visit me in rehab and he said you're president you don't want to leave every five seconds yeah which is what cocaine does to you right you know so now I feel good I feel good I mean it's I got nine months clean that's amazing yeah that's amazing two days ago what's the hump like what do they say you have to get over before you stay clean well first of all my drug history is insane it's it started when the first time I got high and I tell these young kids cuz you know I'm 52 now so I was in you know I was in rehab and jail and a halfway house the last eight months and with some of the craziest motherfuckers you've ever met in your life and they all have stories but once they know my story because I had some success in life basically as a full-blown junkie they're fascinated by it right and the first time I got high was 1979 okay Jimmy Jimmy Carter was president so when you tell it 23 year old kid that they're like blown away that I'm even alive and I am too I was I I hit a homerun in Little League I'll never forget this and I my buddy's older brother wish to call this kid's sick jack I don't know what happened to him but he he handed me a joint and I took a puff on a weed and from 11 years old I knew I loved it so much I just loved B I love the feeling of being out of control you talk to a normal person they go I hate being out of control I loved it I love like Wow and you have an excuse for it I was fucked up yeah that's the thing yeah excuse for being wild an excuse for just being a screw up too you know and my own man was a lunatic he was not a drug addict or an alcoholic but he was a criminal you know he was a low-level criminal he came in the streets of New York and got to like the 10th grade in high school and he was like my favorite human being of all time he was like my older brother but I saw him do a lot of bad shit you know I saw him fight all the time he was a boxer when he was young and just the real street smart guy and his life was chaos and I love the chaos I was addicted to risk that's why I'm a gambler too so when cocaine came into my life a few years later I was 16 the first time I did a line of blow and that was really fun because now you're up all the time and and that started basically a 35-year drug run that didn't end to like nine months ago I mean I don't know if it's ended you know that's the thing I don't put pressure on myself I'm like it's one that one day at a time stuff it sounds so cliche but I take it one minute at a time I can't guarantee people I'm never gonna get high again I just know I'm not gonna get high too next ten minutes and I don't want again there is your risk of saying that you don't know if you're ever gonna get high again I like you know what the direct opposite is true that's what they tell you in a program like Narcotics Anonymous and again I'm not some big program guy and I didn't turn to some God guy anything like that but I'm a little more spiritual I would say and you know it's all stuff you know you should tell me the last time I was on the show you know you're telling me to try to like you know exercise anything anything that gets you through today that's positive you know I in other words my by saying you'll never get high again and I used to do that all the time when you really bullshit in yourself and everybody else you put a lot of pressure on yourself you know I like to say even these young kids these poor kids man are looking at a lot of jail time prison time - living under a fucking bridge some of these kids and they got nothing that's why you know the careers of me and you and congratulations on your everything you've done Joe man you just could you're a solid guy a great talent but you know I the careers we have are such blessings I mean we're living out a dream you know and these kids have nothing and for a 23 year old kid to say in a in a group therapy session anywhere I'm never gonna get high again that's the one thing to say you're never gonna do anything again and even for me at 52 years old I love it you got to say I love I love being high I love the chaos I love the lifestyle you get addicted to the lifestyle too cuz you live like you don't live like everybody else you know and I had a means of making money legally and you know these kids had a Rob to get all the shit and and so that was enabling too we live in an enabling world but uh to say you're never gonna get high again is so much pressure to say I don't know and just work on the next day and for me it's like I take it minute by minute literally I did I got high like we're here on the Lower East Side of Manhattan right now I got high everywhere here back in the 80s I used to come here a my my buddies older brother and get mescaline hits ludes back in a day you know we in Washington Square Park blow so there's triggers all over the place so I just say if I can get this one more just get one more block without fucking out that turns into a day and in time you know so it's it's harder to say for yourself I I'll never get high again what was the long as he went before this nine-month stretch it feels like the last time I had nine months clean I was nine months old no I okay you know in the late nineties I came out of LA County Jail my well again the first time I got arrested for I got arrested for attempted bank robbery when I was 17 years old I wrote a back tell her a joke nope that said I have a gun and I went to jail and I got a probation I asked Estella for $50,000 and and she started to give me the money and she puts she hit the sound alarm I was with my girlfriend at the time I was 17 she was 18 so a SWAT team showed up to our house we just left and what do you have the money I I didn't take the money tonight if she started to give me the money but again this is my fucked up personality for her I I was like wow I'm gonna get 50 G's you know and she started to give it to me but then something said I can't do this I took the note I gave her and I crumpled it up I said I'm just kidding and I threw it in a garbage can I get in my girlfriend's car and she drives away she goes what happened I didn't tell her I go out now it's bullshit they had her name because she had an account she's an adult oh geez and a SWAT team shows up in her house so we both get arrested were handcuffed and I go to jail she III I say plea and her old man I think was connected it was like a mob guy and he sat me down and he goes when you rob a bank you know take my daughter he didn't ever probably robbing a bag he had a problem that I took his daughter you don't think women when you rob a bank you and I go I wasn't trying to rob a girls night because I know you you're a crazed you crack anyone but but again I I just loved the the action yeah that's why I love gambling so um I go out to LA I get me a TV now I'm making 10 grand a week and then I got a bad cocaine problem and I started gambling the first Tyson Holyfield fight I lost $25,000 I thought Tyson was gonna fucking kill him and Quincy Jones who produced MADtv got us ringside seats at the at the fight and I lose 25 grand on a fight another 8 grand at the tables I get blow I take it on a plane back to LA at one o'clock in the morning I take a swing at a cop and I go to LA County Jail for trying to assault the cop and he found that eight ball okay so I had an eight ball of coke on me I take a swing at a cop and that's my last day at man TV oh Jesus I will use this this is 1996 right after we did that sketch of mithya which is like 95 I think that was 96 it was 96 a second okay which is funny to watch because it's so fucking long ago it's about about a month after that we did we taped that sketch I got arrested Wow and so I go to LA County I come out LA County I'm on probation and I got to take urine test everything so I got clean so to answer your question I had almost a year clean at that point and then after that it was loss to the races again I so nine months is the second longest I've had clean since I'm 11 years old no what are you doing for thrills like do you have to replace the Joe Rogan back do you have to do something to replace well the feeling ambling or a void because you're not gambling right that's an excellent question no I can't I can't do anything right because it escalates right that's all right it escalates if I put a fight on a bet on a roulette table right now by tomorrow morning I'd be running guns to Cuba I'd have a human trafficking ring everything the badness just gets worse and worse because I can't have a beer you know right right and that's hard to that's hard to admit to yourself though you know I mean I can't have one beer and it took me a long time agree of that concept some people can so I've had moments where you could have one beer in your life like that you ever gone what I rather Tsaritsa have a couple beers and that's it yeah watching a game but the problem is I mix vices III tell us that when I was a longshoreman at the port in Newark okay for a couple of years I was the orange juice beer this happened twice I had a bookie I used to gamble with so drinking and coke and gambling does not mix well that's why to give you free drinks at a casino because you've you know messed up yeah so I'm from Monday Night Football the bookie took bets up till eight o'clock kickoff was nine o'clock so at 5:30 right after I got out of work I would call the book and I would say give me give me a thousand dollars on the Giants play the Cowboys give me a thousand on the Giants then I start drinking seven thirty comes around I forget I made the bet two separate times I bet on the other team at 7:30 I called the book and I said give me the Cowboys so all I could do is lose the big loose so this happened twice so the bookie bookies taped all your calls and they destroy the tape at the end for it cuz the cops get it but what they do is they have the calls on tape in case you have a like you have a dispute I got a bet that it goes on I got you on tape doing it so I said to the bookie why did you let me do that he goes cuz you gotta learn a life lesson I go thanks mr. bookie for giving me a life lesson you know I'm trying to win money and he goes I got a tape you at five-thirty making a bet so at 5:30 I'm like all articulate I go yeah give me the Giants laying seven over two Cowboys give me the under over 41 give me a dime which is a thousand dollars you just here's you at 7:30 give me the fucking Cowboys I want the Cowboys in the other Parlin and you'll hear him try to go you just bet the judge flogged you know I didn't I shake on the phone give him the gab boys I'm a Cowboys I met some girl who's a cowboy he took me in uh so he's a bookies try to give me life coaching - oh my god so so what happens is if I would go have the one beer on a Tuesday night in February - sports bar then I realized Virginia Tech is playing in a college basketball game I bet Virginia Tech then I have two beers then I got coked and it's over so your question is a great question what do I do what do you replacing it with that's that's where this business which is taking me back now I think 11 times my 11th comeback I have fans that I got that you know threw me a TV and the stern so of course that are so loyal stand up stand up this dis business yeah doing what we're doing right now toilet do another funny guy who I love bullshitting making money doing comedy I have a gig tonight in Poughkeepsie I'm going to Poughkeepsie you know and I'm gonna get on stage and talk to people for an hour and make a lot of money doing it he's doing bananas no I'm doing a place go laugh it up laugh it up in Poughkeepsie so yeah I did the bananas thing a bunch of noise but so so you know that that that's that's it that's what I'm grabbing onto right now cuz women I've lost three I say this all the time I lost three fiancees because of heroin heroin saved me a lot of money I dodge three torpedoes with that the heroin was way less expensive than a divorce so you know right now I cling to my work comedies the only thing that hasn't abandoned me yes you know in a lot of ways and you know there's businesses you know that keeps taking me back you know a lot of people are addicts they get really addicted like marathon running right have you ever thought of doing some fun okay it's like a crazy idea but you if you could think you could run a block let me can you run - yeah it's a you know you run a mile yeah actually no I'm gonna do a 5k well I do what I do a bit about this am i stand the back one the first time I tried to get off heroin just this um this trainer who I hired this kid he said manok I guarantee you a heroin high is not as good as a running high and I said to him have you ever tried heroin he goes no I go well then you're not qualified to be in this fucking confident cuz I've done heroin and on occasion I've run and it's not even close so anyway you get a running huh you got to be in really good shape and it's got a run more than 20 feet yeah why yeah I mean I mean do you run is that what you yeah yeah I mean I would love to get that kind of thing in my life again I'm at way healthier than I ever was in a long time where are you living I live in Hoboken New Jersey yeah there's gotta be a place near there yeah there's nothing that's the thing about nowadays young comics like you forget about the drug culture if a 25 year old comedian has some gluten he starts to freak out let they go - so they go to Alcoholics Anonymous they have gluten - take so there's nothing but healthy shit going on mmm in Hoboken it's not to put young people jogging Pilates yoga you know something to get addicted to you can get addicted I'm for sure it did - the exercise all right I know that I don't have about you for a long time but it can help you yeah yeah well that that getting something like that my life would be the ultimate turnaround yes yeah because I love sports I'm good athlete I was an all-state baseball player and I I could shoot hoops I was playing a lot of basketball in jail yeah I was running full courts well I got an outside shot like crazy and but I'm the kind of guy I have here my coordination I could gain weight playing basketball I don't even move I just shoot the ball right the running thing is something I you know I got a releasing endorphins yes what you just said see that's a very insightful question because the whole the whole thing is substituting die yeah with something out finding something else you're obsessed with yeah my life I've always been obsessed with things but luckily none of them have been bad right you know it's been but it's the same personality the same personality that could have led me to be a junkie let me just get obsessed with martial arts or comedy or I wish I got addicted to martial arts and heroin yeah I mean I struggle with video games yeah cool like I need anything that's like that I could get better at well that's what you know it's funny I everything in my life went back to drugs you know I love shooting pool - yeah yeah we played when my studio yeah I I found though when I did cocaine I was better pool because I focus yeah you've got a lot of guys take amphetamines yeah and you have this hand-eye coordination gets better so you're playing 9-ball or something actually what I have a movie script I'm trying right called booger sugar 9 boy where a guy gets way better he becomes the best and I hope they're okay so has to keep getting the money playing pool there's all the best guys from back in the day they were all taking amphetamines like buddy hall and all these like yeah yeah they were all they were all drug addicts they're likely in days and days at a time yeah well if it the movie - hustler with that we're guessing they play for it that was booze that was just booze but these guys really did do that yeah these guys played for they got on pills and they played for days the key is what you said obsession yes obsession I get obsessed over a woman I'm dating yes I get obsessed never you know if anything I like yeah I don't want to stop yeah I want to keep rewarding myself the situation you know you're you're you're a very successful guy so is someone gonna be able to tell you I was making all this money and I'm taking care of people around me supporting people around me and so who's gonna tell me to stop right you know that is always a problem that's a problem with people it's a real problem yeah like I make millions of dollars a year yeah fuck you something's going right yeah I'm not gonna stop right then what happened is I got I got legal consequences like I've never had before so your situation now like you can't if you test positive at all for anything you're fucked I could go to jail like even if like I smoked a joint in this room with you if it came up I mean that's that that's you know everybody again I'm on this thing called drug court which is like probation on steroids it's kind of new it's only 20 years old the premise of it is there's not a lot of guys with my charges right now I have a third degree possession charge right now and um because the the the charge in LA is so long ago that was expunged off my record so technically I got a first-time offense third degree not a lot of guys with that little of a charge get drug court drug court is for people who can't stop robbing people because there's in other words they were putting everybody in jail for robbing stuff and they linked that behavior back to drug use they were stealing that support the drug habit so to get all these robberies on their jacket and and they go okay to try to help you instead of giving you prison wouldn't give you this thing called drug court but you got a report like like I gave five urines this week you know so if I if I got high first of all my situation cuz I'm well known the second III give clean urine clean your and clean urine and then 1:30 it's all over you know yeah the news now are they why do they give you such a harsh sentence if it's just possession I I don't really know are they trying to make an exact I think that's part of it yeah because you know every time when I got the first charge was just regular probation and I got no new charges or anything it was all these technical violations because I kept piss and dirty and eventually after I feel that they gave me drug court but you know again I got no problem with the people and illegals but what is what is your feeling I'm like what works how do you get someone it for you is it being scared is it that's pouring you got you got a want to do it right did and you want to do it right now but wasn't because they threatened you with so much Lee I mean it is their it what I'm trying to get at is is there like a method to this that makes any sense which I'm supposed to be but the father okay the premise I think that the best thing about jail for a drug addict is it actually locks you away from the drugs for a little while because you see now cocaine made my life chaos for a long time but when heroin came into the game forget it lights out heroin is if I saw some kid thinking about trying heroin for the first time I would tackle them I would do anything to get them to stop because the only way to stop this this opioid crisis is prevention you know doctors became pushers with oxys it's nothing like that you know drug companies it's a lot of money you know yeah I'm a legal and illegal side of it so once once heroin gets in your system you need it every eight hours you need it every eight hours like it's oxygen so you become desperate withdrawals are insane so is it insane like what does it work it's insanity well okay when I became a you know again my story on a Howard Stern Show the big headline at the end of why I left that show was and I I speak sometimes in NA meetings and I try to get this through young people's heads I was basically a full-blown junkie I'm the biggest radio show of all time yeah I mean that's that's the headline that's that's what you know saw nodding off on the air but I also had a full time stand-up comedy schedule so my life became the kind of chaos that not many human beings have ever seen so I would I would have gigs and Pittsburgh Phoenix in Detroit three weeks in a row then I got to get back at 6 a.m. to be honest I'm now I was by the end I was so paranoid to bring drugs on a plane but I needed the heroin to get on stage because the Signet picture the flu times 10 that's what that's what withdrawals are and there's there's aches all the emotional pain your mask and comes back so it's withdrawals are a living hell so when you see the withdrawals coming you see the heroin getting out of your system you're like okay it's to get really bad then you realize most people can't leave the room then you realize you got to do five radio shows a week and then you got to fly to Detroit and do stand-up on a Saturday night so when I landed in Detroit I wouldn't have heroin so my life became a dance of like I would land in every city and I would say I would I would get in a cab and I'd say the cab driver I need kid can't ID heroin I got a score otherwise I can't do the show sometimes a guy would recognize me and and want tickets to the show I would go to the worst part of Detroit okay or the worst part of anywhere anywhere any city and try to fight the heroin because in an hour I got to be onstage and in 20 minutes I'm gonna be deathly sick when I say sick like shit in my pants throwing up so this is you're getting there no connections no connections not school yeah I used to call them I used to call them dope sick sets because with drawers they call it dope sickness and I one time I was on stage in Orlando Florida I do an hour half an hour into my set I realize I'm gonna shit my pants in front of 2,000 people so I said okay in my head and I get on with your act sometimes you got jokes you could do like a robot so I'm just I'm just going through the motions and you say this it'll get a laugh you say just look at a laugh when I realize I'm gonna shit my pants okay in front of 2,000 people so I said there's two choices I can either say guys I gotta go to the bathroom listen to some music and go shit or shit my pants in front of 3,000 did you shit your pants no I I said play a song did you tell them are you gonna shit your pants I came back and I said I was gonna shit my pants okay did you start fans like oh it would have been funnier if you shit your pants so I got stern feds who knows about to shoot my pants the last half-hour of the show is like them yelling shit your pants yeah Darryl particularly ruthless I remember I saw you at the Lex the Luxor in Vegas yeah when the first times ever saw you in front of a stern fan right like the stern fan group and right they're ruthless it's crazy yeah it's crazy they did and then they say that they love you but then there's Bremen shit out and you know in Vegas is another again so that became my life the chaos was insane what do you think was encouraged to like the people in currently did they enjoy the fact that you were off the rails some people do yeah some people didn't be cut because of that do you think that like you identified with that like this is who I am this is what I do that's a great question absolutely part of me said maybe this is my thing yeah you know and that's that you bullshitting yourself because that's also you saying it's a reason to continue yes you know I could keep fucking up because this is how I make money yes and this is my lot of money a lot of money yeah I mean I okay the the most money ever did make him stand up stand that most money I made it was actually at Mandalay Bay Superbowl Eve 2007 this is an example of my life and one night I made a hundred and forty grand to one stand okay I got 70 grand for two shows I did two shows I'm on the plane flying back from Vegas I'm doing the math between the gambler the drugs and the hookers I lost one hundred and forty five thousand okay when I got home my accounts what I was gonna give a check for a hundred forty grands I said I need five g's oh Jesus I made $140,000 and a night one night my father climbed rules for a living okay he he never made that in 30 years and and then I'm going back to co-host the biggest radio show ever and I lost a hundred but I had a ten thousand dollar hooker who looked like a young Carmen Electra and and a guy I lost money playing craps I lost on the game and and the drugs I bought Jesus I was not a hundred forty-five down so after I paid out my commission to the three ages the weekend cost me like 40 grand have you put this in a book yeah I don't know if that story's in a book I'm right I wrote another book in jail so I wrote a fourth book good it's called ripping and running and I'm trying to I'm trying to get a deal right fuck wouldn't give you a deal for that Jesus Christ that's just one fucking story of I'm sure yeah of madness that's the thing about those stories they're so great like it's such a catch-22 right like the stories are so amazing and and people love you for those stories but they also want you to be cleaned well here's so so that's the catch-22 you know and then I'm saying to myself so again the answer your original question is a is the art if I were to be honest with you right now the reason the thing that got me the method I'm using now are consequences if I didn't have jail hanging on my head I don't know what what happened today but I think I'm far enough out of getting hot like I got it's the drugs are finally out of my fucking system there's other drugs they give you that are basically legal dope there's this thing called suboxone and losing an opiate blocker but it's dope you know the do do it it stops you from getting high on heroin but it stops the withdrawals too so you also get high you know it's an opioid yeah but it's legal and so if you're on what they call some box and maintenance you uh you can pee with that in your urine and you'll be alright if they know you're on it but you're getting huh through a doctor you're getting I it's like methadone right methadone we used to have these guys that would come to the pool hall we'd call them the methadone Ian's yeah they would go down the street they'd get their methadone it comes to the pool hall maybe just be zombies okay another story about methadone for a little while I took methadone at a methadone clinic while I was on Howard because I was desperately trying to get off heroin but look again the only diversity methadone and heroin is legality lately one so the courts are cool with one for some reason and the other one is illegal I mean if if you have no legal issues why not just keep doing heroin it makes no fucking sense probably like better for you heroin is the one drug that doesn't affect any organ like the way people die on heroin is you you overdose but like look at Keith Richards I mean he just got good shit he got pure shit yeah and he never od'd and died so like he's almost preserved it kind of doesn't affect your liver nothing like that so so there's no real health consequences other than over other than really other than odeon and the withdrawals because it becomes a part of your body is they thought like it's it's again I'm not recommending it it's a living hell it's a living out the lifestyle and the people that get into your life because of it but so a couple of times I went to a methadone clinic that opened at 6:00 a.m. because the guy was a fan of Stern he would let me come into the methadone clinic at 5:30 and get I took a shit they give it to you an orange juice okay take a shot of orange juice with the methadone twice I threw up on the air and one time the again I was never funnier off the shit than this howard was talking I think it was Roseanne Barr and Howard said hey you look thin she was on the phone and I'm nauseous listen to this timing I'm nauseous when the left I feel like I'm gonna throw up and I got a live mic you know right and and she goes oh yeah Howard I've been exercising and he goes what he been doing she goes well I get I get in a a two-piece bathing suit now as soon as she said that you know as soon as and Howard thought I was doing it to be funny go shot what do you do when I go yeah as soon as she said I get a two-piece but my comedic timing was better so so so now doing that for a while and but at that point I know legally what the fuck am I even trying this for right you know and suboxone look suboxone helped save me and helped me get off it but eventually you got to get off that too and you kick how hard is that is it hard to get off it okay there's something called fentanyl yeah okay which is elephant tranquilizer it's synthetic it's like spice like what synthetic weed okay all these kids in jail by the way the junkies they smoke this k2 shit date and they could they stop while they're talking to you like a kid will be talking to you in jail like that jail jumpsuit and it'll just be like he stops he looks like he got hit with volcanic ash or something because they spray these chemicals on the weed and it does something to them they start dancing like Julie Andrews all these Bloods and Cripps are dancing to the sound of music the hills are alive it's really it's weird so federal is like the heroin version that it's synthetic heroin yeah much stronger people are dying from touching it like they touch you to get you cops are dying or cops getting overdose these guys at the border that are sweating right it comes from China there's always conspiracy theories about China trying to kill us and who knows maybe it's weeding out a lot of junkies I was in a rehab which I got to give a shout out to this place turning point in Patterson is where I really got clean I was here for three months I did a month in jail and then I did three months a turning point a great place they really helped me out a lot my counsellor Sarah shout out there but she you know I got clean there but it was in Patterson in the hood and the gangs would fight each other to get the corner right across from the rehab because people would come out yeah people come out and get high to kids I was in there with you know went and got I they died that day Jesus they just leave and they died that day from fentanyl these are junkies if you get a certain amount of time clean your your willpower you know your resistance resistance goes down and so they would take what they used to take and it no one killed they were out that so to get off the suboxone is is very difficult because you got to kick it you got to kick it you know we trolls take average four to five days and I've done that in jail twice so if you have fentanyl in your system and you take us a boxing you go into what they call precip withdrawals which are like the regular withdrawals times a million like you feel you're gonna die you start to loosen eight this happened to me twice I went to I went to jail not knowing that the coke they put it in everything they put it in the cocaine they put it in the marijuana because they want people to catch a habit and if a couple people died cuz if you got a habit I got to keep going back so you're buying what you think is blow it's not it's it's blow with this fentanyl in it heroines Brown when you get it it's brown when you get it it fentanyl is white so if it's really a lighter color it's it's got fentanyl in it but people want to get high so bad they take the risk if you're a junkie I'll take that so I did not know I had fentanyl in my system it was in the cocaine I had so I get that I get to jail and I see this kid in the Bolton at the jail and he was a dealer I knew from the street and he owed me he owed me a favor and these kids smuggle drugs and in there in the band that I rub sweat pants they have it right here if you see a kid going like this all the time and kids walking over to him you know he's got something so I went over the kid and I said what do you got and he goes I just got subs suboxone I said give me one cuz I you know I couldn't deal with the anxiety and he gave it to me I didn't know I had Fenton all in my system I took us a boxing with it and in ten minutes I was writhing on the floor Rock just just just so they threw me in a Cell and I had a I had a kick um I had a kick with those kind of withdrawals in a jail cell how long is it last five days five days not a cos when I was kicked in an Essex County Jail the co0 I love them they're great guys are tough motherfuckers they got a tough job and they were very supportive of me and they protected me in there they were there were good guys but um so they were giving me food they were trying to keep me hydrated and shit there was a doctor that it was really cool but I I was naked because you're also on a suicide watch if people kick from heroin again all this emotional pain comes back on you and a lot of people commit suicide so they give you what they call this turtle shell that you're naked and you go in this turtle thing that's like a Velcro thing so I kicked for five days in that thing just just rolling around I started to hallucinate my old man's been dead for 30 years I could have swore he was talking to me right in front of me yeah it's just and then and then knowing that then I get it out of my system I get out of jail and I'm and I and I get high an hour later you know so you know if if you keep doing that there's something wrong so what happened this time to change I they kept me away for longer than I ever was III I was doing I was doing like two-week bid a week bid in jail this time I was in jail for almost two months and I kicked then I went to a long term rehab and I got locked away from it and I started to think clearer and think about the consequences and think about my mom and the fact that my mother is this great Italian woman who you know I thought she just needed money from me I took care my old man on his deathbed said take care of your mother and as an Italian guy from North Jersey you think that means money doesn't mean anything else so I kept giving her money not knowing she was worried about me died and you know all the time so she's I thought about her pain and I said I can't do this anymore so I just started to think clearer and then a one-day-at-a-time comes in so Wow that's the difference the difference was I was locked away from the dope longer than I ever was so not only did the physical withdrawals go away but the mental which was Charlie Parker to great jazz musician it was a heroin addict time he was 35 he said they can get it out of your body but they can never get it out of your brain Charlie Parker done at 35 Charlie park was 35 Jesus correct the coroner said he was 66 yeah but but he adds the most profound thing I have heard someone say about heroin he said they can get it out of your brain but they can get it out of your body but they can't get it out of your brain because you remember yeah I remember there it's a way to deal with shit and it's a maternal thing right it's like almost like being in the womb didn't I've never done it but why a knee surgery they gave me a morphine drip off yeah give me a button yeah I was in the hospital I could hit it any time I want I just hammered that thing yeah of course you just go just glide off to the most beautiful wonderful feeling well that's the thing about drugs they work [Laughter] yeah you know you don't want and again that's something else in our business like uh you know I don't want to wait for anything you want the money now right I want to come now get high now I want to gamble that that's the part of what makes you a great comic though that impulsive wildness is what people enjoy in romics yeah all my favorite comics Kennison Joey Diaz yeah all of them struggled yeah it's it's a drier look of Richard Pryor yeah Lenny Bruce Lenny Bruce Hicks all of them Mitch sure Robin Williams everybody everybody had drug problems yeah um I get your greg Giraldo I'll give you a great Greg Drago story all right okay so this to me sums up a comedian who's also a drug addict 2006 William Shatner roast Comedy Central I'm Geraldo was just hitting with the roast she was going to be a big deal but I had party with him a couple of times and you know we both had the same problem so so we were the only two guys coming from New York City to do the Shatner roast this was o-64 Comedy Central so I'm at the JFK first lounge first first-class lounge waiting for my plane and I know Greg is supposed to be on a plane he shows up five minutes before the plane takes off and he goes already man he like hugs me sweating he goes I'm tweaking like he was on taking amphetamines so I go he goes I'm not getting on a plane I go dude you're hot you're like the best guy at these roasts now you have to get on a plane does your career and he goes I can't get on a plane I go you have to get on a fucking plane so I had all this vicodin I smuggled under my under my sock I said take a couple of vicodin and have a beer so I got him a beer and he started to calm down a little bit I literally held his hand okay I held his hand got him on a plane I changed my seat to sit next to him he was too paranoid to go to the fucking bathroom so I regard the bathroom so no one could come in and I I we get to LA now we got to go to a dress rehearsal at CBS Radford Farrah Fawcett was on that roast so now he's still freaking out paranoid and he he want he goes I'm gonna hug Farrah Fawcett I go you can't go near Farrah Fawcett he goes how about a hug fire I have to kiss her I got arrested your career is gonna be over you're gonna be arrested for sexually assaulting Farrah Fawcett on M feta means so I go you just gotta calm the fuck down we get through the dress rehearsal and he goes please don't tell anybody and now I've been there so I know what he says so I go I want so we go back to the hotel I leave my room I sit by him like Florence fucking Nightingale I've given them like hot compresses and shit the morning the next morning the cars coming to get us to take us to the show at noon and he comes out of it he comes down the breath to me goes I I think I'm I came down he hugs me he's crying he goes thank you so much ago dude you would have done the same thing for me okay so now we go to the roast he's the first roaster up first thing he says he goes Artie Lange's here how about a hand for Artie line and everybody plus he looks at me goes look at you already you fat fucking drug addict I just I practically made out with him I stopped him from sexually assaulting one of the Charlie's Angels he won yeah he won powerful I've never said that very few people hardly ever have oh my god oh my god again this is something he is things you wish you had on tape about 1998 ish me Mitch Hedberg and greg Giraldo both did sets we all three of us did sets at the Comedy Cellar and there was an old diner on 9th and 23rd called Chelsea Square diner I don't know vasila anymore the three of us was me Greg and Mitch and if you if you ask why God spared me out of that three I have no idea it's just sheer luck but God spared me for some reason I don't know why and I remember talking the three of us were talking about about drugs and Hedberg he told this to a couple people and I didn't know Mitch's well I did a couple of gigs with him but you know he said you know a lot of people are trying to get me to stop I'm never gonna stop he said I'm just just don't waste your time I'm never gonna stop doing it I love it that much and you know at the time I didn't realize how dark that was and he died you know he's been dead almost 15 years now you talk about a real genius you know and like he just was like I I just I know I can never stop like that's how much it takes it takes over to the point where you know you know you might die because I don't care I want to do it this way you know so again probably remember when he almost died from gangrene yes he was shooting it's the same hole he was going through he might have been with a towel I don't know and Louis black they did a tour together and again that's one of the saddest stories yet the security at the airport smelled the gangrene oh that's how they found out yeah and they found shit I think he beat the case I think they found like powerful nail your stuff but you're talking about you know one of the best maybe the best joke writer ever and he just doesn't he just like I just why again when you live in this life like stand-ups most of us dreamed of doing this our whole lives and now you're doing it who's gonna tell you to stop anything I think with him to they were inseparable they'll stand up in the heroine together yeah like Miles Davis said they get with playing the trumpet you knows no meaning again you're talking about extreme personalities yeah John Belushi yeah and again like you say you have the same personality but it just manifested itself in different ways I was lucky when I was a kid I knew junkies my friend Jimmy's cousin was selling coke when I was in high school I watched him brought away I watched him shrivel up and and I remembered I I was also I was very paranoid right and I didn't I didn't want to ruin my life I was always worried about ruining my life yeah so I'd see things like that like all right stay the fuck away from drugs that's amazing amazingly mature attitude at that point because I was a direct option I said that's gonna be part of the success yeah for me harder so that reservation yeah yeah and look that's a smart way to think but I I tell I tell when I speak I tell these kids because they're like how did you make it man like how did you make it in show biz like they Google me and they see me you know on The Tonight Show yeah how did you do that like rehab they would like you know they're watching my movies on YouTube these kids are magicians with the fucking thing and I stand up and they go how did you do this like being a junkie and I'm like I don't know I can't even remember but that's part of the problem is that you're kind of rewarded for being so wild and yeah being wild you're it's an accentuated yes are the drugs yes and by the craziness I'm gambling and all of it well the way I say the way Ray Romano wrote new jokes about having kids and a family yeah you know a lot of comics you you comment on your life yes that's how you get new material so my life was not a wife and kids my life was just craziness with drugs and gambling and that's that's where I sort of I mind that for material and it's also the audience loved it they loved the fact that you're out there living that life like right Kowski or Hunter Thompson yeah anyone who's out there living that life there's like it's romantic yes yeah you you're not living like the average slub no like Ray Liotta says it in Goodfellas like you know we we were rock stars yeah you know all these guys want to wake up and go to a nine-to-five job we don't know that life you know and and I said dude I saw the other side when I was at this halfway house with all these crazy motherfuckers I had to get a job as part of the program so I pumped gas and I worked on the back of a garbage truck for a while throwing garbage and I pumped gas as a kid and you know you know the money we make for being onstage I've gone from that money I'm a I pump gas 40 hours one week I got a check for $280 you know so that's what that's life yeah that's real life that's real life yeah okay start with this kid in the halfway house I had five three roommates one was a carjacker the other one was an arsonist okay this other kid was it was a jerk this kid was my bunkmate he lived on the top bunk I was on the bottom he's like 22 year old he had some 40 had a form of Tourette's every 11 seconds my hand to God he made this sound hi hey all night let you sleep he watched porn on his on his phone so he loved a specific kind of porn we keep showing it to me's jerking off on the top bunk and I gotta go pump gas the next day I'm like my life is fucking over and he loved watching these really fat black jinx get fucked by small white guys so this is what you hear you hear this fuck me with that honky dick hi little white pussy hey is even in like he jails like Hills he's in the old days people just lit him on fire right and thrown him in a dumpster right but now it's a disease right so he's got a disease so but he the kid I go your honor for the fucking internet you can watch the hottest chicks on the planet he with jerk-off these days I go those chicks look like the 86 Celtics that looks like Bill Walton but Dennison this enormous like Oprah looking shake with a little like Richard Simmons looking guy and he goes hey did you ever ask him why he's into that sort of but no explanation made any sense I was in jail with I was in protective custody so if you're a protective custody I tell you you it means you're a murderer a snitch or some sort of celebrity so you're up there with hardcore motherfuckers so this this black kid it was next to me in the cell great kid I love them I love them but when me and him were both adding cell together for rec time I noticed the guards were real protective of me like now they would make him go in the shower and lock the shower while I walk past them he had some sort of ghetto Tourette's or something like because every okay he'd ask you a question about your life and then he would interrupt you by going word up like everything so I'm gonna ask you a question just start to answer okay okay what's your name Joe burn up are you from word up born in Jersey word up he'd get every 11 seconds he went word up were up I love the guy why was that okay because I'm locked in my cell 23 hours a day one of the guards told me he'd the guy chopped up three women ooh pull it up cut it up yeah whoo so that's the you're rubbing elbows with these guys Jesus III think it she chopped up three girls the most affable I like the kid I still basketball what I'm like the pace day was playing and yeah cuz you're in solitary confinement was he able to have conversation he was mentally ill obviously but but he kept he kept like I heard him on a phone the other thing about jail man they have tablets now to have the technology so I for one hour a day I was out of my cell and they you you could play basketball or whatever but you're in these cages so they give these young kids who are in jail for a long time tablets they could call anybody on the outside so they call their girlfriends which is always a bad thing like it starts out nice but you hear the bill like how you do a baby but who's that who's that in the background who the fuck is that and they start screaming at him and they get violent and I go don't call your girlfriend mm-hmm and when this kid would talk to anybody's life he kept saying wear it up every five seconds so when you're you're trapped with these guys and yourself for 23 hours my own solo protective custody job yawns so and what are you doing when you're in that cell well I won three I wrote again that helps being creative too I wrote you know and I I read a lot I had a great lawyer my lawyer at the end sent me a lot of reading material again this is where starring fans oh you talk about a crazy are there also the sweetest people on the planet they were starting fans all wrote me letters we're rooting for you I hope you get better they sent me books that they knew I liked and I you know you killed time 23 hours a day so yeah a pad and pen yeah see writing things out yeah you do right stand up did you write a lot of stand-up and I wrote I wrote this book I have a rough draft for a book which is all stories like I was just telling you you know I mean this book I've written three books and there are all crazy stories but this one if I do it the right way which it's hard to fuck off because it's just repeating these stories it's gonna be insane I'm sure but I want you you got to release an audio version of it like there's no way yeah it's gonna do you justice yeah printed form well I have to interpret how you're saying these things the first book I had out to fat to fish which debuted number one of the New York Times bestsellers that's another thing with drugs I was I read halfway through the audiobook and I couldn't do it anymore I was always in withdrawals in the booth so I quit I just quit in the middle of it so who read it I hired two guys with speech impediments oh Jesus on purpose [Laughter] one of the guys had trouble reading oh you gotta read a book oh my god is that available right now oh I just stopped here for three I get to chapter six and then I just do a thing I go guys I quit I put that in the audiobook Louis anymore oh my god I'm sweating I'm leaving you here like leave the booth next thing here is that I had a thing kind of happened with studio time took like four four extra months oh my god the publisher Random House brothers were going over to we if someone's gonna read the book they have to not a read you know David Goggin says the Navy SEALs yeah I've heard that he did a great thing with his book where he wrote a book but in the audiobook he had his business partner read it and then he would talk about it after Wow okay like almost like a podcast full right right that's interesting yeah because the thing about these stories like the way I'm hearing you say him this is how I want to hear it in the book yeah I don't want to hear you read your book right right I'm saying like absolutely like it's almost like you'd be better off instead of writing a book if someone just transcribed what you're saying yeah yeah well I don't allow these a lot of these stories I tell them stand-up - yeah but if somebody could just get out of the way yeah if you can get someone who can interview you who's not gonna get in the way yeah yes yeah like these conversations like just talk you just go with it and that's a good point well technology is changing that game here that's a putting out the idea of like a multimedia book yes you know yes well this is Magog instead he put his book out you could read the book right then the the audio version is the book plus so it's the book plus him explaining like these stories are actually fucking crazier than I'm even writing in the book there's more to each one of them well I know what's interesting about that the way I've written all three of my books with my buddy might the co-author anthony bozo who wrote is writing for M&A he's right now man Emma's book right now and he wrote slash his book right before me Tommy Lee and he was writing a book with me and Courtney Love at the same time the kid almost jumped off a building the kid to know is covered in rice so it's gonna require the to you to make a living oh my god he needs both of you oh my god me and Nick DiPaolo had our own radio show for a little I remember and we got this big contract and the first time we did stand-up at the Tower Theater of Philly Nick goes yeah my life scraped my entire future depends on Artie Lange well that was the attitude that he had on the show to watch the show because he used to be on television right right was the net was one of the networks that was on DirecTV those watched I was like these two are not getting along ha ha but I know both people and I could send Nick is such a grumpy old Italian now it's so funny but yeah very funny Greg joke writer absolutely yeah but tell you guys though yeah weird mix like that one guy is like this sort of grumpy guy likes to complain about things the other guys getting high all the time great sounds great well maybe need a third person to like fucking mediate yeah like a law enforcement somebody both respect yeah but yes so so the way we wrote the books was he I would record I would tell the stories like I'm telling him to you into a recorder right and then we transcribe them yeah and so it's almost like you the premise was the way Mark Twain wrote like like you write like people talk that's great but the original recordings need to be preserved that's to say it again and again yeah those things exist oh that's telling the story that's what you need to release that that's what everybody wants right I'll did see the the polished producted produced version of these things is never as good when I try to polish myself that never works it doesn't work with anybody yeah that's what people people love is like this this conversation we're having right now is just you talking right this is what people love I think no you have the story you can't wait to tell it Oh way don't let me tell you this then boom it comes out and it's live it's like hangin out shootin bulldog it's alive alive and when it hits their ears it's alive yeah if there's something missing when people are trying to over produce things it's say that again already but this time yeah that's why the HBO show I did I did for a few years crashing Apatow was really smart with that he just sort of let me tell talk yeah you know and it worked that's a good point the stories are the stories are like it's that this stuff's not even the tip of the iceberg it's just like um it's it's chaos that I can't believe I put myself through I mean God God did spare me I should be dead a million times overdue in a lot of different ways you know a lot of different ways just that was well you're in a very unique position now because you did get through all that because you did get through all that and now you're a nine month sobriety and you've got these great stories you're funnier than ever it's a it's a very weird position for you to be in because you can help a lot of people with the story I'd love to well again you know when you talk about the method thing with getting clean the 12-step program which a lot of people obviously if you're not in it you know it's a legendary iconic program aana mm-hmm but you don't really know what the 12-step is the premise is once you get to the 12-step you by you helping other people it helps you mmm in other words because that's what you're talking about that is a productive way to use your time yeah I'm gonna go help this guy like someone in nal say there's a guy died and his family needs us and you don't even know the guy you go and you try to help them so by the end of helping him for five hours you maybe save him but you're also saving you because you do so the premises I'll give you this was very poignant one of the speakers and a turning point this guy in rehab really explained it perfectly at the beginning Alcoholics Anonymous it's also a great story a great American story these two a stockbroker and as a doctor couldn't stop drinking and they realized just by talking to each other they could stop they helped each other so they devised these 12 steps so they will go around the hospitals this is in the mid 30s and they would say to the people the hospital is there anybody in the drunk ward like a hopeless alcoholic and they go yet and it goes to have any family here and they say like his wife is here she's you know desperate can we talk to her so they would go to the wife the guy's in a hospital bed in an alcoholic withdrawals just a delirium and they would say to her listen we found the cure for alcoholism we think we found a cure for alcoholism can we talk to your husband and she goes you know what I that sounds like total fantasy to me you could try we've tried everything I don't know how you're gonna cure him and they said no no you understand he's gonna cure us like by talking to him we're gonna get better like he's gonna cure us and hopefully along the way he gets it Wow you know so so that's that's like a simple premise but that's a stroke of genius in a way it's like you're using your time for something insanely productive and you know like you're a generous guy you like helping people you're a good friend you know it's you gotta you get a little bit of a rush you get a lot of out of help get a lot of I tell people I'm good selfish generous person well they think like the 12-step they say it's true altruism where you know true altruism is you know not the way these big corporations give back but you get nothing in return right but in a way that's bullshit because it helps you you get something back I just wanna help people I get a rush right helps me if you that that feeling you get if you give somebody you love a get us the gift you're trying to give them is look we're trying to get you better and by the time you you spend all this time working on them you've stayed clean you know it also does it radiates they'll do the same thing yeah they realize that somebody helped them that it helped you to help them yeah and they'll do it to someone else and they'll feel it as well and it also spreads the culture of being generous again you're right on the money that's very insightful because that's what a is it's a domino of the culture of being generous is very important culture being friendly you got a culture being supportive yeah the selfish people they die alone it's a fucking horrible to lose absolutely there's a lot of wealthy people I've met through this business who were just angry motherfuckers they're broken and and they don't have anyone to call and there's no one no one loves them knowing hugs and when they cease absolutely excited you need that well this business is a particular thing during the the TV era which i think is kind of gone I think now we're in the absolutely Internet era but the Internet era is a much more generous era because it actually helps everybody to have all these shows and no one's competing against each other in a sense because you know he wants to be like there was one hosts the Tonight Show everybody stabbed everybody to get that fucking job yeah and that was those late-night war the movie with stories about cars now with Lucy Oz with Joan Rivers a few times yes I mean that's how everybody works that way like I think back then it was a famine mentality because it was such a there's a few slots and there was hundreds of comics and everybody was just fuckin fighting in the trenches with not that was no look again see you though as a good person with character that's your attitude which is great you live that lifestyle like you knows what were you saying is important like this is the biggest podcast going if you were hosting the Tonight Show and look I've been on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon a million times I kill every time but to have me on the mainstream and I love Jimmy but to have me on a mainstream show talking like this there's consequences to that corporate wise yes they can't do it they would fight you to have me on yes so you're gonna you're in a situation where me and you were two guys who've known each other a long time who respect each other's work and his people and I'm a guy I mean let's face it I'm trying to get back on my feet and you you come to New York and you let me do this that's huge that's something I can do in America day early that's why I'm here I was supposed to I was supposed to land today at 4:00 in the afternoon is Val right touching blessed by golly man I'm happy you're doing great right now and if I can help put some wind in your sails and keep you move great direction I'm doing a lot a lot of people tell me like you got a lot it you got a lot of fans areia everybody I heard John Rogan I heard John Rogan Rogan was talking about you and it's always positive and that dude that that that helps me get out of bed some days it does and I'm saying your point is well-taken if you were hosting the Tonight Show you have all these people badly you can't have already on right now it's crazy man even though I need to but you were this position you can you could do whatever you want you do whatever you want and well we're here right now in Louis's studio right because I mean I guess in some way we're supposed to be competitors isn't like we're not know they would miss my urn that we're all friends the podcast community is one of the most open supportive communities and write comics now every comic is a fucking podcast and because of that it's like everybody's supporting everybody everybody's helping everybody a dance so does got a new HBO and everybody go watch it hey you know Ari Shaffir has got this thing coming out everybody go check it out everybody's helpful and everybody support so it also helps that everybody's a good guy yeah but it's this community it's a different feeling that ever existed during those Tonight Show Wars oh not even close not even close those guys hated each other they even Stern when Stern with anybody in any other mark I saw the Howard situation for for eight years that world and how it even says like you know Howard was this insane ball of talent and ambition and if you got in the way of that train man you were his competitor really go after you your family everything everything it's it's it's you know I saw that firsthand and you're talking about it's it's it's it's scary but you're right this is a different world you're positive about this situation but I think even the way Howard did it it's like I don't think you could do it that way time no way nobody would accept it no way no way it's a world it's there's a lot there's a lot of people who would check them on it yeah you know before it got crazy but you know you talk about every comic everyone has a podcast I used to go to it when I went to jail a couple of times I get my own cell I think oh why does he have his own cell well cuz you know he's not a big radio show and then why do you want your own cell now because I have a podcast the guard says well so do I have a podcast [Laughter] to everyone else you know I mean again everybody shoots video it is it's a very I mean look it also inspires a lot of talent was bores to do this yes you gotta have something you gotta you know but but it's open-ended if you have something to offer and and and someone is a good person and you want to help them you can do it with this platform yeah and the the entry it's not expensive like you could evening the iPhone and just some sort of a lipstick counter I'm starting another one yeah I know so beautiful it's called the hardy Lang's halfway house I love it it's great and the premises these stories with Mike Bocchetti and and and and a lot of the guys I met in these crazy times with these crazy stories they're the most unique stories on the planet well you were doing a podcast from your apartment for a while right for two years but I was you know I was running I was on drugs yeah okay I did a I did a podcast in my living room I was late eighteen times what are weakened comedians were beating me in my kitchen yeah IIIi was late eighteen times that's hilarious I wouldn't have you know people are waiting outside and I caught traffic by the bathroom I would say rats how out of control it was my friend Jay is one of the producers of the doctors and they were gonna fix your nose yeah but they're worried that if they did it they'd have to give you painkillers right well that's that's a big thing to like with the drug court thing if you get any type of surgery they gotta do paperwork also the guy from botched it wants to do it too I'm actually in a bidding war to fix my nose what happened to it um a bunch of things 30 years of drugs right okay you want to hear stories first of all a bookie I was dealing with a few years ago had a guy who used to work for him who got this idea to try to get money out of me and he he sucker punch me at my this kid was a 19 year old boxer and he can't I was going to my car one day and he thought I was like you saw me on TV he thought I was like a billionaire and I'm going to my car and I hear arty and the kid it's me with a right hand right actually I mean like you could never get off on a regular fight you know like like the way close and hit Trevor Berbick right here right here right um on and collapse and collapse the bone right here knock me out for 10 minutes at least 10 minutes and and and you know that situation got solved the way cuts off but you know I was I mean well I just had to deal with it in my own way I did I made up with the guy through you know intermediaries tree and everybody's fine and we moved on but the kid laid me out a kid I mean it's a 90 you know I just boom and so that's one thing 30 years of drug use but this is one of the crazier story so there was this stripper I used to go on the road with and she would meet me in City she's actually from Boston she was from she's from Southie and she was hopping it but when she's like talk to her sexy sound like Mark Wahlberg that accent so gross you're wicked hot fuck you know but she was beautiful and over the years like I would meet her at hotel she would call me on the road and she was a drug addict mr. snort drugs together so we're at a hotel in st. Louis is about he's got about five years ago now not less three four years ago and um we're snorting oxy coat so to snort the pills you got to crush him up so we're in this hotel room this nice hotel room I got a show that night at a big theater and I go I take a shower she takes out like like about about five pills and starts crushing them now was a nice hotel so we had room service the room service had a salt shaker that was glass so she couldn't crush one of the pills she takes she takes the salt shaker and starts hitting the pill with it and the salt shaker breaks glass breaks okay so then she takes a credit card and and you know makes it into a fine powder a fine dust not knowing there's all glass in in the powder she cuts out like four lines she gets called down to the desk to go to I bought her a gift so she goes down to get the gift I come out of the out of the bathroom I see the lines and I take a I take a pen that I cut down and I snort one of the lines and there's glass of it I snorted glass and actually coat holy shit so it sounded like a zipper I just I saw one picture of your nose where was enormous ly swollen that's after the kid punch me that was actually put that was after to get by Japan no he he tweeted it out he was trying to be a jerk-off he put he took a picture of me with my phone and tweeted it he was he had a bad plan but it that way to try to get money out of me and the bookie who yeah that that was after I got punched yeah so that got out all over the place yeah and again that's my life that's the chaos that was my life but I snorted a line on oxy coating that all glass fine cut up glass it sounded like a separate switch and then my nose just started to it just it just went nuts just bleeding and I went to the hospital I had to cancel the show and I wanted to strangle a girl and that's what he caved in that started the process if you watch the show crashing you I'm on that three seasons you could see my nose morphing into what it is now like from a regular nose to like what it is now and again part of me I I tell young kids apartment want to get a fix because every time I look in the mirror I go this is a life this is this is what happened to me yeah it's a reminder maybe to not fuck up again yeah and maybe it tells kids that though it's just such a dangerous thing to get it fixed and then to be in that kind of intense pain and then have the temptation to take a pill the premise is while you're in the hospital you get what you need because you can't get it's an operation so I think I put you out they put you out yeah but then afterwards look I had my deviated septum fixed right and they gave me a couple different painkillers that I didn't use I got out and I was I I didn't use them when I had knee surgery either let me ask you something see this fascinates me so as a guy who gets obsessed with stuff right yeah and you feel that euphoria fiend rip yeah the the obsession over that feeling is not as strong as you not wanting to fuck your life up not even close yeah I know I know it feels great but my brain is I uh okay out of here cover your cover your hand tuck your chin bob and weave get the fuck out of the corner right get out of there okay here's what here's what a drug addict is this way this is where they claim it's a disease I'm smart enough to realize that too but I'd do it anyway yeah I'm the direct opposite I never I never got into the drugs at a young age but still you feel that feeling yeah you know what I mean like like like you know if that that's something like like you know to me the sick person is why don't you want to feel like that'll you know yeah it's crazy like some people have a painkiller prescription all these pills in a bottle they don't finish it other than that premise - yeah I sold mine I took percocet so I think it was percocets when I had my first knee operation after the morphine drip I got out they gave me percocets I took it one day and it was it made me so stupid okay I've never sit on my couch my god I'm so dumb right now I can't think okay I got that I I the MA I took in one day I counted cuz I was obsessed when I took a hundred and twenty three percocet in one day twenty feet hard so I got pancreatitis Jesus Christ I was on the liver list and then my liver came back oh I guess she talked about around the transplant list and they they were about to put me on the list the doctor said to my family said to my mother's sister he's gonna need a liver this is life this is five years ago because I got out of control with the percocets which is why I went back to snorting I was try not to snore I was taking oral for your health yeah so once that once you snort the glass how do they get it out of your nose well I had to go to the emergency room what those do for like four days what do they do they cut it out they yeah they had it they had to go in they do a surgery they knock you out they gotta go up and they clean a lot and then I had surgery again a couple of years ago to do it so there's no like I should breathe good and everything now I don't know you know but again they would take a piece of rib right do they take your cartilage from in between your rib which will eventually grow back and right here with prop it up they do it the fighters yeah yes man and the guy at the doctor's I want to see him the guy yeah and he was like I don't know because he never saw he goes he never saw a worse nose Wow he looked in the nose because I never saw wears no that's incredible and graduations yeah I'm very goal-oriented but if they did fix it you know did the real issue would be what it feels like when you get out of the hospital right and you know how whether or not that would disrupt your progress enough the point we were absolutely back well again I'm making more more mature decisions now because I could have went right into this mm-hmm but and again the doctor had botched was was cool about it so he said you need more clean time at least a year yeah for you even try yeah well good for him for thinking that way sort of just I mean like a big episode for them and again if I can if I couldn't breathe it'd be one thing but I can breathe all right and like what you know I never looked like David Beckham anyway what do I care yeah that's gotta give you some material on stage as well I say stop to smell the roses in life and they had cocaine album it it's it's it's it's been an odyssey of craziness my life has just been an odyssey of craziness no we tried to do this in LA one of the reasons why I had to come to New York as they wouldn't your parole officer would not let you right now probe the probation Armond doesn't let you travel border you can't leave the state more than 24 hours so when you go to do a gig look you can come back that night I should do that anyway right I just I I don't love stay like the Kip see I'm in Poughkeepsie tonight and it's a two-hour you know and I'm coming right back yeah I like that want to show the other thing I used to get you know when I ever I tried to come back I get greedy and I would start the with two three shows a night for the money I'm doing I do one show mostly tonight so you don't get burnt out I do you know you drive it out you pace out your energy yeah this is the one show and I come back I think that I mean cuz the money is good enough what do I mean I mean that's they don't get crazy yeah yeah don't get crazy don't put your health at risk don't don't stress yourself out the good thing is is that you know that's sort of mature thinking you have about not one to fuck up your life I'm starting every day I get more and more to thinking that way mmm so it's improving still yeah even though you're nine months in it's a constant it's so that's like - like endurance like strengthening your endurance your resolve mentally more than anything yeah well that's it's almost all mental at this point it is yeah at this point it is you know you just gotta I mean something spared me and I'm 52 I I would love my legacy to be someone that help people but you know even though you already have whether you realize it or not and I guarantee you if you keep going you will I hope so you know no it's a hundred percent if you keep going with these stories with your your personality and your sense of humor this is a hundred percent gonna help people and not just a few and fucking millions of people you know Robert Downey jr. III when the paperback version my first book came out I wrote a paragraph about him to where you know again about the the ruthlessness of show business people say show business is very forgiving well if you're that talented of an actor like Robert Downey jr. they let you come back and through his assistant he contacted me and um was so was so nice like you know and I got at this point he was Iron Man you know and um he you know and I'm this comedian he's a big stern fan he had read the book and he appreciated that I thought I was complimenting to him in the book and again there's an example to 12-step stuff he really was like he goes I'm through he said basically to me I'm here for you if you need me I'm here for you Joe Walsh me Eagles who I met through the star know same thing hmm that's amazing you know it look like like these guys are like because it it helps them it helps everybody so so Robert Downey helped me in a way just by knowing that he got better could you talk about chaos his life was I remember talking about him honest aren't sure when he got sounds you know the stripper with the Wonder Woman outfit and Chris trooper dressed like Wonder Woman and Crystal Method of somebody else's house you know but I've always wondered like a guy like that that's so fucking talented he's talented in this weird explosive sort of creepy he's unique easy unique guy if you watch his movies even though he's in a shit movie he's great yeah like he always look at what he's doing he makes unique choices as an actor but I've always wondered if like the engine behind that is the same engine of addiction absolutely whole civ wild reckless sort of energy and now he just contains it in progress and success like his cousin working I mean I don't know him personally just just through that contact I just told you about but it seems like he's like way into the program of AAA right I know yeah I mean again it's also like the premise are going through a meeting an na meeting I try to go to five or six a week now and that's that even you know they want you to go to 1990 there's a lot of comedians in recovery you know I won't mention who they are but you know it's an anonymous thing but there's so many guys where 20 years ago there was a stigma attached to and there's not anymore I think people understand now it's not being weak people used to think it's weak it's like it's these are behavior patterns their thought patterns and you get stuck in a rut of them and you get there's a smooth carved path that your behavior just slides or it in and goes and it's hard to hit those fucking breaks and stop that path yeah and you use the behaviors to manipulate like if you have a talent like a sense of humor you know it's funny I one of my POS said to me you're gonna tell me you never use your sense of humor to obtain drugs I go I don't know a drug deal as you know but as payment like listen noodles I want that ounce of cocaine I have no cash but knock-knock it's not gonna work you use your sense of humor to get the money to buy what what the people at the task evaluators a drug court a lot of these rehabs do is they link exactly what you just said they link every behavior back to yeah the drug use yeah like what why why acting this way why being charming if you can charming can't be charming something just Rabia yeah you know well I was talking with this about this with a friend of mine recently about girls about like basically every comic really became funny because they were trying to figure out a way to get girls absolutely that's the first pussy a hundred percent I mean with men you try to explain it to women like like for me like like you're up to about 11 or 12 all you want to do is hit a home run a Little League and then one summer you see a set of tits or something and then it's all about pussy that's it you just want to try to get pussy yeah and and then that is talked about an addiction yeah and if you get involved like the girl I was telling you about if you get involved with a chick who's got a drug problem with opioids and this good-looking - you want to fuck you're talking about Adolf Hitler you tell you chicks are manipulative already but if you have a pussy at a drug problem mmm whatever it's your prize a because I don't know why bitch is always complaining I got half the money and all the pussy that Richard Pryor that's Socrates does it is that something like that that the litter should be on his fucking grave they got half the money and all the puss oh I'll give you another story okay you ready this is being a drug addict I was with this other girl at Martha's Vineyard this is like 20 years ago and I went to visit John Belushi's grave on a big Belushi family I had an eight ball of coke on me and everybody at Belushi's grave I was in Paris once where I got arrested for drunkenness but anyway I said they do this at Jim Morrison's grave people leave bottles of booze like heroin needles sometimes loaded on Jim Morrison's grave so people have beers and everything I'm Belushi's grave so I took the eight ball of coke out and I took half of it and I left a couple of rocks on top of Belushi's headstone at like 3:00 in the afternoon and I said that's on me John four o'clock in the morning I went back and got it it was still there at four o'clock in the morning meeting the girl ran out of coke and I said is it raining she goes why I go come on I went back and got the cocaine Oh jester was already in place you imagine though that the retarded there were the level of retardedness that is your life at that point I'm with a girl at for the more than I know is it raining because I left the coke I was then and we're hoping he can get you oh my god another another guy a young kid the other great thing about a a meetings is you will someone could say the most profound thing from any walk of life like some some professor was a genius and MIT could be in a meeting with a cook at a at a diner and the cook says something because he's got a different perspective on it this kid said once who's a janitor the best part about cocaine is going to get it and that is told that's the smartest fucking thing I it sounds so simple but when you hear someone has it you go the I always said I'm surprised a lawyer a prosecutor hasn't tried to convict somebody on this yet they cause DUI driving under the influence you're totally under the influence of drugs driving to get them I don't care if they're in your body yet you're under the influence of drugs you want to get high you're speeding you get to the dealer so if you kill a kid on the way to get coke they're gonna test you it's not in your body but you were totally on the influence of cocaine you know I mean I mean that's like I'm righteous I've opened up a whole new can of worms I don't want I don't want my brothers together but I'm saying like am i under there it's not in me but it's not influenced by completely yeah and it is it's like it's like a kid on Christmas morning if you're a drug addict you anticipate that see I equated it with fun the gambling you know yeah cuz what's gambling it's just instant fun you're bored to death no you're still watching sports yeah I don't like it as much of course not I used to bet again I like pure gambling people who people who bet on stuff and handicap it that's like a job who wants a job I don't want a job I don't do research fucking game I just wanna yeah yeah that's not action cuz it you kind of know what might happen right I used to I used to go to the Mirage sportsbook in Vegas they have a line on everything you could bet on two kids playing wiffle ball in Minnesota at the Mirage they have a line on everything it's just it's just it's heaven for gamblers so I would bet on sports I knew nothing about and then do cocaine and like 4 o'clock in the morning I'm going around people at the bar going hey did you see the high school lacrosse scores I got rabbit poo versus Dom Bosco Prep I would bet on the cross look cuz I knew nothing about it Wow I would put each Super Bowl from 2004 to 11 I had 10 grand on the coin to us mmm 10 grand that occurred to us and seven at a times I probably I five times I probably lost so before to kick-off I was down ten grand now how far behind are you if you all lifetime if you want to look at lifetime gambling how far just gambling yeah yeah because everybody's behind like I don't know anyway two million why probably three point to play though is what I've lost gambling holy shit if I had to be I do that math in my head a couple of you know ya die I'd say I'm not about oversee my cific 3.2 is very specific yeah cuz I know I updated in my hands cuz I'm obsessed about that don't you talk about you know to lose that much money got a bit of a jets a lot I had an uncle I had an uncle ice to do this joke oh man my uncle was a degenerate gambler and he said you know art when I was a kid I was in other jets and then I got into girls and then I got back into the Jets cuz I realized there's times when a girl won't fuck you but the Jets will always fuck you can't figure it out I don't want out like the coin toss is pure gambling right heads are fucking pay yeah ten thousand the one that's about to happen I can't describe it what's the rush when it gets heads and it's like pussy it's almost like something it's it's close to it yeah and then so now how do I keep that fucking going and when you were on Stern to it came up so it was almost kind of encouraged because well again Howard gets a bad rap sometimes I mean encouraged by him again again Howard tried to help me a lot and he was it was good to me I just he didn't like again when you're in a junkies life eventually you don't know what to do you don't know what to do if you don't live that life like Howard and I a lot of our rapport on the air work because he was the most disciplined human being ever and I was the most undisciplined he was like The Odd Couple so he from the first time I went in there with Norm Macdonald I had the story about getting arrested a man thievery he just goes I said I love out of control guys or fun yeah so when I got on the show it's four and a half hours of filling every day where part of my life so I would talk about going to Vegas and gambling and you know but I I'm on the you know I'm on the air you're the cameras always on you on that show so I'm on the air committing felonies like like I got I'm cooking a bookies dealers office I there was a guard there after Heath Ledger died as a joke I said I had the same dealer as Heath Ledger as a joke and it was a joke the DEA shows up at Stern with the with the windbreakers on says he is gotta talk to already pulled me out throwing a commercial I'm like I'm at work bro and they said and I was joking around I told him I was I was joking around and one of the guards and how he gave me to look Craig sure Allah gave me in my head sometimes when I think of Greg you know you have all these moments really like that one moment are you fat fucking drug addict you can't kiss Farrah Fawcett tells another guy that the crazy thing is you see Greg on stage with the microphone you never think he's out of control now he was so smart the writing was so good a person seemed so educated how smooth is it okay that the last movie Chris Farley ever did was dirty work and after it right after the dirty work right before he passed away he hosted Saturday life so Norma still doing Weekend Update so norm caught me up and said listen Farley's out of control with coke come to the party after the show cuz I got you gotta help me watch him but that's how bad he was a high you know you had to help one eye so this is this is how fast norm is now this is a testament to norms Wiz so I'm at the party and norms talking to somebody and I'm watching Chris I'm on coke I'm coked up so so so I see Farley disappear into a bathroom with Andy oh okay him and Andy going to a bathroom yeah they come out five minutes later like giggling no I'm coming over to me and goes what's going on with Chris I go bad news bro he goes where I go he went to a bathroom with Andy Dick I said there's only two reasons a man goes into a bathroom with Andy Dick and neither one of them's good and door looked at me without mr. bean said holy fuck I hope he's high holy fuck I hope he's high oh good news uh Chris Farley showed up on a set of News Radio one day to visit Andy yeah and he sure he did he had the complexion of wet cardboard I've never seen a man look moron hell to do it I went to a strip club with him at Toronto he shot the review at the rod three had chicks hanging I mean he was just like oh yeah it was fun took a picture of him foam coming out of his mouth laying on the ground yeah that's the people you're around exactly exactly yeah it's like yeah uh one quick Mitch Hedberg story so I opened up for Mitch at burg like 22 years ago and he comes up to me at the show and he goes hey Ida man you're a fat guy I go that's what he said I go like I could lose a couple but whatever what he talkin about he goes I wrote a joke that um I can't do because I'm not fat but I give it to you guys because you know when you're a kid and they tell you to wait a half an hour after you eat before you go swimming and I'm like yeah he goes you should say you've never been swimming because never been more than a half an hour since you last ate and I know that's a great joke can I I could have that joke he goes yeah so then he comes back and he was smoking a lot of weed so he comes back totally serious because hey man you're right that is a good joke I'll make your deal if I gain like a hundred pounds before you do that on TV I get the joke okay so cut to like a month later I'm wit nor McDonald's having dinner with people and norm does that joke about me he goes hey man it's Artie's never been swimming it's never more than a half an hour's is he last day I'm like where the fuck did you hear that joke he goes he goes I heard a fact I do it at the comedy I go really so I see Mitchell two weeks later I go Mitch what the fuck bro you gave me that joke norm said he saw a fat guy do it at the college store so he's all fucked up when he goes Hayati man you know listen I'm sorry you know I I get fucked up a lot I forget shit I probably gave that to a lot of fat guys he was the weirdest joke rider ever because it was all silly non sequiturs yeah everything was a non sequitur no bits transferred into other bills joke joke joke joke - it's great to watch Mitch like IIIi get such a kick out of watch it around do was set where he starts off bombing like it like it I'll tell a joke and the audience doesn't get it yeah and it'll go like okay you guys don't like me it I'll keep trying and then he gets him and then the first big laugh he gets he's like a little kid he goes yeah he was my favorite to listen to I listen his album on the way to the airport oh as LAX traffic's so horrible and each it was so silly yeah it's silly silly yeah and smart at the sound smart and silly one of my favorite jokes ever is uh somebody said do you want a frozen banana I said no but I want a regular banana latest so yes well he did a joke once he did this joke on TV somewhere and you could almost tell he pause before he did it cuz he's getting a lot of trouble he goes my FedEx dealer is my FedEx man is a drug dealer and he doesn't know it all right like I used to do drugs I still do drugs but I used to - well the crazy thing about him is he would do you know an hour ten minutes of that like how the fuck do you remember what you said and don't say well you're on heroin well well that's the thing I forget shit all the time like I said like I bet on the other team yes with the bookie I bet on the other team but he was high when he was doing shows and and and at the end the last time I saw Mitch was two weeks before he died at Stern and then I went to go see him at Caroline's and it was like you're watching this is genius shell a shell literally a shell like like he was he was you know taking drugs for people in the audience pills I took a birth control pill watching I thought it was a vicodin someone gave me I don't have the baby it worked but he was like but scratching at the walls and shit I'll give you I'll give you one more quick
