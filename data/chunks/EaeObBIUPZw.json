boom boom boom boom boom boom $15.00 o32 boom and we're live ladies and gentlemen live Mauro Ranallo and Big John McCarthy Eddie Bravo rockin the old school elio gracie shirt i love respect deep respect brendan motherfuckin shop oh and i got a sugar Sean O'Malley shirt I might strip down later and put his motherfucker is that the best shirt Reeboks ever maybe might be one of the dopest sure it's pretty great that's pretty great Reebok Reebok seeing better man I'll give it to him I thought earlier today you know me I was super could have gone them for a while they're getting way better man yeah way better this is good that they when they posted that I got my boy who works at Reebok I sent a screenshot went goddamn you guys hit this one other Park they're embracing it they're embracing the fact that he's a STONER like heavy-duty yeah it's just a fun shirt oh yeah kotas Instagram dudes getting high all day don't you see one less fight well it just takes time off you don't have to take much time off and in three weeks or something no two weeks two days two days days yeah really yeah a new you solder rules you just can't be high when you fight depending where you fight though right cuz there's some issues coming up I figure which state they different probably X expressions of haters so Dylan Danis this is not his MMA debut yet is o against Kyle Walker and Eddie tell us about Dylan's Jiu Jitsu he's pretty high level yeah he's one of the best around for sure he had an amazing match with Gordon Ryan at 2017 Abu Dhabi I mean the fight was really close it could have went either way and they gave it the judges decisions gave it to Gordon and Gordon winner went on to win his division so he's he's top of the food chain and you know he was with marcelo garcia you guys black belt for marsala garcia yeah marcelo kicked him out for shit-talking right it's not a deal for you know he start hanging out Conor McGregor and marcelo garcia is the opposite right that kind of super humble incredibly um yeah yeah you would think though that Marcelo and him would work it out though but not have a guy black belt in the guys a high level black belt like obviously just too much drama but one in real life he's a super great guy he's just trying to make some money he uh he's smart least he talked shit to John Jones and here we go oh that's stupid I know all these guys talking shit that John Jones are eventually gonna have to meet him and they will be pussy but then I saw Dylan when the Conner and Floyd fight meet him sat next to each other he's the nicest guy in the world man look at his fans he's very Conor McGregor ask with that same coaches right coach the same camp oh dude he's got real problems with the strike ain't that dude just stepped in and cleaned him with that left yep you got some problems his stand-up is super rudimentary older house takedowns are did they better be good well it's kind of he's got like the mackenzie Dern right of Bellator well he's obviously closing the distance to which is a problem because it's obvious you're coming in the guy could just wait on you several times he's been clipped by that left hand hold if this guy can keep this fight Stan okay yeah his kicks her stiff yeah but his jiu-jitsu is this shit if he gets his fight to be kind of like an alley cat version of Conor like super alley cat my my real rough he pulls back with his chin straight up in the air to need to get a clinch yeah for sure for sure I like it doesn't happen enough fatty no it doesn't happen if you lie down if you can't take the guy down and you have your dangerous off your back pulling guard is great right yes hook and he's about to get him an arm bar right here oh yeah oh it's good this guy's in trouble if this guy he's gonna sweep this guy knows too good she wants her legs got that he's got him it's in deep it's over there he goes and that's a wrap I think he's okay he pulled guard and she got a heel hook pretty sweet aful yeah opponent I don't have a problem giving them a warm-up fight like the source first one first MMA fight your Bellator you still could be worse to be in Pico your first fight you know I'm saying there's so stings man I see a dude get his knee ripped apart like that like that dude's fucked look at him he's in pain you could get your shoulder ripped apart in a kimono the exact same way oh I know but it's it's weird right I mean I'm not saying there's no one to tap that's it yeah I think the promise guys aren't too familiar with what goes on with the leg like so by the time they're tapping it's too late yeah but what I'm saying is for whatever reason for me when I watch it I've cringed more with leg whoa I agree like if I see a guy get his arm broken it doesn't bother me like I see a guy get his knee ripped up is it cuz we're not used to seeing it I don't know man maybe it's cuz I know that tap you like you only have so much time to tap like your shits gonna explode maybe it's just I don't know I don't know but when a guy's really good at it you know if you fuck up an ankle he's out for a grip yeah yep yep old I had a bad angle as a toad that was a heel hook initially yeah I thought so too but they didn't really show it they couldn't see his back was to you right yeah yeah well you know what man I mean I like the fact that he's in there but man I feel like just watching him move with his stand-up I'd like to see him that's his first fight brother I know but I'd like to see him get some more stand-up training just it seems like I mean look if he gets guys to the ground they're good they're in a world of shit but you can see from a stand-up it's like rudimentary it's super amateur but it how's that any different than Michael venom page was zero digits or so much just zero Jiu Jitsu you know that starts on the fie Michael Voris he's a straight-up black belt as they get when he hit the ground in America because America venom pages tap people he's tap people with nothing doesn't share yeah I just I don't I don't think it's jujitsu as bad as you think so that I not Michael venom page you know Dylan Danis but no Paul de Leeuw that's yeah that's a good existence off yeah yeah if you're high level at one aspect yeah whether it's wrestling jujitsu or striking if you're super high level world class you can suck at the other two it doesn't matter I mean look at greedy look at Melvin man who he's so dangerous on his feet he doesn't really have any jiu-jitsu but it's okay it's true you can still want to see him fight look at Damien Meyer Jake Shields my thing is the one I see a guy like Dylan Danis who's so good on the ground I really want him to achieve a certain level of striking proficiency before he fight fights yeah yeah I just feel like gotta pay rent the wrestler but it's gonna put him in a world of shame Joe he's never been in that in that cage before right so maybe in training he's put it all together like you ready to go man gets in he's like damn maybe it's nerves never felt those nerves inside the cage he took those shots too took those shots on the chin wall you got hit with a couple good clean left hands and he adjusted I'm sure I'm about a million percent sure the plan wasn't to go out there and pull guard the fact that he realized oh shit this guy's tagging me and he was kind of hesitant to get in tight to get a takedown pulling guard showed that he can adapt mmm yeah I'm sure that was probably in the plan you know plan B Plan C but uh if he gets guys to the ground during a world most most fighters they don't have it in their plan to pull guard most don't not the ones that that I've talked to it's never part of the plan like let's this doesn't work or that doesn't work I'm gonna pull guard it's either I'm gonna try to take him down until the bitter end speaker pulling guard you know Camaro who's Mons fighting Demian Maia yes David might take a short notice how's that wait cut son that's not good was he supposed to be fighting upon Zenobia yes what have you got hurt a knee injury right ma'am that car take has taken a hit because then our our boy no time isn't fighting Shogun so that to move it because of his fight chosen well because of his things going on in Florida with the with the felony or whatever they seize waiting on hide so yes travel to Chile so that to do it though the fight still on forget to take it off Chile that cards taking the hit whose months a monster he's a monster but you know Demian Maia is a monster on the ground and Iceman's most of his game is the ground his ground and pound and most of his game it's gonna be very interesting to see that they're things because I'm a shitty fight he is Big John McCarthy is a big motherfucker to be interviewing people you're not I mean like I've seen him interview some fly weights yeah he's a big disliked Yanks they don't dance about I'm the fire on this mic cuz you know he takes up the counter a little music let's drop some pure fire what is he saying we got some volume Jamie it's not working hmm okay back to the drawing board Dylan remember the seminar one don't forget the seminar walk home Samurai you Vreeland to die in there heard that before yeah I never heard that before come find me brah give you some tips we need we need some work on that shit talk callers but right now bro might tighten it up mate find a dollar to find the dollar in the back yeah well you know he's all fucking that may have been corners line maybe he wrote it for him could be to die you wouldn't to die in there might you give him a free seminar well the old dance can be a beast to beat down yeah well especially if bellator gives him the right matchups why wouldn't you though it says for sure definitely freedom and he's a wrestler too he wrestled them I think you wrestled four or five years growing up so there's some good fights on this card okay - Lovato vs. Gerald Harris I liked that fight let's fight that's an interesting fight man Nelson versus Mirko Cro Cop they've been given him the testing son we've been giving him the testing apparently do you but do you believe they're testing when out here belt ours testing I always like when Frank that's like the Olympia really would you give him like a written test yeah what did you take today dude I didn't just dudes are fuckin eatin hay and snorting they're on so much equipoise dude that's like Canelo he came back you did that hair fassl sample but people are saying bullshit though why they I guess the way it was done like how do we know it's his hair it's coming from his camp exclusive low is it yeah yeah this is true they come on man yeah it says can't he tested positive for being a 55 year old trainer that's a bummer man that that fight is down because now he's fighting one of Edmonds boys he's fighting a triple G's fighting horse fault that's fucking fun wild and have fun with that he's got a dream I mean he's got an e naeun name one of them Armenian joy that brother characters enjoy that bed yeah well we gonna do LenDale in the house [Laughter] enjoy that fucking Armenians love to fight man yeah they're tough as they come phaidor 36 and 5 Frank near 1811 yeah I mean favor he looking thick thick yeah you don't look good they need to let him fight in Japan again get him on the right looking good I said Franco my shawnzy yeah you were Jack right now I was talking about fader I said I would as I jumped a half guard he's like what'd you do I was like I won't play it striking bout in the first round jump to half guard if I had your half guard no Guerra oh for sure nothing some of the best however a different game now yeah I'm super suspicious about all those old fights now though you know I'm super suspicious brother super suspicious then he comes here and just gets fucking ran su super to sorority wow those Nogueira fights that were that those weren't fake no no no that's not what I mean that's not what I mean I mean steroids I mean performance-enhancing drugs of cool I mean we're looking at a different human that's what I'm just saying Bellator don't really check we're joking around they do some check in they do have stayed out any better in Russia we know they well then within Japan Japan was encouraging 100% you know and who knows who was doing what and who wasn't doing what but when you talk to the guys who were over there like ensign anyway and he'll tell you they had in capital letters in the contract we will not test you for steroids and then you look at Wanderlei when he weighed 218 when he fought cro cop he was heavier than cro cop when for cro cop that is just fucking bananas yeah but but if you look at that joy you cannot say that about the UFC till you saw it it came in you definitely can you definitely can but you can up into the point I think it's a air less because they ten days right and the courage not trt days you write about trt days like trt Vitor we always ran time that was leaked all those boys yeah well guys who were on t RT including Frank Frank was on TR ten for a while they were telling fighters to go up away class like you know what I need to go up against mm-hmm well they were also telling fighters that we'll let you win you know we know guys that was k1 same shit that's Japan he was talking some dark web shit right now how do you tonight listen there's there was just a lot of shenanigans going on back in the day and a lot of it was also they were just trying to compete with the UFC and they were trying to do a big business and it was awesome was awesome it was awesome I mean there were superheroes one name for you Bob Sapp fucks come on son come on sapwood who's 375 pounds with abs I love that he's so jacked it was 370 with ABS 370 and like not bad cardio wasn't bad not bad oh he was on everything no bro every joint everything they made all the EP OS and the EPIA EPIA yes but he was on the Environmental Protection Agency was on EA the FBI the CIA he was so big he stood out so big in Japan you couldn't go anywhere well you remember when he was like a super-duper star over in Japan but then there was a situation with I believe it was k1 they they wanted him to sign a contract after he fought and he was like I wanted a contract before I fucking fight man like we got us I gotta see the contract and they'd like to know you fight and then contract he was like fuck you this is crazy so he walked out of the fight and he was done after that he was the main event so he was he doing good though yeah he's lucky didn't get Yakuza Cuza style look that's 57% jail Thanks how about jail has to fight the winner of this yeah that's crazy dude how good at jail look against rampage he look good his wrestling is always good he prepares he's smart I mean say what you want about Chael Sonnen you know that guy is always prepared Nieman Gracie oh this is interesting I don't know anything about Javier Torres don't know anything about Javier Torres hopefully shits is good Yeah right not as good as Gracie's mm-hmm interesting I mean no one could say anything look whatever everybody was on back then phaidor was still beating everybody's ass so if they were all in the same shit phaidor was still beating everybody but the caveat to that is when he came over to the US he got dealt with with our guys yes definitely he struggles as Brett Rogers right yeah a little bit with him gets dealt with with Dan Henderson Sanderson touching them beat the fuck out of them what Silva bigfoots him up yeah beat himself slaps key he Peter laughs key in affliction there was no testing in affliction that affliction thing was the wild wild west they were that mean I was their teacher does he own a huge event yeah wasn't lost air when he got hit he's whooping his ass to find me he was he was dealing with him in the stand-up and then he did something real stupid and he got clipped with a haymaker that was such a crazy not though such a cool fun I'll ask you front kicked him to the gut box in a mop he looked good Arlovski looked good but he did something really nutty and then all sudden boom the bomb so fader Tim Silva under laughs key Tim Sylvia fight was amazing good fight that was amazing great but he looked like phaidor than that for acts like that was and then the Strikeforce then you got a lead XE right and he got Brett Rogers Dan Henderson silva ver doom was it was Italy Dex II was in a was in early XE when he fought Brett Rogers or knows that Strikeforce I think his Strikeforce I think Elite XE was just Kimbo I don't think okay I don't think Fred Rogers was the lead XE Michael great I think you're going crazy because remember Strikeforce of Brett Rogers thought Overeem when all over him was he didn't just he hit him with a leg kick like 1520 seconds in the fight one of those thudding holland style leg kicks and you see bread Rogers face like oh shit that's not stuff like no but Overeem hit him with some technique yeah hit him it that real technique that that's why the argument for steep a being the best heavyweight of all time is legit argument cuz he's fought clean he's never been you know smart well he's not fended the most the UFC title which is the hardest title to defend in terms of like historically no-one's defended it more than him he defended three times nobody else out beat two the only issue with that if you want to argue against deep in I'm not I think he's the best all-time hammer cane but if you wanna argue that you can say well the guys these beat aren't in their prime that's a good point that's a good point I think that's true what there's a Scientology Network what curious I just started everything get the fuck out of here and there are they're advertising it on paramount hold yes despot paramount well they might be paid they got but that's time whose money son yeah you ever drive by Scientology building I drove out last night oh I got the test I want in in there I got the test I went to one of those things no you did I held the cans yeah I was filming a TV show for CBS and we were outside in San Diego and while we had some downtime they had this thing set up like stress test and you go and you hold all of these cans they ask you questions I think I once a Brian did stand-up in there so one asked me go up there induce I either did stand-up or like a TED talk some shit in Scientology building real well he was taken he was taking acting lessons with a guy who was a rabid Scientologist and then I went to see Brian's acting teacher sing songs from musicals not even a musical just the songs from the musical seconds for at least oh it was amazing it was great me and Brian were high as Jesus on the space shuttle I mean we were gone we were hugging each other why it was going on we couldn't believe how ridiculous it was either did like a motivational talk or stand up there though well he was you know there's a thing about acting classes a lot of my ex-girlfriend one of her acting classes when I first moved to LA and I started dating this chick was an actress her acting class was a Scientology based acting class and apparently it's really common there's a lot or at least it was at the time isn't that get kind of up with everything coming out with that Lea Raimi or whatever name is Leah Remini yeah it should be like the gigs up you know there's the internet you know podcast around was full of shit it is you know some people are just dying to get took they're just dying I'm so like so I was like girl Brendon you can be the next fucking expendable 7 you just gotta jump into the Scientology I'd probably check it out what happens with girls with girls apparently they come to them then they'll arrange like boyfriend situations and weddings what happens Tommy Cruise right allegedly Katie Holmes allegedly she said fuck that noise snow shoes Jimmy Fox Fox Lake down down I know shit fucking yeah yeah Tom Cruise is laying low right now he apparently did some crazy ass stunt for Mission Impossible where they had a film at like a hundred times did you see it no Jamie hit it you didn't see it he jumped I'm a bit from building to building he does all his own stunts he is a badass he guys he does all his own stunts if even when he's flying out the helicopters he doesn't let anyone else do it I just jump from building a building and he just barely misses it and from another building going down his heel and foot first like into the building and it's fucking anchors Jackie broke his shit and he's like cut he's still like finishes the take yeah mm-hmm he's 50 what three kill it though listen that Scientology shit is real it's got how do they have so much power in Hollywood how does that work just Tom Cruise Villani him and John Travolta got this cord that is crazy but you're Tom Cruise look at this dick juice oh snap this shit son damn oh I see Mission Impossible this just goes that shit like a baller that's Top Gun son god damn well you say big bugs that's a quite a jump too that's a quite a distance you know all this the scenes in the helicopter and all that were these hanging out yeah that's all him and he's white that rope wasn't there he would have lived right he made it he actually made it I think the Rope didn't help him you don't think no no no watch again play it again don't know if there's no rope I don't makes that there's a rope kind of hitting that know the ropes carrying him yeah oh so the Rope is assisting I'm never sure all right let me see yeah for sure it looked like the world was behind him yeah I thought the Rope was just to catch him cautionary does the rope like that's a weird thing the Rope is assisting him like man how do you even plan that that's kind of cool the Rope kind of catapult well maybe maybe it was behind the ropes behind him the rope is not help oh and there's one above this in above there's two yeah yeah you're right yeah yeah yeah I catch some stairs I'm fall the way down and I yeah well that's what it's for that's what my point I bet it looked like his Achilles tendon tore off yeah that looks like the ropes carrying them I bet he has drugs that we don't know about fix that a yeah they get that from Mars yeah that shit from they pull it out of the fake rocks that they pull out of Mars here's another one let me see the other one he hung on the side of the plane well that's fun and is he dashed with a rope - yeah a little bit but still though really good he still really gets taken off he's hang in there that's nuts that's fucking - that's bananas that's rope though right you know you - surprised you'd be surprised at how hard it is to hang for long periods of time you know when I hurt my shoulder and I started hanging you know just holding on to a bar and hang I was stunned at how little we kyo you know i do a lot of chin-ups but i can't hold on for more than like two minutes something you have to that condition there's no really condition that shit out yourself you think you're gonna like save your ass and like hang on the side of a plane fillet you're screwed no you're dead you can't do it oh damn lady push Kim get out of my face bitch you got that camera too close to me but choke so now son we had a fear factor episode once where people had hang from there was a bridge and there was a bar on the bridge was men and women and you hung as long as you could hold it till you dropped into the water and the girls beat the guys how long were they lighter do you not remember not very long not few minutes no no no I don't think anybody beat like two minutes and 20 seconds or some shit here we go Neiman Gracie ready to choke motherfucker I thought I saw him fight was on that Newark mess square garden card I think it's hanzo's nephew yes yeah he looks hyper aggressive he looks like a hens own nephew big kid man and so the other guy's hobby auteur Javier Torres is that his name does say Jane yeah did you see Roy McDonald ask him Ben Askren the sign of bellator yeah and Ben Askren wants to do it too i Ben Askren still owes fights with one Fc though so they would have to do some sort of he's under contract to them yeah he owes two fights he owes to fight hey one Fc I know you're listening do us all a solid do all the hardcore assault let him out and so you're never gonna let him out what they would do is they would Co promote and it's possible you know if you wants fighting you see it spar oh hell no promote one up see you would have to it would have to be favorable conditions with the UFC or like they just you know you can't really make some sort of a deal with one of something they would have to be something or they give them a piece of the revenue but it would have to be a very small the odds already against I'm gonna sign with you and you go all right now you gotta make this deal with what I've seen Davis my kick rocks well what he should do is he should get out of that contract that's and just smoke to news real fast just smash two dudes just give me two cans but not he's the King crusher over there rich Franklin's the guy who does the outdated comb Kinkos room at Hume is - Matt Hume is a part of one I know what's up yeah let's get this one of the greatest fights of all time roll in my man well who would you have them fight Woodley ah his friends would their training partners yeah I'd have them fight GSP first and then I'm fight could be do you think GSP would take that fight nobody knows who asked Rinna's poor fans he said he would could be Kobe nine months ago seventy yeah yeah come he wants fight at 7000 that is the fight I want to see could be no what is he no aspirin Tommy two aspirin khabib is what I want that's my number one fight because good luck taking GSP down just good luck and good luck standing with them to you know that the stand up there's a big gap between Ben Askren standing up at GSP so it's a big gap between been a strands grappling just happen sure yep it's true it's amazing fight what there's a big gap between what Ben Askren zoos grappling and GSP grappling really a big gap yes there's a big gap there's a big shit Olympian legitimate yeah GSP and Askren big gap yep if they wrestled a screen I don't know both okay seek out good Woodley is an ass Woodley yeah GSP has more takedowns in UFC history you're right but never on a guide at the level of aspirin when it comes to wrestling no you're right if it gets to the ground the bet the best guy he fought as far as wrestling credential pride Josh Koscheck my yeah my thought would be that GSP would never let oh yeah clocks always doubled up to maybe this that dudes in trouble those dudes in trouble it's so crazy how leg locks are now making their way much more prominently in MMA now you've seen much more leg lock action unless you're focused on it I feel like okay you're fighting dealing Danis O&F six weeks get ready for that you're not gonna learn the legs out game use that fear there's no way no one against a high level leg Locker it's gonna take you four years to catch him right so these guys they're so far behind like fuck Dylan dance like lots to lace here it is oh he's doing the right thing yeah but his both legs are tied up man he's so stuck that's such a gross feeling you could do it in two years it doesn't have to be four years average but two years if you were though if you were the good coach we're gonna try to battle someone at like you know hands Oh Gracie guy leglock level hmm it's gonna take you at least two years to stalemate yeah you guys aren't doing that yeah that's the thing with them and May is generally in MMA at leg locks were thought of as the technique you don't really ever need to even focus on because it's just an MMA there were too many people have gotten knocked out going for leg locks so the general consensus is don't really worry about leg locks at MMA they're too dangerous anyways but they're um they're you can't get knocked out it is dangerous in MMA but they still work you just got to know which leg lock positions are the safest and this is know if nothing else is working out if you can't take the guy down he's beating your ass and it's the third round you lost the first two rounds it's the last round that you know going for a heel hook it might be a great idea and if you practice on and if you're good at them you have hope in that last round you know what I mean don't necessarily go for leg locks right away because it is risky see if you could take him down first so you can get on top and pass this guard and see if he can get his back if you can't and it's too dangerous then at some point your coaches and you you got to decide okay it's time to go to plan B Plan C and leg lock should always be the last resort you know you remember Marco who lost against Gary Goodridge Gary Goodridge was beat his ass the whole fight last 45 seconds mark was pulled out of heel hook that's we used to call the remember Nicole Mary that's what we used to call heel hooks Hail Mary he looks the last resort it was like Paul Harvey's kind it was the one that really made it famous for a while but those fucked up Allen bitch get black belt yeah I think I'm gonna sit down on this and just punch you in the face well what's your really prepared for that when you get to the point with your leg locks where you can well you've been in the fire for a couple years two three four years and you're really good at leg locks and you're going against someone else at that same level leg locks probably aren't gonna be the deciding factor in that fight they're gonna nullify something and then if you're going against the guy who's really good at defending and he has good wrestling and good punches shit you like you might state you might want to stay away from leg lock yeah it all depends dude it's the man who did belt should bring in for his leg lock training because he brought in someone really Davi Ramos that's right and Dean Lister yeah Dean Lister's yeah he brought him in and had you know he said it was just at two months one month two months of every day them attacking his legs and that's all and that's all he needed you know Javy Ramos is fighting 55 in the UFC right isn't he I believe he's fighting think survive that's a bad motherfucker like that motherfucker he won Abu Dhabi in 2015 he had a sick flying armbar in one of his matches wait Torres just fell down makes me think that his knee might be jacked isn't he might be a little shaky he looked like like wobbly the way he fell down that looked weird dela Torre ratings have been rough rough lately have they been rough rough so hopefully this one's better well it's good general you know when when Bellator in them ufc's doing good for MMA in general it's good well for MMA in general we need big cards I mean it really needs to get more people watching and these are entertaining fights and there's no reason why more people shouldn't be watching I think they got a real problem with their name and I've said this forever the name is stupid but even you know that's not even UFC which is a great name their ratings suck too sometimes sometimes the name matters I don't think it matters at all I don't think it matters at with bands and music oh it doesn't you like booty in the boat blow fist you like that name yeah I do yeah are they today flogging.molly you like that I do doesn't bother me you no matter if you like it because it works Smashing Pumpkins if you weren't used to it you would think if they never existed but if they never existed and I told you my new bands called Smashing Pumpkins you would say dude you got to change your mother I would love it just do it Billy Corgan is a cool motherfucker man we tell you I had him on the pop yeah he was great on the punch normal I love that guy the form we should go that the form in October let's do it let's go you know Texan damn you know that's one podcast I wish I would have been here for God that one in the Paul Stanley one shit I wish I could have been here was that you tool fan URI meet Maynard I never met Maine or not they wouldn't get along cause he's a jitsu to God a nurse a jujitsu freak I know his round belt but I'm pretty sure he's got his brown I'm sure yeah he's a purple a long time ago but he's uh he comes in town for seminars he goes to dynamics like a Murray Aikens his place yeah he does it goes to seminars down there Jim I know his friends very well I just don't know how he's a great guy Maynard is one of the smartest people I know man rickets much does the owners wrestling league yeah no no that's Billy Corgan Billy Corgan Holmes the NWA is that it he's balls deep into who loves pro wrestler does he own TNT one of those hero oh look at this look at this that's it I'm trying oh that's it that's a wrap son tappity tap we're getting all submissions tonight that's nice well Lovato and Gerald Harris is gonna be a difficult one I bet you this mission are super excite they're very good you good yeah I'm good too I might be over good over good no yeah Billy Corbin he's diggin wrestling wrestling loves it he's a funny guy man he's a really smart dude he's such a sandwich man such a money man is not into pro wrestling but what Manor is into his own he owns a vineyard and a restaurant he's fucking crazy into wine he talked about one for a solid hour say the nice thing and say yeah it was interesting he's got the clamp you're screwed man yeah that's a tight one baby yeah you see how he like manipulates those legs that guy's done that to a lot of fucking people at this point he could he could have defended right here if he would have just brought his legs up and hooked his own left leg and turn away yeah he could've just went like this yeah yeah now when guys do that though you go to the doctor go to the right yeah it but you gotta do that before he puts you but when a guy grabs his legs do you still go to the impaler I've seen you around guys legs I I rarely do an arm triangle not mounted I stay in them out why do you stay in the mountain because because that one defense I was just telling you you can't do that stops all armed triangles there's you're forced to go to another submission which you're forced to take the back you kind of give up your back but the guy who is about to get tapped wins he gets another chance guys on your back but that choke was in deep when you um when you tap a guy from the mount or when you go to the arm triangle from the mount what percentage of effectiveness do you think it is in comparison to go on like like a clock like fully out you may there may be some added torque in the twist but if you go butter mount which is putting your butterflies on top and you extend you get you don't need you don't need to get on the side so it is it just a new movement you have to master well it all depends you know on your opponent if he knows this D fence someone Butchie an arm triangle like this is caught I would all have to do is just bring this leg up right I do it get inverting go bro and there's no way you're gonna tap see this is a thing I've seen you separate guy's legs when you were really into the Impaler and I know I've done it two guys that aren't very good but I've seen you when you were really into the Impaler for a while no one did that though the Impaler being you know what dibs no one did he defense the defense yeah nobody did that not back in the day cuz everybody was laying back the way he did the arm triangle where he's like laying inside control flat on his back you it obviously works people are tapping mhm but it's easy to defend if the guy knew it if the guy sees it coming but as soon as as soon as this arms in trouble boom you're right here that's interesting maybe I'm confusing you with somebody else I I had because I know I know during your when you there was a whole run when a lot of us were into the Impaler and then you also started putting it down where you would put the shin to the hip and really stretch a guy out yeah but Jesus look at that cut oh shit who's cut is a damn Cage Warriors earlier today oh my god that's crazy that's an eyebrow that's a full full iron plate see his skull that's that's one of the biggest I've ever seen um Jesus I remember arguing with somebody about it when someone was saying that you can't separate a guy's hands like that I'm like how long do you think you can hold your hands we need mats in here do you know we do maybe you can put Matt and Matt right but here's the thing I have new mats coming so we can do that right here all you do is cameras have gone straight the defense just thought you could dive right in the middle of the map don't know what we're talking about no we're gonna have that because there's new mats coming in because the mats that I'm getting from Fucci the the grappling ones are too slippery there they're not they don't have any texture to them you got zebra I'm getting new zebras man like see those are the best like zebra have zebra in my office those are the best by far I'm getting all new zebras but Fuji makes a real good one with the texture for striking so for kicking and stuff I need some texture I can't but on the ground it's fine so I'm gonna take the ones from the ground well you need the texture for passing too if you get it all sweaty yeah the texture yeah cuz that the mats I have now note everybody complains that they have to slip slippers there made for wrestling because the maps I have made for Russell shoes and Russell's have shoes so it's not an issues when you're going when you're going barefoot and doing jiu-jitsu and it gets sweaty after like three or four rounds passing becomes impossible is like passing on ice is it hot but if you feel the Zebras they're made they're made for barefoot Jackson we got thermostat zebras are yeah yeah this is what they put in my my gym but um my gym at home yeah but these out here the Fugees the smooth ones man it's not good for kicking like when I'm kicking them slipping around a lot like I don't think this well for specially for spinning spin I need I need traction I have to have something where I could push my foot off I can't like with round kicks you can kind of get away with it because of your foot slips your whole body's just kind of moving so what kind of match you got coming in you already got it all hooked up yeah it's ready they're out there I'll show them okay yeah the brother Fugees their functions but their tatami mats oh yeah it's a pretty long texture so stride you decide you know those with a / zebra Pedro Oh Jimmy Pedro went over to there and he did my first place he you know Olympic judo master he's a bad motherfucker he did my other place and so you know when he moved there I just went with him there I liked him I just don't think they're the right thing for what I do but the tatami ones with that heavy texture is perfect yeah for kickboxing I mean you really I need especially if I'm really sweaty and I'm throwing like spin kicks and shit like that I am not in the mood to blow my knee out a lot of my a lot of our students but I think the word blame the mats when they have a bad day and I'm sitting there and they're having a bad day they're like good man together the cortical yeah it's the match like yeah when are we getting new mats goat your shoes bro she kinda guilty too fucking mad brawls he's fucking mats they'd make fun of the HQ mats that's funny they do I do but no more in two weeks I get new mats remember when I just had pads put down with a cloth stripped nylon top stretched across a member we've got those dudes to do it yeah those are still gun yeah those can get slippery super slippery it was loose - it's like the problem with that was it wasn't tight so I remember the old headquarters for Gracie jiu-jitsu in Torrance yeah where they had that massive floor the green yeah that's exactly what I had so it was like it's never totally never tight it's never really tight dude am I crazy to think but Bader's the dark horse to win the heavyweight tournament it booked Bader's still very very good and not that King Mo's not King mo can fucking punch and he at one point in time at least was a world-class wrestler King mo was a beast of a wrestler he still is I've ever seen but he's had some injuries man and he had really really bad staph yeah I think the staff got him at least twice I'm honest I know he got it once I want to say he got it twice real bad he had a real bad staph like come on man Bader is probably at the top of his game right now Bader's in his prime when he beat Phil I was like holy shit he beat Phil Davis and he took him down a bunch of times like look he's at his game he's at the top of his game look at the heavyweight division the tournament Bader's my dark horse man Bader is a he is a legit world-class fighter that is actually probably at his best right now I would say that Ryan Bader right now is in his prime here's the thing though even in his prime he's not at the level of John and that was over in the UFC no but the way of saying who is well maybe Damon yeah I mean DC DC is DC's close you know DC put up a good fight the first time and the second time it was a better fight he did the speculation is that John barely trained for two hours literally at all yeah that's how good he is correct but when John fought Ryan you were like okay this is a gap disabled I'm like a baby around there's a gap that you go oh how are you gonna cross that gap you know even if you're DC you gotta be thinking and you know I loved easy even with DCs are you thinking how can I cross that gap ice forty distribute is gonna be for it's true it's true look I'm can't disagree with you but DC at least was competitive in that fight before he got head kicked it was a competitive fight he was putting a lot of pressure on Joshua it was interesting it was interesting there's a good card room but John set him up it is a good card whoo Paul de Leeuw versus John Fitch Jesus Christ that's a good fight man holy shit Aaron Pico do you see his last win that left hook to the chin fucking he's a big font he's a beast he's so good I think losing that first fight it's probably the best thing that could ever happen at yeah just healing train would you get does he ever that first fight he did he's a 10th minute guy right not anymore oh he was he and then after he lost I think Dylan I don't know just never came back Dylan Dennis's tattoo is fucking sweet like whoever did that that's like a real artist they nailed that dragon yeah it's really good man that's like Aaron Dellavedova style like look how good that dragon is man like what I'm talking about too is not just the image but the way it's lined up like the the with the use of space like when you see a real good tattoo artist one of the things they do is they really they they fill up the space the right way with the right amount of darkness right amount of lightness the katana body the body it fits perfect sometimes I was sure to go back cuz now Pat I feel like tattoo artists are so much better they're so good styles are so much different you know just I get like the Prius of tattoos instead of you know it's way better than well you could laser that shit off you know how fucked I don't know no I wouldn't go with none I've killed enough none yeah I love tattoos man I - I do - I feel like you have to cover them I believe you I don't know why but I do I'd love that Dylan Danis style of tattoo - that's a dope tattoo that's my favorite style those big-ass modern Japanese looking I always cover my men I mean around you get so yeah we're from do it stand up oh yeah I always cover I do four stand up a shame yeah probably the only time people seeing what I'm not is on this podcast honestly if it's one of them well no even during my shows like cover weigh-ins weigh-ins I wear a t-shirt that's one thing UFC's been doing is bulk making cool t-shirts for each Reebok I make a cool t-shirt for each place you go to you know have you been wearing those sometimes I don't use more the plastic yeah you rocked on it one usually but I wore the Boston one Boston they made a dope one those greens like a bumblebee looks like a bumblebee with gloves on at the UFC's like backstage who was like the head honcho walking around is there someone above Dana that's walking around and hanging out backstage or a statement well Dana is always run in the show for sure but is there like oh shit that's the golden schnitz right Nowitzki is the guy everyone's kind of like well no no he means like running the show no no just walking around hanging out no there's nobody man and Ari is so back - oh no no but when he comes there it's very brief and he comes for the fights or it comes to the weigh-ins he goes you know fucking busy that dude must be he's in and out you just don't know that you'll see Society yeah not even it's a big company it's a it's a business they put together with a bunch of celebrities bought into it and you know it's a real big deal but yes probably a lot of people bought into it I would have to look at it and that's like it's part owner of the UFC well I don't ask questions honestly I really don't ask a lot of good like I wasn't a chair I've been working there forever I asked almost no questions this is what I asked what are you gonna do with this guy what are you gonna do that Machoke anyway like you can't tell anybody this this world my god shit oh shit that's the questions I asked with Dana I never asked questions about business or who bought this or I don't have enough room in my brain to give a fuck about other people's business I have zero interest in the people's business I mean literally zero especially with the UFC I don't give a fuck I just want to know who's fighting who's fighting who what are you gonna do I'm not like how much is this guy gonna make what percentage is he own and who's he what's he doing and how is he gonna make his money back and what kind of financial return on his investment you're gonna get I don't give a fuck about C but when they say those flurries are owners it's just like a business potato they might have not be into the officious as far as money like well that's my people are into getting famous people to invest in shit too it's a fun thing LL Cool J is that LL Cool J me Kimmel hmm there you go he's Mike Beltran he owns it too don't have any say Mike belt round get the best fucking mustache in the game heaven owns a piece of pie how about about Nick Newell Anthony Kiedis there we go cowgirl Devine damn owns a piece the UFC damn damn damn so a lot of people bought in but the fuck is she doing in the fight game so what they do is they you know they probably everybody chips in a little bit man that's a strategy Jim stock they skim stalked my whole baby pretty sure I'm sure they didn't chip in I don't think they chip I would think it was Don nor will they give them stock for cuz they own the business right they're not then I can cash from those guys I don't think but what then why would they do that well they give them a piece of the business for no reason hmm they'd have to give him money I don't know see this is why I don't do this I don't like this is why I don't doing this I don't do it we're doing like wondering who's paying what or how they're doing no I want to hear about it now we we like it we like it you know what that's one of the things I found as I've gotten older especially is to concentrate on less things like god bless you other things just put it aside but if it's not concentrate on less things you can get better at the things you really enjoy there's only so many things you can think of there's only so many things if you spend your time worrying about other people's nonsense you're robbing yourself you think it's fun but it's really a big fat distraction you know what it is it's not even your life right so you're thinking about things that are going on in other people's lives and you're doing it because you're not giving a hundred percent to your life and there's some stress involved in that and so to distract yourself from that stress you concentrate on other people's lives it's a very common thing do you have arguments you ever have fake argument with myself I used to do that all the time I used to pretend someone would say this back to me I was going oh I'm gonna say this bad yeah I would and then sometimes would be with the dude and then I would run into him to talk to him think we're gonna have this big already came in I'm sorry I think there's so much of how people interact with each other it could be just way different with just a little shift in how we talk to each other and how we think about it I did that last night Juna said the laugh action we're talking about off here Santino and Theo von I was going you know in between them I had this whole dialogue in my head cuz they're like oh yeah stay and watch yourself I gotta be cool as soon as I got done I was like ah that fuckin Santino about that sock yeah I'm like Larry go and come to the back he was a nice guy ever Santino's a very nice guy he's fuckin he's a funny dude Chris like do young guys that are coming up that I go oh look at you him and feel last night back back to back I was like you motherfuckers are monsters have you seen his bit he does about the rock you gotta ask him Santino yes cuz he doesn't he it's he's got so much material that he stopped doing it I guess he'll do it but if you bring it up you'll he'll do I would love that I asked him to do it one night he did it for us in the the Oh our dude hey I don't know who sent him oh you guys see him he's so he doesn't like my show time guy well red head for Mars red head okay um he's um he's a fucking funny guy he's doing I think he's on my show on the 2015 told me he's on Shekar he's doing that with me in Chicago him and Tony him a double header that's a ridiculous show him and I walked from laughs after the Comedy Store last night and he's a Chatty Cathy it's pretty good talk really good dude I love that guy I love Santino and Theo von I love him - he's so original - killers man so so death when they go watch it Leslie oh um I was supposed to do his podcast but I just never I don't know why tonight you guys he had you on there we went back and forth I'm I still want to do it just didn't uh I just didn't hold the last few weeks have been fucking crazy so go with your knee operation yeah they have each other's numbers yeah yeah he's so funny man responds ask him better - how about how about his boy was with him last night I don't think he knows much about feel stand-up and feels just sucking every fucking breath out of that place just destroying and he goes man he's good huh Mike do he's the kids like I mean he's doing really good down there like yeah man the fucking killer well you know the thing is Theo has really come into his own over the last two years and that's I met him right around the time it was really popping for him he was always really good like everybody thought he was always funny but he hit some new level I remember me and Adam the booking agent at The Comedy Store yeah we were in the hallway and Theo was murdering and we he got offstage and I went up to Adam I go dude he's on another level he hit some new stride he goes yeah right like we remember like recognizing this moment where Theo is in some new space he was in some weird like original space everywhere I go like I was just in Calgary and a they go who else is good out there when you have you deal everyone you have three or Vons like no Mike how do you guys not he should be drawing talent even sales it's only Austin Santino - yeah how are you guys not just people gonna know yeah keep an eye on those two dudes are like the next Thompson correct you guys didn't know Michael che is yeah oh yeah his Netflix specials fucking high level Oh it's called Michael chain matters dude he's got this Jesus bit or he talks about you know Jesus as a carpenter uh-huh I'm not gonna ruin the bit but he's saying he like he must have sucked because if he would have been good there would have been pieces of furniture I do is really good yeah good he does he's high low high last report just released a special on Netflix I didn't know he's still doing stand-up James your boy comes James yeah yeah he just did yeah yeah he's been doing stand-up he does like I know used to man up haters I didn't know we basically were amateurs together we're basically just starting to get paid and I signed with my manager and I got my manager to sign with Kevin and like I have a I'm in a small management company and he has a few clients that have been with him for more than 20 years and two of them are mean Kevin exists you and Kevin is this sort of in Boston or LA it was New York I moved from Boston to New York because of my manager and then I hooked my manager up with Kevin and then you know I Kevin and I are pretty close yeah I know that that's what I watched the semester because I think Brian told me like dude he was a killer I think you told me that so I've never seen a stamp I've watched it unlike YouTube but then his special it's good with you know today's man it's like at this point he's just so busy you know he's got his TV show and he's always doing before Kevin can wait he was always doing his other TV show that went on forever you know that's and he was a like a main guy on that show so here's the main you know I mean as an actor I mean as a writer oh so it was nice oh dude he wrote everything with those guys and he super wrote a lot he rewrote a lot he went over all the scripts the reason why the show was so good is because it was a talented staff a riders talented actress Leah Remini was very funny there was a lot of funny people on the show Patton Oswalt was really good on the show he's great but but more than anything he was like kevin is like a driven dude like he gets super obsessed about doing the run like he would go over line is it like this like he's a craftsman like he's trying to break it down you know he's trying to figure it out but he just doesn't do the amount of stand-up now that he used to when he was start now how could you can't there's no way you could that's why you didn't think that he was doing it anymore because there's no way he could do the kind of stand-up where you'd be everywhere all the time he just never that time you're doing a sitcom it's your sitcom switcher you're writing fuck dude that's so much work shailen talk about that too because you write everything over lick every episode and then you can't do both think think about some of the shit that we've done like that cartoon about you getting kidnapped by the Mexicans and then fill you up with drugs and turn into a sex slave my dicks pump that we we need we didn't write a goddamn thing no we were just two friends riffing giggling being ridiculous and it turns into a cartoon and it's fucking hilariously they watch that cartoon it's hilarious we have it so much easier if when we do in a sitcom we would had meetings we would have to do a run-through for the network the network would give us stupid notes we were identities I know and it was a nightmare fucking nightmare from day one it's not a nightmare I have to deal a little bit a little bit now because my Showtime show on below the belt your shows at least not scripted no see that's the thing is when things are scripted shit gets weird see because what they're doing with you is very talent dependent they're dependent upon your personality now so people see the more they let you go the better the show is gonna be they realize that and you see it in the show now right but if you're if you're us a show where they're creating the dialogue everybody's got to say there's an there everybody's got their own little fucking opinion about how this should go and that you go and you don't want to hear their shit and they think you suck and everybody's going back and forth and then the network comes in and they don't want to get their greasy paws on it everybody wants to get their fuckin jizz in the soup they all want to get their plays everybody literally wants to add their DNA to the script I've seen people try to change things just to justify their job they have to have an opinion everybody has to have an opinion like I just think she's not trust hot enough they have these conversations we need to we need a black guy we need a black guy and like what and then you listening some executive that doesn't know shit about writing they're not writers they just decide they want to have some sort of say and they think they know the business because they've been working as an executive fucking up shows for about five six years so they got experience fucking up shows so they think they can fuck up your show and fix it you'd be a nightmare to do all that and do stand-up we need a gay neighbor be half defecating they gotta get a gamer Tom Lieber big silly bold well now it's Google transgender tiny transgender I'm here transracial all dude thank God you guys remind me of this there's a who fuck yes yes there's a new documentary on Netflix about that lady who was white raging yes and it is a big alternate epic what's a call I forget but you watch it poor lady no you feel bad yeah right to called the Rachel divide the Rachel de bellas Elle's renamed Ozel Dolezal change your name to like some soup she still want to be black super a stick and sounding name no spoiler alerts I mean look this shit up yeah but they basically like she goes on she writes a book sales 500 of them it goes terrible strand make money cuz the black community doesn't accept your white we need Interceptor so she writes this book and then at the end here taking her braids out like oh damn she's going back to white but she doubles down makanda style comes out with like an afro changing the name like what is her new name it's something crazy it's yeah like from the motherland yes cherish Gerald Harris was always like super jacked he looks good he looks like he's a good shit there's gonna be a great fight man yeah Gerald Harrison Rafaela by oh there it is GG Ameri Diallo that's a shame that's super Tommy yeah that's super normal that makes sense for a white girl um do you know Gerald Harris does stand-up apparently is really funny oh yeah yeah I haven't see I saw like a very short clip of him when he was first start now oh yeah yeah he's a funny guy yeah that could be like an enemy Comedy Tour you Gerald Harris yeah Megan who else's oh yeah who else is doing it Adam Hunter Adam hunter he's like no he's a girl he was a really good restless but he's still in the MMA community yeah his his show is fucking good man and he's a hilarious comic he's a really good joke rider like a one liner type dude very good at that he's a good dude too so that would be him and he wrestled I think he coaches wrestling too doesn't he do some shit with Einstein Einstein I think they'd cast together and then they don't need they don't work out and then and out those started doing it and that's all cause the trouble always caused the trouble I've never met him that's troubles for you we'd love him never I'm sure he brings you up though he calls you Brendan schwabe The Fixer the big back I've never met him one of the funniest guys to ever live it's a funny fuck he's so fizzy Oh Ranjha show where he does the sketches that's the heat sketch he's got the rock III sketch once off the chart dude he's brilliant it's this one if you're seeing the take on ski rides all of that Michael Bisping Michael Bisping in him in a fucking parody of snaps is fine so good it is hilarious no channeled he had his own show and eat it's a talk show where he's brought and he's at a Henner Henner Gracie Frank Sheeran and he's the time he's the host but it's not a Rick it's like a podcast but it's a show and he rushes his guests he's the the premise of the show is he's better than the guests and he's gonna crush him and he smashes you he had Frank Shamrock on and I asked him I go did you did you bring up his snaggletooth not you know you know and and and he's he brought it up for 30 minutes I love Franco but he fixed it though he's got braces I got braces my teeth with braces Frank's braces are my teeth were just as bad as Frank so I had to get braces as an old man is are you metal I did embezzling Brian's doing in this line they're not getting better Brian said Invisalign for like four months now check this and took him out its teeth or fuck snatchy tell me letter let it go oh here it is snatchy can we play this on the podcast yeah and that's uh who's the other kid at Cole right no kid uh he's a grappler Dale get down yeah this is great like a Turkish we've lost Billy Magali well where the fuck did you lose him to and I as if he's a fucking pair of car keys fights going on Oh we'll come back to the sketch it's a long chance we'll come back to it let's watch like 40 minutes long this fight no let's go a show is 40 minutes Lovato and Gerald Harris here this shit's going down this is an interesting fight to me Lovato is one of the best jujitsu guys right now in MMA my boy out of Oklahoma money can fuck dudes up standing and speaks Portuguese right Oh crazy flying knee do you go to the ground with him he's probably that's not a good idea let's see what happens here you might get tied it up I thought Jill retired he did for a bit and they laid his back this is he come from the you'll see and then Simon belt or is that I do not remember Lovato's got a really good guard - so he's in him he's in danger yeah I mean he's got his legs closed I don't like Gerald's playing this game this is not a wise it's maneuver it's probably gonna end right here yeah you don't realize some well you know what his left elbows out he's good he's safe right here his legs are tied around he's a triangle son and if he puts in that if he triangles his legs even with both arms and oh there it's over it's not all it's done is tapped yep but they don't know they don't know you know this guy's level of jujitsu they have an idea they think they could survive you can't he has knockouts to them does he's kind of bummed out that he didn't get to choke him but he could show that he does he can do that too but the level on the ground is so high when's the last time you saw this many high level jujitsu guy just submit right first round right boom crazy get on Bellator now Frank just cap the night off jump the half grab bro like a dungeon if he snaps bay doors armed - shit think about that change in the frame Sylvia Nogueira what if he breaks faders arm and we go get the fuck out of here he has arguably one of the best choices in the history the heavyweight division this out got night guards ready yeah Frank you have French way barred it is it is better but Frank's got a wicked fucking guard man get that beautiful swing BAM he this leg wraps it up - god damn that's fuckin filthy beautiful do you like the sign look at the swim right here boom yeah that's right there perfect um do you like this way I get arm are such that all the time that's off a normal crush that's how your legs will be off of failed arm crush to the armbar right it's perfect do you prefer it like that or Dina or the legs narrow that that's when either the legs are if the legs aren't perfect were meaning the ankles across over the far elbow or an or shoulder that's perfect but sometimes you just can't have it perfect so that is if Gerald Harris would have had a good corkscrew a good hitchhiker he could have got out but you got to have that and then chamber ready to go right and you got a you know wrap it a couple thousand times that's a very technical move remember remember when Karl Perez Ian fought Matt Serra remember that yeah and Karl Parisien one of them almost had an armbar Karl almost had Matador and then mad hit a perfect corkscrew a hitchhiker yeah out of it so if you have those in the chamber ready to go the legs need to be perfect yeah that's what I was thinking the left shoulder had more mobility than it would if you had right over but it was so tight yeah oh it's interesting on some guys like Chu they get a certain way of doing it like that and then they choose that over the other way no no he didn't know Yeah right there there was no if you want to try to get it perfect first he would have lost it but you know how some guys do that though some guys will choose like a specific way to lock up an armbar or an arm triangle and it might not even be like the most effective but they do it that way so much they get it locked yeah yeah there's there's so many variations that you can hit that armbar you know you could hit it belly down on your side on your back you know you ideally if you're controlling the action you're gonna get that arm bar and you're gonna be on your back and he's gonna be on his back and spider what if you're controlling everything but shit the guy's a beast and starts moving you got to move with them and you gotta you gotta make sure that you have the skills to get that arm bar and any of the the positions in the Scramble do you remember when people were almost always doing the rear naked choke with the palm on the back of the head what's almost always hiding it you're saying instead of doing the crotch anyway it was always palm to the back of the head and then it's switched and everybody was like oh yeah that's that's way better if you can get it in you have the gloves then sometimes it's hard to get the gloves when Fedor Nick Emelianenko tracked down by FBI agents at Bellator 198 what I've been in and out of this hotel room for the last few days apparently - and why is a former owner of Bellator was Michael Cohen why and there might be some something up Russian collusion what why find pictures of him and Trump is this real holy shit this we reported it from here I mean I'm not digging that's your other place has had it so what if Trump and phaidor are colluding that's crazy boy or fate or in Putin tetherball you were saying before about Invisalign Invisalign does work the thing is gonna Brian no he probably he probably takes them out you got to keep them in and once you take them out for life you got at night you guys sleep with the retirement that's not for you got it yeah you got it people get lazy I get lazy so I'll you're supposed to do it every night if you go three or four nights without using a retainer your teeth go back to the distribution just go with the metal for like three months still the same thing even with when you're done with the metal ones you still need to wear a retainer really your teeth will go back like

cartel killing of a cop I can't watch did you watch that no I don't on video I mean they aren't they record on their phone it's basically slice the skin off on a dead person there's already a dead person there okay a cop and they slice his skin all the way they skinned him alive pull out his heart cut his heart out show it to him show it to the camera and warn anybody it's fuckin door it was really is ruin my night yeah it's the darkest thing I've ever seen watch this the only thing worse would be watching you know that what happened to a baby or skin yeah us that's it roll yeah let's change this I can't watch that stuff it's it's floating around it's crazy I know that that's happening somewhere in the world it's happening that's right you know two hours away yeah it's right there on the border of California he's asking because of organized crime and that organized crime is they they're surviving and thriving because drugs are illegal and they got everyone paid off have you seen that documentary cartel land yes Jesus Christ no the best part of that that one guys I kind of he's going to get scar telling gets his dick sucked by his mistress and he goes boy oh boy you know what's funny is halfway during through that documentary it looks like everyone being armed is the solution so halfway through the documentary I'm already texted people called shit you gotta watch this look what happens when everyone has machine guns but then it down it slowly goes south yeah we'll have you seen it Joe know like the main storm haven't seen it come on no the main star of it he's like fighting back against the cartel he's married and he forgets he's miked up sees his mistress and there's subtext he's gonna stick sight in your seat the subjects bueno boy good let's do it it was a hero and he had a lot of groupies and he took in you know he forgot they were filming everything News miked and he had a lot of groupies laid the law down that's hilarious I need to see that I was telling him about American made the seals movie with Tom Cruise another badass Tom Cruise movie oh yeah we he's on the airplane so just typing around yeah do it it's good it's really good good look I know a lot of the Barry seals story and they covered a lot of you can only cover so much of it in a 90 minute movie but look I mean they did not pull any punches they made look like Bill Clinton got him off Bill Clinton called the prosecutor they caught him with millions of dollars in cocaine and money no nope they have her on the phone with Bill Clinton Bill Clinton like he's telling her I'm gonna walk whether or not he said that I don't know cuz he's dead no one knows right and he's telling her just trust me I'm gonna walk right out of here and they're all laughing and she's like you're not gonna walk anyway and they're like mrs. prosecutor Bill Clinton's on the phone and it's governor Clinton yes yeah you see her go you see her just get pissed off next thing you know they're unconfident and he's leaving mm-hmm so they'd let you know that Bill Clinton and if the only way you could put that in a movie is the nasty truth some truth to him they're like there's gotta be some sort of a documented record of him making that call right he made that call he had to have made that call you couldn't otherwise defamation right of course Bill Clinton and he is the governor so there's probably a record of him saying let that guy go and so the reason they think is because in the film this is what they're saying is that he was tied in with the CIA and somehow another through the CIA using him for reconnaissance photos and stuff like that and they eventually got hooked up these drug dealers start selling drugs the CIA was in on it and they were allowing him to do it and he was getting them photographs and Intel from all these different drug places and in return they were letting him do whatever he did and taking a piece of it problem did they mention Mena Arkansas yeah yeah they mentioned all that all that mean that's where Bill Clinton was a governor of they they only found out of all the stuff cuz two kids were killed they were murdered and they told the parents that the kids had gotten high and fell asleep on the train tracks but the parents did an independent autopsy and found stab wounds in good so like oh Jesus what the fuck happened here and then slowly but surely the whole thing unravels they witnessed a drug drop yeah and oh well they couldn't have any witnesses dude they made me kneel like it was a case you go to youtube and just punch in CIA Mena Arkansas cocaine boom and you get the host it's a serious oh look at me it could be a two kids we don't know we don't know somebody was saying I assume the CIA the kids must have seen the drugs be dropped and whoever was selling the drugs moving the drugs they just decided to kill these kids because they couldn't take a chance the kids keeping their mouths shut so they killed him and apparently that was just one thing though in the movie the way they haven't made up is like that that was just one thing that sort of straw that broke the camel's back they don't even have that it I don't even remember if they had that in the movie the kids did they have that in the movie the murder they didn't have the murder the kids no they didn't but what they did have is these people were I mean everybody was rich they were all coming in buying things and everyone's like where the fuck is all this money coming from who was rich the people that were working with Barry seals okay like his brother-in-law like his wife's brother a parent I don't know if that was a real person but in the in the movie he's he's balling out of control and he's he's got some fucking ridiculous souped-up car and he's got money coming out of his pockets he stuff in his park and he gets caught by a cop you know and I don't know if that happened in real life but in the movie they made it seem like everybody was just there was so much money flowing around it didn't make any sense they were burying in his backyard they when they busted him there's like in the movie again I don't know if this is real cuz you know what fucked me up man that Mark Schultz movie the Martian yes because I know Mark Schultz fought one time in the UFC because I watched it he fought Big Daddy Goodrich he took Big Daddy Goodrich down and beat the shit out and they didn't use good daddy and the movies funny some Russian do some red white guys fighting a white guy is also Stevie also Schultz head there's no gay relationship there that's the other way bleached his hair and made him look like he was like an ultra-light each other that's weird and weird Matt's at Hollywood Mark Schultz told me that that movie's full of shit but it's bullshit because she doesn't fight Gary Goodrich at the end why would you change history like this is what we're talking about in the soup no fucking way no fucking way now jack cuz I can't trust anything I can't trust anything in a movie look Hollywood doesn't know the minefield look the movie was great Steve Carell is good at sucking amazes a nose mom he's amazing but I know what really happened I know that he fought Big Daddy Goodrich why isn't he fighting Big Daddy Gertz in your fucking movie melting over an accent you can't overlook that no she only fought once it's a part of the moment I hear em it's it's a really easy but it's really easy just get a black guy so what maybe Barry that sign off on his likeness or it doesn't have to he doesn't have to its history there's a reality to it you don't have to have him say his name you show Big Daddy Goodrich across from him you show him you know you have Marshall you just cut into it right when they're introduced and have a buck and then have the guy and you know have him wear the gay just like Big Daddy Goodrich had Agee on it's got a never Gyan who this is stupid you can't change history this is a real historical moment it was a moment when one of the best wrestlers on the fucking planet Earth a legit super high-level Olympian fought in the UFC and he only fought once and you got to see how easy he took an Elite MMA fighter down and just dominated him that was an important historical moment in MMA that's my change they missed the changing who breaks Jackie Robinson's record a Babe Ruth's record or Mickey Mantle changing his you could never do that with baseball nobody would let you you don't think because those are major sports and a lot of people would know that with MMA there's like that whatever men they might have done that but that makes me not trust everything else in the movie because if you did that with a very important point that's a very important point because as a legend yeah that put a Paul Herrera knockout when Paul Herrera had him like a fireman's carry and he hit him with all those elbows that's probably the most Bru Kayle in history yes of them it's certainly certainly one of them you know was a terrifying terrifying KO how easy is that for them to fix - if you just put some sort of reference to Gary Goodridge to Big Daddy Goodrich he head kicked Don Frye remember that is a month that kicked him and Kay Odom you know Big Daddy Goodrich is an important historical figure in MMA you can't just change the name of the guy Mark Schultz fights good movie though I lost I lost faith in based on true story movies when the dragon came out the Bruce Lee movie by Jason Scott Lee he did he was played Bruce Lee yeah and I love it so much bullshit in there oh my god I love it was filled with bullshit it shut in the movie in the movie he had a real fight at the Long Beach arena he was just at in reality he was just doing demonstrations but in the movie they had him in a fight he did have a real fight there and in a movie during the fight his opponent like broke is back with a sidekick and in the movie he was in the hospitals heartbreaking in reality fucked his back up lifting lifting weights he was lifting weights he was back in the know when that fight no mostly to death but he never had a professional fight ever ever right ever not one fight never no I don't think he ever competed I don't think you had an amateur fighting yeah I mean he fought like he had on the street you know the show yeah on the streets and he fought in a YMCA for the right to teach non-asians kung fu in San Francisco that be if I was always yeah he had real fights he was a real fighter but he didn't have a real professional fight yeah he didn't have anything like that he broke his back lifting weights not in a professional that's was he lifted so when I saw that I thought okay I can't trust any Hollywood movies now based on a true story they got a peanut a little bit no no well no you can now it's now it's inspired by true events files yeah I dig that she can't entertain stuff you can't add stuff you can't add a gay relationship can add a karate kick to the back that fucks you up puts you in hospital you can't add that oh oh in reality he had to fight if you if he beat this guy at a YMCA he had the right to teach non-asians because that was an issue back then yeah they're like why you teaching you Americans are shit and he's like I'll teach anybody who fuck I want so he had a fight and wasn't at a YMCA in the movie in the movie it was in an underground cavern with like elders and these little spots back up again gasps he kicks them yes but it's like it wasn't a weird like Illuminati can I love that part though I hate when they do that yeah it was all bullshit can't do that about a real watches documentary fuck that's like when Abraham Lincoln fought the vampires it was obvious it was a we don't know maybe he killed Mon that's why we could sleep good at night that movie so underrated we do know a lot of people out there are drinking baby blood maybe after a while you turn in like two into like like a vampire kind of person you imagine if vampires or something you really had to worry about we're so funny you imagine if there was dudes out there suckin people's blood and a bunch of people found with like their their jugular veins tapped into by those two two prongs you know isn't it weird that it's kind of romantic like chicks think that like you bite a girl at now blood but you know why - because it's the guy loves you so much you're willing you love him so much you willing to be the undead and you for eternity go for eternity like the best one ever by far Twilight Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder Ocean Rams - oh yeah fantastic video interview with the vampires fucking good - is very good but it's a different hand pick top yeah dude Tom Cruise killed it in that - killed in that - really good in that with that little girl that listen girl people it's fucked up what's that little girl's uh she's dan Dunst yes yes fine man amazing she's amazing in that movie she's fucking fantastic and she's like 10 and she's killing it as a little bit about a little bit to them this is terrifying - cuz you believe I know and she would like dress those people up after they were dead and people like what the fuck you killed them and even top crews I got a chill out yeah she was killing it couldn't help but she'd kill her see that no fuck ya wanna order a large piece I'd she might have been the scariest vampire ever the ladies up there she's up there right cuz she's so fuckin cute and so vicious because she was like 300 years old but she was ten you know who's not a bad vampire is Colin Farrell in a night of living dead not bad at all not bad not bad it's not nice living dead it's um I know what you're talking about it's the newest one the yeah the kid who died what is it called the fuck is it called it's not nice Living Dead I don't think so no it's like from dusk till dawn now that was good - Friday night that's it that's it Fright Night um just till Dawn's good movies have their big I watch them all of them Jesus Christ why light ones the most vampire they could live in the Seattle area because it never says shit they are the makeup I'm a fucking they don't burn when the Sun hits them insulate that was a movie right blades of fucking good that's a good no-call Pharaoh's a beast in that that's a good movie there's probably more vampire movie movies and space movies Star Wars aliens Star Trek you just keep going on event horizon happy going on and on agree homeboy disagree hey have you guys seen lost in space on Netflix have you heard anything about it no any good here anything about that Jamie Lawson space supposed to be any good trailer look good I didn't hear good reviews though oh I know they did it they got a new show they're doing with that chick from Battlestar Galactica Katie how do you say her name Sackhoff she's badass you ever see Battlestar Galactica the sci-fi version no was that bounce sure glad to go with old John Travolta the worst movie of all time no no go right now to field earth you know you know that Trump gave NASA a whole shitload of money like 19 billion dollars and said okay here's the money but we're going to fucking move let's go to the moon so they they started a campaign to go to the moon and they just cancelled the mission why no no they didn't cancel the mission they canceled the moon rover they canceled the the construction of the moon and everybody's confused they don't know how they did that because it's like the last moon rover that they unless they have some new top-secret moon rover that they won't don't want to let anybody know about maybe they found some new cool ship maybe probably maybe they can't go okay give us the money let's figure it out okay we'll figure it out we got 19 billion nobody else is working on it putting a rover on the moon but and the in the NASA wasn't either until Trump said here's the money let's go to the fucking moon and then we're going to Mars she magic Trump goes on TV and says there's a lot of things to talk about one of them is a terrible tragedy we've never been in the moon ladies and gentlemen shitty would do yeah oh yeah found out he doesn't know you're all he doesn't know how he's too busy with those friends with Alex challenge he's alone really talk that much cuz they can't they can't everywhere they go they're wearing wires everyone's wearing wire their phones are being you know you know okay and on is Q ain't heard about that crazy shit dude was it Q a non is someone in the Trump administration but people think it's someone in intelligence in the military who dropping all these clues on 4chan and 8chan so the whole thing is is it real is it disinformation is someone playing a trick but he legally can't say what's going on behind the scenes another leglock look at this he legally can't say he's given because it's it's against the law so he's dropping all these clues and it's a it's someone named QA nan and it's been going on for about three months and there's all these people in the underground basically he's saying trust the president it's gonna take a while to take down all these corrupt people at the top of the FBI and the Department of Justice in all this shit we're gonna take him down one by one so he's been dropping all these clues on how they're gonna do it it's pretty interesting you listen to it every day has drops every day and it's it's like it gets addicting but you don't know if it's real or not is it disinformation got cue ain't on and Pete and he makes drops every day and leaves all these clues of what's going on behind the scenes no one can trace back to find out who he is anything like that no I think I'm like 4chan or 8chan isn't it like if you can you can hackers know how to drop in for me information without being tracked right for sure right is that that's what's going on I know you have right yeah there's a bunch of posts about it but you again I who knows if it's real or not yeah but but the people that I mean there's people who there's a guy named jerome corsi who works for how it's jones who that's his job is to analyze what's all these clues of what's going on what Trump is doing behind the scenes because he's got the media and all the entire media Hollywood FBI and what they're finding out is they're finding text messages and emails going back and forth between key people running the government colluding to destroy Trump that's what's going on so for sure they don't run him around they didn't think I was gonna win so they did all this shit thinking Hillen was gonna win but now that he won they're going back and looking at all the text messages from all these super powerful people people are resigning it's crazy shit gonna most people don't know the it's like Game of Thrones for real you know Game of Thrones has like 50 character and it would take you about a month to take to catch up on what's going on there's just so much going on that's what's going on okay there's a game of thrones going on right now but the media is only going to tell you their side and then QA non is dropping the behind-the-scenes clues it's pretty fascinating arm try Blair there's another standing on hundred percent it's over a hundred percent camera I'll go back to the cameras talking to you you should jump the full guard good why do you think this is definitely done it's so deep and the guys not doing anything with his left hand while he wasn't if he just jumps there you go okay it's over now I'm trying go in full guard is bad and how about the arm triangle from standing position your eyes them to the ground finishes it yeah I was sick then you see it every now and then you got to be tapping people so much with your arm triangle you have so much faith in it it's got to be your go-to to take a chance like that if it's not your go-to that's why you don't really see it cuz there's not that many fighters overall in MMA that are known for amazing arm triangles it's kind of popular it is probably you know I would say 25% of MMA fighters have high-level arm triangles I'm saying maybe that's a little high but you know about 20-25 percent well what he did there that was like special was get sideways he was doing like a rear naked choke from the sides at a Brazilian or Mexican what is his name Jamie so fought Sam the Brazilian flag on short this is dope look how he clamps the shit down very interesting very interesting because he look how tight he gets it man he gets it super tight Manuel Sanchez Manuel Sanchez Mexicans they got heart dude this is phenomenal you don't need to make it comments the full guard look at this see what he's doing with his left hand he's not really protecting anything so that shows me that he kind of doesn't know how to get out of it Wow super Snuggie that's a mean the Mexican then we need to come back to Z I agree well he offered Yaya Rodriguez a beat correct maggle bed shower actually came into my gym last night a couple days he's uh yeah you did yep yeah and she came in with Kelvin they've been hanging out he's phenom we have a phenomenal you don't want to see him versus Abby no why not hold-hold want someone to lose no amazing fight yo just fought Franky Eggert well his last legs Frank get lost right got dismantled right so you have two awesome fucking beat who could probably beat the top five right now so four yeah why not who wouldn't want to see that the heart we do but if you're if you care about your the heart cords knows I beat but he's not a huge name so Fred yeah it's a huge risk so you can ease up get back in it's ya're you think he beat some it's a tough fucking fight for a man well I've to Frankie Edgar right true different fights cause I'd like to see it because Yair in my opinion has the most dynamic stand up in all of MMA cuz he throws so much crazy shit he's doing the wild shit I love that man so does that beat I want to see I want to see it it looked like a be thrust like a Jackie Chan fight the beat is he's got a bunch of like really solid fundamental movements like when he lands like he'll throw something and even if he like he's off he'll shuffle and adjust and always be in perfect position like he's really good at like throwing kicks and throwing punches or elbows or knees anything he does he's he hits you and then boom he's in pretty doesn't hold yeah you never say him stumble or look weird he's never like off-balance he's on the same team as could be though no no no it's a Mark Henry guy oh he's a Mark Henry guy new jersey marxism the kind of thing friends they're all from Dagestan okay okay please maybe they maybe they trained maybe they came up together in the same Club Kabhi Kabhi bus' always retreating waiting retweeting well they're from the motherland but zombied is a very different game I mean he's not a wrestler per se he's very good Jiu Jitsu he's got very good all game he's good a year and your young kid you just got your ass whooped by Frank y'all see taking a year off he's trying to figure things out and you're gonna fight zabi who could I think a gang with the top five right now you want to find right now he's ranked what maybe 14 13 it's gonna fight him we'll let him fight when he's like 5 3 2 when he's a champ not now I knows that beats people wanna fight I don't know if they made that fight though I know yours agent Congrats on a great wins a beat it would be an honor to fight you one day we'll have to meet each other in the top 10 which I know you'll make quickly my next fight coming up so stay tuned I know yeah agent really well and they're not take there's no way they take that fuck so you think that's what it is you think they made a conscious decision now's not the right time for item wait till he's top ten and I agree should be top right yeah in my opinion yeah I watched him against Bach niak and again you know botnets super tough guy Kyle Bachmann known as the beeps last name Mago med sharp ha ha ha it's not even happening for me damn it off I stumble a couple of times at the weigh-ins I stumble through practice will you read it like if I read it like I watched him fight but when I watched him fight it says a beat whatever the fuck his last name is like if I hear you say it like multiple times then pick it up maybe mega med sharapov magomedovich no but they they want you to just calm the beat because like for American fans like that's a hard sell when never got mad off is hard but everybody calls him kebede for the most part yeah the beat is super high level man I'm so impressed with his striking the way million a broken are a broken fist yeah we entered the fight entered the fight with him hitting the pads I got marked up as Mark Henry told me he's the most talented guy he's ever seen come through his gym Eddie Alvarez Barbosa Frankie Edgar says the beat by far the most talented yet how about that crack Kevin Lee fight with Barbosa he's a beast look dude Kevin C I think Kevin Lee kabhi was a great fighter great because I think it takes who down see I think Kevin Lee does things battle somethings better than khabib does and khabib does some things better than Kevin but I think Kevin's better at the more important things it's hard to tell who does what better really is because they're both so good at everything Mike Kevin Kevin Lee ever by a longshot Cubs good - he's good yeah cubes good stretch it'd be better standing up the real question is gonna be in the wrestling because khabib z' in this number one goals did not stand up and have a kickboxing match with you no one goes to maul you and whoever gets the takedown it all comes down to how good the guy on the bottom is office Kevin's a better cop Kevin's a better graphine he's better at finishing from the back correct like he has a very anxious mouth passing in that fight the passing in the first row first of all he took Barboza down quicker than khabib did khabib struggled Barboza's shook them off a couple of times now but kabhi breaks everybody everybody the grapples with them coming down you know kevin has a higher takedown success right but khabib even against guys that are really good like dos Anjos he malls those great fuckers nineties people nuts a great fighter great ones like guy he's getting he's new to the game is 25 years old and so he when he finds he's smart it's cool taking Kevin Lee is smart is fuck done Kevin Kevin Lee khabib Damis the most interesting [Applause] Tony Tony could be I'd love to see that but I'd let's see Tony Nate Diaz but however with Tony being hurt so I don't put him in the discussion right now Kevin Lee khabees the fights fair that's surgery that that stitches decide the size of the fuck do you because I've never seen anything like that in my life is like a motorcycle accident whole LCL came off that poor dude I've never seen anybody it was horrible or horrific like surgical wound on their knee that's hard that's like some 1980 shit like when they used to have to open you up and like a suitcase and check and replace shit he's not a guy I'm worried about you know some guys when they get injured my car fuck yeah I'm not worried about Tony for some reason look at that though dude do you know how big that is that's a giant ass wound that looks like a 12-inch wound better reattach the whole thing that's a rare knee operation right there the fact that that happened while he was just walking and tripped is so fucking crazy that a guy with his kind of balance he must have been exhausted that's the only thing that makes sense he must have been just run ragged doing all these interviews and then like a peaky training just a freak accident way yeah I'm just making things out I don't know what the fuck happened fuck but it's such a bummer oh she's already trying I've talked about this before we should talk about it again he was not wearing sunglasses that was something he misspoke he said he was wearing prescription sunglasses to Ariel Helwani is that what he said yeah it was a mistake yeah so everybody's repeating this including me and Dana and all those other people we thought he was wearing sunglasses inside like he does when he does so stare downs it's not what was going on even if he was I don't sunglass it has nothing to do with it he just trip I don't care what people were mocking him oh really it's yeah it's you know especially when the guy is like would have fought anyways I know he was gonna fight anyway crazy in a good way he was he didn't care you guys remember pride when sakuraba would literally wrap his legs up like a mummy that's what Tony was gonna the doctors wouldn't let him so he went to two different doc but cubes not fine for a while because of ramadhan right I don't know you can't fight them two years Ramadan uh he's out for a few months because of his religion yeah yeah so then you do what Eddie operation oh boy who fought through Ramadan went through his training camp through Ramadan is Bilal Muhammad he figured out a way to do it and the way to do it is to nan drain it till nighttime make sure he eats first and then trains at nighttime but he did it well no he did it he did any fault well he just adjusted his new tribe camp I forget I don't remember who we flaw I'm saying that we'd have to watch a championship-level I would hold off to fun could be right I see what you're saying yeah I see reset but you can do it but I remember you thought a good guy remember who it was was interesting yeah he figured out his schedule he could pull it off yeah it can't be the best way to go back not the best way to go he's a bad I wouldn't do it if it wasn't for your religion there's no way to do it just be good for performance there's no way you would do it but you could do it you could be done because you just got to wait till dark right if I'm compete though I just yeah that's sundown it's not that it's not ideal yeah it's not ideal well it's fasting it is ideal apparently these days it's the best thing no but it but it's not the way first of all if you're gonna do it you wouldn't do it like that like you won't do it early you wouldn't do it like that and you you wouldn't you would do it where you stop eating and like 5:00 in the afternoon and then you would go off but at night if you do have like a long some people argue that's not good who argues that's not good well just from your from our human genetics that you can be hungry at night right so you don't get us good asleep yeah but it depends on what kind of foods you're eating that's a big part of what it is if you're eating a lot of refined carbohydrates you're gonna get really hungry at night for sure and you're gonna want to eat again but if you're on more of a fat based diet you could pull that off for sure 100% yeah you could pull it off for sure the real question is is that the best thing to do for physical performance and its most likely not say no yeah I don't think so we had Zack bitter in here the other day he's oh he weren't he off ready for this record this motherfucker ran a hundred miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes he was averaging a seven-minute mile ish for almost 12 hours he weighs four pounds yeah buck forty yeah he's but he's a very thin guy he's not a fat based diet he's on a keto diet essentially but when he goes to race he takes a lot of car behind no way done superstar Kevin super smart white dude really nice guy but imagine that shit happens you know strong your fuckin mind has to be strong your mind has to be to run 11 hours and 40 minutes yep the u.s. record us u.s. American record holds the record champions probably like or Mexicans Mexicans Mexicans can run marathons we don't play football or basketball but shit she didn't run for a long-ass time and they're the mountains of Mexico sinem and well that's what part of that book Born to Run that she lost mountains yeah those guys who ran like basically barefoot yeah Boyz N Da New Mexico - they're like the number one cross-country team all the Mexicans they're all the white kids Mexicans are really known for cardio it's very interesting heart heart endcard left hook look at the back look at the boxers leave the MMA fighters MMA fighters boxers yep known for cardio how about Julio Cesar Chavez motherfucker just was overwhelming he never stopped coming at you he was he was so beautiful when he was in his prime when he would throw combinations like to the body to the head uppercut step to the side right hand left hook right hand to the body he was just non-stop his volume was so impressive in his placement just a fucking amazing hey what's going on here 25 year old Russian wife Polly P oh wait what I hear Russian I assume you can't trust them I mean isn't Oh - oh sure for sure 100% 100% they just got busted what you watch it Christo you go I saw it well even when Zach was talking about the testing to the guy when Zach was talking to me about testing for these things he was he was kind of let on that one of the things that's different is the culture of the guys that run a hundred miles like it's not in the culture whereas like in the cycling culture it's a big part of the culture like everybody does it but in the that ultramarathon world is a brane world that's a world of like how much can you take like you can physically do it they're not doing anything crazy physically like Usain Bolt or someone who does not give a genetic right but there there are small no right I would love to do that yeah another side another fucking slob high level jiu-jitsu tonight's a very nice yes here without - um we were just saying what we just oh I seen those guys are small the genetic freaks I wish I could do it but I'm just too goddamn big yeah it's a shame well you'd have to lose weight I'm sure you'd have to dry yourself out no it's - I love it that much even when cam when he does like the big ones like when he did the Moab 240 he got down to - sick what - 160 rather 165 I think anything's a big dude usually weighs about 185 he might have got to 160 he might actually got right below 160 but he's so hardcore do you know how he did it he just worked out burned 4,000 calories ate 3,000 yes it was something hard to do I wish they would show that again but the way he set that arm bar up booze he remember the teepee we crossing ankles in you extend your legs instead of leg column will the extended him it put everything in there in a right angle and then he helps it over then he head yeah then he had to suggest a tutu thrown shit yeah do you know what I've been watching Vikings I can't get into Viking dude it's a good goddamn show you gotta get four episodes in way too complicated now that's our first episode of Mike shit what's going guys refresh any of the old ones before you started the new one because the preview is like three minutes long they kind of give you a good background of it I never basically the opening is all the the robots don't tell me anything okay don't tell me how dare you find out right away I'm just waiting for game of alert were you confused don't get confusing I'm for the first season was very confusing also it took a while to fit their say now what season are there now three second second they're saying it's so confusing the losing subscribers like ratings are just fucking - but how do they know it's one episode yeah it's just that I just read that bro it's a same thing you know what what I'm so just write shit like that just to be assholes I think today yeah I think maybe the writers confused so like everyone's confused you talked about it see how you talked not validated you talked about it because it's a thing that you want to here and go oh man look what's going on over there no I don't complicate my quest oh I heard they're losing subscribers maybe who's like oh that's if you're gonna sell magazines or an article and you want to peel to that mindset that we're just talking about earlier that's what you would write you're right Bob saying is that last thing I read was that on less world I don't watch West world people dig never watched it no you got to start from scratch I'm telling you it's a good show I know people love it man you can't do it I don't know seem like you're never gonna do it I talking right now like yeah yeah yeah I just said with game of thrones but then you guys talked me into a night that's my favorite show of all time there you go telling you do you think get season 1 of Vikings these dudes fuck people up it's fun what's the plan it's basically a historical reenactment of the Viking days based on a true story yeah the Ragnar lothbrok who was a real Viking a real shit listen to me man they wrote down every word they said all throughout the day his whole life so they got it they can read Viking you know who knows what the guy said and did but it's a really well-made show it's the acting is fucking amazing season I think they have five seasons what are they trying to do they're just trying to go from town to town dude I don't want to make don't want to fuck it up it's based on real sieges that they did with me a pattern where there is history he attacked England they way they attacked Wessex they killed a fuckload of people they showed up on boats and just jumped out with axes and you started fuckin up villages it's it's based on that barrack shit but it's really well done man I you know I was skeptical I never heard anything about it and someone was saying you gotta watch Netflix or Hulu no I got it on Apple it's probably on that foot it's a History Channel it was a History Channel show I just subscribed to it on iTunes I got that Apple what is it I home what is that shit called Apple TV yeah I heard frontiers good - it's about the fur trading business oh yeah with your boy the face of my mom yeah I heard it's really good - mmm Viking so hooked I'm hooked I just finished season three damn you're into it's fucking good man it's a good show it's one of those underrated shows he like how do I not know about this one I've heard about I'm just not Vikings or like clever that shit yeah you do like that I love that shit i watch Teen Mom does you guys watch wild wild country wild wild country it's a docu-series it's on that guy the the sex cult guy right yeah it's more of a it's like an Indian dude his his name is um he has like three different names but his his religion was half Buddhist half capitalist thank you could be spirit you can be spiritual but you want man live in luxury - yes yeah he could do both I'm in jail son he said he says I believe in luxury I believe we all should live in luxury but if you can't live in luxury I'm gonna live in luxury myself he's super pimped out all these rooms there make sure you so what happens they get kicked out of India so he has all these rich followers and they built a city in Oregon in the middle of nowhere they build this gigantic city in Oregon in the 80s and all these people from all over the world ended up moving there and the surrounding towns just like old white people they they go to war and that's what the documentaries about it's pretty awesome it's it's awesome it's not about that it's about him starting a new city with like tens of thousands of people in Oregon and they got all these old white people out there going what the fuck is going on so wasn't about a sex cult they you know they believed in free sex and all that stuff but doors but it wasn't it wasn't yeah focusing on that that it's more about a they had to find out of culture bad up the finances to literally build a high level city in the middle of nowhere and when did this all go down in the 80s okay I'm gonna watch it I'm gonna watch it uh I can't watch it this weekend it's really good it's really good man you won't regret that one okay beautiful the cult leaders always Chris mattock and they're always trying to fuck everyone wild did you start a cult why else why else what you just want everybody just listen to you know a bit and then you want the pussy direct come on every time called the personality and the type of person that would want to have all those people ladies and gentlemen we're going to move to Oregon we found a spot yes exactly white people from all over the world but they're rich I know someone whose family was involved in that oh yeah yeah get the good things about it no it did just seem to see how it all comes crashing down though that's that's the interesting part it's like how does it come crashing down because it's doesn't exist I don't know what the Mayans friend of Mines ex-girlfriend from like 20 plus years ago she grew up in that in that one in Oregon I think it's that what she was I'm pretty sure it's that one she's a freak I'd have to ask him I don't know how I bring that up bro watching this daughter wasn't your girlfriend yeah imagine that man imagine like you being in one of them cults and like being like 10 years old and like looking around going um what is going on why does the Maharajah keep fucking my mom like what's happening here you're not gonna grow up normal yeah you'll be pretty damaged um mom what are you doing well the sacred one brings to me blessings duty at all these Rolls Royces in the middle of Eastern or he would just want multiple like endless Rolls Royces fallen I believe in luxury the line is if I can't manage to make everybody live in luxury at least I can manage to live in luxury myself just wish it didn't didn't fucking our Kelly get in trouble recently they think he's running a call yeah yes kind of he has this sex life so he has one kinda well no what he does is he has one house where he stays then he has a next-door about the house he's a bunch of flock of bitches in there and so the parents of those kids are like he's holding hostage they're sex slaves he's taking away their confidence when really he's just you know pimpon pimpon pimpon pimpon our Kelly part of his inner circle resigned amid sex Pat allegations this today heard about the pets was last week this is a week oh my god it's not telling you about to hope high-profile women have resigned their roles after new revelations emerged in a BBC 3 documentary oh that's what we're talking about about that girl from a small village in the fuck like she's trying to recruit actresses to be in the sex cult when when did something wrong here when did she do is this from the past I don't I don't know that that's a news from the past a little bit but also no I think it's recent yeah if she was trying to get Emma Watson to join or something like that I don't know this is just stuff that's coming on the mainstream medium maybe it's all bullshit I don't know well she's going to prison why would she do that they would have they would have they had um they would have parties is this this thing that she was involved in at Richard Branson's Island look at this it says she's accused of being a leader in a pond awesome for a sorority a scribe young women who were manipulated into serving as slaves for male masters she's facing 15 years to life imprisonment on the charges of sex trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to commit forced labor okay now let me ask you this if you run into a bunch of girls okay say you're this girl and your thing is like being in a cult with one master who gets to fuck all these women who's who's to say that you shouldn't be into that if you're her right now and now who's to say if she goes and talks to a bunch of other girls and talks them into having sex with this guy why is that bad that's what I'm saying well she's your daughter to do it's not what you want your sister to do but we all know people that like getting tied up 100% we know people that like like smacking each other and like being so shit and like being well not really maybe slaves but whatever people like kinky shit let's just say that right they like kinky shit why is it that we can decide that that's too kinky well because is she bringing those girls there and then they're keeping them right that's the question if that's the case of course this excess force right there right if you scroll right but if you turn someone into your slave and you said slave you're gonna clean my kitchen and they're like yes master and this like part of some weird kinky shit you do yeah and then after they clean your kitchen then then you've mouth fuck them yeah if you just decided like give some weird weird like that right oh and some people like it some people like weird shit and then there's some people that get talked into joining a cult and they get talked into these horrible situations they actually do become sex slaves so how do you know which is which how do you know like which is a consenting of age adult who really loves being a part of some super kinky shit you know versus someone who's coerced into joining a sex cult and who is like held against their will like there's a line there right like they seem kind of similar from the outside but there is a line right I don't know what the fuck happened in this situation I literally don't know anything I do know I know what happens so she'd get these girls and then that you did get them naked and she would take pictures and hold it as a ransom or like if they didn't fuck the leader oh okay well I got dark just hit me I remember that that's why she's fucked okay thank good no but but it would be interesting we're talking about that other guy with all the money in the Oregon like if someone did that today like some are Kelly type guy I'm not saying are Kelly's a good guy I'm not saying what he's doing is legal but what I am saying is it is possible I don't think this is the case in this situation but just as a what if it is possible that you get together with a bunch of people who are really into that this slave dominatrix type deal like some people are really into being dominatrixes some people are really into being submissive and they get together like with it as long as it's men and women we have a problem with it right like if as long as it's some guys like a CEO that hire some mistress to kick him in the balls on them and do what happens we're totally cool how do people survive that that's a good question some people some people like getting kicked in the balls and kneed in the bones like repeatedly and as hard as you can no pays to come into this is some Club nice to work at and girls used to get paid - Nene's in the lap dance they would just need a shit out of their bones like honey I don't get it maybe that pain that feels like death to most people it feels different to other people that that's like a rush can you imagine if that when you get hit in the balls you know that intense pain it's not like my stomach yeah it's a unique pain but there might be people that take that unique pain and turn it into like just this high for you yeah yeah you're right those people that are into it I'm gonna watch that shit on YouTube Frank had a good point we came to fate or a timeout his losses when Cometh States saying how he never trains in a cage it's true it was the cage a factor in any of his losses because to realize to happen Henderson he couldn't get out of money the Henderson fight you can gather way in the Werdum fight maybe mmm the henderson fight race inside control the ring ring is a more fluid thing that's right the Henderson fight he had him inside control in Henderson and under him popped out with the under hook he wasn't careful with with the under hook he had inside control if you don't have that under hook and the guy on the bottom shoots the under can get the dog fights true front side control you don't even need quarter garter half guard but if I'm phaidor that's like a tennis player only playing on grass where he's gonna play on clay mm-hmm what the fuck you doing what the fuck is yeah yeah can you not finally got to him there was times where he didn't want to fight anymore so the question is is he fighting now because of money is he fighting now because there's no one else to do or is he fighting now because he's got a reignited feeling about competition and he likes it again dude go work security for Putin give very bro their bullshit that's a good that's a good call it's a good call he's your right-hand man fuck with failures there yeah I mean that would be I mean he's got to be a hero and rock dude did you think we were going to war with Russia teasing us with those as serious strikes no you never thought so not even for a second no I didn't think we're going to war with everybody thought I'm sorry I'm scared any time bombs drop though any time bombs you're opening up the possibility of bombs dropping back this is like you know I mean even if what happened with the people on the other side you dropping the bombs on deserve it it's still a holy shit we're in a fight you know any time that happens if you're not legitimately concerned that horrible things come out of it yeah but the idea of us going to war with Russia I'm like probably not but fuck man I'm just crazy house in New York for that I've got holy shit I don't know what is going on when it comes to foreign policy I would be a joke if I pretended which I have many times in my life you don't know I mean who the fuck knows what's happening with Russia or with China I've been talking about this Huawei thing Huawei is a big time cell phone or electronics company in Japan or in China rather okay and the State Department has recently recommended you don't buy huawei products and that they might be bad actors and you know spying on the people that own their phones so they they cancel deal with Huawei to be an AT&T and Verizon and all these other cell phones you know providers here in the United States and they they literally issued a warning I was like I've never heard of that before and then there was something about some sort of hacking that they think they did they're gonna take him to court prosecute him for something they did with Iran this is another thing about it but then I've heard people online say that they're suspicious that what this is is trying to squash China from entering the electronics market it's like the top three people in cell phones or Apple Samsung and Huawei is number three worldwide it's a thing to stop Huawei in America would be like an economic thing because they're worried about China increasing the amount of money they have who can you believe yeah well you know um if you're interested in following QA naan a lot people analyzes drops but there's a YouTube channel called just informed just inform something just informed but he breaks it down everyday he talks about all that stuff so it's all interesting because you got to know that if just important to me is that big and here's the thing that the super dorks like Jamie and I've been going back and forth about this because the super dorks online I say that with all due respect the dudes who really understand cellphones they're calling bullshit because they're like if they were spying on you these guys who develop apps and to understand phones these these like super type dudes they would be able to find the code another percent they'd be like you this shit's spying on you it's listening to you here's what the code this is what it's doing microphone set to one set it to zero yes I've heard is as good as the Russian hackers are wherever in the world the best are in America whatever they can do we can find best everything what the fuck it is America we're best at suck America drop a bomb merica eating steak american dragon beer Marik Frank Mir just informed talk is the YouTube channel that breaks down queueing on if you're interested it's really good it's very interesting predictions for this fight it's a good question man I think they're both at very similar places in their career which is one of the reasons why this fight is interesting Frank's been out for a hot minute sometimes when you get in there and you've had long layoffs just say fuck and throw caution the wind so this could be super quick why did Frank get released from the UFC what happened do we know didn't he do some tests positive he test positives last one how long ago was that was a while ago he got fired for he got yeah as a commentator wanted to kill Brock Lesnar yes literally kill him yes fair enough he was a really good commentary great calm Taylor who was really good it's Compton out for ACB what's ACB like that that Russian league oh okay yeah he's the head come to I don't seem interesting interesting but Frank's last fight he got knocked out by Mark Hunt and then they'd let him yeah remember when he knocked out Todd Duffee though Oh whew that was crazy great frontier still showed in that fight that against dangerous guy like Duffy Frank's fall in love with his box and men hate here and then well I mean he's a smart dude if you if you you got to think his digits are still on point he's so smart yeah he's very smart very well read him and Josh Barnett I think do smart heavyweights that I've ever met it's a good call Josh Barnett is very smart very cerebral that was a good fight yep Josh Barnett Mir I'm a Josh Byrne had him against the fence he was had great head position and for Josh what does that yeah yeah that's right it's a great fiery judgment was a five rounder wasn't it I believe it was five I can end it pretty quick no Josh what is that oh no no no I'm thinking of another top speed as Josh beat his ass and knocked him out with a knee right yeah Josh yeah fuck them on fucked him up I'm thinking of another fight where Josh went five hard rounds was it against DC you ain't broken in no no no he beat somebody in a very impressive fight oh it was Roy who's big country oye took him down yes they kept he kept taking down yeah that was it that was a long two shit out of Roy and it was a long fight right wasn't it like a fire boys I don't know five rounds three rounds of an ass-whooping though see if you find that problem is a monster he's a bad motherfucker he's a bad mother him and frankly the most cerebral I think that's why Travis Brown's elbows are so fucking impressive that he put him out he because josh out that's weird when josh rushed him to salt gonzaga get stopped like that and he did the same thing I think he got clipped with a punch before he brought and then I think if I remember correctly I don't remember correctly but I remember those fucking elbows week to this day we call that position the Travis Browne yeah is he done Josh no sorry I don't know um Josh Barnett and Roy Nelson he has a five round yeah five rounds I don't fight no no I'm sorry fight made a main event yeah yeah that's nice yeah it was a bleeding man was cardio and he would pass roids going like yeah dude Frank does not look fat Frank's Jack why did I see I saw a photo must been from in the past where he was heavy like maybe while like there setting this fight up because like looking at him now he looks very flex great he looks very fit he's in stood with me I talked to man you look shredded he's like I'm ready to go wow I'm impressed he does look very fit so he must have been heavy when he started camp since well oh he's really heavy that's what he didn't fight for a little bit so you know he's been commentating trying to rush interesting here here we go there's only three rounds they don't do five round main event so only title fights here we go what do you think about that I can't agree with that yeah I'm not mad at it I like five rounds three rounds that goes to quick I like five round 20 smaller weight classes it's a good point my thing would be men that five round fights are beatings man I mean you really in trouble well he's surviving now Frank he didn't have the underhook right there again that's why Frank stood up this is phenomenal if its own it's over that's it dad what a war damn you ready for this phaidor Chael Sonnen Snax oh my god sinking oh my god oh my god yes fine that fucking color that can happen Wow Frank Mears you know and he almost had him it was Frank almost had him what a great throat that is a great fucking fucking hope to us huh that was beautiful that bottom sometime to fade or Chael Sonnen Wow when was the last time fate or one knows or not oh but he really lost it when she lost yeah so he flew let's I agree what he wanted but he lost it so let's let's take I was in Russia right yes let's take that one out of the equation Ishi dan that's right Satoshi Ishii was his last fight his retirement fight in his last run and then he decided to come back after that it is look at this boy he's all wild and loose huh boom wait the left both both hands down damn what clutch this must be all right there the left hand right on the chin Oh boom boom this is a crazy hard shot just swing in there swing it why I'm just going oh shit I feel like he caught him earlier than that to just that was that was the big one the one that really hurt him perfect stoppage god damn there it is oh it was the left perfect left hand that was nice it's crazy this is faders first win in take out the Maldonado fight she's how many years then I'm here it's been a rough go for my men when was a she you got beat sing my brain goes no that was when fifteen New Year's Eve 2015 he also be Pedro his Oh on January 21st 2012 that was yeah 2012 was after the 2012 oh yeah the the Pedro his Oh fight was a crazy knockout man I must have been in Europe something I grew a leg kick and then faked a leg kick and landed a punch phaidor started out against I mean a guy we think about who's got better leg kicks and Pedro his m1 it was a Russian fight it was a ruthless knockout man see if you can find one one two three pull up Pedro his own versus phaidor do you notice if you notice anything of faders record there so he went on that fight fight winning streak it's none of its in the States before that three Lawson States comes back States loses is this his first win in the States yeah maybe Brett Rogers was his first this was a this was look at that boom boom he threw a leg kick and before that did you was this the whole fight or just a highlight get edited they edited that yeah the video c30 Jesus he's still explosive he hit him with a leg kick first and then he faked the leg kick and came in with that punch came in that right hand then left took behind it he's crazy yeah he's still explosive man oh yeah man tonight he was explosive look he's still he's still fuckin phaidor I mean he still he's a legend for sure but you tap him in the jaw and he'll go down like a regular guy he is a regular guy in that regard now all the fights d-town all the wars the fact that he's in his late 30s right how old he won he's 41 I'll tell you a fight I'd love to see that some never happening so it's stupid for me to say it Francis in gone and phaidor oh my god why would you want to see that because they both just slang them bangs how do you think that fight would go I think I think Francis knocked his head into Russia yeah or Brock Lesnar phaidor if I had if I had like a Willy Wonka golden ticket just gave it to you and I gave it to you I would say Brock Lesnar versus whoo whoo Bob France and the poster is just old school would be so sick I like that I like that let's think about Brock can win if he lands a takedown but good luck not getting clip coming in such a dynamic fight it's a nice scene phaidor win man I gotta say I mean I love Frank Mir I'm a Frank Mir fan and somebody had to win she's kind of nice okay door I like it I like that a lot at the biggest fight Bellator history it's a very good fight man it's a very good fight and Chan's gonna talk some mad shit himself fighting more he just just off his name that's what Frank was saying goes dude the media tour I have to do everything Pharaoh refuses to do interviews now yeah well I get it it doesn't speak English yeah figured out the new fans like who who well they know him now I see I think even amongst the the new fans this is like I mean he's essentially like a Reggie Jackson type character if you know those ball you know who Reggie's even if you don't know a lot about them you know who Reggie Jackson but if you're new to the sport like this guy's the best of all times seen this stuff but they don't realize this pride days well you got to go back and watch the first nogueira fight finest or you know even the Kevin fight when he got clipped the Kevin Randleman is a great one suplex and then just a few moments later catches his arm nasty yeah very very very interesting she's been translating for fate order for 24 ever just fly sir in yeah maybe that's his girl she goes out back she puts a make America great again hat on they can surf a doors locker for she's wearing the manager I would make everybody a camp where it just for the press me too I'd put it on man he's the president knighted States what's the fucking problem yeah we're Natalia Kanye okay but I mean come on man how good would that be if all of faders camp including phaidor had those red Mogga hats on yeah that shit would be hilarious it would go trolling no bad if they were trolling tell you white man your boy Mitrione I mean that's a giant win for him that was a giant win when he ko fatal well now Matt fights the winner of Bader King mo that's a tough fight tough fight it's a tough fight for Matt Matt you know if he's got an issue at all it's not in his footwork or his knockout power his movement it's if the fight goes the ground it was wrestling here we go I want to hear what she has to say bring this shit up Jamie look at it say somebody being Russian his track so old-school yeah it's very pro wrestler it's just not very good how and that's all the russian thing in this be this damn chill son is pretty fucking big yeah fader is a small dude as far as the heavyweight goes yeah very interesting god I thought you know I expect more chill I thought you liked it one thing I hate more than being this cage do it's a Russian in this gauge it pulls out a Mega Man when is a fighter gonna come out with her I mean is there ever been a time where you get more shit for liking the president never Nev not even close not even close I mean at the very least even if you didn't want him to win now that he's the president would you not want him to succeed what do you want why if he succeeds it means we succeed you want everything to be a catastrophic failure because your guy didn't win or do you want him to get better at the job and be really good at what he does and be the best president that he can be and pull a bunch of shit look what he did with North Korea what's up with that with both North Korea and South Korea giving Donald Trump all the credit that's amazing on CNN he that alone shows you that his unorthodox style that might you might be terrible if you're married to him or terrible if you're doing business with them or terrible if you're as lawyer or terrible whatever but that unorthodox style might have value to it but no one wants that value because you don't want them to win it's a fucking weird time it's like Rudy it's almost like you're rooting against America because you feel so strongly about the pros rather have like to your point would you rather have him out you want the economy better when doing he's the other thing you want Mike Pence to be president are you sure you don't know what you just said you don't know what you're saying like that is not a smart choice that's not what you voted for it's not what you want what you should want is even if you don't like Donald Trump what you should want is that he does a great fucking job he turns the economy around he goes after child pedophiles he goes after like whatever whatever fill in the blanks whatever thing you would like him to do even if he talks crazy shit about and it gets on Fox and Friends and says a bunch of nutty shit wouldn't you still want that guy to do the best job running the country this is where things get weird cuz I think most people say no I think in if they say yes they're lying they wanted they want them to fail they want them to be the worst ever do they that's what they want that's what they wants a flaw that's that's a crazy way it's not look I didn't vote for Donald Trump but I want him to do great because he's the fucking president like either someone else comes along that's better and wins and takes over or why were you why would I want everything to go bad even if I didn't vote for so retarded everybody if you have you had a doctor this is a good example not know me but maybe it sucks but if you had a doctor and the doctor was a dickhead the doctor is fucking annoying but he had to fix your knee but you know he's the best at fixing knees but this guy's a dick and I hope he fucks my knee up only hurting you is the only guy can do this operation you gotta listen to me I know the guy's an asshole let him operate on your knee he's gonna do a great job he's gonna talk shit he's gonna try to fuck your mom but he's gonna do it no job here's a video I mean get people that hate Trump accuse him of being racist and there's a video of Ice Cube 50 cent Shaquille O'Neal like five or six celebrities and now Kanye West that they don't think he's racist to go out Donald Trump was badass he's a he tells it like it is the question is like was he when he talked about Mexicans on the campaign trail was he playing to people that are white supremacists and what does he understand that he has a base and those people and does he defend that base that was about Charlottesville to correct because he was saying that on both sides there's there's problems on both sides all the protesters and the KKK you gotta just and sometimes and he was right there was problems on both sides but they were there because of a white supremacy rally and the most important point is that that alone is a ridiculous way to think and that as Americans we can't tolerate someone who only likes people that come from the same part of the world as them or people that only have the same color skin is them or the white race or the pure race because that's stupid it doesn't even fit up with what we know about IQ standards if we really wanted the master race we would be all trying to be Asian correct okay because they dominate in IQ to the point where they're suing Harvard right now there's Asian does an Asian American group that's suing Harvard because the standards for Asians to enter Harvard more stringent than even white people they're harder because they're better because they get they get in more because their brains work better than yours like right but see this is not this is not a popular narrative you know people don't talk about this but but no one no one's saying that you know so if you're if you're out there saying that the white race is superior you're not even paying attention to the facts this no but you got supremacy sure but the white supremacists do and they want a general population thing that Trump thinks like that - there's that's not true there's no evidence that he understands that he has a base and that his base is white people there's a big part of it is white people that are fed up about political correctness white people that are fed up about being said the races just because they're white and he knows lack people that want to hand out like there's a lot of races that have welfare problems that people that are on welfare they're taking our money and they're taking our jobs there's a lot of that going on and he knows that those people there's a percentage of those people that I'm sure support him so you gotta be real careful there sandy plays for that side yeah but no one's saying he's got there's any evidence that he's like that but he did say racist shit about Mexicans right when he was talking about how they rape and murder and like that you know like someone's doing the rape the crime well the crime control but he's not being honest about that okay so if if one that's obvious that he's trying to win right cuz if he's being honest about that what he would say is the reason why there's so much crime is because drugs are illegal if we made drugs legal we could sell these drugs to these people in America would be run by businesses instead of being run by the mob the demand is undeniable it's undeniable there's a demand for cocaine marijuana drugs there's also a demand for alcohol there's also a demand for plenty of things that are bad for you in America Zr ones you go about go buy a 770 horsepower Corvette zr1 that goes 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds and just drink all the fucking red bulls you want get on the highway and stop the gas and you're in a spaceship that's crazy - it's all crazy so is doing heroin you probably might die more driving a zr1 like an asshole than you would be doing coke but your offs gonna kill more people in those the other ones you might look you might look there's a lot of ways people could fuck up their life and other lives around them that are absolutely legal we just make this decision that once something is illegal like drugs and I don't think you should do coke I don't think you should do heroin but I don't think you should look though I don't think you should fucking drink to your debt either and people are doing that every day we're we're hypocrites in that regard and this idea that the only reason why these people were over there raping and murdering is because they're Mexican that's the differences he said that's what they're saying it's only Mexico someone over there is doing it but why are they doing it I'll tell you why and you know why you're doing it because drugs are illegal that's how the cartel makes their money wall what do you think about building a wall you shouldn't build a wall you shouldn't have secure borders we should do is help Mexico we should we should figure out some way and one of the best ways to help them would be make drugs legal could be one of the best ways to stop the cartel another one would recognize that what what Mexico is just like like how is Mexico in terms of like the amount of distance how are they as close as they are to us not us but New York is us you can get to New Mexico in two hours dude you could drive to Mexico from LA in two hours but that's not a country I'm in US but we decide that Maine is us that shit is way the fuck over there these people are attached to us they're right there they're connected you could walk there it's not outrageous to have more mess sources nations are ridiculous nations are ridiculous they don't want one world government no not even a government man we should have rules that we all agree on our problems are as the ball teams go against other teams but if we're all on the same team then we compete against each other economically the way we do in cities it's why we don't have wars in cities we don't have city wars right the reason we have wars with other countries because we think of each other as being on another team there's crime in cities but there's crime in countries what we really need is to abandon this idea that we're all in these fucking tribes and I'm not saying I support one side or the other but when Trump was saying that isn't a lot of violence's from the Mexican cartels and stuff in America and the some of it yeah a lot Midori it's 100% real but it's propped up by drugs and until you address the root of what gives them money and causes the violence and I that's true nonsense so the primitive way to approach it is to say this team is gonna go against that team so we're gonna put up a wall to keep that team from coming over here that's not gonna help they're still you want to look at the entire future of people the entire future it's eventually gonna come to a point where there's gonna be an easy way you know there's there's they have these pixel and the Google pixel phone they have these earbuds that allow you to translate someone's language in real time so if you were talking to me in Spanish I could hear through these earbuds for the Google pixel phone the pixel to and it would translate so I could go to Mexico I could talk to some cat who knows Spanish he and I could talk and he could I could understand what he's saying it's gonna come a point in time where that is way simpler in language it's gonna be all the same language and then it's like why is why is there a war with Mexico and not a war with North Dakota why why am I not on the same team as someone in fucking Tijuana which is right there why am I not not just like those people why are we on different teams says who says why what benefit is that this is some old-school shit that we only need it because he didn't know what the fuck people were doing because it was like Vikings they would show up and both start raping and murdering territory but they're not doing that to the people that are in their village right they're not doing that to each other well they do it because they think people are the other so this idea of the other and the idea of the tribe it's an outdated idea it's an outdated idea that it maybe it's not time it's times not done now but it's time is done in a hundred years or a thousand years the future is people just people it's not Germans versus the French versus the Russians versus the Italians that shit is retro it's stupid it's just like it's just like tribes have fucking ancient hominids just sneak it in when they didn't even speak languages and clubbed at each other and raping each other and doing all the shit that people have done forever plus California Arizona and Texas were Mexico how about California's trying to separate into three spots I know yes it's gonna be on the ballot it's gonna be on the ballot and what 2020 so what it is big this wins what happens there's gonna be South North Central South really there's gonna be LA it's gonna be one that's gonna be like California and then there's gonna be like Southern California like San Diego way up to like you know a Bakersfield or some shit it makes sense though if you're gonna go off the old game plan the old map it makes it so big this is why I make taxes if you drive from LA to San Francisco you drive through Kentucky I don't know how it happens but the the you drive by god is great signs and don't have abortions here's a doctor this is Jesus loves you it's farmland it's not what you think it is and it's nothing wrong with Kentucky I'm talking about late it's rural it's real beautiful yeah it's but it's rural yes farmland like there's a big part of California that's farms yeah but isn't it isn't it the the south is the one struggle in the north is killing it right no it's political man it's all political right but it's not that anybody's killing it it's that the the cunt they don't feel represented see there's more people in San Francisco and in Los Angeles by far than the rest of the state but the state is huge like you know it takes you drive from everybody thinks that San Francisco's Northern California the fuck it is there's a there's hours of Drive until you hit northern how many hours did it take to drive from San Francisco to Oregon do I want to say four is it four I think so I'll say three somewhere I'll say a little bit more I'm gonna say two fly-half I'm gonna say two and a half hours was it's a jam okay I'm sayin for stickin to four you might be right I'm just guessing but it's a it's a grip of space five hours five hours see there's a lot of fucking space up there and those people are all rural it's like that's where like the Green Emerald triangle is and Humboldt and they're growing all the fucking we the beautiful it's beautiful up there it's like a rain forest should I've been to many many parts of Northern California it doesn't even remotely resemble Southern Cal hell no so these people don't feel represented LA's all goofy it's just you know that they feel like this is just some liberal delusional hotbed and they also don't like a lot of the laws the laws and in regards to wildlife management or the taxes like that if you listen Sacramento wiping the same taxes someone that lives in Malibu yes the taxes are off the charts here they were saying that five hundred thousand people this year gonna move out of California in New York because of taxes just because of taxes a city wasn't more than if you live in Oxnard should be paying the same taxes own that's not a beachfront property no fucking way how fucked up is that no for it makes no sense but you aren't you paying more if you live in Malibu because you're paying more you make more money so you're higher percentage of your property you know your property is worth more so you should be a high fuckin object to live in California rates ridiculous crazy well you know also it's raucous when we realize you don't have to pay that rate if you go other places like I know guys who've moved what's the best day for Time Lord is pretty good Texas Florida is good if you have a business you know I know guys that have businesses that move to Florida because if they sell their business they don't wanna pay thirteen percent to the government yeah in California and they can't take there's a lot of places we don't pay state tax Washington you know pay state tax Nevada you don't pay state taxes might be I think this this what I'm reading right now says this is not just a plan to split the state it's the split away from the United States no I believe in luxury yeah that's not happening so that's a Florida text the big one were the business people people want to save their money the United States is fascinating in a way that you could find out where the laws are best for you and you go look we're just gonna fucking take a chance and move to Montana you know you live in Montana you're living in a place with like three million people instead of thirty million people you live in a place where you're like a butt it up against the fucking Yellowstone Park and looking at mountains you shit at night is it true that you could take the world's population and fit them all in Texas all in their own house is that true that's really true that's true how crazy is the Texas is giant well but we're talking about all of China and all of Africa in Texas with everyone else there's some things there's something about Texas where that true yeah that sure amount of European countries you fit in Texas it's kind of crazy the whole world can fit into yes you with their own house yes everybody with their own age that seems unbelievable eight billion people in Texas in their own house eight billion houses in Texas well you know Texas is a different state man it's not like any other stare Alaska to look you could do the same thing in Alaska everyone lived in a 10 by 10 room yeah well Alaska is the biggest and Texas is the second-biggest right isn't it yeah so doesn't it seem if that's if that's the case then the overpopulation is a myth it's gotta be no it's not a myth because it's about the resources in space you could jam everybody in Texas but it would be like Mad Max you'll be funneled still empty and the rest of the world is you down to grow food in the rest of the world and people would be sucking it out truckloads be on top of each other I don't know no overpopulation is not a myth Eddie no overpopulation screwed everybody in Texas it's a myth no no no here's the thing first of all it's not sustainable this is the problem with overpopulation right now we're okay if we just kept this number the human race could survive the real problem is we're not keeping this number son though this number is gonna grow this number was two billion whatever the fuck it was in 1950 and it's seven billion now the reason we're having less kids now I have so many friends in the forties that have no kids countries that's one of the things about the rest of the world they're out breeding us know radically well not in Japan there's there's been studies every time I'm on a plane I see emptiness in barren wasteland everywhere I go I don't see like over situation I see emptiness everywhere I'm Betty has a point where people and you fly over the country but there's places where you can't grow shit Betty but you're flying over Nevada you're looking down a gross shit so we could grow shit you gotta look what they did with Vegas is they tricked everybody to thinking you could live in Nevada don't they fucking fuck made that they made Henderson they made Vegas they basically build these places in a place they shouldn't have built places they found they had a crazy rule they could do whatever the fuck they want they're this the lawsuits what's weird about Nevada is Nevada has two weird things one nuclear testing they did a fuckload a nuclear testing you see the fucking there's a map or a video rather that shows you the map of the earth and it shows you all the nuclear bombs they set off in Nevada and you just like Macaulay Culkin's I'm not allowed by the end of the video like what have you do you remember those old nuclear test videos or they show like a building and then like I like this hurricane of nuclear energy going through it like what everybody remembers knows right now how did they film that they set cameras up how cameras know how they had to be see as they've said what kind of cameras are those listen they're very far away when all this shit is going down and here's the scariest thing is not those buildings in the glowing hearts they because they got hit so hard the scariest thing is the ones when you see the bombs in the distance that miles away and these guys out there they jump up at the the shit goes over their head they're in these ditches and they jump up and run towards it cuz they didn't know shit about radiation back then so they had these soldiers practice what the idea was that you had dropped the nuclear bomb on people and then they would run towards the bomb because the people would be so fucked up and disoriented that you just take over the city Jesus Christ but meanwhile these people are running right into radiation growing like three eyeballs you can shock people in Vegas aren't born with three heads what's not Vegas some are it still it's close to Nevada is big Nevada is big yeah but those nuclear test sites are not that far from Vegas where if they're blowing up these nuclear bombs all the time people in Vegas should be growing fucking three dicks for the next 1,000 years well you know there there's a story about John Wayne that John Wayne was filming a movie no I we're gonna need you on this one Jamie the John Wayne was filming a movie in like the nineteen fifty whatever the fuck it was he was doing those westerns and that during that time they were in an area where they were doing tests nuclear tests and everybody on that movie set got cancer everybody say that again what is it was it say there the movie so toxic it killed John Wayne the tragedy of the Conqueror yeah that was about him wasn't no no I don't know that movie killed them I mean how would they know well people getting cancer all the time no but I think a bunch of people got cancer or we're getting cancer from the polio because of them got it did you know that that like a million people is a vaccine from the polio I don't even know if this is a true you know that you know that you've heard that yes I don't know if this is a true story I need two instructions knowledge - how am i dropping no knowledge I'm sorry I'm keeping it fun today I know it's good point you're flying a flight nomination no Lucius it's the prayer things you'd have to turn all that shit into farmland to feed those people big that you don't know about that I don't know just dirt yeah if it's just dirt there's definitely room the question is for how long and how much how many people can you feed off that dirt like if you're in Nevada how many farms are in Nevada was it conquer what does it say scroll up conquer filmed on a nuclear test site good move yeah Howard Hughes the director and Bill Powell knew of the dangers and had assurances from the Atomic Energy Commission that it was safe but apparently terrible it's so terrible [Music] [Laughter] hold on what does hey Jamie a lot of people got cancer on the set Wow how many people 90 of the 220 person crew did 46 those people died some of the all the main actors apparently all died of cancer within 25 years of the movie coming out whoa you might be able to say that about any movie know so many people died of cancer isn't cancer than no don't kill all the doesn't the cancers out there hi great dude that's not like mood this like go back Jurassic Park everyone's still alive yes that mummys mom you know there would be a lot of people like now even today these nuclear bombs were going off in the 50s it's 56 who's always a conspiracy guy doesn't recognize this conspiracy but these dummies didn't understand what the fuck they were doing that's not a conspiracy that is conspiracy up about this was that that's that's mainstream right there that stuff works calm that's as mainstream as you can get what does that mean you know what's mainstream the JRE this is mainstream is fuck hell yeah this is mainstream is fuck now he download the day what does this mean what does mainstream mean it doesn't mean it's not real because I'm saying this was a conspiracy theory and I'm like no no that's not what I said I said the conspiracy to keep this quiet the fact that the government's nuclear tests most likely killed John Wayne and a shitload of actors from fucking cancer in the desert they were dropping bombs not knowing what the fuck they were doing and there's plenty of evidence that they didn't know what the fuck they were doing if you watch the videos of old nuclear test site with soldiers running towards the blast you ever seen those yeah fucking insane looks like it looks like I don't know just like all that old footage looks like it doesn't look authentic it looks like they faked all that shit what about I don't know I you know there's a conspiracy theory that that nuclear bombs actually don't exist that they never actually figured it out but they realized that the threat of nuclear bombs is good enough Eddie you can see the bomb that their ever see the one where they drop the bomb in the ocean and they didn't know how much of a blast it would create but all I'm saying how do you know this is just a regular powerful bomb like how do you know how do you know by watching a bomb go off how do you know it's nuclear if you love the nuclear test I don't know what a nuclear bomb looks like when it blows up I don't know irregular no listen we have things that can test nuclear you say how do you how can you tell I know if you can do tattle you can do tests with those insured I've never done those like you you can't I don't know I'm saying I don't know I know but I'm saying I don't know but I'm telling you you how can people look at a bomb you're saying someone else figured it out how can you look at a bomb and tell shit the wrong way it was really do no I'm just saying if there was a videos of 20 bombs going off would you be able to pick out the nuclear bombs Eddie they make these giant mushroom clouds they're very unusual it's not like a regular bomb I'm not saying that video is a bomb the ocean how can anybody tell like a regular question I think you should probably talk to a nuclear physicist I'm just asking the question what I know but to question it like it's not real is ridiculous they killed how many fucking people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima shit how do you know watch this watch this bomb there's still half look at this I don't know how do you know if that's a bomb that that is the craziest amount of power you could ever imagine I could never imagine something that can blow the ocean on the my nail into the sky okay and that's just one video of it there's another one of those videos where they do it from a distance where you look at the water where it's falling from I get see if you can find one do you understand it could be a nuclear bomb I'm saying all I'm saying I get how can you know for sure look at that how can you know how many whales died in this Oh everything died everyone they all the fish they made some tuna salad out of that motherfucker yeah all the fish are fun look at the water come down how crazy that is what that boats fucked though huh look at that look at that yeah I don't know if what that is I don't know look at that that's high that's big but I don't know why question tensional bombs it's well with different cuz Eddie's Eddie Sam the reason why they threatened nuclear bombs keep everyone kind of chill but we want to have the they did already dude that dude that would wipe out a fucking city but maybe you could do that with just regular conventional bombs maybe just maybe that's like okay okay what I'm saying is I don't know right well you should find out I don't know my this is this is a nuclear bomb okay and the scientists all agree there's no conspiracy conspiracy is amongst idiots these people that are talking about it online they literally have no idea what they're talking about and they're spread I don't know I'm saying I don't I understand you don't know but don't even bother question it's a waste of time it's a so you're going down a rabbit hole for no reason you waste all this time how do you know how do you know how do you know I don't know what do you mean I could way I could waste my time on whatever why I'm so concerned why are you so concerned about me wasting money because you waste our time too why why don't you want to find the answer to it why do you just want to question that you could look up look up yeah you could look up anything it's not going to look up if you literally want to know the answer to this particular question you could look it out now no no no I'm not no no you could go to college okay you could get a professor you could find any number of people that have the answers could show you how to study them could prove the test to you could lay it out could give you all these instructions so you could go do it on your own without anybody I don't care about it that much then why then why again then just just in question I just don't trust anything I can't verify for myself but you don't have to get mad you can take that why you mad because that you're getting mad right now shit from the government you can verify this you just said you can't but you can that's that's the issue on some of these things with science they are have you verified it yes they're fine I went to fucking physics class and what at college I got an A okay so that proves they own it today works I quit college I didn't keep going down the nuclear klutz farther in than physics 111 and 112 at Ohio State they don't give it to the freshmen damn I guess high level state that's it I mean if you want the answers you can go get them it's not just question this is why it's frustrating because you don't want the answers you just want to question everything that the in air quotes government says we do so angry not it's frustrating why because being flattered because nuclear bombs being fake because dinosaurs not being real those things are crazy they're a giant waste of time for who for us more time to talk about something else okay but you will like talking about those things hey I didn't bring up nuclear bombs you guys did I didn't bring it up but you really argued it for a while I'm just bringing up questions and you're getting angry not angry Eddie okay good do you hear me being angry right now you guys sounded angry said you were frustrated Frost frustration it usually is is in there with anger anger I'm just saying it the the the one fun point Eddie was making is like man I don't know nuclear science or anything like that so how do we know those atom bombs a real computer regular bomb there's a fun conversation that's it just makes up your fucking calves Jamie same 7:00 tomorrow morning turning game 7 you can look into a lot of this stuff and you can't find the answers that's all that's my only point and when you're talking over me that's where the frustration comes from that's it you're angry I'm not angry angry at me telling people did not get angry you using that as a defensive tactic because he's making a good point because I'm saying people are angry okay you you got you say it's frustrating so as I say it's my angry because you don't believe in the government you're angry I don't trust the government you could say that we can say why are you angry I said I do say that no we could say that thank you we could say why you angry that doesn't get anybody anywhere we're just talking about the reality of these facts you guys can believe whatever you want all right I will okay I believe everything I've been taught and learned go right ahead I think that isn't frustrating me I don't care what you think what am i am i wrong then no you could believe whatever so why would you continue to question it hey Brennan that's a nice shirt hey flowers floral is in right now like alive track if you go

listen to him I want to show these how can you chew he got like show me by Jimmy boy and I'm saying he flexed up on that one but I want to make a public service announcement for these past couple days I seem like there's a couple females that are trying to expose me as I'm sitting like there's a lot of you like I can't even name sir is a lot of you know like have a little bit more respect for yourselves and I say that in a way because you need to get past that it was just like a one day thing you know hope you like what the f-- where did you find that go to Home Depot is this music good I never know I've listened to clips of like you know and second you nuts I'm old enough now where I don't know you'd have to it's not for me go to Home Depot people are loving it they're eating it up skewed or dude it's fucking you'd have to call the doctor you'd have to get a psychiatrist I can't we can't play it'll get us take it off for you to okay I can't I can't afford that anymore it might be great you never know so here's my question if this is ridiculous right what is what is the next thing after the shit look at this mother floss robot damn this guy is ninja in the shit there's stuff it's hard good guy piss we still looking for a while we'll keep going look at this motherfucker on Ninja Warrior man I'm super impressed with the way this dude is traversing this I think there are people that call cultural appropriation on this Takeshi 6:9 guy oh really what are they commenting on everybody making I don't know this I don't know who's behind him either like the managers are behind him and there's a couple other guys that are making a shitload of money I have is it oh is it a producer project is it my planned did they pluck this guy go okay this is perfect for our like he'd have to really get a God it's one a tattoo his face you know I mean that's some fucking that crazy right now so many people have tattooed faces got some serious commitment tattooing your mug millions of dollars yeah but I mean it might not work and you're stuck with 69 big days like an asshole think they probably might wait until they get that first big check and I maybe didn't did he wait I don't know about him particularly there's a controversy between is he a blood or is he a Crip and he's claiming he's both because I'm friend with both of them something like that but he wears an awful lot of red so people think that he's a blood what a weird weird work at it off you shut it off stop we can't do this anymore Jamie he makes me watch this guy all the time Jamie's got his thumb on the pulse of the straight he tells me I follow him on Instagram I find a fascinating love so shows me these girls with giant butts that's he knows a box oh no real ones real ones real job you can tell they're not because of the diaper but caper butt is our thing that looks real that's real it's fuck dude Jesus Christ that makes me uncomfortable it's hot in here you know what see here's a fascinating thing the ass was not a big deal for a long time for a long time you go back to like Lynda Carter and Wonder Woman you never saw her ass ever an ass was not a thing man yeah asked Farrah Fawcett you never saw Farrah Fawcett's ass right now but now if a girl's gonna be a hot chick she's got to have a banging ass yeah but girls like in a movie as a hot chick there's gonna be a point in the movie where you see her in a pair of tight jeans you go whoa Yeah right yeah the next a lot said that like we needed big but I like I think we probably big but definitely it was definitely a moment but always in the Mexican community and the black community we were always into big butts we didn't need we didn't need society to tell us that we didn't know what the hell was there just like like if scientists grandmas in the future and they're studying the size of asses they'd be like well there's a noticeable jump in women's asses a certain point time in the 20th century look what is that I saw this documentary once called the history of sex it was on the Science Channel or something was a five-part documentary and they were getting into why we we like certain things from the opposite sex and the but apparently the reason well obviously like tits we like tits if they're big like we'd like them because we know baby they're gonna be able to feed the baby right so we get endorphin rush big because a woman can have birth give birth easier so you're attracted to that symmetry according to this documentary the fat in the butt during the third trimester of pregnancy that's when the brain develops and and the brain is developed from fat from the ass according to this documentary so I guess we're looking at big round asses first smarter babies evolutionary that's what the documentary said I don't you know who knows well they definitely know the shape of a woman that's attractive to us is because that's the most fertile women the women that's gonna be most likely to hold a baby to term and raise the child and that's why all those qualities that you liken him like what a lot of men are really attracted to nurturing women and you really attracted to a woman who wants a cookie dinner you know woman who wants to like give you a massage like to a lot of guys that's a big deal because that's like a nurturing type woman that would be not just that way to you but that way to your children too we're talking about why scientifically are men into business we're also talking about how back in the day asses weren't a big deal with Farrah Fawcett you never saw Farrah Fawcett ask Wonder Woman Marilyn Monroe no scurvy yeah it was verse Kurt nobody which wasn't sticking their ass out all right she's curvy though well you know where it might have happened you know what Jayla member beata guerra yeah before they miss but she was famous just for her ass that's true just grasp with no internet no internet dude magazines everybody knew who she was rare oh shit the all-time ask queen yo this was pre-internet right pre social media she's look at that son get best butt ass fuck out of Dodge with that ass and that was and it was DNA and earned that wasn't he's a human or something shot yes exactly she was I know a guy think I know a guy fat and stuff and you know I'm too and he was he was not into her well I am I he just likes dudes he says just there was nothing to talk about with her a man sometimes I'm after I've talked with her sometimes you just want to have a conversation bro and snuggle she's a singer too hey dude well sometimes she put on an album you know sometimes you did with a gal you give her a book you say hey before we do anything physical you read this and I want to read it and it was talk that's talked about the book dude she that was a great fucking reference Joe I forgot about Vita Graf she was my favorite I had a poster of my college dorm love her out so what's impressive is her ass superseded the Internet you'd like bypass you sure was before the end I think it was wasn't it was there but it wasn't why she got famous she got famous magazine 0 she was in lowriders for sure she she had a push from the internet there was dudes passing her picture around and she'd been way bigger if she was current now well yeah what I should say is well there's a lot of girls like her now she'd get lost in the shuffle what I'm saying is like then she was one of the few girls that people would pass her photos around pre social media correct so it wasn't like it was like this girl in an Instagram page and she had 10 million followers because of her ass it was like guys like you would go dude look at this and you would send it to me and I'd go Jesus hung a poster that was born people emailed each other the FHM maxim what years is tater he's probably done 500 maggots 2005 this is pre so she dating Nikolas share some shit myspace time but that wasn't the same as like Twitter Facebook I bet she had a
