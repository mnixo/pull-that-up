the Joe Rogan experience you know I have to sit back all the time and try to think for myself for that you you've I love my library that I have all the books within it I love the cars that I have I love the relationships that I have but instead of relation but just the things and it's like these are all great things but if I don't have them I'm still me I still have everything that I need in this world I I don't like to think about them being lost destroyed I certainly hate the idea of it being destroyed because even if it wasn't in my hands I'd like them to still exist for others but without them I'm no different than Who I am now and I guess that's kind of a thinking of like the Stoics you've been more defined by your accomplishments and your thinking and your philosophy there's lots of things that people obviously they couldn't know about me they've because it's not the kind of thing that isn't just my Who I am right and and I don't need someone to know whether or not I'm smart or whether or not I know this or whether or not I can do that it's like I'll do it what I need to do it and I have to try and look to see that I have my own inner peace is based on my own self knowledge and knowledge also for the that I am lacking that I can be better that I and if I want to I can choose to in those days that I don't it was a choice not to be better it wasn't that I couldn't because even going and failing like we talked about before is a worthwhile endeavor because it'll move you towards either a eventually getting there or be that it's not something that's gonna be yours but you know what it is and you know what it takes to get there and that's a different perspective altogether and that is where I feel like that's where I can be okay in this world and dealin in there's all kinds of things that you can draw your focus and really eat at you and bother you and you're giving weight to these things and allowing them to have an effect on you and that's natural that's a normal thing and it's easy to fall into but if you can be okay with all right if all I'm left with is just me and what have if I no longer have anything no more luxuries no more this no more that can you be okay with that you know what kind of life would you make of this and I like to think the same one I have now you can pick me up here take all my shit away throw me some other part of the world a third-world country and it will be jarring it will be difficult there will be some lament of course but I will continue to be Who I am I will see what is necessary to to communicate with others and to continue to propagate this that I'm trying to create in me that's hilarious have you ever been a place where it felt weird we found that someone died there you've been in a place where you've been in places that felt weird because you know some violence was gonna pop off and I knew right oh no I was like let's get the fuck out here right as you can tell that's you can feel that somebody dying yeah no I was at a concert once in a bra borough got and I quit I was a security guard and I was an alien concert and it broke out I put a hoodie on a zipped it up it covered my security outfit I'd walk right the fuck out of there I was like I think you out of your fucking mind into this fray and getting clocked in the head by somebody like power fighting and they're there and they cancelled the show and kicked everybody out land fires I was at not the vibe Awards when dr. Dre got jumped in young buck stabbed a guy oh I was there Wow and I was doing a show for you P and this was back when UPN was still a network and one of the execs from UPN was there with her young son he wanted to see all the rappers and he's sitting at the table with us and I saw like the g-unit group come in yeah and I sort of death row guys come in and I saw it Dre's group come in and I'm sitting there and I tell I forgot to get ladies name I said hey you might want to get your kid out of here sometimes about to go down wow she's like what do you mean I'm like it's about to it's about to go and she's like he's so excited he wanted to see Dre and he loves 50 cent and I'm listen get just kid it was a little white kid to him I oh my god there's can I go say hi and I'm like and one as like the second time I said it like yo you're not gonna really get him out of this gum pop off boom Dre gets punched in the face mail a young buck stabs a guy and I'm like told you Jesus like two days later on set she's just like how did you know that like I know the I know the energy in the room I could feel it I've been around it too many times that's a crazy feeling too when people are about to do something weird is yeah you see the you see the walk you see the look you know mm-hmm that's like it's sad but it's true like when you grow up in the hood you have that instinct you have that that look you look at a guy walk past you at one time and you look at okay it's about to go yeah it's about to go yeah people that have never experienced that probably wouldn't know what to do right they wouldn't they would think nothing of it like that lady like she'd never seen those signs before yeah I've been on the road this was recently like maybe three months four months ago I had a my feature at my feature comic with me he's from Chicago actually and we're in a club after the show and there's a couple guys talking in the corner and I said something to a girl she's like hey Tony Rock him have those small talk and she walks over to the group of guys and one guy walks over and stands at the end of the bar here and one guy stands into the bar here and I turned to my friend Dave and I go yeah you ever been a fight in a bar before he said no I said get ready motherfucker you about to be in one cuz I saw it Jesus and then third guy comes over so funny the third guy comes over he's like oh shit you you are a comedian and I see yes I thought that was you we was already talking I was like I thought that was the comedian guy and it's I got a good picture me and I took a picture one of Minnie's calls nothing I'd like it was comedian it was him it was like he kind of just squash it cuz he I guess they didn't know who I was I was gonna go but cuz I said something to the girl oh like no it's the comedian is hit and I'm like hey fellas now I would you guys need a drink let's do a round of shots you know um Dave's like that's just you know that I'm like I know yeah if you ain't never been around violent people you probably don't smell that vibe Yeah right you smell that vibe who knows who's on steroids on and when you sort of came you know the guys that kind of like their bodies changed somebody who dropped off radically yeah so quick really quick like oh damn I never thought yeah like it's not just changed but changed to the point where like you're not even the same person yeah you're like doing an apprentice in their 20s doing them an impression of who they were just a couple years ago on the sauce yeah she's happening man Nowitzki is a good guy man he's just like he's got a bad reputation from a lot of people that could be cool with him cuz I'm you know I'm not cheating I'm not a guy that anymore I mean now he's what is his official title it's like athletes OHS how much she wouldn't be hanging around him like the wire would or wouldn't be as friendly with him because they don't want him sniffing around on you too though when you smoke weed you ever get paranoid this one time I didn't edible I ate too much so you know Jamar neighbors sure very twenty comic he gave me an edible one time and this was before like anybody could just walk into a dispensary like cuz now you just had to show your ID and you can get anything from the dispensary this is when you had to have a card so he went in and got it for me and it was this lemon bar that said award-winning on it and me being the weed novice I was like oh this is gonna be award-winning because of the taste right it's like probably I was like this is like a Paula Deen recipe and so I ate like half of it and I was by myself and I woke up I was laying down and I was in my bed and I sat up and I said am I talking to myself I'm not talking to myself oh my god I am talking to myself I'm not talking to myself I and I was saying this out loud I went on my phone to get on Twitter to see the make sure the world was still happening cuz I was like I felt like I was in some weird Twilight Zone yeah it was awful so I got on there and then I made I forced myself to go to sleep because I was like I can't be awake like this so I forced myself to go to sleep I woke up the next morning I was still high for like five more hours yeah I gave my friend an edible and he called me up a day later said I'm still high a day if you don't know what you're doing with it because I had a conversation with someone else the other day and they were like I ate there I ate four words rice krispie treats and I was like why would you eat four of them he had he called the cops and then checked himself Patel cuz he thought he was dying do you ever see the one where it was a 911 call the cops took weed from these people they pulled them over and then the cops used the weed to make pop brownies and then they ate the pot brownies no when they called 911 on themselves they called for an ambulance they said they were dying please send help times moving very slowly but what's hilarious is it's a fucking 911 call from a cop from a cop and the cop is calling to get an ambulance can you say the time is moving slowly and they stole the weed from these fucking kids they pulled over the whole thing is just it's brilliant it's so funny drugs man it's one of my all-time favorite 911 calls because it's just so it's not YouTube yeah yeah can you please send help times moving very slowly play it article about it the cop had there he resigned before he got in trouble for he resigned taking the weed and be using it so he quit yeah that's probably good you're kind of at that point you kind of have to yeah he called 911 about in a podcast years later everybody's heard that yeah but I didn't you never that fucking I guarantee the video has probably been played a million times easily more than a million do you have a Jamie yeah I just found this shorter version okay listen this poor fucked just think about this to say I think we're dying see pot is something that even when you're having an overdose people laugh at you [Applause]
