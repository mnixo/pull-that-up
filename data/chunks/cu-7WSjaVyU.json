push the sucker right up close three two one and we're live what's happening man how are you I'm cool man farinelli this is gonna meet you a person I've seen in magazines I've seen you since man like when when did you first burst onto the bodybuilding scene well year was that I was reminiscent today first time I came out here was 1992 Gold's Gym so I came from UK to do my first professional bodybuilding contests was called Night of Champions in New York and I got second place there and made a real big impact and the WIDA company that used to be based out here with a flex magazine a muscle and fitness there right down the street they used to be I don't think there are now it's all closed down the fence around it and everything but that's not that's less than a mile away from here yeah the weed offices are out there and you know we those was a big name in bodybuilding the magazines and everything so they flew him out here did my first photo shoot at Gold's Gym 1990s oh yeah 27 years ago and I remember watching you in those magazines you're the first guy well you know what were the first guy but you were one of the first guys that I ever saw in a magazine that it was like gee how the fuck is that a person you were so big man well Christ you were big that's funny because I look back at some of pictures now at me and I say what the fuck it's extreme it's and I came into the sport and I wanted to see what I could do I wanted to like take it as far as go take it you know well you represented to me as an outsider looking in this insane determination you know like I felt like all the best guys whether it was Arnold or you or Lee Haney all the top guys they always represented not just like the biggest and the most profoundly ridiculously muscular body builders but also this extreme dedication that was required to reach that level well you know you've been around money with with a martial arts and everything any kind of sport is the same thing what separates the guy that's first from second from third or whatever you know you all got certain physical characteristics that that helped you in your sport and so on so you're all gifted up there so what can separate the guy from first and second and third it's it's all up there that's that's the key how did you develop your mindset was that something that you always had was it something that you developed as you were training I think is something I already already had and I kind of left home when I was 16 so I was out on my own on the street and you know you are they're gonna get smart and you know look after yourself are you gonna fall down there's nobody there to catch me so that was there from from an early age I think and I was just very determined to do this thing that our fellow could be good at in order to change my life and change you know the projection of my life the people around me I was grew up on a housing estate in UK I had no education I was in a jail when I was 18 so I had all that that was you know the people around me I was like I didn't want part of that future I wanted to do something else and I got this thing that was good at so I'm gonna take it and run with it you know it's crazy how many people have similar stories like that where they were in just a terrible environment and they realized that they had to toughen up they had a smarten up and they had to get out of there and if not for those terrible situations who knows if they would have ever reached the levels of greatness of thinking I can tell you from my point of view I don't think I would have done because that would be too comfortable if you're comfortable you're not going to put yourself through that extreme kind of pressure and pain and you know I wanted to improve my life it changed my life and through the sport Here I am sitting talking to you on this show people are listening to me I've been all around the world thanks to my sport so it's been great for me you know when you meet current bodybuilders they're like hey man what the fuck are coming out a gigantic huge mr. Hulk anymore your regular size athletic-looking dude yeah not really maybe some of the younger guys that are coming into this now but you know people know me I was a professional bodybuilder that's what I did and I was the best at doing that but that kind of training and that kind of physique is not going to serve me now so I do training to be more functional my goals are more health-related now whereas before I was a young guy and I wanted to be the best that this thing I was doing I put everything into but you know that kind of physics not practical for everyday you said you know I said another tie my shoelaces when I was 300 pounds oh I'm sure man and how tall you like 510 511 511 so like when you were that big you were just a ball of muscle just a mass yeah and 300 pounds I was 300 310 in the offseason Jesus Christ competing 265 but I mean 265 leanness fuck dehydrated you know shredded so yeah that's that's all I did that was all I did I trained I eat I sleep I studied that's just mental focus was like lays it on that thing that was doing nothing else I wouldn't go to the movies I wouldn't go to dinner if I got home after 11:00 because I got to be in a bed at the lemon well I was you know that was the regime that I lived for many years and that's why I was able to beat other people that maybe could be argued they were more gifted than me but they weren't willing to do that so that's that's what it's all about yeah that's what I had always read about you and that's what I did like I said that was like the impression that I always got like what you represented is the pinnacle of extreme dedication yeah and study you know we had no internet then everybody's got coaches now a nutritionist a thing that appealed to me is this was an individual thing I had to learn about the training had to learn about the nutrition had to learn all this stuff myself and that was apart from the training that was part of it as well you know the learning part of it I enjoyed was it hard to get good information because I'm sure there's a bunch of like gym experts there's always these bro science guys that are hanging around giving you shitty advice like how hard was it to get the proper information when it came I kind of sifted through it and was very influenced by a guy called Arthur Jones don't know if you've heard of him but Arthur Jones invented the Nautilus machines and this guy was like a billionaire self-made billionaire he just was fascinated with the bodybuilding they had no business interest in it so he just wanted to you know he studied it and it was like what is it that causes muscle growth what is it and he found it was an intensity of exercise and then there was another bodybuilder Mike Manso went to compete in the mr. olympia when the mr. universe he took those principles and he used them so I read all this stuff and it was very logical you know it made sense and then I tried it out in the gym and it worked in the gym and if I trained more often or if I did more in the gym my progress was slowed down or it would stop as soon as I cut back and I made the workout shorter and more intense my progress went so it was for me it was pretty early on I learned how to train properly and that's why I was competing I competed in a World Championship after 18 months training which is pretty much unheard of that is pretty much unheard of now when you say shorter more intense workouts how did you regulate that like that is that's a huge issue with martial artists is over training they want to do more work than everybody else they want to work harder than everybody else and they wind up breaking their body down and showing up for the fight exhausted overtraining is a big thing and if you you see the the process for muscle growth is you go in the gym and you put stress on the muscle if you put stress that it's not used to then it's going to react you're going to get growth but you need to recover from that first you don't go to the gym and grow and then recover later that's that's not the way it works you go if you've you know you give some your body some stress is not used to you'll get a reaction but before you get the reaction you have to recover so if you're not allowing enough time to recover you just I use this analogy at seminars I do it's very simplistic but it gets the point across if you get a bit of sandpaper and you rub it across the palm of your hand and it's kind of bloody if you leave it and let it heal up what's gonna happen the skin's going to develop back a little bit stronger a little bit thicker than before because it wants to protect against that stress so that's the process but if you go and you make your hand bloody and before it's healed up again you go and rub it again what's happening you're not really getting any we're just gonna have a bloody hand you know you think you're being tough but you're actually just being silly yeah and that's why are you going to the gym right I'm going to the gym to get results so I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get results and if it means training thirty minutes once a week or it means training ten hours a day every day whatever it takes I was willing to do it and I would have done it but training ten hours a day is not gonna build your muscle is just gonna burn out so I was doing average 4550 minute workouts probably four times a week no really that's it and everybody say oh that's it whether I write on a piece of paper what the fuck is that that's nothing man I'm like okay what come and do it come and do it and tell me if you want to do more when we're finished nobody's ever said oh please come and do some more they're like no that's it that's enough because every set bother warm-up sets you got a warm-up and you know to be safe and everything but the set the real sets I call them we're going to go to absolute failure and even beyond with force reps with assistance reps maybe extra negative reps which is something most people in the collect when they lift weights they think you know I've lifted it all right let me go down I've lifted it but they're neglecting the lowering part of the weight they're negative so I get people to really slow that down so you're taxed in that part as well and even at the end of the set on some exercises with machines where it's practical so you know you can't curl anymore physically on the positive on the contraction but your strength on the lowering is greater so if you did curls and you failed I could lift the weight to the top for you and you could lower it down for probably another three reps so if you just gone to failure here you wouldn't have exhausted the the negative part of the rep so my thing is exhaust everything it's totally fucked you can't lift you can't lower it you can't lift it it's total failure if you do that one sudden exercises then time to move on do another exercise how did you develop your protocol just trial and error trial and error and you know I didn't invent this system of training as I said people there before me Arthur Jones might mentor I just taught what they did and refined it a little bit more for a competitive bodybuilder because Arthur Jones was a competitive bodybuilder people who trained weren't so his his routines were even briefer than mine but for a bodybuilding you know you could you got to work the side dial you got to work different aspects so I probably did a little bit more than they did so I adapted it to myself and my needs now when you were at your height and when you're 265 pounds shredded and dehydrated and and then 310 pounds in the offseason you got you must be like used to looking at yourself like that like was it hard to adapt to being that mean you're still obviously a very fit guy but you're a normal sight like if I saw you I'd be like there's a normal fit guy yeah that's what I want to be now I'm not training for bodybuilding because it's not what I want to do now plus I got a lot of injuries from a little super heavy weights I did I got a torn rotator cuff which is not I've had a couple surgeries on there it doesn't repair so you know I was trying to you know lift weights and continue to do in what I do because that's what I'm used to doing right right and when you're familiar with doing something you're reluctant to change something else but I noticed you know over that my shoulders getting a bit worse my hips were getting you know I'm like hold on is this serving me now why am I doing this am i doing this just to try and maintain something for other people what they think I should look like right and I kind of came to the conclusion yeah you are because you're not you're not a bodybuilder anymore you're not competing right so if doing this kind of training is not really benefiting you and maybe making your injuries worse you know when you're 60 or something you're gonna not be able to like lift your arms up or something like that so I'm thinking more practically and I started doing yoga and you know I really fell in love with that it's amazing isn't it yeah it's amazing as physically it's amazing I got much more range of motion mobility and then you got the spiritual aspect of as well so actually that I was inspired to do yoga from DMT trip predator DMT trip and I came back and I was like my body's all fucked up there's this thing right like I gotta fix some stuff here what shall I do and I didn't even I knew what yoga was but I don't really know what it was and I got to do something got to do yoga or Tai Chi I don't know what it is but started looking into it and then found a yoga teacher and I'll do that a couple times a week I found it's it's great every time I do it I just think I should do more this morning and I got up this morning did with yoga class 8 o'clock Gold's Gym and you know on an empty stomach just had some water and some tea and I fucking feel amazing on that well it just to me it feels like it connects everything it connects all the tissue from the back to the legs to the arms as like the neck and thus the core it strengthens all the connecting stuff and just a new energy flow yes going around and that's the thing with bodybuilding because bodybuilding you're isolating the muscles right so you're isolating your bicep isolating the tricep isolating the deltoids and putting stress on those muscles to maximize the muscle size of those individual muscles right which is great for bodybuilding but your body doesn't function like that you know right if you throw something you throw a punch or you know you don't use one muscle use the you know it's Chalian affect the whole body works together and the body bone you don't really do that you don't learn to do that so that's what I've had to relearn you know so when you exercise today like what kind of stuff do you do besides yoga I do yoga do some cycling I live in Spain we've got some good hills there so I do because I like to push me and I can't push the weights anymore I can't get in that zone you know because of my injuries so I got to do something else Yoga is a challenge you know and it continue to be like if I do that until I'm dropped down dead 80 years old there's always more that I can do you know you can always do a bit more rains or a bit more difficult pose so there's no there's no ceiling there you know with the bodybuilding I already been on the ceiling yeah you know I do cycling a couple of times a week up and down the hills so that's like you know it's got almost like intervals because you do a hill it's intense and then you go flat and it's a bit easier so I enjoyed doing that you moved to Spain well I lived in UK and I started visiting Spain because in Marbella and Spain the south coast of Spain it's got a very big British community there and the weather is amazing it's like la Marbella is like for me it reminds me a lot of LA but a mini LA without all the bullshit and the traffic exam and all that kind of stuff you know okay so that's why that's why I moved there that's nice now have you ever looked into anything for you sure like stem cells or things no I had there's a new surgery now because what happened I tore my supraspinatus a couple of times and because the end was badly frayed there to chop off the end so now it doesn't really bridge the gap to the humerus so it needs a bridge and apparently is a new surgery that they can make a bridge now but I went to see a surgeon is like okay what's three issues here pain do you have pain like no not really have range of motion actually I got more range than the other shoulder it's a bit loose so the only issue with - strength and stability and he wasn't able to give me a hundred percent on whether the surgery would do that for me and I've had about six surgeries I had a tendon reattachment here about three on the shoulder had some on the hips and I'm like you know what unless you're going to tell me a hundred percent that going through the inconvenience and pain of a surgery is going to give me what I need then I'm not going to do it I'm just going to cope with this and I can't bench press but so what like you know it doesn't really matter that much to me you can you do push-ups or just I can do some push-ups but probably like ten where before I do like a hundred or something so it's it's very weak and stable so yeah if sure if if I had a surgeon it says to me listen man we're going to do this and I guarantee your shoulder is going to be stronger and more stable after it because you know you got to sit with you in a sling for like six to eight weeks you can't shower properly can't dress and yeah and all this stuff so for me to go through that again I would have to have like yeah this is definitely going to help then I would consider it until then I live with it they're doing some pretty amazing stuff now with stem cells yes tendon tissue so yeah they can do a lot of soft tissue regeneration they're also doing it now the most recent things they're combining stem cells with platelet-rich plasma they're doing it together and they found but that by doing the stem cells and the PRP together it helps generate new tissue growth better yeah I know my watch at the new surgery had the PRP and the recovery was real quick so yeah it's nice meniscus yeah oh yeah there's any surgeons out there that know how to replace repair Dorian's shortened supraspinatus let me know now is your situation very similar to what a lot of bodybuilders face after they retire they just they're so much stress and strain on the joints and the back and yeah well Ronnie Coleman who is mr. Olympia after me and he's a serious super strong yeah he did a lot of really heavy squatting with also when he was getting ready for a bodybuilding competition and basically doing powerlifting which it's probably not a good idea so Ryan has a lot of problems with his disks in his back and I'm not sure of all the details but I know he's had a lot of fusions so his mobility and so on is going to be better than one fusion yeah several so he can't really turn his neck and his back to good and he's at both his hips replaced oh Jesus Christ he's a young guy to hold on he's running six no no run it's like almost my age is probably early fifties is he yeah why do I think he's younger than that I'm retired maybe I'm thinking therapy at 46 into the 36 you know he did we both were known to be very strong running around more so than myself because I did powerlifting before so we move some heavy weights and you know any sport man is that you're gonna have some consequences ya know if you run if you fight and play football whatever and anything has its you know its downside but all things considering I think I'm doing pretty good I'm healthy and you know I got a Dickey shoulder so big deal it's okay yeah I'm telling you man I've just hang in there they're on their way to figuring something out for that yeah that's that's almost what I'm thinking I'm thinking like don't do anything now because in a few years time there'll be something that can really do the job so yeah I'll wait until then yeah the last thing you want to do is get something like I always tell that to my friends to thinking about getting discs fused and like you know they're so close they're now shooting they're shooting stem cells into the discs directly in regenerating disk tissue the same way they've been regenerated meniscus tissue and tendon tissue and things along those lines I'm it's a guy that trained out here many years ago in LA and he told me they were and I've seen before and after x-rays of joints that a the joints destroyed you got no cartilage so you know connect replacement and these guys have actually regenerated the tissue back but it's quite a lengthy process of traction like hanging upside down and hours of ultrasound just to push a ton of blood into the area blood supply and then you can heal it up you can actually regrow cartilage tissue but it's not it's not quit it's not on the protocol of the you know Medical Association so they basically push these guys out of business with lawsuits well you know there's a doctor that we've talked about on the podcast before that recommends hanging from bars for your shoulders it's one of the best things ever to alleviate pain and also to increase range of motion and reduce impingements well I have to get in touch with this guy yeah well there's my feet so much for my back another inversion table I'll do that a couple of times a week just to you know keep the mobility there are no one of my disks l5 is a little bit worn but I don't do squats or heavy overhead stuff so I think it's going to be okay but yeah still you know it's all about prevention and you heard of the reverse hyper machine have you seen that no no we have one in the back I'll show it to you but it's a creation of Westside barbell you know Lois Simmons yeah crazy bastard yeah Lois Simmons created this machine that when you lift your legs up it strengthens the back and on the down when it swings down its active decompression okay it's phenomenal for disc issues it's like active decompression plus strengthening together I have one back here I love it so much right there it is like this you can see it up here see it's we've talked about this so many times people would think this guy's like hired me to endorse his product but it's an amazing product so he can explain those wife she got this well your wife looks very fit so I'm sure she does a lot of lifting as well so though there was a world champion as well and I failed you know it's so common for anybody that puts any strain in their body there doesn't usually the l5 l4 area on the bottom of this mine yeah one of the things about bodybuilding is that in isolation when you're you're constantly isolating these things do does that run the risk of like weakening certain areas like you have to be I would imagine very cognizant about balancing everything out I think like with bodybuilders the shoulder injuries is the most common because you've got the road so which is small muscles and tendons which gives you the mobility that's why you can move it around rather than being a hinge so what happens is you know your pecs are getting stronger adults your lats all these external muscles are getting bigger and stronger but these guys inside are not so eventually they get overloaded and you get some kind of issue there's some kind of tear so when I'm training people now I give them rotation exercises just to strengthen those areas so they can avoid that but aim and I started training that haters like yeah we didn't know anything and when I got an injury and I living in England as well there's no sports medicine doctors dealing with you know strength athletes or so on so I just go to your doctor and he's like how do you do that lifting weights stop doing that shit while you're lifting weights take these pills and you know yeah that's it you know so so now we have much more information much more you know sports therapists and so on so there's a lot more things available now and a lot more knowledge and information that we didn't really have back then yeah that's that's the main thing you you neglect some of the smaller some supporting muscles I think when you're doing major body building exercises do guys now address that do they do like a lot of rotation exercises a lot of I see it more in the gym then like you know if you did that back in the 80s people like what the fuck you doing there a little weight you know time do some you know lift some weights well I see people doing it now and with the bands and everything so yeah people are doing more preventative stuff it's fascinating because there's guys like Arnold who like kind of the original pioneers and then guys like you who came after him but you were still again pre-internet figuring things out on your own learning from the guys that came before you but taking it to another level that was the beauty of it for me you know I never really liked team sports because I just feel like this assholes letting me down here you know and I felt like that through my life as well I felt like like my parents didn't really you know like everyone's fuckin letting me down fuck this I'll do this myself and so I got to learn about the nutrition and to learn about the train and I got to do it I got to pull it all into action and of course I had people like supporting me but when I got on that stage it was win or lose I'm can fall responsibility for this and we don't really have that now and the guys don't learn anything because I got coaches so what should I do but I do this do that and eat this and eat that okay and you know the beauty of it's gone you're not learning anything anymore and what if you fall out with a coach like I'm gonna do next contest you know so is that like a big thing now like there's like a series of coaches is it like a champs no it's like I don't know I think the guys are suckers because who's making the money here the coaches the coaches are making the money not the not the competitors the coaches are smart and I look at the coaches and I say who the fuck are you and what have you done you know which contests if you actually won and though most of them haven't done anything is just all theory so it's one of the exercise physiologists all right they're just guys from the industry that you know they're they've trained a few people and they've got a few results and it's more about their for me it's all more about the insecurities of the guys competing like why don't you learn yourself and listen to your body and I used to make notes you know every week I'd write down my diet I'd write down every single workout that I ever did from 1984 to 1997 I having a training log you should sell that I printed a bit yeah all these little exercise books you know and like you can see the first one went on like 21 years old it's a bit childish with the comments on but it's like you know I felt shit today this was a shitty workout never fucking let this happen again you know all this stuff I'm talking to myself so I got all this and it's that go back and look at it sometimes and it's weird because I can go back to 1988 and I can look in my book and I look at that Walker and I was like I was in this gym and I was training with this guy and I can't even remember like I was like what I was wearing and I can go back in time and remember just from those nodes yeah like every workout as soon as I've got home and I finished I was like hey bones pressed I did this and every month I would make notes and I'd say okay this is what I'm doing now these are my goals for the next four weeks you know whatever is like little goals like I'm going to put five pounds on my bench but if you do that every month and they another month you got yelling that you I got sixty pounds right so I did all these things like you know mental rehearsal visualize a all this stuff I did it I just I kind of learned it nobody nobody taught me so that was one of the things goal-setting right and writing it down on a piece of paper just and you can do this with anything your business whatever you're writing it down on a piece of paper you're making a commitment it's fucking there on a piece of paper every day you can look at that and that just gives you a stronger mental vision and instead of saying right I'm gonna win this contest in 18 months time yeah that's cool you're gonna win that contest but how are you gonna get there is like saying I'm gonna sail to Australia yeah it's a good idea that's cool but how are you gonna get there if you got a plan if you got a map or like fuck you're gonna go with no map you're just gonna get lost you know so I found that very helpful that's what I try to teach people as well you know yeah I think writing down goals is huge and it's something that most people don't do yeah I still do it now like a daily thing this is what I got to do today sometimes I won't get through it all but you know at least is there I might put a couple of things off for tomorrow but I find it very very helpful yeah yeah and once you've read it down like you know like let's say I don't know you want to stop drinking or something write it down I'm gonna stop drinking alcohol sign it if I can put it there on your table you've said it you've made the committing you put on a paper so you're gonna you're gonna let yourself down you're gonna be a pussy you're gonna be weak and you're gonna break that come you made that commitment man right you know it's there on a piece of paper so that's that's strong especially for the type of person like you a dedicated focus guy like something like that is just extra motivation and I like a you know you it's a scaffolding yeah it's something I just say it casually I fuckin committed to this I wrote it down you know yeah I'm a firm believer I think you should at least for a week you know at least for your week set it out and have a little checkbox next to it make sure you can look at that like I did this I got my workouts in I got my my whatever whatever you need to get done whatever you're trying to slack off it's five things to do that did for them and didn't do the fifth one because I smoked to join Oh for that still that four out of five I reward myself if you do write things down though you'll just get more done even if you don't fulfill the all of it more you're gonna get more than than if you didn't do it hundreds is having a plan man everything needs a plan if you want to get somewhere I use that analogy if you want to get somewhere if you're a captain on a ship you don't just get in ship and say hey let's go sailing and we're gonna get there no you're probably not you need to you know you need a route to get there yeah and you need to know what it takes to get there oh I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this fight and competition yeah cool but do you know what it takes to get there right first of all this is what it takes okay are you prepared to do this are you gonna do this yes or no and if it's yes go for it you know if it's too much be honest though just don't fuckin do it you know there was a time when you were at the top of the heap where there was there was debate as to like what a bodybuilder should look like there was like the Frank Zane look which was like a strong obviously fit guy but much smaller and just symmetrical and then there was you that just came out with the fucking Hulk you know and then it was almost like overwhelming for a lot of people and then there was this debate to try to figure out absolutely because when I look at a bunch of bodybuilders on a stage and they're trying to pick out who's number one who's number two much oh yeah I mean I always assume that it's like a lot of other things like the deeper you are into it the more you can see the intricacies of it whereas for me a person is not a bodybuilder I'm like they're all fucking huge how can you tell who's the best well it's a matter of you know its body building right yeah so it's muscle size is a big factor it's not the only factor but it is a big factor if you look at the mr. Olympius for instance in the era of Frank Zane and Frank Zane is a body that probably most people would look at and say fucking hell that's that said that's great and you know you look at me and say it's too extreme but in in the era of Frank Zane who was mr. Olympia was Arnold right Arnold was mr. Olympia you could you could argue that Frank Zane's body is is more aesthetic and nicer and prettier than Arnold's but Arnold beets and why it just was bigger more freakishly is bigger and Lee Haney was eight times mr. Olympia you could argue maybe Leela proud or somebody like that was better proportion and put together but he was much smaller so you know Frank's little guy you would see in a gym today like a regular dude there's a lot of regular duties or there's a there's a category now so you got bodybuilding but you've got other categories now that you didn't have so you've got men's physique which is more of this type of physic they're looking for very aesthetic tight waist everything like that and you've even got classic bodybuilding now which is height of a weight ratio so you know the guys are not that big so you've got different categories as a reaction to people not really like in the direction that bodybuilding went and and yeah I'll take responsibility for it going the size route and I had a nice physique when I started you know I had a nice physique had nice abs and everything but I'm like if I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this to the max and I'm gonna see how far you know how big can I get how rip can I get how strong can I get I want to go to the max and I I don't want people to say oh that's wow that's the nice pretty physique I want people to say what the fuck that's what I wanted to do well you succeed you definitely succeeded yeah the guy that inspired me to before that was tom platt sort of the fucking freaky legs and you know he was the guy when i started he wasn't mr. olympia but he was very inspirational and when he talked it was just full of energy and enthusiasm for the training and pushing the body to its absolute maximum and remember tom platt saying you know when i walk out on stage at a bodybuilding competition i want to see those judges there with the pencil in the paper and I just wanted to fucking drop that pencil and just say what the fuck is so big his legs were so freakishly big like that guy had like nobody has really surpassed tom platt says leg development on thing to this day it's fair to say now is that just it's weird because it's very rare that someone's known very specifically for a body part that plots is known for his legs but Platts made a whole career on on the legs and not only the legs the this passion he had for like pushing himself into the gym for the to the absolute maximum and that inspired me to do that and try and take it even further and that now is missing that's not here anymore now for me the bodybuilding and the fitness industry people are just really more concerned with the cosmetic the look and you know taking their pitches and putting them into the gram and all this kind of stuff they're not really into it's almost a spiritual side of it you know where you want to push yourself to that maximum and see how far you can go and how you know how far your mind can go into the pain and all that kind of stuff that's not really there anymore well what's what's missing look what's the element that's missing like why isn't that there I don't know man I mean society in general people just want stuff like you know they want stuff easy now you know ever wants to be famous put the picture on Instagram you don't need to do shit just be famous go on Big Brother be famous for nothing you've done nothing yeah that's I don't know I think that's a reflection of the way things are perhaps in everything but what's the difference in the way the body builders approach it today I mean they're obviously doing something cuz they're still huge and they're still you know these giant guys that are lifting weights so what what Ellen but if you look at the giant guys that are lifting weights now they don't look quite like myself and the guys from the nineties now the guys are just big everywhere the waist so huge everything's huge and it's 20 years since I competed in a contest so I don't exactly know but the guys are using a lot more different drugs and we use them a lot more insulin and igf-1 you're seeing is in the big guys is somewhat assists systemic growth it's like they just got bit bigger everywhere and that doesn't look so appealing I think right when like their guts Xterra so maybe they relying more on the chemicals and they don't really you know I haven't really heard anything from any of the bodybuilding champions in the last 10 or 15 years and I think interesting or new or revolutionary in the training methods it just you know they don't really even talk about that much now everyone just does the same stuff you know well it was at one point in time where no one talked about it at all right like it was you would get the magazine's and they would tell you to take creatine yeah you could look like me but everybody kind of knew who everybody who knew people who knew people was it was somewhat of an inner circle you know I remember I started in the eighties and I read the magazines and I serve you things by arnold and mike man so where they kind of admitted they used something but they very downplayed it i was only for the last six weeks before a competition just to give us that last polish and stuff like that and ask a few guys in the gym and when i first started they were a bit cagey like no no no no I don't do that you know later on I found out they're all they're all doing it right yeah and it was very much in a circle in the gym bodybuilders now everybody knows about steroids and now it's mainstream and guys take steroids now just for cosmetic reasons because they want to look bigger and harder and quicker I just equate it to women having a Botox or having some implants the guys want to look bigger they don't want to work so hard they don't want to you know they just want it quick right so you get guys coming to the gym and they just take steroids pretty much straightaway and they don't necessarily learn how to train really properly and it's not just competitive bodybuilders now I mean it's everywhere everywhere it's mainstream you look at Hollywood you look at hip-hop artists I mean come on they're all they're all doing a bit of juice man looking right look at nelly 10 years ago and look em now man he was just really nice and nelly they're all jack man you know it's not following me I can see what's going on guys from Hollywood they want to get in shape quickly for a movie you know guys just want to look good on the beach it's it's it's everywhere now it's mine closed there's Nelly damn Pannell he's jacked yeah we saw a picture of Hugh Jackman when he was preparing for Wolverine he's doing deadlifts and he was in his 40s yeah and someone was asking me do you think he's doing yes yeah well yeah how much did he get paid for the movie as well fuck yeah well no no no me that like tip for a guy that's not really that kind of an athlete to all the sudden look like that like you've got to make some radical physiological changes and a couple of months yeah like that was that's not even a good picture of man there's real good pictures of him jacked but I mean there's pictures of him from the movie to was just he's enormous like he just became my enormous guy what I'm saying is like how much did he get paid for the movie my point is you know he got paid for that so maybe he took a little health risk or whatever you can debate that but he's getting paid for it well is it is it worth it if you're just doing it just fucking look good on the beach and all look good for the girls or something and some how much yeah here's the thing man once you get on that merry-go-round you don't want to get off that's the problem right and you don't want to get off because you took some stuff you you you know you got bigger you get more attention from the girls now guys got more respect for you your self-confidence is up you know you don't lose all that man well he because I took it for a competitive sport I'm gonna stop the stuff that was it but that wasn't like that's my question like how did you just accept the fact that you were no longer a superhuman looking freak show of a man now you became a regular man was zero this whole thing was see if with bodybuilding competition I never showed my physique even in the gym with the guys that I trained with I was covered up all the time if I want to look at my physique and practice my pose and stuff I did it at home so on the street I was wore long-sleeve a shit about anybody else why is that because I did it purely for competition but why did you cover it why don't you just dress like with ah because I'm freakin wanted attention all the fucking time I'm not interested in it you know I'm gonna quiet guy and I just wanted to go about my business and reveal this thing I've been working on mmm I didn't see it as being it's almost removed it's like a statue I'm working on you know so I wasn't tied up in like I was tied up in being mr. Olympic because that's who I was and that you know somewhat a role you're playing but the whole huge body and I didn't I didn't need that for for everyday use well that sort of fits with this whole Spartan image that it people had of you you know that you're you the image of you was like this guy that was just doing work that other people weren't willing to do and some sort of quiet isolation somewhere salutely we're not just a basement a basement in Birmingham England where you know it's not exactly a hotbed of bodybuilding activity you know no beaches are nothing it's an industrial city so I just locked myself away there and worked on this project and I love doing it I loved like just being in that tunnel you know yeah and seeing what I couldn't do and obviously the further you get along the more difficult it is to make any kind of improvements but I was trying you know that's fascinating to look at it that way it's almost like an art project there was a statue I was removed it was not my I wasn't like building this body so I could get you know admiring from the girls or the guys gonna respect I was already like a fit strong guy before I started so I didn't come from that place of like I need to do this to make myself feel better I need to do this because I have some talent for it and I can change my life with this maybe I don't know it's going to be mr. Olympia but I just knew that if I put my energy into this something positive was going to come from it and after a few years I won the British championship and because of that you know I was British champion I didn't have a car I went home to one-bedroom apartment with no furniture I didn't even have a proper bed I had a mattress on the floor I don't have shirt but I won the first championship and because of that somebody put up the money for me to open a gym then I had a gym then I was making an income from my sport so even if it went that far it would have been worth it you know wow that's well I think that attitude is probably what's made you like very healthy like mentally afterwards well you know I was separate from your body and then it was a project there was a period afterward that was very tough because I was asked I was mr. olympia and this is you know it's all I've been doing like since I was 21 years old and then I got an injury so my exit from the sport was not calculated well I wanted it I told my tricep tendon on the left elbow and this had already one injury a bicep tear but I kind of handled that and didn't affect my training too much well this was almost a complete detachment that I have to have repaired and after that and I just knew I couldn't I couldn't lift properly and I you know you can't compete with the best of the world if you can't lift properly so I had to retire and then I was like in limbo as I own who the fuck am I and what am I gonna do with my life so it took me a few years to kind of slowly get back but it wasn't about oh I've lost my muscles what I'm gonna do like it was more about of you know I don't know what my role is in life I don't know who I am it took me a long time to find that and I think a lot of athletes that retire from sport they have the same same issues it's a giant issue with fire you you know you've got this fucking tunnel yeah you're in right it's almost like being at war like you're stressful but you know you've got this role and it's this thing that you're just aiming for all the time and now it's just gone like what the fuck you're gonna do who are you what you know it's all about you know so it took me years to to kind of you know come to peace with that but it wasn't about losing the muscles it was about losing my goal and my focus and my role in life I think yeah the for a lot of athletes it's the intensity of life as all the sudden will reduce down to a mundane become a normal guy there's no lows it's just mediums time but I turned it round because when I was doing bodybuilding my life was very restrictive like a fucking monk you know I just had this regime and I didn't want to socialise I didn't want to do anything outside of that so after some time I came like hey man so you can't do that anymore what about the thousand and one things you didn't do when you were doing that because you couldn't now you couldn't do all those things you can go where you want do you know if you not eat all day if you don't want to like eat six meals a day you can do what you you know so I started looking into some other things I was interested in I was always being interested in wildlife so I started going a few safaris and things like that and yeah slowly I realized like hey you know there's a million one things that can do in life like this you know I got over this so just a transitionary transitional period yeah but I can absolutely see why many athletes struggle Frank Bruno who was you know boxer world boxing champion from UK I know he had a really hard time and almost like he was a world champion when I was a mr. Olympia and we've tried at the same time we both got divorced like everything falls apart man like you know and then you hopefully rebuild back to something else yeah it seems that very few athletes have a smooth process into retirement and fighters in particular they always come back when they shouldn't yeah well I know why they do that when I was a kid I was always like why smiley coming back man like just you know who's the greatest and now he's going to get beat by some guy cause he's coming back but you missed the fucking adrenaline or whatever it is of that you know that all your focus all your soul everything is going into that one point and like it's it's tough to replace but you've got to know when it's the time to step down I think you know now when you did decide did you have a plan did you write out a plan like how to step down because you wrote out a plan for the rest of your life no because it was it was like new Tara was like that you know it was like I didn't have a plan all right so the injury yeah of a Glee I had a idea in my mind that I would like to open more gyms when I finished bodybuilding actually I didn't happen but I started my own nutrition company which are still doing sports nutrition during age sports nutrition so put a lot of energy into that and different things and being able to you know experience things in life that I shut myself off with so that's how I dealt with it and now I feel I feel great about it and I can look back and I can sit back and say you know what I couldn't have given any more to that thing I couldn't have given any more so there's no regrets like a lot of athletes you know when you're young and you're there maybe you don't really appreciate so much and then when it's gone you're like shit man what if I had done this what if what if what if what if you know I don't have those what ifs man I did a hundred percent even too much to the point where I got injured so you know I'm happy with that I can put that to rest that's a great lesson that's a great lesson for young people coming up if you just do all the work when it's over it's what you can do man win or lose you do what you can do and then you have the self-satisfaction the pride to look back and say you know what I fucking give it everything I had and no regrets and that's the way I feel about it and I know there's a lot of my contemporaries that compete against me they don't really feel like that that's why a few of them are still there in the 50s and they're making comebacks that's one of the most horrible things to see someone who's lived a life of regret yeah just now or even I don't like to see athletes coming back when they're not as you remember them at their best and they're coming back and they're not so good which I'm sorry but inevitably at 50 years old was going to be the case is there any body builders are doing that now at 50 yeah Kevin of Rowan who came second to me and mr. Olympia he made a comeback last year really yeah how do you look well it depends how I answer that question how did how did he look compared to previously not good at all how did it look for a guy that's making a comeback at 50 years old yeah great but it's not a 50 year old guy looking good contest as mr. Olympia Saburo well so you know I just tried to make it come back within a year doesn't it take like many many years to get to that kind of shape with bodybuilding you got a thing called muscle memory so maybe it took me 10 years to get to be 260 pounds ripped but now that information is in my DNA it's there so I could theoretically not train for 10 years Luis all that muscle and probably get that back in six to twelve months really yeah absolutely well I've heard of muscle memory and I know that it's a thing but it has it been physically if they isolated what causes that or how it is in your DNA I'm not really sure if they have or if they're interested enough to do do the studies it's necessary but those of us you know that are in the sport we know it happens I mean Arnold did it like 1974 I think Arnold was gonna retire but then he got this pumping iron movie that everyone's familiar with so the 1975 mr. Olympia which at pumping iron runs around he basically made a comeback for that just just for the movie and previous to that he did a movie called stay hungry with Sally Field and Jeff Bridges and I think he had to get down to like 200 210 pounds because the director didn't want him to be too big for that so he came off the back of that and they just put all the size back on for the mr. Olympia for pumping iron really there's so the director made him sort of emaciate himself well I still look pretty big I guess for the average person yeah oh man that's nothing compared to how he looks what Jeff Bridges yeah I mean he looks like a really big fit guy that you see at the gym look at Jeff Bridges he do I love that guy he's still around man still banging out great movies yeah talk about how many great movies that guy's been in absolutely what's the one where as a country singer that was great yeah that was recent yeah god dammit I saw that that was a good movie he's good at choosing roles so but when when a guy does get down to something like that is it a matter of like taking less steroids working out less like your body just naturally stops if you're if you're taking steroids and you stop then you're going to lose a lot of weight pretty right and maybe just don't lift weights you know play tennis do swim in there's something else and your muscle mass it's going to go down so I'm guessing that's what it is now when you first started bodybuilding how long did it take before you did take something after about 18 months I decided I want to do a contest and I knew the guys in the contest were taking stuff so I just want to be on a level playing field with them so like two months before my first contest would take a little bit of Tebow twenty milligrams a day ball a day that was the first thing I ever had and then never to the contest I switched to some anavar and prima Boleyn but I mean 20 milligrams a day is like fitness chicks take that now and I do they real they do fitness do take steroids right means 100% 100% even bikini chicks really like skinny Pacino because they want to look harder they were no cleaner and that's you know I get girls that are fucking strippers and all kind of chicks asking me oh I want to take this winstrol stuff you know anything about that I'm like I do do you oh the guy just told me it's gonna make me leaner and everything I said all right let me explain what this is this is an anabolic steroid an alibi Rock steroid is a derivative of testosterone which is a male hormone so what they try to do is minimize the androgenic part of the testosterone the male like and so you're left with more than anabolic the building part but they can't completely minimize the antigenic part so even though stuff like winstrol anavar is less androgenic than testosterone is still derived from a male hormone and if you takin off you're still gonna get the male side effects which is pretty common in women's bodybuilding and fitness and so on it's common in athletics across the board you know we see it in MMA we see it in women in MMA as well look man if you're a competitive sport a competitive athlete you're gonna do whatever you can do yeah to win there was a study once done by a guy called dr. Goldman and it's called Goldman's dilemma and he asked a bunch of athletes including I think Olympic level athletes so if I could give you a pill that would guarantee you would win the gold medal or whatever the equivalent is in your sport but you would die at like 40 45 would you take it the vast majority of people said yes they would take it that's the mentality you're dealing with especially when you're young man yeah you feel indestructible like nothing's gonna you know yeah it doesn't seem real - right it's like global warming why do they make the Seas rise but not right now the fuck right now I want a fucking gold medal that's all I'm interested in I'm not even that doesn't even exist I'm here now on the fucking gold medal and this is a mentality of the you know the successful athlete and you know maybe applies to everything but maybe is a fucking businessman if you said you take this pill and you'll fucking make billions like would you do it you know driven businessman I'd probably say fuck yeah I'll do it if it's a solution that allow you to win yeah yeah so that's what I did I I consider that I did a calculated risk you know as far as taking steroids with the possible negative health effects which I tried to monitor I had doctors you know blood tests and everything like that so something really was going wrong at least I have you know did you ever find anything wrong no some things were a little bit out of the normal range when I was heavy my broad pressure went up like nut sky-high but it was you know 140 over 90 150 over 90 so it was it was edging up there but I was 300 pounds so you know and a couple of other readings were a little bit but nothing of great concern you know but that doesn't mean to say that they're harmless because right it's over a period of time right I equate it to smoking you know if you smoked for ten years and then you stopped apparently after 15 or 20 years you're back to like you know a guy that dinner smoke if you smoked for 20 years 25 years then maybe it's a different story have you ever seen Chris bells documentary bigger stronger faster I haven't no I'm I think I'm due to speak with those other brothers right yes Kristen I think I'll be going on that podcast at one point but actually I haven't watched it great guys really great guys they both been on here a couple times and very knowledgeable and you know Chris is just did a great documentary called prescription thugs - about the prescription drug industry and and you know getting people hooked on these pain pills but in bigger stronger faster one of the things that was fascinated about it was he was going over like we were told that this is gonna kill you we're told that all these health negative health effects he's like but where's the bodies where are the bodies like can you think about all the things that kill people obesity crushes human beings I mean it is one of the number one causes of death in America but yet it's looked at like visiter smoking alcohol description drugs all those things all these things there have been some deaths in bodybuilding that may be attributed to steroids and there's been a couple that are definitely attributed to diuretics yeah which is you know diuretics you lose a lot of water you you can lose electrolytes you lose potassium and sodium which regulate your heartbeat so then you're playing Russian roulette a little bit and a couple of people played that game and lost so yeah that's an interesting thing to point out because the diuretic aspect is critical when you see someone on stage and you see them shredded those guys are basically like almost dead right I mean well you know like probably the least healthiest fucking point you've been at all year is is when you're looking like that on the maze amazing boy I can tell you you know you feel weak as a kitten you know I feel real good at that point but you know you do whatever you got to do yeah it's required 1996 when I was competing they had actually testing for diuretics because there was a couple of deaths and the people in charge started getting concerned you know this doesn't look good and that affects your revenue and all's right they don't attempt they attempted steroid testing in 1990 but it it affected the guys look so much that you know once you've seen a guy like this or once you've seen a guy fight like this or once you've seen a guy run this fast nobody fucking wants to see anything slower than that or less than that right right the audience is not interested so they realize that real quick like fuck this would just forget about the steroid testing and anyway steroid testing is like it probably just makes it more unfair because the guy that's got more information and like the clearance times and all that stuff they don't know stop people from taking it they're just going to take it and try to avoid get around the test and it's the same in all sports and I don't care if it's fucking running riding Tour de France whatever it is it's it's going on to some degree well what the UFC is done and they've self-imposed this is they've hired Jeff Novitzky the guy who went after Lance Armstrong and he's ahead of you sada and they they just do random tests on okay and the punishments are terrible like two years suspension I mean I think first time if you get popped first time for steroids I think it's a two-year suspension now for the UFC and this is again this is self-imposed not even the Nevada State Athletic Commission or any other athletic commissions and positions and they've radically cut back on the amount of people that are first of all caught and second of all doing steroids they're just not doing him well if you do real random testing you're around yeah then we got a chance of you know laminating something it pisses athletes off because you're waking these fighters up at six o'clock in the morning but I need the rest but they take the blood they take the urine see you go back to sleep and you know that way nobody can be safe and you've seen a radical change in performances and some athletes and people were suspecting of doing steroids yeah they changed the way they look like there's so many pre and post you sada pictures of people that post them on like Twitter and Facebook and stuff like that where they you know in these groups where they talk about fights they're like the who's a you know what chaff letes have been hurt most by you sada yeah it's like it's it's interesting because they more the bigger guys or it's across the board it's bigger guys but it's also EPO like the other guy's been popped for EPO they've been popped for what does that other save male melatonin there's another one god damn it I'm trying to remember it but it's a similar thing to EPO EPO increase your red blood cell count so you get more oxygen which would give you more endurance yeah that's a I mean that's giant in the sport yeah I mean physical size is not really that much of a consideration there's very few guys that early big and muscular well here's the thing with steroids they don't I mean that can give you muscle size but it depends on your training but the kind of training you're doing right so it can also help with your endurance so just because the guys not big and muscular doesn't mean there's not benefitting from steroids you get runners and cyclists and yeah like Lance Armstrong is like you know he was on the pedestal and then he's demonized and it's down here like let's see the only guy using a bit of testosterone well you know no he was a you know Bill burr was a good friend of mine at stand-up comedian had a hilarious bit about it and he's like our psychopath was better than your psychopath yeah you got a dirty sport yeah he's like we just have one psycho that was more psycho than your psychos and he had testicular cancer right yeah so I'm assuming then you're not producing any testosterone so you're gonna have to put it in from outside how much well they had it in they used to allow testosterone replacement therapy for fighters they don't allow that anymore because guys were abusing it and also there was questions of why they were losing testosterone in the first place and one of the thoughts was damage to pituitary gland because that's apparently a big factor with fighters once they developed damage to the pituitary gland from head trauma they start decreasing the amount of testosterone their body produces and so the thought was put it back in but other doctors are saying well maybe you shouldn't be competing anymore maybe put it back in for general health and wellness but you probably shouldn't be competing anymore if this is the way your body's responding to head trauma yeah and it shouldn't really need replacement testosterone until you're like 40 or there abouts you know because you shouldn't be produced and still and there's ways to up it right even you know yeah there's natural supplements to up at the aspartic acid is one and what is the aspartic acid the aspartic acid is a compound things from amino acids but anyway they've done Studies on it that shows that it can raise your own natural testosterone some herbs tribulus terrestris right also has some you know some studies to back that up also exercise right like high-intensity exercise Sprint's certain kinds of squats always how much is going to make difference I don't really know but yeah heavy heavy exercise would raise your testosterone over a normal baseline but once you get to a certain age it starts declining in any case you know now when you started taking stuff and you started off with d-ball what like at the height what was the craziest amount of shit you were taken the most stuff I took was in the offseason when I was training real heavy trying to build sized because I had a regime that I used to get ready for contests and I was always known for like really coming in in shape so I didn't use so much stuff getting ready for a contest he was more in the offseason so like a thousand milligrams of testosterone a week some decade or a belen maybe 500 milligrams and d-ball maybe 40 50 milligrams its average and growth hormone in the offseason oh shit it's probably about 30 percent of what guys are taking now I think so based on what people are telling me I mean I have come people come to train with me that haven't even done a competition let alone in mr. Olympia and they their stack is more than that because they found it on the Internet I'm like what the fuck you know why I just saw it on the internet somewhere yeah this there's I mean you go on the internet and have a look for Dorian Yates stack I mean I've been on there and it's I'm like first of all 50% of this stuff I don't even know what it is right so I don't even know what it is and the rest of the stuff that I do recognize like if you take this you're gonna get real health problems so make insulins an issue right I mean instantly take too much insulin and you fucking keel over and in a coma I tried instant in the last couple of years I was competing because there's a few guys started using it and so on and I don't feel that I benefited from it I got a bit bigger I got more bloated the conditioning was harder to get so for me I didn't feel I got any benefit from it you can get bigger but it's not the quality you know it wasn't I was known for like super hard grainy quality and I was felt I was losing a little bit of that he was an insulin so that's my opinion I wouldn't recommend it I recommend it to people that I train with because it doesn't have any real benefits and has as a risk score why you know that's fascinating like the quality like what constitutes the quality of muscle that you're looking for well I think in my case I was known for muscle density so you could have a 20 inch arm that's like Dutch good volume we've have 20 inch arm that looks like a fucking block of steel so how do you get that look what's the difference I think the difference is in in the training that I trained very heavy and primarily quite low reps compared to body boards I was working in six to eight mostly six to eight a little bit higher on the legs ten to twelve but everything I did was like six to eight reps where most of the guys are doing 10 to 12 and they're relying more on pumping just getting a lot of blood volume into the muscle rather than overloading it so I had a density and a powerful look to my physique that the other guys when they stood next to me they didn't have that and that was just from really heavy training I think so you get the density of the muscle rather than just pumping it Volume one how did you figure out how to make that number like six to eight like why not three to five like what you know what I'm saying like what how'd you just over over many decades first of all people in the gym and also studies as well most studies would say for muscle growth you need to keep the muscle under tension from probably 40 to 60 seconds which in most cases would be 8 to 12 reps so I went a bit lower like 6 to 8 that worked really well for me but not on legs I went higher 10 or 12 on on the legs so just a bit of trial and error we know the lower reps will give you more strength and more power without the hypertrophy or the growth of the muscle so that's ideal for fighters I work with a few fighters in the UK and I try to explain this to them and it's hard for them to grasp because they think I'm in the ring I'm doing a lot of you know right I need endurance yeah you do but you're already doing that you're already doing that right so if you want to get more power behind the punch but you don't want to build muscle because if you build muscle you put on weight then you go up for weight category so whatever more power you've got is going to be negated by the fact that you fight and heavier guys so if you could stay the same weight but be more powerful and stronger without building muscle size that would be the key and that's basically like powerlifting low reps like three reps and then have a really long rest please foreign to MMA training yeah I'm gonna do a bomb bomb bomb put it back and wait for three or four minutes yeah again so you get that half the power behind the punch but without rest but without increasing your muscle size yeah because that would have you know if you if you get more power behind your punch but you're going up a weight class like so what you know you want to stay in the same weight but be stronger that would be ideal for a fighter so that seems counterintuitive for a lot of people because they assume that bigger muscles mean more power not necessarily I mean bodybuilders got bigger muscles and power lifters power lifters can lift more weight at least for one or two reps you know yeah they're training for that power boom right same thing with weightlifting it's a couple of reps but very explosive and powerful that's hard for people to understand as well like yeah throw it up you know power well that's the thing about kettlebell competitors they're not the biggest guys like they got the internal musculature the core right there's a lot of the lifting right yeah you know if you're throwing a punch I mean who cares it got huge biceps it's like the internal right throw all the way up through the core that's gonna give you that power so you got the guy he's like Fedor Emelianenko a huge fan of him I liked his fighting style me as well you know I mean a guy looks like you know it's got arms like sticks is it looks like he's got a potbelly it looks out of shape but fucking hits like a baseball bat man well early in his career he was bigger yeah you know and he stopped training weights and started training only sport-specific which is it's a very controversial subject because if you talked to modern strength to conditioning coaches they said it's absolutely the wrong approach and if phaidor continued to do strength and conditioning along with his martial arts training he probably would have been able to prolong his career but who the fuck knows if that's true that seems like a very it's it's very hard to say what would have happened but the modern approach seems to be you have to consider strength and conditioning as a huge part of any regiment in terms of like some of the elite athletes focus primarily on strength in camp and not really unskilled work because they feel like they already know how to fight like that in the brain well it's all the conditioning it's all about I mean as far as the you know the conditioning of their emotions and their ability to react is already there it's just a matter of building the ultimate gas tank and having the the body that can perform and react as quickly and as fast and recover as fast as possible but I've got the guys that hit the hardest that not necessarily the most muscular though that's some of Omar like tyron woodley who's the UFC welterweight champion he's one rare guy that kind of violates the normal build of professional MMA athletes because he's fucking jacked but he's also he's also very smart in his approach whereas like he's the consequences of engaging with him or extreme because he has tremendous power so he can pace himself more then like maybe some guys can because if you get in a firefight with him like one shot from him puts the lights out on you so he's got this ability to and he's developed a very very interesting way of fighting where he just paces his bursts but his bursts are so terrifying like when he comes at you when he can't when he does sprint your way so much faster than the average fighter and so much stronger that I guess in his mind having all that muscle and he says it's actually natural he's in his size you know there's a genetic yeah my son is is doing bodybuilding and you know I have a particularly good diet a fried chicken and burgers and stuff and his like shredded all the time well tyrants son is Jack and he's a little kid genetics are real there's no that's like me when I started I had already a physique I had the ABS I was lean I had the shape everything was there just had to get bigger so yeah jeans are a big thing as far as your body type is it insurmountable like if a guy a shit jeans can he become like a jack no no no whoa they can get better everyone's get better but you can't be Lee Haney there's it's a rare individual that you know can get up in the mr. Olympia stages probably hundred thousands of maybe millions of guys around the world that in the gym training and maybe would like to compete what do you know can everybody be a UFC champion can everybody be a basketball player know you need certain tools to start with and then you got to work on that and build that but at least for but for athletes and fighters in particular you see guys who don't have impressive physiques that have incredible records and up doing really well with their skill and their tactics and their mindset and their understanding of when engage when not to engage with bodybuilding though it's a very specific look if you're born with like slope shoulders and small hands and you know octree you need first of all you need the frame right right the frame you can't is the bone structure you can't do anything about that with with your training rights all right you need a relatively wide shoulders to smaller hips you need the limbs to be proportional for bodybuilding most of the successful guys that tend to have a little bit longer legs compared to the torso because just looks more aesthetic and makes their upper body look more like that so that's a bone structure you can't do anything about that you know you need to be born with a bone structure and then you've got muscle bellies so you've got the length of the muscle belly which is genetic so if you've got a short bicep you know it used to tell you I'll go to the gym and do preacher calls and that'll work you know you get along no your your muscle attachments are genetic so the longer your muscle bellies are the more potential they have for volume so somebody that's got uniformly long muscle bellies with a good frame and a good metabolism that tends to have naturally low body fat then you're looking at somebody with potential to be a good competitive bodybuilder if they don't have all those things everyone can improve but are you gonna go in conscious no have you ever had a guy come to you and said Dorian I want to be a champion you like kid you're fucked yeah damn I mean why you know Dorothy tells you fuck I don't say I try to be a little bit more subtle than that you know but I'm like you know I'm not here to bullshit anybody right like so if somebody asked me I'm just going to tell them like yeah you can improve man but like you know you're just gonna waste your time if you dream about they mr. Olympic because you know I don't be rude but you just you just don't have what it takes like yeah and I enjoy your training you know be healthy have fun in the gym but yeah forget about that cuz it's not gonna happen that's hard for people to hear though yeah blowing smoke up their ass and saying yeah oh yeah you know yeah pay me and yeah you can be you can have whatever you want man because somebody else is gonna tell them that have you ever seen a guy that you thought man I don't think so and then he became a great bodybuilder no no I can pretty much I mean I've been around like you know whatever 35 years have been in this game man so I can see people and I've seen people probably was more potential than me well they don't get anywhere because they don't apply themselves so it's you know you got to have the physical stuff but the glue the thing that holds it all together is this so yeah I've seen freaks in the gym but they you know first of all they're not that smart they don't really you know understand everything that's going on and usually when somebody gets something real easy they're not you know they're not really that hungry right so it's not necessarily always the guy with the most potential that you know you can beat somebody with more potential by being smarter and working hard but it's you know it's only two degrees right yeah that's what I've always said like you can get a guy who's the most dedicated the most hungry wants it the most but when you competing a basketball against Michael Jordan yeah you're kind of fucked because he wants it bad - and his genetics are just so superior there's just no way around so you can't equalize that what you're gonna do you know I saw this thing in a England recently guy came over from the States real I don't know what his name was but he was a good martial arts he was a kickboxer he was dedicated it was lean it was fed and it came over to fight this gipsy fighter over in England and this guy is like fat out of shape he turned up like 45 minutes late for the fight because he'd been drunk the night before and he came in and is just fat and looked like shit and and for like half an hour is getting his ass kicked well then I think woke up you know and they kicked the other guy's ass so this guy's been training has been dedicated is he's doing all this stuff and this guy's the night before is it's getting drunk but he's still coming and kick the guy's ass so you know it probably just had more potential or he had a hard head or something I don't know there's a lot of factors involved in fighting I mean his experience his ability to take punishment that some of it is just inherent like some people just have a like a wider face stronger neck they can take a shot better yeah these are all genetic characteristics yeah the ability to absorb punches it seems to be or at least the variables seem to be a lot of it based on maybe I got sick of bones or a shorter neck so your brain doesn't rattle as much or something mark hunts a perfect example that he's one of the best kick boxers of all time and from New Zealand yeah just a tank of a man ya know 5 foot 10 265 pounds just built like a brick shithouse cut to take him out oh dude cro cop head kicked him and he went down and got right back up it's like nobody does cro cop head kicks you that's a rat you know and he's one of the few guys that survived it well I got a my friend my business partner from New Zealand I don't know if it's true but he told me about Mark Hunt who's got a brother and the dad used to get him in the in the backyard there and just like knock the shit out of each other you know until they're like they're immune to getting hit yeah I don't feel it anymore well he's been knocked out a few times recently like but you know he's in his 40s now what is the case with fighters I don't know I noticed anyway you get a guy that's like seems to be invincible then he gets knocked out and then after that he loses it like a Chuck Liddell perfect example yeah unquestioned what is that well your brain does not want to take that kind of punishment anymore and what Chuck explained to me was that what it gets to is the point where your brain realizes that you're too tough and you're just gonna absorb this punishment and it just shuts itself off shuts down to protect ya and that's that's how he described it now obviously that's not like a neuroscientist describing it there's also the connective tissue that keeps the brain connected and and the states are that it gets looser and more tone have you ever seen connective tissue it's almost like like a strong version of cotton candies yeah it looks like it's not it's not the toughest stuff in the world and it's not supposed to take that many beatings like in the wild if you have that many beatings over a certain point that you'd be dead already somebody would have already eaten you but uh MMA seems to be safer than boxing because you don't it hit as many times yeah I would say probably overall safer but that's like saying motorcycle racing is safer than like going downhill in a skateboard 60 miles an hour you're kind of fucked it's all relative right yeah it's all like these study that they did that just came out this week on football players let's show they did they did a test on a hundred and eleven fighters or 111 football players 110 had traumatic brain injuries I saw the movie O'Connor was cold now with the concussion Smith yeah the brain damage was causing the guys to like be violent and honest often but they were saying that 87% of football players at all levels high school college all all levels have traumatic brain injury 87% what you gonna do stop exact up football stuff MMA like that's the question I'm in like you know everything's got its right its risks right every sport unless you do it like you know moderately if you do things in moderation they're good but you never do Dorian Yates in moderation no competitive sports not you know they're not the healthiest thing in the world right no no I mean you're dealing well I mean I guess there's injuries involved in basketball right but you know you're not you know lose your ability to think but even like endurance sports marathon running stuff like that these guys die younger than a sedentary person yeah because of the massive amount of free radicals they're producing which is aging the cells must have free radical from all this oxygen like so you know you you're aging yourselves you're wearing doing all this endurance sports I think what's going to come out in the future and I've been doing this myself and getting great results is very short interval training they've done studies with five-minute cardio workout and it's getting the same results as an hour why it's yeah I do 10 minutes I do what I do 90 seconds like you know moderate then I do a 30 second all-out sprint whether it's on a cross trainer or rower or kettlebells or whatever get the heart rate right up like 160 or something and then go back down do that a few times like 10 or 12 minutes and my resting heart rate was pretty good for a bodybuilder I guess it was like 54 and 55 in the morning I've had it down to like low forties 45 and I'm really yeah and that's just from doing a couple of times a week a 10-minute workout and once a week I do a hard bike ride but yeah absolutely because you want to get there you want to get the benefits from the cardio exercise which is a more efficient cardiovascular system but you don't want the negatives of all that free radicals so if you can get what you're looking for in a 10-minute workout are you gonna do an hour or two hours I don't know if it would you know be useful for a fighter because you're gonna be in a ring for all that long so you've got to condition yourself with that I'm just talking about for for a general health wow I've never even heard of such a thing yeah interval training but 10 minutes 10 minutes they've done Studies on a 4 or 5 minute workout Wow so that's I think that's the future where you you know you want to get the benefit but without the negatives do you think you could run a marathon right now better run a marathon no no I'm running is not not for me no well not definitely not for you when you were in your Prime yeah fast walking that's good when you were in your Prime how much endurance did you have like if you had to do something if you had to go up a flight of stairs real I wasn't too bad because I always did some cardio I did some cardio and stretching so I was a bit unusual for bodybuilders because that doesn't give you bigger muscles but I saw the other benefits of it because if I got more efficient cardio like I'm training legs and back stuff like that that's a huge amount of oxygen you've got to failure on squats or leg presses you know that's a huge amount of oxygen so for me to recover from that I needed a bit of cardio so I was there three or four times a week and offseason everyday getting ready for a contest but it wasn't very intense it was more like moderate I did like fast walking for an hour or I do stationary bike for 45 minutes sometimes twice a day so I was doing quite a lot of cardio work getting ready for a contest rather than starving myself oh you know I was bringing the calories down a little bit and bringing the activity of a little bit so it's a bit of both a bit of color restriction a bit of more activity more but calorie burning now when you're doing calorie restriction but you also have to keep all that mass how did you contradictory goals yeah you know training we can debate because I trained with some MMA guys in England bit of jujitsu but mainly conditioning stuff and it's fucking hard man this is hard training right it's a super hard cardio and then someone's trying to punch you in the face at the same time that's hard so we can debate about the training which sport is harder yeah because I've done a little bit of both well what's harder in bodybuilding is when you leave the gym it's still with you and when you're getting ready for a contest you're going to do more training and you're going to eat less so most sports if you train you can go train hard then you can go home and eat with bodybuilding you you know two months before a contest you you're hungry all the time because you're trying to lose you're trying to lose slowly lose the body fat or I'll maintain the muscle if you're trying to lose weight too quickly your body will preferentially burn a muscle because it's like what in fact is an emergency store right but it doesn't want to give it up so you could I like coax it out slowly you know but yeah you're gonna be hungry and you're gonna be tired for a couple of months ago for a contest that doesn't sound like fun it's not fun man it's it's a constant mental battle as well what is telling you to eat you know eat you've got to eat and at night you can't sleep properly because you go sleep a little bit and then your body's like internal alarm clock will wake you up hey if I can starve and go eat and you're like no I ain't doing that but how do you keep your body from absorbing all that muscle cuz you're carrying so much muscle is there a drug that you can take that keeps the mass well you know you're taking steroids which are anti which are anabolic and anti catabolic so that's going to stop you from losing muscle however you know if you restrict your calories too much or you know too much exercise and none of is still going to burn muscle it's just gonna lower the chances of it so you you know you've got to stack everything in your favor you're taking steroids is you know try to keep the muscle mass and stop losing it but if you do restrict too much you're gonna you're still going to lose it so you need to like one or two pounds a week very slowly keep your body from going in and shock yeah that's where a lot of fighters go wrong because they starve themselves for a couple of weeks and the lose muscle they lose strength to lose glycine from the muscle and you know they're weaker yeah they fight very weak that's that's a huge issue and a lot of fighters are choosing to go up a weight class and they're having big success Donald Cerrone is a great example that's been a quite a few fighters oh you lose it you lose that weight very slowly yeah it's not depleting it down you know what kind of diet were you on when you were competing for high protein pretty high protein offseason are still a lot of carbs medium fat and then getting ready for a contest the carbs slowly come down but I was a big guy you know to 70 to 80 I was still eating probably 3,500 calories a day which is probably more than I eat now but you know when you're that big you you're starving because what do you weigh now weigh now 2:30 something like that so yeah all that extra mass needed to be fueled yeah exactly now what when you were in say like out of contest know what your goals were to put on muscle that you would eventually like you would get bigger and bigger every year that was one of the things I would try to yeah and then maybe there's certain areas where you want to like work on at some point that's a bit behind so you put more focus on that and a bit less on something else to try and keep the balance it might sound strange an hour but when I first competed my first contest I lost to a guy called Mohammed Ben Aziza and his back was just like freaky thick it was like 3d coming out and I just stuck in my mind I'm like I fucked I put a picture of him on my fridge at home I put a picture in the gym and funny enough later on in my career I became known you know for the guy with the best back kind of thing so yeah I was inspired by other people to do that well kind of back for a couple of years what is the difference between the way you approach nutrition when you were competing versus the way people do it today because so much changes in nutrition I mean it seems like every five or six years like you know oh no low-fat sout now you go high-fat you know high things are out now you go low carbs you know it could change back and forth again I mean I think the the seven is like Arnold area Franks and they go more low carbs getting ready for a contest but then you lose size more quickly why do you lose size more quickly that way because you get catabolic you haven't got the energy so you you know your body can use the amino acid from muscle for energy so there's a balance there and also you lose the glasses and storage your muscle is 70% water and the water the water holds carbohydrates in a muscle glycogen so you lose that as well so you lose that bit of volume it when you lose the guys didn't you lose the water so shrink down a little bit so my approach was are more was higher carbohydrates especially in the offseason getting ready to a contest to cut them down but not you know not zero and fairly low fat I think people now realize that fats more important and there's probably more fat in the diet then there was back then which which I think is healthy fats have just got a bad rap and it's bullshit you know well that's we've talked about that several times in the podcast but there was a New York Times article recently about how the sugar industry paid off scientists to fake results and that was done in the give the 50s or 60s and that's haunted people to this day they think that fats are bad for you well I suppose they're essential I may be wrong with the organization what I think it was World Health Organization they the basically submitted a study that showed how bad sugar was and some Department of the US government which is a lot of money from the sugar lobby basically said I think you want to reconsider this you know can you like so that's where the whole fats are bad you know low fat came from they knew back then that's how bad sugar is so I found it amusing when I first came to the state in 1990 got all these low-fat products and I've called my friends at home B how fucked up this is man they got low-fat muffins what's the fucking low-fat they're full of sugar though low fat low fat yogurt low-fat muffins it's fucking full of sugar it's the worst thing you could have you know so people thought they were being out there but they were being misled and it makes you fat yeah nothing wrong with fats as long as they're natural you know if you get the fats in baked goods and all this shit you know that that's not good but natural fats in animal products and coconuts and all that stuff it's great now what would you use for carbohydrates did you have a preferred method or did you very complex stuff like oatmeal was a big thing use oatmeal brown rice sweet potatoes and some fruit and fibrous vegetables oh those are the main things that I use like stick nothing fancy you know did you mix your portions up in like little Tupperware boxes or something like that so that you could know exactly what to eat I used to weigh my food like pretty much all the time or they need in restaurants very rarely and yeah I used to pack them up in boxes because you know you've got to have it all the time right yeah so that was one of the things I didn't miss man so relieved and I carry another fucking plastic boxes around with the food and just go to a restaurant and eat whatever I want you know and have an ice cream if you want exactly that must have been nice when you realize you could just just eat yeah offseason wasn't too bad because I eating good food but a lot of it but yeah getting ready for a contest I mean that was the real mental test you know because your whole body's telling you you've got to eat man even at night I said you wake up you could gotta eat no no I'm gonna eat watch MTV for a half an hour maybe fall back to sleep a little bit hopefully you know so yeah the diet thing I don't miss that at all it was you know is a tough mental challenge and I did it and you know whenever you get through a challenge I think it makes you stronger but you know I don't have to do that again yeah I could only imagine now when you give these seminars and you talk to these young body builders that are coming up how do you even you kind of have sort of a holistic approach to life down there just you're about health and wellness and but when you're coaching these kids are talking to these kids about how to be successful in competitive bodybuilding is a multiple time mr. Olympia one of the greatest of all time if not the greatest you mean you can't have a holistic approach can you kind of help yes they coming to me for bodybuilding advice right and I don't have the body now necessarily but I got all the information here that I can put across to people for the training for the nutrition but it's called specific you know you want to be a competitive bodybuilder this is what you got to do I'm not a competitive bodybuilder now my diet and my training is geared toward what my goals are which is functionality and health and well-being and that's that's what I'm in so now that's where I'm at I'm not a bodybuilder anymore you know I'm body reducer if anything right and I feel good man I fucking got a suit from Hugo Boss a couple of months ago off the rack and this was like so happy I could just buy a suit off the rack before I have it made and if we go for a fitting go for another fitting all that I'm sure if they looked at the measurements on paper they were like what the for what is this and I was like this wide going down wardrobe what is it you know so yeah I look on the other side of it you know young guys coming up maybe they think that's strange like and ask me don't you do look at the pictures back and think wow look like that I'm like no I don't look at I just look at that and I think wow that was fucking extreme and what I did and that's crazy and it's incredible but there was competition for yourself I did a little bit sometimes when I look at those black-and-white pictures giant picture of dorian yates and his if you got any of those black-and-white pictures man and that's just like exam there it is that's like you couldn't really fit any more muscle on to that frame really you're not sorry no I know I went to places and I did things that other people you know in the gym look at your fucking forearms well my there's a thing for arms I never did any training for forearms all that was just from gripping the bar when I was doing back training mainly and and some bicep training and stuff 19 inch forearms and I didn't do a single fucking exercise for them apart from gripping onto get that it's so ridiculous well that's a good picture but it's not me I don't know how dare you Jamie often on door you keep going to your right no no down where you were yeah go to your right one more that one BAM side tricep jaysus cry it's from onstage picture from mr. Olympia so what you can see if you look on the legs you can see the thinness of the skin and the like you know entity of the muscle underneath like there's no fat there's no water between the skin layer and then the muscle layer what a body but what percent of body fat did you get down to well I don't really know because I had skin fall calipers used to do the same for calipers and they're not accurate they used to get down to like 3.5 probably like a month out but I know I got leaner after that but they didn't really register because they're not that accurate after that point so I don't know maybe three percent but it's you know nobody measures your body fat it's what you look like it's a visual thing it's really what you look like in the mirror but how did you know like how much water to drink and when to back off and experience I didn't really see your fucking legs dude I don't restrict water intake until like maybe 24 hours before the contests look at your right leg there that's preposterous yeah that's huge medialis right over the knee there yeah that's a lot of sick work man that's like that's like I used to train legs pretty much once a week and for four or five days of every week I had trouble sitting on the toilet I had trouble moving around I mean if I didn't I wouldn't be happy man I like to feel that fucking pain pain in the ass pain in the leg just to sit down but hey satisfying because you know you've fucking done some damage right if it's like that and the damage repairs itself to get slightly bigger and stronger bodybuilding is just an adaptation to stress you know you put a certain stress your body's going to adapt to it fuck I need to get bigger and stronger so I can handle this stress next time that's basically what it is so you're continually trying to stress yourself like anything like you want to get better cardio got it stress your cardio system so it adapts yeah there's no other way right to get that big I mean there's no shortcuts there's nothing you can do there's no easy route well I don't know it looks like guys are looking for the easy route now because I don't see them training that hard but then you don't see the quality of their physiques the guys are big now but look at the quality it's not the same it's not the same okay not the same kingi was generally accepted in bodybuilding that the nineties was the peak of competitive physics as far as the standard and the depth of the standard there was like six to eight guys on that stage that were like really like if you're off you know there's places could change now you've got one guy Phil Phil Heath there's a mr. Olympia and it's pretty like distance between him and the next few guys now what is it though that I mean is it doesn't it open the door for a current modern-day Dorian Yates like some super dedicated person me physiologically people can still do the same things that you did yeah but things have changed since the nineties there's a lot more avenues that people could choose to go down as like doing a sport or I mean for instance UFC it didn't exist right in the early 90s I remember watching the first show on it was in New York I watched on TV the first the very first one you know with the boys Gracie so you got you got MMA you've got a CrossFit and you've got all these other competitions now in in the in the bodybuilding arena that's not bodybuilding it's men's physique whether we're the board shorts and they're good have the nice physique and abdominals a kind of physique that most right will aspire to have I guess you've got classic bodybuilding so got a lot of different avenues and I think the interest in pure bodybuilding is a lot less than I mean in the 90s I don't want it to be a bodybuilder it was like hugely popular yeah what's interesting now what is this Jamie what are you pulling up here this is a mr. Olympia from 1996 as myself Sean ray in the middle and that's Ronnie Coleman on the end who became an eight-time mr. Olympia guys are on Jack also it's so hard to tell ceil I'm like I'm looking at this and I kind of fucking like well it's also got to be hard for that tiny dude that's next to you you know tiny dude has always been unhappy because it got beaten by me but thing is I had a great physique just like Frank Zane had a great physique right you know if he was the same size as Arnold maybe he would have beat him but he wasn't the same size as Arnold and Brian goes throw the gentle not there mr. Shawn right he had a great physique but it you know I was twice as big so a big guy always baits of the good little guy right yeah yeah it's a crazy sport man now what about the top guys today like I said Shawn Heath is the number one guy I'm Phil hey Phil I'm sorry now there's so many different avenues now and a lot of them a lot of people are going towards like the Internet route because you can make a lot of money as like an Internet like famous person for being a bodybuilder then you selling things and selling areas l Heath pretty jacked yep she's a Phil Heath is you know is not very wide in the shoulders that's his weak point but he's got huge long muscle bellies on most of his body his pecs are not great but the rest you know the rest is uh it doesn't really have any weak points that's why is as a head of everybody else and you just think there's just less people doing it now there's less people going into competitive bodybuilding because there's a lot more avenues and I think it's less popular now because it's almost like peaked out with myself and run in and gone down a little bit it's like how do you you know how do you surpass it got to a peak and guys are trying to do that so that they you know that they're trying to get big and they're getting big but they're getting big with a big waste and everything as well so it's not the same it's not the same look it's not they don't have the same quality that's got to be super dangerous isn't it when you see those guys most enormous bloated bellies yeah there's a huge debate and then like what is that you know what is it I don't know those organs well here's the thing initially that's what people thought right and I my way started get a little bloated around 96 97 maybe 97 when I was using insulin right got a little bloated a little distended but when I retired it went down and I actually in England because I was always like I'm taking steroids for this sport because I'm a professional when I'm not competing I'm going to take them so stop taking them and also I took growth hormone and that was the thing a lot of people think growth hormone is gonna increase the size of internal organs and that's why guys are getting bloated waistline so I went and had a real I mean a battery of tests where they actually measure all your internal organs and mine were all totally normal apart from my heart was a bit bigger and stronger but that's just normal athletic heart so that wasn't the case so I perhaps it's fat that's building up around the internal organs or maybe it's just a lot of water in the intestines and just bloats the waste out oh short answer is that the short answer is I don't really know who's that guy in the far left that's like a turtle shell does another good turtle shell yeah Jesus Christ so that could be insulin that could be a variety is we only seen this kind of thing happening since the guys are using insulin and igf-1 insulin-like growth factor Wow so yeah it's not a good look it's not a you know weird the turtle shell look is so weird it literally looks like so it's like the guys have got big like but everywhere systemic like growth you know when you're training with weights you you know you major muscles are going to grow but not around the waist can thicken a little bit but not that now when you got off of everything retired what was the crash like well it wasn't something I was ready for I had a lot of things going in my life I had a divorce I had somebody close to me pass away and I'm you know retiring so you know they say a death in the family or divorce or retirement is like major stressful event about having an all fucking three at the same time while you're not while you're coming down from steroids so yeah I definitely suffer from depression anxiety I don't like I don't know what's going on like why do I feel like this I didn't even like now I know where because if fucking could stop cold turkey because I'm extreme I'm like I'm using them because I'm doing this I'm stop now and stop so and I had no real help there was no real like this guys now in especially in the states that you know they they specialize in you patients that are using steroids and all that you know possible side effects and coming off and all that stuff I don't really have any of that so I just went cold turkey and after about two years my normal testosterone was still not coming into the normal so then I went on the replacement therapy which is like twice a month testosterone replacement and yeah then I felt normal again so the the calm down like you you're taking this work what were you taking like right before you stopped like what was the do you remember probably about a thousand milligrams a week total of testosterone a total of everything all kinds stuff default everything bit of testosterone bit of death care or something like in there and then stop and then you know was it a gradual effect we're body's freaking out or was it like almost instantaneous that's probably after a few months I started like noticing I wasn't feeling too good finally enough like sex drive didn't totally disappear and actually had my daughter was conceived while I was not on anything so I mean they did trials with testosterone is a male contraceptive and it was moderately effective but not enough that they would market it so yeah probably like her six to nine months it was really not not feeling good at all and you know there's a lot of factors there if I was still taking steroids but those things happen in my life would I've felt as bad I don't know probably not but there's definitely a lot of traumatic stuff going on all at the same time now was there any conventional wisdom in the bodybuilding community of how to slowly cycle off or what the factors would be and how you could mitigate them not at that time now twenty years on I mean you can go on the internet and find a ton of information but but not really then the only things guys were using with HCG which is like helps to choose your own testosterone low-mid clomid and some natural stuff like that I mean I remember going to an endocrinologist and asking him like you know what should I do is I'll do HCG and this and that and he's like look at me and I said you know what Dorian you probably know more than me you know he's talking about this situation somebody coming off steroid you didn't have a clue rates are different yeah but now yeah you got guys out there that have a whole I did a seminar Pirin in Canada and Ben Johnson was there actually the guy that Olympic gold medalist yeah for a while he was there with his doctor and a couple other doctors there and one of the doctors told me that absolutely every guy that was in a hundred metres race tested positive every guy but I think was CBS was covering the contest and they're like we can't fucking you know can't have every guy like yeah I've got to choose one and make sure it's not American really that's the story they told me and I believe that man there's definitely some real good evidence that they're all doing some guy was just a scapegoat I feel felt bad for him he was like fucking demonized I remember all the newspapers and I remember my son went to school and they did a whole thing at school about you know and he came home he must have fucking known his dad was jacked up like like the guy was cheating and he shouldn't do that and all this stuff they told him at school you know like all right so I explained to you in about holder and he also had no recourse like Lance Armstrong today as a podcast he's done a bunch of interviews he can tell his story and now you know I mean I think there was a period of time where Lance was demonized but over time that is greatly subsided and people now recognized no he literally was in a sport where everyone was cheating yeah but is it cheating well is it if everyone's doing it is it cheating the real issue I think was deception and lawsuits and saying that he didn't do it and suing people who said he did and there's a lot of stuff that wasn't exactly the smartest thing to do but you're dealing with a cornered person who's a super competitive alpha male trying to figure his way out of this mess that he's found himself in and this mess that exists systematically or systemically in this entire industry the entire sport that he's involved in some yeah I remember there was a car that got stopped in the border a few years ago in the Tour de France going you know France to someone across the border anyway and it was a team car yeah right and they stopped the team car and it was just full of EPO and steroids and all this stuff you know so it's how when was the first Tour de France I don't know but I know and weren't one of the very early ones though I think the guy that was winning he died because he was using amphetamines when back in whatever I don't know 1910 1920 or something like that so it's there it's part of the sport when I came into bodybuilding it's not like I invented steroids they were already there you know my first mr. Olympians in 1965 Larry Scott was the mr. Olympia in 1965 and he said he was using steroids and that was 1965 so when did they start being used I don't know but for sure in the early sixties nineteen sixty five they had steroids when did they invent steroids I believe well you had testosterone I mean testosterone was used in the Second World War the Germans were using that with the SS soldiers so injectable testosterone was available then steroids which are a more refined version of testosterone I think late fifties how is it more refined in what way so you've got testosterone as a male hormone so it's basically 50% Andrew Janak that's mail like characteristics 50% anabolic repair build so they wanted to take this they wanted this part the anabolic and minimize the androgenic because that's what gives you side effects prostate growth and all that stuff so they tried they refined it so that those effects were minimized and more of an anabolic effect that was the idea and as a guy called John Ziegler I think and because they found out the Eastern Bloc they had their own had their own stuff called Torino ball so Sigler invented Dyna ball and I don't know don't quote me if I could be wrong but I think was about 58 or something like that he developed that for us weightlifting team 1958 I think was 58 yeah but before that you had testosterone so who knows what when people started using it but for sure from the early sixties it's been a part of bodybuilding and then other sports and they used to be a disclaimer inside the steroid thing saying anabolic steroids do not increase athletic performance that's hilarious right so they stated this and they also told guys if you take this you fucking balls are going to drop off you can rock and I gonna get liver cancer so guys started using them and seeing that's all bullshit right so then they don't wanna listen to anything these medical guys got to say cuz you aligned to us then right so you're gonna be lying to us all the time not necessarily slower yeah because you do have chances of side effects but it you could say it's been greatly exaggerated and so that's the problem with propaganda and deception right yeah just tell the fucking truth man and let them deal with it and that's what I do because I saw all this stuff on the internet about what I'm supposedly doing and I thought young guys are going to read this and maybe they gonna do it so I did an article in a magazine muscular development I said here this is what I did this is what I did in office this is what I did for a contest and these are my opinions and you know my honest opinion is like I don't think it's worth it unless you you know you're competing and so on but ultimately it's up to you let me give you the information what you do is up to you and I don't know if 70% of the people like this a bullshit he didn't really you must have talked much more than this because I'm taking this actually I'm taking more than this and I don't look like him Oh tough shit man you know I know a lot of guys that take more stuff than me then couldn't even compete in a contest and even good enough is there a certain amount where it doesn't help you I think it gets to like the cup is full right you know it's just a matter of hard work as Cup is falling more than that isn't there going to help you anymore it's just gonna you increase your chances of negative effects so when I was an amateur my policy was always take as little as possible to get the maximum effect and when that's not working then it you can go up a little bit more you know but if you go a day one and just throwing everything in there like your body's gonna get used to that way you're going to go where would you get steroids where where did I used to get them yeah I mean when I got them in UK was just from the gym when I first started I mean people were bringing him in with trucks loads full from Europe and there was not you know the authorities are not even aware of it or concerned about it or anything now the policy at least in UK and I depends from every country in Europe but in UK it's perfectly legal to have steroids for your own use so you gonna be driving your car with a bunch of steroids on the fucking passenger seat and the police call you and they're like what's this - my steroids okay for your own personal use is what selling making money and not paying your taxes that's all they care about now that's I think how it should be you know as long as there's education as long as you're not lying but the problem is when you lie to people about the effects of things then they think you line them about pain pills yeah I and about all sorts other stuff that is actually deadly I think all fucking drugs should be legal and should put money into education and treatment and that's what they did in Portugal and then the fucking results right down Glenn Greenwald actually post something today about that showing how it's changed over time and gotten actually better since they have made especially in particular marijuana so they've made marijuana legal and start legalizing drugs in Portugal they've had far less incidences of people having like real issues absolutely and the money they're using it to re-educate people and get them out of that cycle and try and get them back into society trying to get them a job and all that stuff you're just going to punish people for doing it how the fuck they ever gonna get better you know there's also a problem with telling people not to do something and they want to do it young Joyce is illegal oh yeah there it is you can have it if you want but this is all the negative consequences and what do you want to do and now people are choosing not to do it the body builds body builders that died did any of them die from steroids or did they die from complications involving a host of different issues well that's hard to say because there's been quite a few body builders and mainly male and mainly the bigger guys well there's been a couple of women that have died from heart attacks so did steroids contribute to that possibly what else were they doing you know their individual cases who knows right here where they're taking pain pills anti-inflammatories where they're doing recreational drugs there's a lot of a lot of factors there but I think it would be probably fair to say that using steroids over a long term will probably increase your risk of heart disease perhaps I think it causes some inflammation and the line and the arteries can raise your blood pressure a little bit and so on so yeah I I I compared it to smoking you know probably not as bad though yeah so you know the way I look at it as I smoked for 10 years and then I stopped now speaking of smoking good stuff how did you get how did you find out about DMT and how did you get involved cuz I read something about you having these positive DMT experiences yeah Wow how strange is it reading about you know this massive bodybuilder now getting into psychedelic drugs well and speaking openly about that first time I did ayahuasca was Brazil I met my wife who's outside she lived in Brazil so we went out to the Amazon and but this was like 10 years ago you know so people weren't really not like now people know what ayahuasca is because so much information out there yourself talking about I'm talking about is a ton of stuff on the internet wasn't so much then but I heard about it and I heard about this it's life-changing experience and all that stuff so we were out in Brazil and we've got this guide and I asked him for ayahuasca and he was like bring me these two balls of brown stuff I don't even know to this day if it was really I asked her but I just got really sick and didn't see any great revelations apart from I got this thing in my head stop poisoning herself but the night before I'd been out drinking and getting drunk and everything so you know that was my experience with that then a friend of mine out here in California actually I knew about DMT I used to live in Amsterdam and like I read the DMT spirit molecule and all that stuff so I knew about it but I had no idea to get this stuff away you can get it from and everything so a friend of mine got it and that was my you know first experience of like leaving the room no to speak and and then since then I had some very positive ayahuasca experiences but with a shaman and doing properly and preparing like five days of you know restricted diet and no sex and all these kind of things you do to prepare and also afterwards so DMT is like blow the fucking doors off your perception and realize that this world we're in is like you know it's nothing it's just a little illusion right there's so much more outside of it so there was that but with the DMT I think it's like you've got a computer with like so much storage space and you got it's like a thousand times more than you can retain so you see all this stuff and while you're there you're like haha I know everything oh yes but when you come back how much of it can you hold on to you know right so you've seen it and that's like makes you look at everything differently what the ayahuasca is over hours so I feel like from the iOS era has to be benefited more I was like going through therapy or something because it was much slower and I couldn't digest it you know right so but doing it with the Shaymin I did it with a guy called Guillermo Averill oh and he's one of the top guys in the world from Peru he comes to Spain a couple of times a year so I did it with him and yeah it's probably I don't know it's probably two or three years since I did DMT because I sat down one day and I said right actually I fasted for two days before so I'd be like just in the zone and I said right I'm gonna sit down I've got my DMT here I got my vaporizer yeah I'm gonna fucking smoke as much DMT as I possibly can so like like you know to like gone and pass out so I had that experience and since then I just I don't feel any need to do it I don't think there's anything more I can take from it you know I've had many people tell me the same thing they had such a profound breakthrough experience that they're like okay I get it yeah is so crazy one in around tooth I want to say like two thousand eight or nine or something like that and I took a long time off I didn't do it again - like five years later maybe yeah it's pretty intense I mean the ayahuasca is nice because it comes in nice and subtle and you go through hours of this thing but DMT is like last time I know you feel very anxious when you'd like like it's almost like you leave in your body and you know what do you know yeah so you get that bit of anxiety but once you go once it goes oh yeah yeah that's cool but if you've done it more than one time in a day like multiple times in a night no I just you know just blessed it as far as it could go and that was it I've done it several times over the course of a few hours and you know you're more comfortable letting go that way and some sort of a strange way but it never gets less alien oh we had a I gotta mention his name I don't know his name but we had an experience me and my friend a few months ago that I've never seen before because usually people take DMT they're very calm and sit in the chair and you go off and you might start laughing but you know you don't move much right and this guy he just like freaked out like it wasn't for ten minutes or half an hour my friend was a former may fights used to fight with shamrocks so be he know he know wrestling techniques so he had to hold this guy on the floor to stop him from hurting himself because he was totally freaking out so I could see the guy was going through some something traumatic from the past so yeah today I messaged a mistake hey did you ever find out what the guy what what what was that you know cuz it was he said yeah it was from his birth what who's from his birth when he was born he had the cord around his neck oh geez and he went back and he relived this and like so that had been in the back of his mind all his life subconscious you know subconscious has a huge effect on us but we don't know it's there so now he opened that box and let it out and that's gone now you know so it can be therapeutic I thought this guy's like wow he's gonna but when it came back as I like your goodies like yeah I'm good I'm like do you know what just happened is like no that's a good thing we filmed at them and go home and watch this I had a friend of freaked out too he freaked out he threw up took his shirt off was running around saying a bunch of crazy shit and then after he came down you know we calmed him down it took like 10 15 minutes he goes okay well obviously I'm a work in progress did he know what it was sure why everything is like most of our shit is from that right yeah from the developing years no for sure yeah I mean in especially like real traumatic bonds abuse and being beaten by his stepdad and a bunch of fucked up shit that was just haunting him but you know helps you to come to terms with that especially the iOS because it's longer I felt like the first time I did IRS cure properly with a shame and I felt like I was a different person the next day I was like for 20 years of fucking therapy or something there's a lot of stuff at work time in mind I could even see other people's point of view on things and that I couldn't see before and that's huge right other people's point of view yeah especially a guy like you who's so determined and goal-oriented and just cut out all the bullshit and get it done yeah it can be a little insensitive to other people's feelings around it because just like nothing keep on my way that's a male thing in particularly right and then it's like sterilized and bodybuilding and intensity and competition and then being the best arguably the best ever and just fucking finding everyday my son said to me a couple of weeks ago he's like that you don't see yourself as other people see you so what do you mean he said like I remember when I was a kid first of all the size you know was fucking huge but it's your persona you might have said to me something very like normal like you know you know whatever you what are you doing with a dog like just something normal I said I'll be like oh because just your your your presence made me feel like that you know Brian that's got to be weird me a little tiny kid your dad's a gorilla yeah I remember he did it a kickboxing right so he got his black belt when I was about 11 or something like that and that was my thing I used to take him to kick box him and pick him up and it's like dad can you just can you wait outside like what do you mean they're army to come in and like yeah but everyone's like freaking out and looking at you and [Laughter] I'm coming inside man semi-anonymous in crowds now yeah yeah unless someone's a hardcore bodybuilding fan well there's the thing not necessarily slow because because that the interviewers I did on London real and I talked about ayahuasca and DMT and spirituality and reality and all this stuff I get so many people coming up to me like then they're not from the gym I get housewives at young kids like you it's almost like you're the guy from London real you're the guy that you know so I got a whole bunch of other people that appreciate what I'm saying about spirituality about reality and life and they're like fuck man what you said that really helped me and I got so many letters or emails and stuff people's you know like they just took something away from what I was saying so I mean that's that's really why I do these interviews is trying to help the whole general vibe and the you know put it out there and there's a whole consciousness awakening a revolution going on now and I'm just want to push some Domino's you know and like create that effect and then you know if you touch one person they touch somebody else and it's like you know the butterfly wings flap here and the other side of the world is a you know yeah it's really on me or something it does seem to be working in that in that regard is the time and it's the time as so many people that are more aware now than like twenty years ago there's any kind of like meaning its parallels to bodybuilding right that when Arnold first started doing it there was very little information for Harley and you guys got to see what they did and build upon that and more information came out and now because the internet there's so much information almost too much information people are aware more of what it's all about well with psychedelics I mean 20 30 years ago there's so much ignorance there's so little understanding of and also so little understanding especially when it comes to something as Extreme as DMT there's still a giant percentage of our population doesn't even know what it is yeah I mean they should all take it especially fucking politicians I like to get those politicians man I fucking get them in a room and force them to take DMT and then see how they're going to behave afterwards yeah how they're going to look at the world and and treat people after they had that experience that I don't think it can be you know so self-centered and unfeeling as most of them are after you had that experience I think that any breakthrough psychedelic experience whether it's psilocybin or LSD or DMT there's well pretty much you know ego does offering rode to the same place you know well Terence Mckenna used to say that DMT is the center of the mandala the way I described DMT is it's like mushrooms times a million plus ions and then it just it seems so titanically bizarre that there's like I've tried to describe it to people but I always say look I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna do it yeah I'm gonna give you some bullshit word because you can't it's no way to have the words right to put it into words you know you can attempt to do I went to this place where's not a place but right I don't have the word for it the places everywhere is like and there's colors there's numbers the shapes and people thing things and there's like yes everything is all one fucking thing and what I noticed is like my breath was connected to it I don't know how it happened what was in the trip and I went like that and the whole thing moved yes I really let me try this then and then the whole thing moved and then there was music playing and the music was part of the thing as well yeah like the thing I don't even know what to call it the thing the place I don't have a word you know we played a bunch of these shaman Iker oh yeah and the shaman eager this is the last time I did it and the shaman eek arose like literally made the DMT images dance yeah like they had figured out a way with these sounds and songs to integrate these beats into DMT trips and as you would take these trips these shamans had figured out the right sounds and songs and how to make the trip more intense and yeah sort of guided in a strange way well that's what I had with the the chemin with the ayahuasca he comes around and he sings these are carros and there's like changes tone and then it goes deeper bass in his chest and it's like it's it becomes part of it you know and I was even moving involuntarily I was my arms going up a body was moving and it's like I'm not doing this I don't even know how it's happening it's like somebody's picking my arms up and a nerve and Elizabeth you know started dancing around with this becoming part of this rhythm Wow I had experienced once one of the first times ever did DMT where I saw the difference between negative and positive thinking like I started thinking negative and there was all this like black and dark green like these threatening shapes and colors and then something recognized what was going on in my brain that these shapes and images were connected to negative thinking and I relaxed in the the shapes kind of like settled down and then I started thinking positive like I heard all these like expressions of love but like you're hearing it but you're not really hearing it it's like the thoughts are getting into your head like someone's trying to say it without using words and then I started thinking positive and from those dark images blossom these like beautiful like geometric flowers and colors and impossibly spectacularly beautiful images and I was like oh and I recognized in my mind there is an actual thing that happens when you think negatively and an actual it's not just some sort of an effect driver that effect the program you're in a program yeah and your thoughts the program's coming toward you and your thoughts are going and it's interacting with the program and that's why conflict like interpersonal conflict between people can be so negative it's not just as simple as you and some person getting into an argument it's those dark images and those negative forces becomes a part of your system I had exactly the same thing so but it was almost like a tunnel I was in this tunnel and it was the same thing I was like yeah all these images around and scary and everything and I was like I instinctively I knew to be very relaxed yeah and I started laughing like fuck you they're not even real you're not even real and when I said that it went away and I just got this thing that came into my head you've just been in the valley was it called the valley of the shadow of death sooner the Lord's Prayer I think yeah yeah you though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil because God's by the side right I vaguely remember it from school or something but I got this thing like you were there and you're in the valley of the shadow of death and because you like fuck you would like a heart it's not even real it just it just disappeared I'm gonna went to somewhere really nice Wow yeah I just wonder how much is real you know it's it's such a hippie thing to say like how much is real I don't know you know I've been having these thoughts a lot lately like how much of how much of life do you manifest how much of life is real because it's such a bullshit thing to think it's such a hippie thing to think and so many people that say that are so annoying yeah but scientists are saying the same thing quantum physicists are saying was a thing of surnames professor gates now if you're familiar with him professor gates and he said that they've broken down reality into the smallest level and it's a computer code yes I've seen that guy not only the code it's a specific computer code of zeros and ones and it was invented in the 1940s by somebody yeah I've seen that guy being interviewed we actually talked about it with Neil deGrasse Tyson and he I tried to get him to sort of break it down and explain but what it is is essentially that when you break reality down to the smallest level it mimics a self-correcting computer put code not just not just a computer code but a computer code that's self-correcting which is right there I just said a bunch of noises that I don't even understand you know it's just it's gone beyond my head but now you're getting spirituality on science right he's coming together because the scientists are saying what spiritual masters or they're already telling us that we live in an illusion and everything is inside not outside they were saying that thousands of years ago but is real like you have to work hard or you don't get results Yeah right like you're you're hard fast pragmatic reality of being the best body builder in the world it revolves around actual work real results in this in this reality in this program but also to do physical um yeah probably there was a lot of mental shit going on there too absolutely the work was being done but also there was probably a vlog all day I mean that's all I thought about literally all fucking day so you know I had to have the physical goods to make it happen I could dream about being basketball player or they probably wouldn't help me because I'm not built to be a basketball player but those thoughts were just going out all the time and I was a kid in Birmingham industrial city in England and I was thinking I'm gonna go to America and I'm gonna be a bodybuilder and everyone around me was like the fuck you talking so yeah that was those thoughts all the time so I think it's like a holographic program but we influenced it we interact with it with our thoughts that's kind of where I'm getting at yes in some way and they're guys that were spiritual masters like Buddha and the guy that called Jesus and all know that apparently did things that were called miracles because they were outside the box outside the physical reality we live in how can you walk on water that's not possible right but if you were so advanced that you really knew there was a program then you can like hack the program and that's how they're able to do it they kind of remove themselves out of the program hmm yeah how can it how can you you know how can guys levitate or what they can yeah well I don't know I wasn't there see that's the thing there's no evidence whatsoever that anybody actually can levitate well people have witnessed people doing it there's a lot of people said some weird shit the problem with people saying things is they might have literally seen that but it doesn't mean it wasn't a hallucination and then again it doesn't mean that a hallucination isn't an alternative reality what is it you know people say you loosen eight when you take LSD or DMT you just to loosen a brain but are you or you're just seeing more stuff that you can't normal to see because now you're shifted your your your vibration you know yeah well I'm one of the things that I tried to explain to someone about DMT that I've kind of used over and over again since then is that I felt like I met with a divine force of the universe like I've or a divine force maybe my puny little brain could only comprehend this level of divinity and that maybe perhaps there was something even more profoundly more powerful and knowledgeable and wise past that but I wasn't ready to perceive it then maybe there's levels to that that it's fractal just like everything else and someone said like well you know how do you know that wasn't a hallucination like oh well it could have been but here's the deal whether or not it was or wasn't the experience is the same like if you really go into some other dimension in milk or you take a drug in which you experience going to another dimension and meeting God it's still the same experience the exact same experience and why why is everybody's experience kind of similar right you know we're gonna have a totally different fuckin illusion no one seems to think it's no big deal yeah no one that I know who's ever done DMT is like yeah yeah it's no big you're not gonna be the same afterwards you know you get your your perspective is it going to be different your point of view is going to be different and it can only pop I've never I don't know anybody that's done DMT and then they've said that was not a positive experience I didn't get anything from that every fucking body I know who said that that's like what are noises that come from my mouth and nobody's like nobody's ever said to me that even the guy that I saw that looked like he was getting raped by the devil was a guy getting raped by the dome I didn't see that but I saw his eyes and that's how I imagine somebody's eyes would look like look like in absolute terror is all I can say absolute terror soreness guy's eyes for like 20 minutes but when it came back he was like all right do you know what happened oh yeah that was great I'm like okay you need to watch this video when you go home because we film do you man I had a friend my friend Doug Stanhope and he's talked about this many times on stage I got him high on DMT at my house and he's the only guy that I've ever got high on DMT that I worried about cuz he fell over on the couch and started moaning and like foam was coming out of his mouth he was moment but he's so unhealthy he smokes cigarettes he drinks constantly and I was like oh my god did I break my friend that I I was really worried I was like maybe I should have considered the fact this fucking guy doesn't really take care I think I think when your systems kind of toxic yeah don't get the best oh he came out of it he got great results he came out of it it was a fantastic experience for him he came out of it with all these revelations we had great conversation about it but in the moment he was like [Music] and I was like oh no I've killed him oh this guy was like spasming and kicking I mean my friend had to hold him on the floor to stop him smashing the furniture himself Wow and I was like thinking he was being chose like 10 minutes 15 20 I was like I was starting to get concerned like Christ half an hour later he came out of it but he's glad he did it now but it couldn't see himself at the time you know do you ever float floatation tank yeah I did it once and you know funny enough like when I was a kid I read Frank Zane Frank Zane was doing floatation tanks back in the 70s yeah those Samadhi tanks so I always wanted to do it and I saw this place when I was over in England slow now so I went in there and I said to the guy like talking about it I said listen man let me ask you a question I said is it good to smoke weed before you go in there it's like I'll tell you the truth they said a lot of people come here they smoke weed outside before they come in you said what the first time I think should just go with nothing and see how it goes and I'll be honest I was in there for like it was an hour thing after 40 minutes I just got really fucking bored I thought to myself I meditate every day yeah so I was like this is like I don't feel this is any better than me during my meditation I'm just getting kind of the same thing so I don't know really I wasn't I wasn't blown away by it like I expected to be to be honest but then you know done DMT and I asked her and I said and everything so maybe my expectations were too high I always give the same advice I'd say don't smoke weed the first time just go on and experience it but my thoughts are that isolation tanks and the isolation tank experience is something that it takes time to really fully relax and settle in and there's layers to the onion and you got to go deeper and deeper and peel those layers away and I've done it so many times I have one in my basement so I've done it so many times now that when I go in I can slide right in almost immediately but I'll tell you this I rarely go and sober I almost always go in high as a kite and edibles preferably are the way to really I can have full-blown psychedelic experiences in the tank on edibles full-blown visuals well going into the jungle experiencing the center of the universe like intense intense stuff because the relaxation the the fact that you are the only information you're taking in is like there's a mild feeling of the water on your body very mild that you have to think about to be aware of and occasionally you'll touch the sides yeah of the tank and you have to kind of write yourself there's no some water gets in the air or something but other than that don't rub your eyes get salt your eyes as a bad one but other than that you're you're experiencing no sound no no visual input and in the absence of that visual input I think all those other thoughts become more powerful so whatever the the effect of marijuana is on a regular body when you just hang out sitting around that effect is intensified in a big way when you're in the isotope that can try that next time but when you're in town I can hook it up alright cool if you want how many how many times you in town for how long you in town for ah we're on a hit so Thursday evening I go to Vegas to do a competition there well they have them in Vegas too now they have them everywhere too mate when I first started doing the tank I've heard my first experience I think was in the early early 2000 and I got my first tank in 2003 because when I bought my house I one of the reasons why I bought it is it had a basement and I was like I want a place to put the tank and because I had done the tank a couple of times at this place called soothing solutions in Burbank yeah if you got it there and you can do it every day then oh it's the best I'll do it out night and I get home from a comedy show and I'll say I need to process my thoughts and go over my material and I'll climb in that tank and just take off to the center of the universe and figure things out it also makes me reconsider like how my thoughts are being like one of the things about comedy is you know you have an idea and you've got to try to figure out a way to get that idea into people's minds and sometimes it's the wrong way like sometimes it's like too abrupt yeah or to corrosive or it's too it's just not it's not it's not smoothly getting into people's minds so you have to like really consider it so that idea of seeing other people's perspectives like that we were talking about earlier that's huge with stand-up comedy and one of the best ways to kind of get out of your own way for me is to explore things in the tank because in the absence of any physical input you kind of stop thinking of your body and your brain and you as an individual as like the the captain of the ship and all the other things start to become more and more you've got more room yeah well that's the idea is like you and I are having this conversation but one of the reasons why I like to do it in this room with no one else here but us there's no distractions right but if there was a guy in the other room with a jackhammer it would fuck us up we'd want to get out of there right we want let's go over here so we could talk more time in the gym you want to get in the gym you want to be sure that's why a lot of guys put headphones out right you just want to fucking grind get in your own head well in life itself like while we're sitting here your chair is sending signals to your ass you know your hands it's all data in the tank there's nothing and in the absence of sensory input I believe that your brain becomes supercharged and I think you can consider things in a much more clear way I think you have more resources as I said I find the same with meditation it's like when I try to explain to people I said it's almost like I feel like I've slowed down my thought process so now when I have thoughts I I see them coming in yeah I'm like don't act on this thought or not right whereas before I already acted on it before it was you know I recognized it that's a huge problem as being a reactionary person and constantly dealing with input coming in and like instinctively batting it away or instead if you like stressed and anxious you you're always gonna react like that so you need to get rid of all that you know and people know that and I think that's one of the reasons why people have a real problem with President Trump one of the real problems we'll have with him like this the guy that argues with people on Twitter gets mad and was a nail in WWE yeah it wasn't that perfect training to be a president but that's fine that's silly to me I mean that's the same thing man you're performing yeah you know you for me that's just what a you know the president how much power does it really have how much you know influence or is it just a it's just a panther mind destruction for people but that was before he was president what I'm reacting to is like him tweeting things today like shitting on people and salting people like when you're the fucking President of the United States you the leader of the free world you can't be going on Twitter and just insulting people putting out that conflict energy that we were talking about for what reason and people recognize whether they know it or not inherently they know that this is not the way to lead this is not the way to be above it all this is not the wise person that we want at the top of the hill setting the standards for all the people how about it which was your alternative there's no alternative there you go I don't think there should be a president I've said this a million times I just think it's how much power does the president really have I mean you had a Obama right you said it was gonna close down Guantanamo Bay yeah great what didn't happen I don't know what did he want to do it but it couldn't because other people are really in control or maybe they want him like why they shouldn't do it there could be a bunch of factors I don't know but I think maybe you go there with good intentions but there's other people that polish pull the strings and you know presidents just a front guy in that sense one of the things about Trump being so bold and so egotistical I think that's probably a positive is that he's resisting the deep state he's resisting all of these other outside influences any so wealthy that he has the financial power to like insulate himself from these other people that are like him well I you know I got friends in the states and that was the feedback that I got that the guys that like Trump they liked him because I felt that it wasn't going to be controlled by you know the big money the fact the guys are on a federal reserve and pulling all the strings on the military and all that stuff but I don't think he's kind of I don't think you can beat those guys you know they control the money system to control everything it's a mess I think I like your idea we need to get them all fucked up yeah okay I'm all fucked up this get Hillary stoned and make her a real nice call later you know she we just killed I confess there's a picture of a deer that was on the side of the road that was dead and you know those one of those comic memes and it said what did this deer know about Hillary Clinton yeah it seems to be dangerous to know too much about Hillary and two people were killed just in the last couple of weeks they committed suicide a lot of people know this shit right so they're like we've got this fucking psychopath we got this idiot guy that but maybe he's a better alternative than the psychopath so let's go with the orange guy with the orange guy this is you know he's not part of this cabal and maybe he's gonna you know he's gonna change things for the better so that's why people went with him I believe because he was seen to be not controlled by the same forces if you like yeah you know the Clintons the bush is the fucking all these people they're on the same Club right well it just seems that change especially change over our culture you know over civilization happens and he's like slow ticks to the right or ticks to the left moving in a good direction or a bad direction it's so it's so slow to change and like so when something like this comes around that is perceived to be a negative thing and is perceived to be a negative thing moving in a terrible direction and quite rapidly it scares the shit out of people well that's a feedback I getting now if people over here they're concerned you're not yeah I don't think it makes that much difference who's president so it's just it's just a fucking sideshow too you know entertain people Kim distracted do you think I'm perfect yeah emotional like Oh Trump is and then it's like it's just bullshit as a panther - just to keep you distracted you know keep you entertained just like football and everything else like don't look over here look over here the magician's trick you know Wow I like to think that way sometimes then other times I think it's probably just too complicated for anybody to really orchestrate and we're just reacting to these wants and needs and human instincts and all variety of factors that have been in motion like the the momentum of these things that have been set in motion forever and people trying to profit people trying to figure out how to control various factions of it but the idea of like one person or one group pulling the strings as a cut is that ya find it less and less plausible yeah this is a there's one small group that controls that the debt yeah it's not even money is that yeah no so if you control that then you control pretty much everything right doesn't everybody in debt is every country in debt is in China in debt to who exactly if everybody isn't dead to everybody like is that really down there if I can print money and put a number on a thing and you know you I was X amount let's just cancel all the debt ya know that's why they distract you with things like we got to go after medical marijuana like that Jeff Sessions guy he's dim the ultimate distraction it's gonna start around our cannabis is like that's a huge thing in the evolution of consciousness and it's getting more available and more accepted and there's so many layers to it man it's like medically it's amazing spiritually it's amazing the hemp plant can fucking supply what you know Henry Ford built a Model T Ford out of hemp hemp cream right not only that it's way stronger why she needs it with a hammer he hits the fenders and farm in rust it's a lighter you know everything he fueled it with hemp ethanol as well so did you ever see them make that video where they have him hit the hammer against the fender it's like the first model T they had met fenders they had made him out of hemp and he's whacking it with a fucking hammer and hemp the people don't understand if you've never experienced it the hemp stalk the actual stalk of the tree itself it'll get very big and thick and it's extremely hard but extremely light it's not like any other wood his life light wiring was fucking and a hard like oak but light like balsa wood look at this that is hemp so he's banging his hammer against this fucking car and it's not even making a dent so tell me why I didn't build because of William Randolph Hearst that fucking cunt William Randolph Hearst was the guy who owned Hearst publications he also owned a bunch of paper mills yeah and he's the guy who demonized hemp he's also the guy that was the motivation for Orson Welles to make the movie rosebud you know or the movie Citizen Kane rather he was the oil and steel industries as well it does do a lot of things but a big part of it was William Randolph Hearst because they are to cover a popular science magazine that was like hemp the new billion-dollar crop and they made that because there was a there was a device that was invented called the décor Decatur and what a decore Decatur was it was a machine that allowed you to effectively process the hemp fiber without the use of slavery see for years and years they had used slavery to process him and hemp was what they used for canvas that's why Canada the name canvas comes from the word cannabis that's that's literally lamagno leaves like the Declaration of Independence on him so the first drafts yeah an hemp paper it's a far superior paper than wood pulp paper well when they had come out with this article in popular science magazine hemp the new billion-dollar crop they were essentially saying that hemp because of the decor Decatur now hemp would replace wood for paper for all these other things so I don't need to destroy the forests anymore William Randolph Hearst not only owned these newspapers but he also owned these paper mills and he owned these forests and he decided to combat this competing industry with propaganda so they started printing these stories about how these black people and Mexicans were taking this wild drug right from their white women exactly and then everybody was like Jesus so when when Congress first made marijuana first of all marijuana was not even the word for cannabis marijuana was a word for a wild Mexican tobacco that had nothing to do with that it's Mexican it was exactly careful danger danger cross the border the brown ones and so they people responded to this and they when they made it illegal they didn't even understand that they were making cannabis they didn't know just understand they were making the commodity hemp illegal like to this day until recently like on it we sell hemp protein when we first started on it several years ago we had to buy all of our hemp from Canada because even though it's not psychoactive it was illegal still to grow in America it's so stupid it's just so titanically stupid but the you know there's a there's a crack in the dam now it's that you can't stop it man that ball was rolling now and people are waking up to the benefits you know how many states you got in the US now that's legal there's quite a few medical and I think there's something like what is it like nine recreational Nevada Massachusetts California Oregon Washington State Washington DC did I say that already I don't know how many other ones there are main Alaska Colorado of course yeah so how many of them legalized cannabis one two three four five six seven seven legalized and then jurisdiction with medical decriminalization on it there's a lot of funky weird shades to that there's more than three shades there so just make it legal across the board well it takes time the amount of money what's fascinating is the amount of money that is coming in and that's affecting it because these people are getting in solemn honors massive put it back into the school system they're giving people tax refunds I'm sorry we made too much money they taxes thirty nine percent and everybody's like okay nobody gives a shit in Nevada and Vegas they're literally running out oh yeah that's right yeah well hope not cuz I'm going there Saturday oh they'll get you some I'll hook it up I know people Nevada declares marijuana state of emergency to avoid one hundred million dollar tax shortfall because they wanted the money from the marijuana because they were making so much money in taxes because I think I think Nevada has thirty nine percent as well right they had a thirty nine percent tax rate it's fifteen for recreational eyes only fifteen yeah really think so well they fucked up I should have went 39 nobody gives a shit still five bucks for when you're buying I don't know if the stores are getting taxed too for what they sell recreational attacks fingers the bulbs all in it's not gonna stop now and so many people out there of cured cancer as well by using the concentrated oil and stuff I got a couple of friends that they've cured their own cancer from you know changing the diet going to a plant-based alkaline diet and taking the cannabis oil and the doctors are like baffled yeah so there's that and that's a powerful thing if somebody cures that cancer they're gonna tell everybody everybody they know all their family and it's just a matter of time yeah they just had something on on a mainstream which I was surprised a mainstream news show in England where they had this case of this kid who was in hospital was dying from on camera but it was but anyway this the point is his mother was sneaking in the cannabis oil and he got cured for that and then they did this whole thing on breakfast TV about how their you know the kid who was got rid of his cancer now but I noticed they still you know they obviously told to say this that you know they're told this whole story about the kid is like you know this cancers gone now his mom was sneaking in the cannabis oil and well we need to look into this but but we must state everybody people we must tell you we must you know it's not a cure right what the fuck you're talking about the kids it's cured what you're talking about it's not a cure but it's obviously something they've got a state you know because it's actually illegal to claim that you can cure cancer well it's illegal to possess the marijuana so it's illegal probably to use it as a treatment even though it's effective you have to say it's not a cure exactly there's the influence of the pharmaceutical drug companies that will come down I mean this pharmaceutical drug companies that advertise on these networks which becomes a huge problem because if they're advertising abilify and fucking wellbutrin and all this different shit that they're selling they're not going to be interested in you telling positive stories about abandoning all pharmaceutical drugs then taking natural remedies of course nothing is that competent it so what they're trying to do now is make you know slightly different versions of it that there can Payton yeah as one company I think it's GW Pharmaceuticals in UK what guess what doesn't fucking work when you do that know so I'm laughing at them waste all your fucking money the plant is perfect as it is is a perfect balance is its it works as it is so but they can't trademark you can't trade market so you want to change it a little bit to create something can trade market make tons of profit off but guess what suckers it ain't working yeah once you once you change it it doesn't work the way it's supposed to work it's all people trying to control shit you know it's people that are trying to control how much agriculture you could sell I mean that's what it is it's agriculture with marihuana really is a psychoactive agriculture it's plants like the idea that you tell someone they can't grow tomatoes in their backyard it's fucking bananas it's a plant that grows from the ground exactly as it is god fucking made plant grows from the ground how can that be illegal right so if you have tomatoes in your backyard everyone knows tomatoes have lots of vitamins healthy for you and you know one would say oh you can't do that right what can Chinese have been using herbs for thousands of years your marijuana it's just the same thing as just it's the mother of all like the fucking top you know sometimes people get confused about like oh you know you're supposed to be healthy is supposed to be an athlete what are you doing smoking marijuana I'm like that's the fucking healthiest thing I do every day I got like 40 tablets there yeah I got fish oils i got vitamin c got referred to tall i got herbs i got everything you know what guess what more powerful than all those fucking things together although their beneficial is my cannabis oil i take every day this is like i don't know if you're familiar with a guy called bob mallow made dr. Bob Miller made his uh he studies free radical is human biologist I think and he states that cannabis is the most powerful antioxidant most powerful anti-aging substance on the planet period that's it so I I consider it a health supplement yeah I get high enough it's a health supplement too and there's also ways you could take it that are non I go active you know people that take CBDs or I take this stuff Charlotte's Web hand boys take this every day it's fantastic I think you feel good alleviates aches and pains is good for anxiety it's good for mental clarity it's just great for your body it's just something it's an essential oil for your body I got my left knee the cartilage is there the gone the shoulders you know not only the supraspinatus gone the you know when I go for a scan they're like oh do you know your shoulder is the arthritis is really bad you must be in a ton of pain I'm like nothing I don't have any pain I don't know if that's down to my kind of issues but it definitely definitely a factor in there you know I'm sure it's a factor do you think also a factor is mental toughness because the fact that you your understanding of pain is probably weighed down how do you perceive yeah hanging you know like you know every times it's not a big deal I live with that every day from from training so right and actually look forward to it in a way yeah so probably my perception of pain is like is less than everybody else's but for sure you know when I'm asleep if you had a real arthritis I mean it's gonna wake you're gonna get pain I don't get anything so something I'm doing is helping yeah yeah I consider cannabis didn't be the most powerful health supplement you can take better than all the other stuff but I still take all the other stuff as well because I'm stuck in all the odds in my favor you know yeah I mean I think it's really important guys like you that are going against the grain explaining your position and and also you as a respected professional athlete where people will listen to you and then go oh well this guy is such a straight shooter about steroids and about training and about injuries and all these other things he's not gonna lie about this well the people have just been had this misinformation for so long so strong in their brain it's like it's it's hard to change start to change that you know especially if you don't have any experience it with yourself like this fucking drug like I don't know if somebody put on an Instagram I can't believe Yates smokes weed I just fucking hate lazy stoners that's a pretty strong reaction man like you hate somebody because they're smoking a fucking plan lazy calling you lazy Asterius I need to smoke weed to stop me from doing too much fucking stuff this is slow me down so like a normal level and listen yeah it it can fucking slow you down and you can sit in the smoke fucking weed all day and set in a couch and watch TV and and eat pizzas if you want like you know but if you're smart you use it when it's the time to use it you know like sometimes I like to smoke a little bit for do cardio because the opens were Broncos and I get a better fucking work out or it's generally in the evening when I'm relaxing or if I want to do something creative like I'm writing or something else me like think a little bit but there will be times when it's appropriate and times when it's not appropriate and that's it you know no I completely agree I just think that it's a lot like what we're talking about earlier with fats and sugar that there's this misinformation that continues forever it's like once you get an idea in your head oh low fat is good high fat is bad and then somewhere along the line you realize that that's bullshit like what you might realize it you might do the research you might go into the article and then look at the studies and go wow this is insane and how this happened and go into the New York Times article about the sugar industry bribing the but once you get to a certain point in time you realize like most people are not going to do all this they're not gonna look into this they're not going to get so most people are gonna hear what they heard when they were little marijuana is for losers marijuana makes you lazy you're gonna be a lazy stoner I don't want to be that marijuana's bad like Jeff Sessions the fucking the guys on record saying good people do not smoke marijuana dude you're talking about millions of people you're saying none of them are good people you know that is I think the people that smoke marijuana are generally nicer kinder more thoughtful people and that realized that in some way we're all connected we're all we're not fucking independent so how's that a bad thing cuz he doesn't smoke pot that's the problem well we need to fuckin hold him I'm making smoke pot that's what we need to do but it'll freak out apparently Joey Diaz gave Pauly Shore some stars of death on his podcast and now Pauly won't release the podcast he's like hide it burn it burn it with fire kill it like kill it like a demon I mean cannabis is so good that when you smoke it which is full of fucking tar and Costigan's and everything you smoke it into your lungs it doesn't even damage your lungs yeah I think it's supposed to be a different type of smoke though like the smoke that you get it's probably harsh but it's the same ya know the properties of it don't have the same part like the the issue apparently with tobacco in particular like just regular tobacco if you're smoking a regular rolled cigarette of hand-rolled tobacco just pure tobacco no no other bullshit ingredients is not as bad for you as a cigarette but still bad girl's got a ton of chemicals in this hundreds of chemicals by the way approved by our government well yeah pour it in there that's good throw it in there government govern what governments meant is your mind but marijuana smoke has been shown to be an expectorant actually can clear the lungs of certain issues it dilates the Broncos as opposed to tobacco is closing them up yeah I don't know if you're familiar with the study was done here at UCLA I believe a guy called Donald Erskine he did it over 20 years it was a properly funded study why was it properly funded because it was funded to look for negative results so the purpose of this study was to prove that smoking cannabis damages your lungs just like cigarettes right so they followed three groups over 20 years cigarette smokers only or tobacco to back on marijuana together and marijuana only and tobacco smokers over 20 years of course loss of lung function a lot of cancers all the stuff we ordered no the middle group was way less and the marijuana group smokers like daily smoking over 20 years there was no increased cancer there was no loss of lung function in fact there are slight increase in lung function as compared to non-smokers well they're exercising taking big toast that's that's what he guessed because you take your name but not only that because the cannabis is dilating the Broncos all the time if you keep dilating and keep dialing it keep dialing it's gonna get more you know it's gonna get more functional well it makes sense I mean just it's counterintuitive to a lot of people that think that's negative it's bad for you so I just see it as a super health supplement see anything negative I don't see as a drug there's a sister plant and yeah you get high and you feel good what's in your laughs it's silly shit no it'll be good for you right I agree and I think that people are starting to understand that more now than when we were kids for sure yeah I used to smoke when as a teenager and in England we mix it with tobacco that's just right till I came here to know like people smoked it pure I don't mix with tobacco now because I realized the weed is good and tobacco is bad before I didn't are both probably bad for you I don't give a shit you know yeah how'd that get started in England cuz every time I've been over England they do that - they're like do you mix your weed with the backgrounds like what yeah I don't know man it was like that's how I was always done that way I grew up I grew up with in Birmingham missed a ton of Jamaica and Jonah so the Jamaicans were the guys that brought the weed in and stuff like that but even they used to mix with tobacco and a lot of people smoked hash so hash you got a you got a Mexican you know with something right so people mix it with tobacco but I think last time I smoked tobacco is probably like eight nine years ago when I became educated I was like wow this cannabis is really good on its own a lot of people in America they take a cigar they take out the weed in yeah and they make a blunt out of it oh you're taking in tobacco and the life yeah and you see this weird high yeah because you're getting that nicotine buzz like head buzz but you're also inhaling in a way that you don't do with cigars yeah you don't usually die you yeah puff it out right yeah you put you get the tobacco it gets into your body from your mouth but you don't really inhale deep until I like to use the hemp papers and also a favor I extract as well yeah like dabbing they call her right so I do that I find uh I don't know I find it's a bit different between smoking weed and dab in the extract smoking weed I find a bit more relaxing dabbing extract is like I'll do that before going to bike ride or do cardio or something I know right it's amazing you can you know whatever you're doing run and first of all it's it's dilating your Bronco so you can deliver more oxygen but I think also it's the mental thing they like get in that zone and perceived pain is less discomfort is less so you just keep you just keep going yeah yeah now the guys in Brazil like all smoked before they do jiu-jitsu oh yes helps to be relaxed right when you're doing that it want to be a little tense all the time not just relaxed but also singularly focused yeah yeah that's America to the giant percentage of people smoke pop for the digits yeah yeah it's a big big thing here yeah I bought a building as well really I mean I'm the only one that talks about it because although guys that like scared like it's going to be viewed negatively or their sponsors are gonna like you know drop them or something like that yes well I can tell you like half the guys on the Olympus stage they're all stoners because you know helps you relax after training you can't drink right you know because the color is and if you drink the next day you're not going to perform so well I mean you can get totally fucking high tonight and you can go into gym tomorrow morning zero negative effect right zero do you remember the Arnall I'm sure you do Arnold is numero uno yeah there is token on a little one I mean that was people were like what is he doing back then it was almost like he was getting drunk or something like that yeah yeah people didn't think about it and he was the only one it wasn't he wasn't like passing around other people he was the only one on camera smoking yeah the other guys were probably scared smoking and not on camera you know yeah well viewed negatively you know like an athlete saying he smokes marijuana his risk maybe used losing his sponsorship and I don't give a shit I don't have sponsors I'm independent so you know a bit more free to speak out well the crazy thing to me was the NFL the NFL saying that these guys can't smoke pot and they suspend them for smoking pot meanwhile it's okay to run full-speed at each other and smash into each other and the massive amount of damage that's doing that's that's not that's not a problem well maybe the cannabis would actually help brain injuries because a lot of studies is you know with Alzheimer's and stuff like that it's very protective on the brain so maybe it could have helped them if anything it wouldn't definitely wouldn't harm them and even if it's just CBD oil it's a neuro protectant you know can happen the cannabinoids yeah yeah it's I mean we live in an age where information is leaking out there and people understand things more today than they ever did before but there's still a massive amount of ignorance that you have to combat but it's you know it's a head of 10 years ago yeah right and I live in Europe I live in Spain now and in Spain it's not legal but it's it's legal to to grow in your house for your own use is legal to smoke in your house for your own use so what's happened is these collectives have been created so all right so I can smoke in my own private residence and I can grow whatever let's say three plants for myself arguably so what if there's a hundred us now in this collective in this club so now we can grow 300 plants and so that's how it is it's supposed to be nonprofit organizations so when you go and you buy weed you're not technically buying a weed you're contributing to the upkeep of the collective that makes sense so that's how it works there and then in Holland its tolerated they call it technically is not legal is tolerated so they can sell in the coffee shops there and what are very Amsterdam so those two countries a little bit ahead but everywhere else is still still not legal like in UK where I come from it's not legal but the police have already stated then going to arrest people for smoking weed because they consider a waste of their time so any major city in England you go walk down the street you can smell weed people just walk down the street and smoking weed if the police are there they might say you know come on put that out but that's as far as it goes so technically it's still illegal but it's kind of like you know the police are not they don't care about it unless you're selling it I think Canada is set to essentially legalize it nationwide I think that's the most recent revelation from Canada they're essentially ready to just kind of has always been a pretty good wait country yeah well the Vancouver in particular there's a great documentary about the marijuana industry and its impact on Vancouver it's called the Union fantastic documentary just showing how ridiculous it isn't how inexorably tied marijuana is to their entire economy in Vancouver it's the money that comes in from marijuana is just a gigantic portion of their economy and it's all this right that's why you know Colorado setting such an example that make you so much money like gotta be other states looking at it like I think fuckin Detroit it should get on that train fuck yeah yeah Detroit's a mess right and coming back with like handmade stuff there's a bunch of things like different industries and different you know small businesses are starting to emerge in Detroit that are kind of very very promising but yeah that would be a huge factor now there's a huge industry out there not just grow in all the other I come here and it's like I'm a kid in a candy shop you know right you got chocolate and it's like tells you how much THC is in each square we got breath spray man you got butter you got cakes you got everything yeah you know like yeah be careful with those cakes though yeah well ed opposed and I always tell people be careful with edibles because if you're smoking a joint and you take a couple of puffs it's going to hit you and pretty much immediately to your brain so you're gonna feel it and you're gonna decide whether you want to smoke some more or not or maybe you want to just put it down right and chill but when you eat it is gonna take 45 minutes to an hour so hit your system and you don't know what how strong that's going to be and if it's too strong which most of the time it is if you're not experienced then you're on that fucking ride and you can't get off just for hours and it can be pretty unpleasant mean like too much THC for somebody that's not used to it you can feel very paranoid very uncomfortable you can feel nauseous you might vomit you're gonna get low blood sugar all this stuff is not gonna be a nice experience and probably then you're gonna have a negative view of cannabis like fuck that shit I'm not right I don't anywhere near that again so unless you're experienced I would just say stay away from edibles or like just have a small piece and wait a fucking hour don't don't be tempted to like oh I don't feel anything I'll take another one yeah then you're gonna be fucked that's great advice step gingerly yeah go very slowly on the edibles because it takes time to digest that time to get in the bloodstream and time to feel it so most people will eat some and say I don't feel anything I'll have another one and then BOOM I've said happen so many times yeah it's too late yeah and it's not gonna be over in five minutes you're gonna have hours of that like you know and then think it's just gonna say that stuff that's kind of stuff is bad it's you know it's horrible but you're fine that's the beautiful thing even after a horrendous terrifying night that can happen to you physically you might vomit it's like the worst thing that's gonna happen but you got to be careful because I read the other day right that there is a level at which cannabis can kill you so you've got to be careful that you don't smoke 628 kilos of cannabis in 15 minutes because if you do that that could be toxic that could be lethal someone out there is gonna try to prove you wrong yeah 1.5 fucking tonnes in 15 minutes if you're gonna nail that like good luck to you I think that's actually the ld50 - which means Lisa lethal dose for 50% of the population yeah and 50% of the population are most definitely pussies so I survived that anyway I mean I couldn't smoke a fucking I don't know in 15 minutes how much could you smoke like grams or something like yeah I don't know in the bond you could do more than that but in a vaporizer yeah deep well yeah you're not gonna get in anywhere near 620 I don't know where they came at 600 2827 or 629 I don't know it's theoretical anyway because no one's ever died from it no one's ever died from it so like what other substance can you not die from it even water is right you have too much water you drowned right yeah I mean this is a pretty harmless fucking substance if there's no there's no feasible toxic level all right 628 kilos I'm taking the piss like you know I couldn't smoke that in my lifetime how often is one part every day every day take my vitamin C every day as well rest for at all like all the antioxidants is a daily thing man I might go I go sometimes with not smoking for a week or two just because I want to have the discipline which is right you know to say I don't need to do this every day but I fucking like to do it every day so why not you know I hear you man and we're not you know I don't get up in the morning and smoke when I got shit to do because it might not help me do that stuff but if I'm working out if I'm gonna lie on a beach I'm going up the mountains yeah I'll take a joint with me one why not it just enhances everything you know enhances you your experience it Hans's food and hands his sexed enhances music you're preaching to the choir man yeah I know I know you know I know I'm saying I'm with you I've seen them with you yeah no I mean I couldn't agree more listen man we just did three hours well I'm crazy fucking went quick like that yeah I was like an hour and a half or something anything else to say the people before we wrap this bitch up ah I hate to be the guy that goes on chat shows and promotes things but I'm gonna have to do this please do yeah I'm gonna be in Vegas on Saturday and we got a thing called soothly yeah the date actual date Saturday is 29 9th yeah I'm going to be in Vegas we've got a competition called Super League and this is for bar slash strength elites and it's somewhat functional because I you know you get a bodybuilder on stage and the general public look at that and I say what the fuck is that there's like strange and maybe a product of just taking drugs and they don't appreciate the work that goes into that and how strong and athletic some of these guys can be so this competition is has two rounds the first round is lifting so you get judged on eight different exercises you score a maximum of 12 rep set so there's that and then it's a physique round but it's it's done by a computer so it scans various areas of your body and gives you a score on that it sounds a bit complex but if you want to go on Superliga live it's got explain everything have you been doing this for this is gonna be the first one and we weren't sure like what reaction we get with the first one but it's been off the fucking hook and I think we're gonna get a new breed of athletes that maybe not purely for the bodybuilders as like the mr. Olympia we've got guys coming from powerlifting we've got guys coming from bodybuilding there's a lot of guys out there and the gyms around the world that are fuckin athletic strong freaky guys and girls we've got both categories that maybe don't want to compete in a bodybuilding competition for various reasons or they do want to compete in a bodybuilding competition and they want something alternative to do we got a competition between Team LA and team Atlanta as well and we've got interests for the role this out internationally so keep your eye on that man so how do people go to it where would super league live and the contest is in the City Athletic Club German in Vegas which is like another biggest gym in Vegas okay and so on the website for it would be super league live or super league dot live I'm not sure darl absolutely don't live and I'm gonna be there Sunday and a lot of other people from front of sport and I'll invite Joe Rogan if you've got spare time I'm actually going to be at the UFC Saturday that's so unfortunately it's a good card very excited rubber spider John Jones and Daniel Cormier oh great and that's in Vegas as well no that's out here in Anaheim ah cowboy Cerrone and Robbie law it's a great card actually it's one of the best cards of the year I'm just joking so I would do whatever you want folks but Super League is gonna be awesome I'm sure yeah listen man it was an honor and a pleasure I really appreciate it man has been oh yeah like three hours has gone like nothing like nothing I'm sure we could talk for fuckin 24 hours but I bet we could it's time to smoke a join us I agree alright alright everybody thank you brother appreciate it see you guys tomorrow [Music] [Music]
