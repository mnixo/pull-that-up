the gyro can experience your childhood was fucking completely bizarre I mean my childhood was bizarre on paper but it wasn't bizarre in front of the whole world you know and you became a fucking superstar when you were a little kid you're 40 now right right just hurry okay I'm 43 so when I saw the champ I think I was seven what were you like four no no I was seven so you were ten in the champ really yeah okay mind my time run you're close either way either way whatever I was seven or ten I was fucking crying like a baby and you were even younger than me then so when I was a little kid when I was like going through life trying to figure out you know what my parents were breaking up going trying to figure out like fuck with his life all about you were fucking famous in front of the whole world like I couldn't imagine that point in my life being famous that must have been so strange to develop in that but you're so normal well here's the thing that I think interesting about like growing up famous because I became famous when I was like seven so I don't have any memory of life before Fame Wow so when that happens and you're forming and you're getting programmed and you're getting created as a child right that's what becomes normal for you and so I don't have any frame of reference like I wasn't 30 and all of a sudden BAM became famous and I had 30 years of history of normal life so Fame is normal for me so because it's normal that means kind of it's not special because what's normal is is normal right so that's kind of I think a different unique thing about being a child actor like I wasn't I saw drew Barrymore last night I would never heard anybody put it that way before I went to her premiere last night she she's kind of done the same thing and her new movie and gave her a big hug and kiss I haven't seen her in 20 years she grabbed her ass and no I just cute girl I've known her since I'm so good I was I'm 12 come on feel good she was eight that's drew Barrymore we would dance at some Tom Green that got that you could get that to kid got the same thing it's been a few of us have gone through that like not many it's a very very few become yeah the percentage of people who go through that and get Lindsay Lohan are like it's like 95 right yeah more more than that gotta be what do you think was the difference with you Oh what's the difference you know I quit the partying thing when I was young and I didn't continue it like I think some people do and you know I had my few wildly years between 16 and you know 20 but you know I always kept my kind of stuff quiet and I kind of kept it under the radar and you know wasn't really public about it and then I meant that was because there was no TMZ internet a little bit on the DL writers here making it rain you ever wonder when I was 20 I met Andrea and that just kind of changed my life because I was I was a dad at 2200 so that's a big part of it too responsibility very early on it now did you used to hang out with all those people back in the day they're like Gary Coleman and all those guys like I like pop were you to like hang with punky brewster and stuff yeah yeah I knew everybody there I mean the different strokes kids were filming next door the facts of life girls were across the other studio stage each other who's the boss kids you guys back you must have right sure yeah it's small wonders where Lance from a small one you dream crowd knows what's up so yeah there was some drama going on on on set you know I mean there was I told you a little bit about the Todd bridges thing yeah Todd bridges we had todd bridges on fear factor and he had a chip on his shoulder I mean no I mean wasn't a bad guy but had this thought that everybody was out to fuck him everybody like we were fucking him over like we didn't want him to win oh I see what's up you don't want me to win I was like -
