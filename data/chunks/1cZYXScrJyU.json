- one fucking kids today fucking kids today fucking kids today hasn't everybody said that from the beginning of time I bet k people were saying that shit uh-huh it's just it is what it is right every new group comes up they try to re-establish themselves as smarter you know there's the new group coming up they're gonna change the rules I don't know what's so wrong with how we turned out you know I mean like we're a mess I'm saying that from a like I mean every I think every generation is better than the next in terms of how like things this is the best times I've ever been for most people right but I'm saying from like how we handle things perspective things seem I'm like a fine human being you seem like a fine him like most human beings are fine and we were raised quite I don't say differently but a little better in my perspective than like what's happening now like what what is being corrected is is strange to me so people that don't know the story let's fill them in on your story and how we got together so you're doing a gig you're at Columbia mm-hmm so a few months ago I got this group called the asian-american Alliance at Columbia University hit me up saying hey you know we're big fans of your work I was the first Indian ever write for SNL and so they were like that was a story in the Asian American Indian community and so they hit me up in like May or June like hey come we have the show in November it's called culture shock it's a big like fashion culture event and I've done like tons of these before you know cuz my sister and I we both went to NYU but my sister like helped put on these kinds of shows so I would attend them and like I've seen them ever since high school because I went to high school in Parsippany New Jersey which is like a hyper diverse kind of place at least with like Asians and Indian people and like I went to a few in high school and got laid after one of them when I was in high school so they have like relations my lost my virginity after one I'm so like it was like they held a special place in my heart and so like I went thinking okay this is gonna be fun and and they know who they're getting in that you know the email said we're fans of your work like we want you to come do the show it's about like representing agent identities and all that I'm like dope and that's I get there like 7:30 and I walk in and I'm like okay I know all these kids I mean they're like 20 or something but like I know them I grew up with these kids you know like Abigail's & pratik sort of like I know all these guys right and immediately my comic hat turns out I'm like okay the show itself the Energy's dope but the show like acoustically I'm looking okay it's a high ceiling the lighting shit it's not set up for like a comedy event but I still think okay this is going to go well 8:30 8:45 I get onstage and I'm like I do some Columbia stuff because I went to Columbia for like a summer program I started making fun of the kids a bit and I say do I have to give like a trigger warning almost like joking like do I have to give a trigger warning because I know you know that's a thing and I say like be careful some of this might be sexist some of this might be racist you know just buckle up and one girl boos and I'm like and I'm like well look this is I literally said just listen to the set on the way here and I said well buckle up you know because this is the real world or whatever and then I go into material and about and it's going well this is one story I want to dispel like it I I will fully own a bomb if I'm bombing I know I'm bombing I will tell you I bombed before a billion times I'm doing fine 60 70 percent of the set 17 minutes in I tell the joke where I say effectively you know I don't think being gay is a choice which is I don't think it is at all but this is how you know because there's gay black people and no one's gonna choose to be gay if they're already black right no one's doubling down on hardship oh thank you no no one's a funny joke thank you no one like no black dude ever wakes up and thinks you know what this black shit too easy I'm gonna put on a Madonna halter top and some Jordans and telling Indian dude how to live his life that's not a choice that's you born that way and and that it bombs like this silence complete silence and then I say you're exactly who I expected to be as a crowd and then I say the only person that chooses this is also what wasn't print is that the offensive part to me what I think is offensive is the next part where I say the only person that chooses whether or not to be gay in a daily basis is Mike Pence right we can all agree that like I don't know if he's getting that but no man hates homosexuals that much if he himself is not a homosexual he chooses not to be gay every day and that gets some laughs and applause and I'm like okay cool and then I get back into it I'm rolling for about another two or three minutes I start talking to some I do a joke about how my dad landed in Newark when he immigrated to America some girls from Newark she interrupts I start talking her for like two minutes and that goes terribly it's just like I'm trying to go on fishing with her just trying to see if I can get back into was she interrupting I say I say I say a joke worse and my dad let landed in Newark back when he landed it was called Brick City because if you hits if you looked at someone wrong they'd hit you with a brick right fine kind of throwaway line this girl goes that's not true like well yeah I'm like obviously I'm just kidding but like I know where she's what she's trying to do I'm just trying to talk to her and I'm going trying to talk about like trying to get back into material and that's like probably minute 20 or something and then out of my corner of my left eye I see the three girls that invited me to do the show initially in May or June like gather and like that's kind of strange I still talk to this girl flike another 30 seconds and then as I'm concluding my talking to her because I realized that's not gonna go anywhere they come onstage with microphones in like one trench coat they're just like they're like it's time if the literally to say there's been a change thank you to mesh there's been a change in program you know we've received from comments from members you know we think that's enough stage for 20 something minutes at this point and it was that one joke that did it so there's it so I go I'm like I'm first I'm like I'm not even mad at this problem just like in shock I'm like this there's a guy episode of Impractical Jokers I'm just like what are you talking about of 45 minutes left I'm slated to do an hour and like really week and they say yeah there's been comments like people are upset or will offend it and I'm like I feel like we're having a good time and some of the crowd cheers and then I'm like why do I got to go and one of the girls goes the tech has to leave and I look at the tech has this all on YouTube like someone put the beauty video out of this particular part and I go they'd better be leaving because I could see I could see the tech people and I'm looking at them like you got a bounce dude and she's attacked people meaning the people that are coordinating the electron yeah the tech cast the show exactly look like whoever's running a mic I don't need tech I'm not gonna fucking pyro yeah what do mean the tech has to go tech people up there coming up with lies yeah I mean I understand why she lied because she's trying to say face and that like going right and try I guess not to embarrass me or whatever but I'm like I'm not gonna believe that shit that all fur you came out to be like the tech has and then I go is it because the tech has to leave or because I'm saying some things that made people uncomfortable and one of the other girls goes there's a we think there's a distinction between being uncomfortable and being disrespectful don't use your big words on me but but in my brain I'm like what what are you talking about like I I don't think I've been disrespectful at all and there are some people who are like what the fuck is going on majority of people like what the fuck is going on and but like there's a pocket of the crowd where the three Asian American alliance leaders and like the rest of the sort of crew was like waiting and I think some of them cheer when they like there's a distinction between disrespectful and being uncomfortable I'm like what do you talk about have been disrespectful in the slightest what are you talking about and then one girl goes we think you're not entitled to be making some of the jokes are making and I'm like my trigger word is entitled you know like I'm thinking and at this point I'm like I'm too almost in shock deer and headlights kind of to like even processed anger I'm just like now I'm just don't assess what they're specifically saying like which joke specifically and they're like we think that gay in black joke is particularly offensive whatever and I'm like and then at this point I'm like instead of explaining that the joke is quite progressive I'm like I literally got that joke from an audience member at stand-up New York in like 2011 like I remember the conversation distinctly because it was such like one of these sort of oh shit that's a good bit moment right and I tell them that and they were like you got it caught talking to a guy yes so I was onstage and now used to live in Hell's Kitchen in New York and I'm in like there's like a gay black constituency that would always like make fun of me when I was like leaving my apartment but like like ribbing you know what I mean right and so like I'm trying to talk about that on stage at stand-up New York doing like a check spot or whatever and I'm talking to the crowd and then there's a gay black guy that like heckled me and I start talking to him and then at some point I'm like this is how you know being gay can't be a choice right and he he starts dying and we have like a good rapport I'm like oh perfect this is a great bit that I just got right and so I tell them that and they're like no you know there's been a change bro he's like you have to go and I'm like effectively I'm like like you're wrong for what doing what you're doing right now I'm I'm I'm a generation older than you guys I know comedy better than anybody in this room so that's for goddamn sure and I know disrespect and I've been through a lot of shit like I know that what I'm saying right now hasn't been offensive in the slightest and I say you can't isolate yourself from the real world like this what are you gonna do when when some real bad shit happens in the world like if someone actually does something that's offensive like you can't handle things this way if you silence someone that's not it's not progress or whatever and then they ask me if I have closing remarks closing remarks and underprepared so those it's hard to come up with closing remarks I don't know or on the spot I tried to save it I tried to save it with a bit you know and it fucking bomb I'm like alright and just I'm like I'm still talking and then they cut my mic and I'm like really I'm like really you cut my heart and then I'm like alright thank you well put the mic down and I bounce and then they try to then they won't even let me talk to them backstage like one one members like we gotta escort you out I'm like yeah I'm six foot one Indian dude like I don't need escort from you tiny person like I'll be fine I'm not here to fight anybody even I was this is just that the movie so are the escorting you out because they want to kick you out are they worried about your safety no they want to escort me out because they want to take me out right right right and so I go to where I have a camera crew there because I'm trying to film every hour that I do and I go to them and I'm like what the what just if you watch youtube clip I'm like on stage like I look at them I go to them I'm like and then some of the members from the Alliance try to talk to me like we're so sorry that that happened like you know that's not all of us are we don't know what just happened and I'm in my head I'm like thinking so much for the Alliance part of this whole thing right like I thought we're the same people I'm fleshly uh like we come from the same place so there's no other jokes they found offensive that was the only one no that's what they said there's there's there's like two or three things that said like articles which I made the mistake of just reading everything like don't ever do that fucking it's just I read everything and I'd like there's two or three articles that say like I was badgering to people in the crowd and there's like one girl who like maybe two or three minutes in like I talked to her for crowd work like I asked where she from was she doing whatever and the cheater she gets up like she stands and like Shels herself off to the crowd I make fun of her for a little bit and then this other girl the one the newark chick that is like we get personal because she reveals that you know her father's not in her life with the conversation just gets awkward it's not she revealed that her father's not in her I'm like she was I'm talking about I'm talking to her like I was like what are your parents do or whatever I should I was she's like I don't know what my dad doesn't like what do you mean he's like oh I don't know him I'm like oh you but you don't he's not in your life or whatever he doesn't and she yeah I was like okay I can sense that she's uncomfortable now to pull my ask her I was like are you uncomfortable and she said no I'm like okay cool I could just like make this worse and then I'm like but I won't you seem like a nice person that's when they came out but the the people are apologizing to me and I'm like I'm now on Mad now I'm like once I leave the stage I'm now I'm livid but I'm I know myself well enough to be like I'm not gonna talk to anybody if I'm angry because I'll just say some wild shit like I don't I thought I could have Bill Bird Philadelphia the whole thing you know I mean this just went off on all these people for like ten minutes but the fuck is wrong really but I just went I was like I gotta go like I'm out and it took my crew and we just we just walked straight out of this fucking giant hall and and then like I'm waiting for my car and people from the show or like like apologizing not like just audience members may yell we're so sorry what that was fucked out that should have happened you were doing great whatever and then like I get in my over to my next ship at Mike after this I have to do another hour at another show and we're UCB East and Laurie Saad from from Columbia to Louis at second 30 40 minute ride and we hop in a car and like I'm like first my text my agent like this just happened and he's like do not say shit until you get paid I'm like that's probably the right move because I'm about to just fucking Instagram sounds like that's a real agent yes do not say shit until you get paid I'm like you're right man and I'm just like in my head like man listening to like Drake just like I gotta let enemies that kike fucking everything that I think is wrong that we hear as like a narrative of like kids are soft all this kind of shit is playing and like yes that's what it is like and I'm thankful that my crew was there because I'm too on venting to them because if they weren't there I'd be on some other shit and but as I'm checking my Instagram because I'm like this is definitely gonna be a fucking story on Instagram at the very least mm-hmm I'm like people are deeming me from the show like yeah we're so sorry that that happened it's so fucked up people email me the same shit I'm like was anybody saying fuck you you shouldn't have been there in the first place no no one said that to me had a one girl who was the sweet mate of one of the organizers DM me and just like yelled at me basically not just ever I wrote to her thank you for your support like he feels just like that she say she said I'll be fine do my DMS just blow up is this Twitter Instagram Instagram and she my instagrams not up like I deleted from my phone but she was affected from your phone I do I check it in the morning and I delete it and I check it at night and I delete it again real I just fucking hate saw when I was at SNL I worked on an update and so like I was constantly on my phone or on Twitter on it just like checking news reading shit and like it fuck it annoyed the shit out of me I hate the news lo and behold I am the news now for a bit but I got fucking I hate the news it's all bullshit and like being in this cycle right has confirmed my belief that it's all fucking nonsense but she effectively says I hope you learn your lesson of respecting what you were hired to do and respecting strong young women check your fucking ego and I'll just say I was I was like I took all of me not used to be like just eviscerate because I'm like I'm good with well I'm not good a lot of things but I can I can eviscerate somebody in an Instagram the end and so I didn't say shit to her besides thank you for your support and but all these people are messaging me like y'all were so sorry that fucking happen and like I'm like alright I'm not totally fucked with all these kids and I go to this show you should be east and like I'm taping the out an hour so I can't even process but what just happened because my instinct to just talk about this immediately right but I can't because I have to tape this hour and so I get offstage I mean the hour goes well and as I'm leaving UCB East three kids that were at the show at Columbia had come down from Columbia and followed me to UCB East and they came up to me and pologize in person like we're so sorry that happened like we love your set like we don't know what the fuck is and that took me that gave me like a beat to be like alright you know like maybe maybe everyone isn't this way maybe it says the people that have the fucking bullhorn that get to just say whatever the fuck they want and silence people that are like the minority but they're like the the vocal minority whereas like all these people that are like actually on my squad are not as vocal as they can be they're more like quiet and apologize in person and so the next day I don't think anything about it but like the Columbia newspaper hits me up like I get off I leave Columbia at 9:30 the Columbia newspaper hits me up at 10:05 p.m. like hey do you have any comment I'm like comment I'm hungry how's that for a comment like I don't well I'm not gonna talk to you right now let me fucking process what's going on the next day I'm still thinking about it but I'm going down to open for Aziz in Atlantic City and open for him that I'm telling this story and he's he immediately hits on the fact that it's crazy that these kids came up to you and apologized and I'm like I don't even think about how insane that is because I'm still mad but I'm thinking I'm talking these kids like I'm talking to Z's and just like that is kind of crazy because it's so easy to buy into the shit that everyone is a fucking soft motherfucker and then I think about it some more and I think about like all the gigs I've done college wise before like in the past year I've been lucky to know I did like Texas I did a school in Alaska I did school in Ohio to school in Maryland and I've said much more offensive shit like anti-trump shit in the fucking redness of states and it's all been fine you know like I've never been kicked off stage before and so to me like this Columbia incident even the students there seemed like the exception rather than the rule of like everyone's a soft person you know I mean does that make sense it doesn't make sense but what I think is is young kids in particular that are in a position of power right there wanting something they have this idea of how people should behave that they want in their head and when you don't fit that that mold then they just decide to be outraged yeah that's what happened here usually the context we said first of all you're comedian right you're obviously a guy would jokes about shit right so that's not a you're not saying anything negative about black people more say about gay people right you're essentially admitting that it's a hardship mm-hmm I mean we all agree that black people experience racism and gay people experience homophobia everybody agrees that yeah so that joke makes perfect sense and it's funny thank you I mean it's it's it's stupid what they're doing is stupid yes like but that's normal man dude that's been go on forever I stopped doing colleges a long time ago like the early 2000s mhm I did a college in Florida and I remember thinking these they don't know enough like this is not fun like the only reason why I would do this is for money because colleges pay a lot of money yeah but they don't know enough they're there I mean they should if they if their 18 year old kids then get into a club that has an 18 year old limit we can get in at 18 they should do that and then they'll be with other thirty year olds and people with life yeah I don't want I don't want to perform at the whim of children and that's what these are these are children who are engaging in recreational outrage yeah they're deciding to be outraged yeah that's what it you know it felt like with with them particularly it felt like like I grew up fine I grow I think I grew up rich but my parents had some money for a bit before things went no like we're average middle-class people but like to me it's like I've been through some life and so I know when people who haven't been through life you get upset about you yes it's always like the thing with Texas and Ohio and Alaska is like these are like the kids of blue-collar people the people who have been through some shit and maybe not even just blue-collar but people have been through some kind of life well a life experience where they know that things aren't just like words can't hurt but for the most part they're fine it's like when like your fucking dad loses his job well it's also it's the intent of what you're trying to do yeah like what are you trying to do you trying to get laughs you telling jokes and try to get laughs that's what you're fucking hired to do yeah they take the context of people forget that comedian is a job that like I'm here like it's not who I am as a human being necessarily I'm I will go for funny first oh yeah funny over everything well you're a fucking New York City comedian right you have to write it's the only way it works it's so it's so crazy what people I think I don't know if kids have changed or what I don't know they haven't changed they just think that this is the thing to do now mm-hmm look when I was in when I was doing college is way back in the day I was in my 20s I did a college in Connecticut and right after I did their call it I I was talking to the kids I would do I would do my set and then I would like open up for QA yeah but it was I was probably 24 25 maybe maybe 25 at the oldest so just a couple years older than them okay and so it was fun for me to talk to them about what life is like when you actually have to pay your own bills and you're out you're out free and some guy goes you know you got like I was doing the question thing and some guy goes I go you know I lift his hand because tell a joke I go tell a joke and I go to Jews walk into a bar they buy it it's an old look in the street joke yeah street joke after the show you know the show goes great I say thank you really appreciate you guys coming out it was really a lot of fun thank you good night so afterwards I was hanging around say hi people and there was no picture taking back things you had to have an actual camera yeah I had a fucking cameras a long time this is I'm 51 so this is a 90 91 92 somewhere on that so this one guy comes up to me goes the joke he said about Jewish people's very offensive I thought he was joking uh-huh I know he's serious and he was yes very offensive and he's like nervous and shit and like has a hard time looking me in the eye and I go dude I could think about what the joke says it's about Jewish people being really good at business right walk into a bar they decide to buy it it's such a offensive about it at all like it you know what's crazy is like it's like people now and maybe forever I've always heard shit and they immediately think this means if I'm thinking something bad about this that means that someone is saying I'm thinking bad about it they decided this is a taboo subject even if you're not even saying anything negative about it like say if you do a joke about interracial relationships the best kind interracial raise you just say it if you just do a joke about that there are people that are gonna put red flags up instantly and look to misinterpret anything that you say on purpose yeah because they don't want they don't want that thought in their head they don't want the thought of you know like this guy's looking for anti-semitism in that joke just walk into a bar they buy there's none there you could look all day long it's a joke about Jewish folks buying stuff right there's nothing a positive stereotype it's like a big dick black guy Joe yeah it's not negative there's nothing negative about it nobody gets upset that you think they have a big dick unless they have a little let's have a little dance it's a lot of that time it's it's young people they're also flexing right they're free from the control of their parents and I find them you dealing with that more in like rich or upper middle-class families because I think they're more hands-on with their kids and more controlling and those kids get free they want to exert their own freedom and when they get free of their parents they want to establish that they're different and that they have their own mind their own and then we're part of the new generation and the new generation is not gonna tolerate racism sis hetero activity and they just decide that they're gonna fucking put their foot down but it's a pattern that repeats itself over and over and over again it's just today they have social media this is the difference the difference is they feel like they're empowered because they get online in other morons that are the same age as them confirm with them you can just confirm any belief that you want like that's another lesson I've gotten from this is just like confirmation bias is like the wildest shit ever you can find you could be like there's one lady who wrote some shit I'm anti-gay and anti black and other areas I'm like in the comments yes this is clearly this is clearly what he would say and like with that you took that from my set me I'm anti-gay and I don't think there's a solution here yeah I've looked at this hard for a long time now we need safe spaces for comedians there's no solution because you're dealing with immature people in terms of like the literally the development of their frontal lobe they're not fully formed yet how much do you think of it is like I put it in my op-ed that I wrote but it's like I was thinking about like how much of it now is a function of the fact that like we immediately get whatever we want in our hands you know I mean like there's instant gratification so there's like instant kind of thought process where there's no real thinking that occurs it's more just like this comes into my brain I hear gay black this has to be yes this is wrong it's coming out yeah for sure I mean if you say gay black on stage today in a really liberal very progressive environment you get this thing you but you have to say something like Pro super Pro gay and super Pro black and it doesn't even have to be a joke right like it you're better off just going for that applause break move comedian I mean we still want roasts people want their comedians to be their leaders that's what that's what it feels like it is Wow no people when I say people I mean like this next group of of comedy don't because the comedian's that are gonna be their leaders aren't even gonna be funny they're gonna fucking die to starve to death you get once you get out in the real world uh-huh fuck man if you're not funny you're fucked yeah nothing but like it's like like if I went up there and I said Asians are the shit and fuck whitey this I woulda cry what I would have been out on the fucking chairs they were talkin carried me out like this is our motherfucker but like that's the thing I think like people want like I'm not a hero man I'm not I'm just trying to be heard you know well your comic yeah trying to be funny yes that's all it is this is a I really believe that this is just a symptom of growing up and you just giving these people the power to express themselves where there's there's no mature wiser person that's around them that says hold on what look at the context of what he's doing right examine what he's doing and then you're gonna apologize to him cuz this is clearly a fucking joke you hired a guy to tell jokes he tells jokes and you say not that joke right you know this specific thing is strange because they're like it was like he did not respect what the event was I'm like hey I mean I'm not I'm not your mascot here right yeah I mean I'm not this not a pep rally dog I'm here to tell jokes we weren't hired to do a speech about this event right I'm here did my fucking act I don't think they understand how long it takes to write an act it's that's the that's like another conversation though I'm like comedy is fucking the hard work I'm gonna just go up there and just you know I think we were all out last night I ran into you you were at the improv as well right I mean you were grinding Ray's fucking shit up there trying new bits it's tough and hoarding things listening to them like all this didn't work then now I got a restructure now now I'm gonna go back and try to figure out how I can make this gay black joke my friend my friend started a hashtag challenge which I hope no one picks up is getting the NEMA challenge where if I'm on stage somewhere you just come onstage and brick the mic in the next month oh Christ this is I really don't think this is a big deal I just think this is a there's a reason why all these different comedians have been saying are John Mulaney said this recently and I really love John Mulaney yeah but I completely disagree with them he said the reason why comedians don't do colleges is nothing to do with political correctness has to do with the money that is not true no he says that because his act is really good and really clean essentially do his act anywhere yeah it's an excellent act I mean and but there's other guys like that like Brian Regan he's got an excellent act he could do colleges anywhere yeah and yeah like any half again yeah anywhere the the reason why they don't do colleges because the kids are too fucking sensitive that's a hundred percent the reason do you think that they don't make money at colleges you don't understand how much colleges okay they pay a lot of money it's not it's a lot of I think - a lot of comics this is not worth the hassle it's not worth its you know like it if I didn't need the cash and I was like Jerry you know if I was whatever like that the two and a half weeks that I've spent like reading the news and getting back in love answering emails and getting back into the shit of just like they said what like if I didn't I would easily give that up but here here's the flipside this is probably one of the best things has ever happened you as a stand-up oh yeah that's a gigantic national attention it's the the two things every comic I said is but why do you get paid yes and do is a good press right you fucking pricks you're gonna feel the same way after time is sort of soothe the wounds over oh yeah right now it's still raw and fresh and you're still angry I'm still getting shit from comics like that's my that's been my whole that's been my favorite thing about all this is just comedians like talking shit about like I'm or one of my friends post on Facebook he said I mean who among us hasn't wanted to snatch the mic out of me meshes hang pieces of shit like let me live me of course the bomb heard around the world is my comic friends that come to fuck you guys dude Jeff Ross who set this up Jeff Jeff is the one who connected us but yeah shout out Jeff shout out to Jeff Ross Jeff said something that I agree with so wholeheartedly he said I'm almost a comedian before I'm an American yeah and he said that what on this right yeah yeah and I'm like yeah yeah it's like this it's a rare person there's only dude how many of us are there in the whole country uh-huh is there even a thousand like real legitimate working ones I don't know man how many headliners is there 500 there like legit how many would you pay to see is it a hundred yeah that's a good question see a hundred dudes in the country maybe in the world let me be honest yeah I might pay to see two dudes outside of the country International eggs yeah dick fine lovely people yeah good luck with that yeah this shit's America it's it's I guess yeah I mean I agree with Jeff heartily it's like we're it's also like what he said about the instant you see a comic from even if they're like in England or South Africa you see it you you immediately have that kinship like yes you're a comedian it's like you ever watch a community cars when Chris and Jerry do it I've never watched it oh it's great I mean I just like I like I like some of the interviews that he does but Chris and Jerry have a moment where they're talking about going to a party and seeing each other and Chris comes up to Jerry and just goes comedian you know only two people that know each other and it's like that's the kinship that I think you have as a as a comic I forget what are we talking about how do we get on this well we're just talking about guys giving you shit oh yeah I mean that's that's the that's the best part it's just like motherfuckers being like you bomb and yeah I love it I love in New York New York is special in that way we're going York's extra mean cuz it's cold oh it's fucking brutal that's what it is like la out here people are first of all they're trying to get acting gigs the Kissin ass and they're being fake and then on top of that it's warm all the time did you start and where'd you start I started Boston right okay Boston New York LA but I've been in LA I've been I mean if you wanted to look at it on paper although I always consider myself a Boston comic yeah um more of an LA comic than anything I've been out here since 94 oh shit yeah yeah let's think about the other day your 30-year guy yeah 30 years that's a long time as your life your whole life as a human you said you're onstage at cars in 1990 I was four yeah it was 92 know that I'm thinking Oh 90 yeah somewhere around I too but either way it's a long-ass time and the crazy thing is dude you still keep learning yeah like you still keep learning like I'll still have a weird set and I'll go ah why did I do it that way yeah well I'll have this idea in my head let me flip this around and a fuck the whole joke up like why did I say rescue first I should say later yeah that goes just go back to how much work this shit is just you now you forget how fucking much time you got to invest I got two new babies right now not not real babies out of real kids but I have two new comedy baby even better and I'm watering them yeah like right now like oh I gotta give him some light I got to make sure they get the right fertilizer like right now I have two bits one bit that's one day old I did it yesterday for the first time I've been working on it for a couple weeks I knew there were some life to it yeah and I sat down I wrote it out and I said okay want a free ball this shit what's her process I have over the last three or four year of four years since actually five since I did my Comedy Central special in 2014 I decided to change my process right before that because I decided that I needed to do more specials because I went from I did one in 2009 that I really liked then I did one in 2012 that I have asked and then I said okay because I wasn't doing I wasn't at the store anymore and I wasn't doing weekly sets so then I realized okay there's a there's a very distinct process in terms of the work that you have to do first of all you have to go up a lot look you have to go up at least three or four times a week you know excuse me three or four days a week and I would like to go multiple times a night and I like to go to different environments not just the store aisle they like to do the improv I like to do the Icehouse I like to do different environments and then I have to write write like sit in front of a computer and write and I like to do it hi and I'd like to do it sober I like to do it both ways got it and George Carlin had an interesting method that I think I'm starting to adopt because I've been doing it a lot lately even though it's subconscious where I write out concepts sober and then I fire up then I spark up a joint and then I go over it again when I'm high like the structure is already there and then I'll start putting the funny then after the writing part there's like a lot of going over it and thinking about it I try to give it a little life before I bring it to the stage then when I bring to the stage I write it out on paper I have to write it out on paper yeah that's how I remember where my bullet points are then recording always and then review of the recording then rewriting after the review the according this process is like this is my process yeah when I do it that way I feel better I feel excited like last night I came home I wrote till 2:30 in the morning I came home at 12:30 I wrote for two hours and by the time I'm like falling asleep in front my laptop I shot the laptop I know I'm done but I feel good yeah I'm getting it in I know it's happening like this is all live shit you're working out yeah I go to bed I feel good I've got a bed I'm like yes like this is alive this bitch is alive when you wake up and it's the first thing you think about like oh yeah I got this I got this new bill first time last night and it did well at the comic store but then it crashed at the improv whoo this motherfuckers alive was a bit the bit is about old people getting STDs in nursing homes put that what fuck yes that is a phenomena you dick around if you're 85 years old no one needs god I'm doing impressions exactly so but then there's this other bidder that I'm working on as well it's a little bit older about the dude from the missionary that got shot up by the arrows by the uncontacted tribe of course my people did that but they emigrated from Africa 60,000 years ago that's crazy talk to tribe but the point being that the process for me it's the most important thing I think or all this stuff what it's really about is about focus and attention focus and attention thinking about that but the work in terms of breaking it down there's a there's a bunch of things that I think comedians don't do that they really should do and the number one thing is writing actual writing writing like sitting in front of a computer or notebook and writing yeah most comedians like to just have a bit and they work it out upstage and they know how it works and then they improve it the next set and especially if you're doing like the New York City trip were you doing like to sell there and then you're doing the stand that you're doing all these different sets all around town and you're doing a little short 10-minute sets here and there like it's easy to just kind of keep working on it just keep working on it but I think that the it's critic to actually sit alone with the material and just look at it look at it and try I gotta make this quicker what's a sneakier way to do this or what else is in this that I'm missing and I think that for me like III right now like I just started doing like I was up until like a year ago maybe eight months ago I was of the brain I was like I'll write a note I'll write a bullet lit but bullet plant or whatever and I'll try to work it out and then I'll write something that I think is interesting as a joke but like I saw you know opening four Z's they're working with us on like working with people that are like crushing it their process is like fucking they're maniacs when it did like you were it's just like yes I have a codified process this is exactly I'm gonna do it this is what's worked for like 10-15 years I long I've been doing it and once I saw like that process I'm like oh these motherfuckers I think I work hard but these guys work fucking crazy hard it's like sort of emulate that process of like I got to set aside at least 20 30 minutes a day where I'm like literally right even if it's the same thing over and over it's just like okay how can I fix this this word doesn't need to be there like and then I'll say in my apartment to myself like and I'll try to do like how I would do it on stage because it's like I'm my comedy I try to be conversational or at least make it seem conversational so it's like how can I seem relaxed while doing this but still emphasize the right word for that's the punchline or whatever it is yeah and now that process like and it's all repetition now but you got to repeat the process to make it a prize this is a thing you did once and so now that's that's what I'm starting to do now just physically fucking getting up and you're like okay this I got to write this bit out even though it's a bit I don't like billion times like there's something in there I got to figure out yeah another thing to do that really works well to sort of get it in your head is a cork board to have a big old bulletin board and put index cards on none of the titles of your bits mm-hmm and then I would put like index cards underneath it that are like the bullet points of that bit Oh kind of like a storyboard for a movie kind of shit step back and look at them and then try to see if they make sense in order like me maybe I should flip it around maybe I should do the bit about the guy getting bit by the dog before I do the bit about the monkey yeah the difference between being bit by a monkey in it but it's like maybe it's better to introduce this distrust of animals because in this way or you know who knows it's it's about attention though that's the thing it's attention and focus and these guys are you're saying that work really hard it's not a coincidence that those guys are killing it yeah I mean it's there's something to it and there's also the recognition when you do start killing it like oh shit this is rare like I'm in a rare spot I'm filling it these gigantic places people coming out to see me I'm doing Netflix specials you got to work harder now yeah you got to keep it up you got to keep it up and you got to realize that you are like Bill burr said something wants that I think was really really like dead on the money he said I know what it's like to be disappointed by someone that you go to see like you go to see a band because I remember going when I see a band when I was a kid and a half acid and you know like you feel fucked over it goes I don't ever want to do that to my fans yeah I was like aha yeah that's it like realize that you used to be a fan and I'll think of your fans as like what you how you would experience you they don't want someone phoning it in but yeah you know they that's their night right that is their night it came out to see someone they loved and so you got a fucking earn that love almost yeah yeah and take it so expensive and they had to work to get those tickets a lot of people doing jobs they fucking hate and and cutting back on other things to have enough money to go out and have a few drinks yeah yeah it's so there's a responsibility to it but there's also a lot of people that try to skirt that responsibility because of the pressure of that responsibilities kind of overwhelming you think about it makes you nervous and you just start you fuck off and you have acid but I'll be fine yeah yeah yeah it's but that's like college right it's like cramming for tests yeah I think there's a lot of people that study all year long and there's a lot of people that half-ass it up until the last minute and then they just try to shove it all in all at once it's a weird kind of confidence that you need or delusional delusional confidence we're like happy fun fucking and I admit I've done that a few times where I've just been like fuck out I'll work this out it'll be straight but like the times where I've like fucking sat and been like this is the bit I got to do I got to make sure I hit it the point where I'll just bring the notebook onstage and spec okay I got to make sure this this goes the way I want it to go these expression how you do anything is how you do everything or how you do everything is how you do anything mm-hmm and that's there's something to that too there's there's something to like not allowing yourself to think of yourself as someone who's a fuckup yeah because as soon as you think I'm just a fuckup you get that in your head man and that's like the default setting almost where it's like that's easy to do it's human beings are like I think people are hardwired to work but it's also very easy to just not do that and I believe that it'll be fine or fuck this up like that it's a pressure alleviate er as you put these expectations on yourself of success you know and there's a lot of pressure involved in meeting those expectations yeah and one of the best pressure relievers is just fucking up so you lower your own personal expectations people drink in doing all that kind of shit sabotaging your life there's a lot of people that will sabotage their life they start getting some success and then the the panic overwhelms them and they'll just start taking pills or go fucking crazy I'm gonna lose this I'm gonna fuck it up anyway yeah I know that meant it's really normal yeah the psychological mind fuck that goes on when you're attempting to do anything whether it's stand-up comedy or I guess it would probably the same with almost any art form you're especially open-ended art form where you don't have a boss who's telling you hey you know no matter you got to get this fucking project in at 3 o'clock yeah you know like that's it that's the crazy thing it's like you forget or like what people don't know is that comedy is the most entrepreneurial endeavor there is you fucking there and that's why everyone thinks they could do it because there's no capital investment of fuck it's all just mental investment in hard work and well everybody thinks they can do it because they do most of it see most of it is just talking yeah so like I could talk I could talk how come I can't talk like I've made people have do it I'm funny at the office dude I'm funny all the time I'm gonna do stand-up like how many people have you heard say I think I'm thinking about doing stand-up and you're like oh god I'm like good luck man you know because some people I'm like I know they have the work ethic to do whatever the fuck that if like if my friends were super successful in most other endeavors like that they do like finance or doctors or whatever applied the same work ethic to comedy they might be successful yeah if they're funny but a lot of people think they're funny and then just forget that fucking the work part whereas a psych yo fuck this is slave shit yeah you know and there's no one whipping you the only one no one but yourself yeah it's just you'll get the fucking work done it's also you're the writer the producer and you're the actor you're the person who does the whole thing the marketing expert you got a Mele about yeah it's all fucking you it's a weird gig and you have to be a self-starter because if you're not the type of person that knows how to motivate yourself and get out of bed and get things done you'll just fucking laying around till 3:00 in the afternoon then you go eat a sub and have a cup of coffee and then and then the amount my sets in two hours I think I'm gonna take a nap you feel like you did something because you wrote some shit in your moleskin foot right before you went up one moleskin three years ten words on it yeah yeah it's it's a there's no there's no fucking structure to it either in terms of like there's no education that you can get other than self education you can't go to if you want to learn how to play the cello you could take lessons yeah someone will teach you how I mean you there's a real clear process between you know being a symphony violinist like going to school getting an education in music becoming a symphony violinist there's audition being Asian yeah you said something about an ethnicity it must be bad I mean there's no real clear process to becoming a stand-up comedian right just everybody's like what do you do you go to an open mic figure it out yeah you're on your own everybody just wants you to get it just tell me how you go from doing comedy to becoming a writer for SNL is there a shortcut call this number yeah and say this is Lauren's number yeah you tell you tell them one joke and if he laughs you're hired it's that then you're in yeah yeah there's no there's no way to teach someone how to be a comic either that's the other thing like the way you do jokes is different than the way he Jaime would do jokes or different than the way you know fucking Judah Friedlander would do jokes everybody's different yeah and there's no one no one is right like if you went over Judah Freelanders act and went no man you're doing this shit all wrong he's gotta have actual punchline you're just saying a bunch of shit that's not true you gotta stop this is very fucking good he's the man he's hilarious but his act is uniquely him yeah you could never teach anybody how to do that no like that act he had to figure that act out on his own he's developed it so well yeah I mean yeah that's the thing yeah I think like with comedy the heart that crazy shit is is that everyone thinks they could do it in the sense that like oh I could tell a joke and I could yeah sure a lot of people can tell a joke my mom can tell a joke my dad everyone can tell a joke because it's written in shit but it's so hard to cultivate who you are because that's you're also doing that yeah you're like trying to figure out okay I got a bunch of fucking insane shit in my brain and this is how I think it I got to figure out how I'm gonna say it that's not necessarily how everyone else would say it but it's how I feel about it and I'm gonna say it that way and then you have to take into account the economy of words you want to sneak it up on people you want to get the idea into their head before they figured it out on their own yeah so like boom like it pops they're like ah like that's right yeah you gotta you want it's like a little race like that you have to figure out a way to introduce it in a way that's unique and captivating and entertaining but also quick enough to get into their brain before they figure out where you're going yeah that's the worst thing is when you see guy on stage and like oh I know where this is going and then he gets there and then a few people hahahaha because they're from here what took so long I was there yesterday I saw it coming from the moment you unless they can say it and you see it coming it still hits you because it's so good it's so stupid really good writing and the good delivery and a good idea you know but it's also on the other hand I mean we're talking about how hard it is it's also the most fun shit of all time when it works oh yeah there's no mops off when you had a have a new bit and you have the that pause right before you deliver and you like and I told him that's not real and then ever goes back oh I got to hear the beginning of this you you hit these punchlines and the whole audience laughs and roars and they're having a good time and it's one of the greatest feelings in life it's because because you you know but you don't know until it comes out of your mouth and you're like oh I did that well it's also you're making people feel good yeah like there's something about looking out you know you go to the improv last night a hundred ninety people in that room and you're looking out into the audience all these people are having a great time they're laughing having so much fun I got all your numbers I got all you know I got feeling at you I know what you know which is and know why you're laughing at this I know why you're not laughing at something I know who you are a little aspect of who you are because you're laughing at this bit and what you've been through and you're given them a good feeling yeah you're giving them a good thing it's a good exchange like they came to see you like they sat down there let they're willing to let you talk in front of a microphone raised above them on a stage yeah right this is a very unique arrangement in human beings yeah that this person like please welcome Jamie Vernon he goes up on the stage gets up to hey everybody and the like this is a it's an exchange it's a unique contract where you're like okay I'm gonna give this person who has a microphone ten minutes of my time yeah my precious time yeah and in that ten minutes you've got to make me feel better about my life that's not that's nothing or escape my life or whatever it is people see well you're making him feel good like when I go to see a comic and they they kill like say I Dave Attell goes on stage he's killing I'm feeling better yeah because of his laughs because of his jokes when he's cracking jokes about things I'm like I got feel good it gets in your body yeah like he's they're giving you a little drug yes you know yeah I mean we're drug dealers look if you could get a drug if you could go to the 7-eleven and it was an over-the-counter thing maybe 7,000 jobs why you saying seven let's convenient store that is um that could've been a big faux pas I'm offended okay store 24 but if you you could buy something over the counter and it was a laughter drug we could just take a pill and everything would be hilarious and funny like not everybody would take that yeah so greatest feeling ever mmm you'd laugh at something and you you think it's really funny and nothing happens to you there's no negative side effects to any happens I mean your girl might be mad at you feel a bit something I suppose that's that's funny you know when you see girls getting upset and guys laughing my face because you could like like even last night you could you could see their couples and you tell a total joke and I could see what girl is looking at what guy versus what guy is just like laughing it up yeah I have a fiance now but we got engaged like three or four weeks ago and I do this bit about it where I'm just like um the one that she got mad at me because I closed the door too loud because she was sleeping and I was drunk and I came home I just accidentally closed the door and I was like that's how you like the bit is I say you know there's two ways to close the door as a man there's a regular way just close it like you've been taught your whole life and then there's another way if you live with your girlfriend you come home like she's sleeping you got to turn the doorknob push it into the frame and then release it so it doesn't make a noise or a relationship might end and you see guys let's go and girls going that's how you got to do and just like that to me is like the best where it's like I know everything that these motherfuckers are going through in this fucking moment and uh and like they're gonna go home and talk about see I told you that the doors shit was too loud no that's the fucking that's my favorite part of doing any bit where it's like you could see a couple just react to some shit well I feel sorry for people that don't have a job where they can be creative I really do I think whatever you're doing whatever it is if you're a person who enjoys creating things it's one of the most rewarding feelings of building something that wasn't there before yeah and then I'll sentence there and you made it it's like there's it's very hard like completing an act like if you have used start a set have you recorded anything yet like a special no no I did a spot-on Seth Meyers and like July of last year first my first arms counting okay on TV how was that was a weird no I mean he seems like a nice content is the man I love Seth I mean I I met him before cuz I had updates so he came upstairs and like hang out would it come hang out with us the show itself was great you know the process with with the Booker there it was like very simple because they're like big fans of comedy like Seth it's obviously a fan of comedy and but the lady that books the show is also a big fan of comedy so I was a bit nervous just come because like my first time going on in front of like millions of people whatever eleven people watch that and I was like I gotta make sure that my writing and my jokes come off as fucking strong as possible and it went great you know there's obviously some people trolls like talking shit on YouTube but for the most part it's fucking it's so tough not to it's it's so tough you're smart with the thing that you're doing with the Instagram where you delete it every day and then I can't download I got it I got a check like if anyone's hit me up for a gig or some shit but otherwise I'm just like I fucking hate that's what I do I just don't I mean you just develop habits ya know like but the problem is it's an itchy thing like you start you get itchy yes take those times and just go over your notes yeah when you get itchy and you want to look at your phone like who said this someone said it someone said it really recently oh I wanna fuck it up somebody said this in a tweet I want to say it was Ted Alexandro no mark Normand was mark Normand he went up after I did I did this I did talking about Columbia at one night at the cellar and he went up after me and he goes I don't know why the right knee messed up now he's been bombing for years funny man but he he did a joke about how checking the Twitter is like opening up an empty refrigerator and hoping that there's something new in there then it never is he just got fuck let me check again something in there it's like that same feeling I watched his joke ruin it but I got it but that's yeah that is really what it is it's this weird compulsion this instantaneous gratification thing that you're getting off of some weird dopamine hit but by touching that device and and getting information to pop up but it's not satisfying there's nothing there nothing yeah you've been never been in Safari a safari yeah no Africa you mean yeah you know you gotta go I went in a prospect mom I'm at SNL money's gone on engagement ring fucking yeah I surprised expensive and I I don't mean that sound fuck you and one of those open-air Jeeps yo you it's like that's when up until like April I went in April I was just like like addicted to my phone but like using it too much more or less but in Botswana where we went obviously there's no servers to anything I'm just like fuck this shit and like the week even though just a week of not like being on this thing I was just like feels so much better you're you you can think yeah and like the whole time you're you're in an open-air car and just like out and just like was the last time you drove for like an hour and there was nothing but like noise of what were like animals and shit you know I mean there's nothing but this like you the air and just like hanging out just thinking shit yeah I hunt in every year I do three or four trips where like for a week basically lost in the woods disconnected it's the best yeah it's the fucking yes what's interesting even in the hunting world a lot of people are like instagramming while they're hunting and they're doing insta stories while they're out there in the forest yeah it's good when there's no connection when there's no service and no connection it's good you could just leave this shit away I broke my phone when I was in Hawaii and I was there I was on lanai which is a kind of a remote island it's hard to get things there and so I I just kept dropping my iPhone I drop drop that shit like 10 times and I dropped it and it's just started making phone calls I got hold it up it just i got open up my contacts go watch this and I was showing my wife it just starts calling people like an that hangout that's called another person great bug that's call another person hangout I just broke it it was just Jack so I had to order a new one and then it got to a point where it wouldn't let me input my my code and it wouldn't recognize my face it was like it was dead it was like you just fried it took three days to get one so for three days I had no phone and it was great it was great I felt better I felt better yeah was walking around but then I was like I can't wait to get my phone yeah why I feel good without it everyone around people you love the people you need to reach like it's like yeah what what you're not missing anything from will not missing anything but you feel like you are yeah I gotta check Twitter it's like yeah go on Instagram it's we're addicted to it to a point where it's like it feels like cigarettes in the 50s where it's like no one here it is mark Normand social media is like looking the fridge over and over you know there's nothing good but you check it so many times that eventually you start consuming things you don't even like yeah Oh even better there we go story ring tweet left over thousand six hundred and thirty likes son is gonna go up a lot now yeah but yeah it's uh it's and my real fear is that this is one stage of a complete connection to electronics and to each other that's unhealthy and unproductive and unavoidable because I don't think we're gonna end with social media like Twitter and Instagram or it's like you can just press a button get it it's gonna be completely connected to your brain yeah we're gonna have that fairly soon I feel like within the next ten years that's gonna be a normal thing that you could just pull up information instantaneously it's almost like the phone that of the watch thing feels almost you wearing a digital watch no this is regular watches my dad's rato from like nineteen eighty-something system they make such cool digital watches now a lot of them look like that yeah they look cool now yeah but it that's I think the next step is like oh I can just do this I don't got a what's the prompt you it's like you can't reach in your pocket to check your shit I got my phone watch whatever the fuck they call that thing i watch and I wore it twice yeah when I doing with this thing they don't even like it buzzes oh okay cool this person text me you still got a fucking going this thing to say yeah I'm right this it's enough a phone is enough I mean the only thing that's good for is your heart rate you like monitors your heart weight when you run it's good for that all the rest thing yeah Oh watch it also logs the amount of time and miles that you put in and your your heart rate variability you know that stuff this is some good aspects to it in terms of a fitness tracker mm-hmm but other than that it's like what and what are you doing yeah what's going I don't know like I don't run so well for me when Ilan was on the podcast he was talking to me about his neural link thing that he's gonna be coming out with he said back then and this was what was that three months ago yeah somewhere around three months ago he said that they were gonna be coming out with it within four to six months so that's any day now I don't know what the fuck this is but he said essentially it's gonna it's gonna open up the bandwidth between you and information that's gonna radically change the way human beings information it the way human beings access information it's like a internet thing and tell me Hollywood tells no link nor a link yeah because it's on you know we were on air when he was saying it yeah but you hardly trust him to be a phenomenal a net positive for the universe a hundred percent you know it's like like Zuckerberg and like other time like a net isn't that negative force like they are the reasons they're a lot of the reason why the society has gone the way it has like because you can confirm whatever the fuck but Elon I'm like yeah man why not fucking build a car that you don't need any gasoline for why not fucking send shit to the space what you know yeah I think he's a net positive force I'm 100% convinced he's in that positive mmm I think he's a legitimate genius I don't think a lot of them yeah I think Mark Zuckerberg is a smart guy who's very ambitious I think there's a big difference yeah and when Zuckerberg squat that I've read recently that what's good for the world is not necessarily good for Facebook I'm like that's it shut it down they said that yeah or burn it to the ground let's pull out pull out pull out he's what the fuck did you just say with a CH how much money do you have Jesus first of all don't you have like 18 billion dollars how much more do you need bitch yes sitting over here talking about what's good for Facebook is not necessarily good for them you got all the good you got all the good for 18 fucking hundred lifetimes yeah Jesus Christ he said that that's crazy exactly that my favorite Zuckerberg joke I was at we were at update and this is when Zuckerberg is being grilled by Congress yeah and when you sip this yeah and Chris Rock comes by and he goes and you know I didn't like about that trial there's nothing worse than watching someone being grilled by Congress when there's no steaks nothing happens to Mark Zuckerberg if even if the shit goes worse for him you know like nothing happens to that guy right that's my fate like I'm just like you never think about it that way when nothing happens to him if if even if Facebook blows up well here's what could happen if Facebook intentionally colluded if there was some sort of proof that they received some financial compensation to lean one way or the other is that that was I think it's percolating right now no but it could be uh-huh this is what they were searching for well they're searching for us what they were trying to find out how is it that these Russian BOTS are able to disseminate propaganda so readily and so easily and so efficiently what are you doing stop that how is all this stuff propagated like where's this coming from yeah and the people that were asking were techno ignorant and that was part of the problem yeah that Congress so like it was like Google makes the iPhone how come my niece has got bad words on her iPhone and that someone has to tell them Google doesn't make the iPhone the whole place roars like when you can get Congress to laugh like everybody's laughing oh what a fucking idiot you are yeah these are the people that are asking the questions that's terrifying exactly you know EU needs people like Ars Technica you need people from like you know CNET you need people from you need fucking techno guys yeah people men and women who really understand technology should be throwing those questions around Asians yeah and people with autism you need people that really truly understand what the complications are what what the ramifications are and what they could have done to prevent these things I think that what happened with Facebook and what's happening with Twitter and a lot of these other things there's no one anticipated the impact culturally they were going to have that you're talking about this the other day about with Sam J like maybe a few months ago but like how it's the democratization of information and how easy it is to pretend like you know what you're talking about that's like the majority the problem like Facebook Twitter all this shit because it used to be all you you needed infrastructure to spread news you need a fuckin truck and you know Factory now you don't even need pants you could just fuck you just got to put like a weird fucking eagle on your website and it's like this is the fucking news now and even have to have a website is a popular Twitter account yet there's a lot of people out there that have popular Twitter accounts and when you go to the Twitter account and I there's a quite a few people that I follow that I don't follow what that means is I bookmarked their page so they don't even know that I follow them because they're fucking insane uh-huh I don't want him sending me DMS and I'll go and read their stuff and they are on there all day yeah man all day they're doing battle against the good and the bad and dark forces and the light they're just fucking going after it and they develop these sort of news portal pages yeah and you don't even know who the fuck these people are you don't know anything about them but their page or it's all battling and I know I follow people that are like hardcore right-wing people that are just battling the left they're hilarious if there's no silly and then I follow people that are hardcore lefties that are battling the right everyone's a Nazi and everyone's alright like you're all right for it you it doesn't matter if you support every fucking single liberal principle there is the craziest shit about the is this whole Colombia shit is that I was featured on Breitbart they finally like a brown dude I'm like I cannot be like I got emails from people at Fox News like hey do you want to come on this show I like that Dinesh D'Souza guy yeah they're that fucking I hate that guy I was about to say something bad guys can't stand that motherfucker well he's the only brown guy that made it through him and him and fucking Bobby Jindal like they're trying to they're trying to turn me into this motherfucker I'm like I'm not coming on your fucking TV show so you can use me as your so you car good everything's gone amok and PC put I wish free speech was under attack cuz like some people need to shut the fuck up you know I mean like this just too much shit everyone has a podcast so show me you don't deserve to speak a lot of times before fucking it's crazy tell everybody get a pot to take get a podcast but now I stop because first of all I don't think I don't think you can anymore I think over the last like few years it's getting so saturated that it's almost impossible to break through yeah on top of that it's like some people I don't want to shit you don't need everyone's opinion right about it like you you should have to fucking work to develop to have the right to have an opinion about some things well you should usually definitely should have a good opinion yeah it should be something well-thought-out nuanced there's no nuance anymore either it's because because everything's got to be black and white especially with a lot this younger generation was like if something's not black and white it goes fucking arrived for them because it wanted to be black and white so they'll create a false narrative where it is black or white yes that's one thing you see a lot today where people pretend that someone is something and they they do this reductionist thing where they boil it down to one thing yeah you know he went on stage and said anti-gay anti black jokes at Columbia this guy's a piece of shit all right fuckin doorway he's a portal yeah I'm like an Indian portal to the alt right that's who you think I am as a magic carpet to the alright amen I wish I could I wish I could just be offended all the time yeah you can see y'all very hard to hurt my feelings well your comment yeah it's but like it's just so crazy I don't find me a comic it's easy to hurt their feelings and they fucking suck they suck you have to it's fuckin but what I was saying is like with this alt right shit is like everyone wants to put somebody in and their own agenda this reduction is shit I'm just like this is how I feel about it and look at the points that make me seem smart and correct about this yeah and they're trying to do that online in front of everybody instead of like this internal examination of their actual feelings and how they really think about things and whether or not they make sense or whether or not it's subjective instead of that they're broadcasting this in this sort of weird way yeah that's at least partially intentionally deceptive like the the acknowledgement that there's some that there is nuance yeah there is you know life is fucking complicated yeah and ideas are complicated especially ideas in terms of you know what when you're talking about this cultural sort of battle that's going on right now between I mean they're attacking people who are like clearly very left-wing but for not being left-wing enough yeah they're running out of targets I will bother me who someone hit me up saying you haven't spoke out against the white supremacists and people that are harassing this group and these dis bloggers that's going off like what I'm like first like of course I didn't do not support any white supremacist anybody fucking going after these kids for whatever reason what's that the Asian American alliance like the Asian American alliance posted some shit on Facebook and like all these fucking crazy people have apparently been like talking shit to them and I'm like that's I don't succumb to no I condemn that action but second of all does my mere existence not testify to the fact that I'm not I'm not pro you got four ways yes it's a fun look is my name Nicholas Patterson fucking me match Patel's the most Indian motherfucking name I could think of and like I'm gonna call up someone at the KKK but hey hey guys yeah that thank you that is hilarious that you have not denounced white supremacist so by your urine they've decided that you haven't acted enough sometimes there'll be a story online and I'll get a tweet will someone say your silence about this story is deafening pay attention to half the shit I can't write keep I cannot like I someone had to tell me that that was happening before I was like okay that's fucking wack and I'll respond some way also I want to think about things before I respond yeah you know when the louis c.k thing went down i got a lot of angry tweets at them one of them from a fucking journalist that i've done stories with i've done interviews of this guy before and he was talking shit about comedians that have not denounced louis c.k yeah no mic hey man i just like you don't know what really happened I don't know the whole story yeah I know what he said and I know what she said and the whole thing seems to me like a big old clusterfuck even okay let's let's put it this way like he like you can denounce his actions if he said he did all this shit that he does yes you that's gross yeah I think what he did was incorrect and wrong but the fact that like he you should announce that he should not be working again I'm like you forget I'm also a comic and be murderers make parole dog like yeah fucking you got where does it and almost there's there's some things that you should be way more upset about how about a Hastur the guy who's the Speaker of the House who went to jail for fucking kids and he molested a bunch of kids and he only got 15 months what yeah that's why you know that that's crazy exactly that's I mean why everybody's ranting and railing about Louie CK right not that this diminishes what Louie CK did right but I'm saying there's some real Horrors in the world and to choose to concentrate on a comedian who asked women can I jerk off in front of you they said yes and he did it mmm-hmm he didn't hold anybody in a room against their will or forced him to watch and where it's just what he did was just gross and he stopped doing it like more than ten years ago right it's not good but the fact that someone would think that I need to make a statement about it like bitch I don't need to make a statement about anything I don't need to talk about anything I don't want to talk about like who are you it's so quick we automatically when I say we I mean people at large sort of assume the worst about a person immediately I think it's also this social media thing yeah it's I don't think it's they really assume that I think they just have this opportunity to express themselves in a way that they're gonna get a reaction out of you yeah this is the way to do it I also you know what's crazy is that like I we've been harping on this little this younger generation but I've said some shit I like seller and vu like very anti-trump shit and people have been like like one night vu the sellers one of the other clubs I said forget what I said about Trump I basically fat-shaming because I think he's a fat piece of shit but like I said that and more articulate what in the joke form and some guy got up and I was like fuck this and just bounced and I'm like that's what you're mad about you're not mad about the fact that he is that that your president is a billionaire that doesn't use his money just to hire a personal trainer once in a while like adderall McDonald's diet is not the way you want your fucking president to be living his life more or less and this person just got up and bounced and was heated and I talked to him after I was like what what do you what are you mad about so I think it's just he say he was like I don't like the words that you were using it's very crude from Nebraska Florida look man I'm not gonna like the words you were using yet the comedies is vulgar I'm like oh I'm like doc like come on man you're like that's what I'm saying I feel like his fix is like just have a safe space for comics we're like where there's a sign that the seller now is a swim at your own risk you coming down like weird you're here to see us I'm not here to fucking song sing and dance for you guys you guys are here this is an exchange this is an exchange this is an agreement that all you have to do is not laugh or laugh well it's also the people that are going down to see that stuff that like it they expect you to do that kind of comedy right they expect you to go hard right that's what it's about if I go there and everybody's pulling back all the sudden I'm at The Tonight Show yeah also know I'm at a Jimmy Fallon monologue like well well well that's someone I came here for right I came here to have a couple of drinks and here's some crazy shit from Greer Barnes yeah and I mean man this I want to hear some real stand-up I don't want to hear this stupid shit right and you know people that can't handle some offensive stuff that you shouldn't be at a comedy club this is where people go to say offensive stuff that's like you don't want dirt in your hands and you're in a garden right like this is stupid what like manage some expectations yeah you know just walked like hey but people politically man when you get into their you know their team and you're shitting on their team he's probably a Republican of course I'm only has brain damage he's living in Florida waters tough after means to me it's like it's like politically like people are are so like that's part of their personality almost worth like having I I've done a lot of political comedy you know and to me it's like when you do that you're almost talking to them as as if their politics are their person like like and that's the kind of crazy thing like I don't my politics are not necessarily Who I am as a human being like I can I'm pretty liberal when it comes to social issues but my fairly conservative when it comes to financial issues and fiscal issues I'm just like don't take what who I voted for to be who I am as a human being like this no one has that nuance anymore about anything yeah it's an identity issue people find whatever team it is whether it's progressive or conservative and they just decide this is my identity and they cloak themselves in it and then they defend it and some someone that some like yourself is saying jokes that are contrary to that yeah I am talking shit about their quarterback you know you know that quarterback is about to get fucking pop to Jesus Christ Jesus Christ man every day it's like he's still there huh dude yeah I've never the fucking last two weeks I've never like wanted more like Trump to say something wild just so people stop fucking just saw it stopped seeing emails and fucking new Google or it's about Annie Mitch Patel whatever just like chocolate this guy's crazy man well you shouldn't be googling your name first of all we shouldn't be reading that stuff I deleted the Google Alerts I deleted all that she oh it was crazy my mom once my once my mom I didn't tell my parents that that should happen but they heard my my dad works at a liquor store and someone came in with a copy of the post and like on the second page is me it's like that's your son and then post say they talking shit about you know they were there or like can you believe these fucking PC kids good and then you went in here and then and then and then I was like it was still dead because up until that point everyone is sort of like it's more just like the pushing the narrative that everyone's kind of soft right Thursday morning like 45 days after it happened I got a text from Lennie Marcus like 8 o'clock in the morning saying hey man you're trending on Yahoo I'm trending on Yahoo trending I'm number one on Yahoo News Thursday morning and I'm like and then like that day my mom texted me hey what happened at Columbia I said I didn't get in that was the only thing I said and then she calls me and she's like telling me like what did you do is your career okay I'm like I'm fine these kids they didn't like the joke I said and like I didn't the real I didn't tell them is it sold that even for them to get stand-up has been such an uphill battle our parents yeah just to be like what are you doing up until like for the two years that I was like unemployed and I'm living at home and going to the city every night because mom from Jersey so I'll go a city every night to do stand-up they're like what the fuck is what are you doing with your life you know right right and so even up until like then it come see me until like 7 7 years in that's good yeah that's good you get your legs under yeah yeah that brought him to the cellar was dope you know my parents came to see me like a year in this shit but you can't do that doc oh yeah Joe we're gonna fix your room up again what are you doing cleaning the basement out yeah but so when my mom saw that she called me and she's like what happened I'm like my career's gonna be fine don't worry about any of that kind of straighter than ever yeah boots mom yeah it's just this is this would be a positive thing that happens I'm going through some shit now just from like fucking my own hoisted by my own petard situation like reading the news and all shit but this would be a positive thing and like I didn't expect them to sign it Kotick they got it in that I was like that's the end of those like the facts of what happened well you've got some things on your side you've got like tangible success yeah point was like huh seems like I've got some momentum yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be hard to stop that train with anything other than like real catastrophe oh yeah I mean they also know that I haven't they all it's also very apparent in every article that was like printed or whatever that most people are on my side so to speak and I'm a hundred percent confident I did nothing wrong right from a he was a human being or a comic you know yeah like maybe reading the room would have been a thing I did I was like I was like I know these people these are my fucking brethren like I'd yeah I thought I fucking took calculus with you people like I yeah I know I know the kind of shit that me as in my Asian friends and my Indian friends would talk when we were in fucking school like this but this is fucking light work right right and so so maybe that but even then like no fuck that I'm not gonna fucking think about that going awry you know what I mean but I was it that was crazy yeah it's it's an educational experience and a net positive overall without a doubt and it also gives us an opportunity to make fun of these kids which I think they need they need to realize that the world thinks they're fools yeah like in the eye and I really believed that all I've read several articles on your case your situation rather your case kind of case I got comedy me too you know all the articles that I've read were all essentially positive yeah and they were all you know mocking these fucking little children I wanna I want to say for the record that I this is on the record I still think that it was I still think that it's like the minority of that group especially at Columbia for sure I'm sure you know like it's just that they happen to like it's a majority those kids were like amped and like had a good time and even if that can happen the word submerge are a majority can like you in a minority can stand up and then the majority doesn't do anything about it yes that should hurt my feelings no no this get those kids saying like let him stay let him stay but it wasn't like a chorus which is what I would have hoped but you know there are little fucking babies and they need to hear it they need to hear the little babies because that's how you grow up you know you you do something ridiculous and then people criticize you and then you realize oh I'm kind of ridiculous yeah let me just check myself then it hurts your feelings and you fight it off for a little bit you try to pretend you battle it but over all over the course of time you're gonna absorb that information and hopefully those kids are gonna grow and mature yeah I mean I have friends that were like completely progressive weirdo crazy off-the-charts like activists ten years ago and now they're like way way mellow and they were just like what was wrong with me I was virtue signaling I was trying too hard and they realized like a lot of what they were doing was just wasting energy and it was just just a lot of angst and a lot of just trying to trying to affect change in order to make themselves feel better yeah you know I mean trying to push buttons in order to validate their existence that's what a lot of that that that specific instant like was like it was either like nope we have an opportunity to assert our sort of rightness mm-hmm however wrong it is here and but like this is we're gonna take a stand and yeah this is what we I'm like yo just just chill yeah what the fuck yeah it's there's a lot of foolishness but this is the world we live in and I think there's a big part of that accentuated by the fact that we have a maniac for president yo yeah that's that's because they feel like that evil needs to be combated at every term because we didn't before and we let this guy get into offer now here he is and the Mueller probe and all this fucking craziness when Obama was president shit felt a lot cooler yeah I mean it's like Trump is president was like oh shit man bunker down you know we realize all you have to do is be popular and you could be President like that's insane yeah it used to be you had to be qualified we used to think that you understood national policy foreign policy you understood defense you understood exactly what's going on with the economy basic English yeah yeah there's no shit she's just trying to make buddy yeah and wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall I would because what we're getting all the crazy is him when he knows cameras are on him oh yeah I would love to see what he's like alone like what he's I would love to see him like watch Fox News I like sitting hours and cheeseburgers he's a crazy person yeah it's really weird man it's it's unnerving and that's what I think like what a lot of what we're seeing on especially with this particular thing is the thing where it's like you you don't have control and any other facet of your life and sadly so you're gonna try to exert it in a way that you think is positive when in fact you're doing the opposite of what you you're your liberal sensibilities are yeah you know I think it's also a trend and I think that political correctness and it comes in waves and it existed it was pretty pretty strong in the 80s you know a political correctness was washing over people in the 80s and yeah Charlie destroy rap and shit and it's coming back it'll go away again people get sick of it and they'll be ridiculous and people will rebel against political correctness and it but I think overall the culture is trying to adjust its trying to self adjust we're trying to the actual culture that as a whole is trying to eliminate racism and eliminate sexism and eliminate bias which are good noble goals they're good noble goals right but along the ways you have these polar extremes of people that are doing it wrong poor execution yeah terrible execution understanding and it's also strange to me it's like what utopia are you trying to create by silencing stuff because just because you do that just because you say oh you can't say racist shit doesn't mean it goes away or you can't say sexy shit doesn't mean it's a that's more like you're treating the symptom and not the disease right but in their defense talking about very specific platform right and this is a stage if you had actually said something actually racist right then it would make sense that hey we don't want anybody telling racist 100% right yeah so they but they wanted it to be racist yeah that's the thing it's like you know just I can take a minute take a second to relax and well forget it is that what utopia have you read about that's ever been real like every book we read in high school or college brave new world Lord of the Flies 1980 or Animal Farm like The Giver which we read in fucking middle school that's all a utopia but this fucking killing babies and you know South loved it it's all a fucking false utopia kind of situation there's there is hate speech in the world on it you know you don't want it on your platform but you got to decide what is hate speech when is it really hate speech and when is it just ignorant and sometimes the best way to combat bad speech is to let that speech play out and let good speech overwhelm it with logic and reason and a better argument and right that's that's really what freedom of speech is supposed to be all about that we work all this out as soon as you start censoring voices and telling people that you're not gonna allow them to talk boy you you start you create this atmosphere where you can start to choose what you're gonna allow through and when you're not gonna allow through and then you're gonna start censoring things that are far more subtle you're gonna start censoring things that you know they don't seem reasonable but you've decided that it's already okay to censor so you've censored this person now you gonna censor the next worst thing you're gonna go down the line until it's just people to disagree with you and then you're like oh well my world is perfect now in fact it's actually just a bunch of people that are talking shit about you you you just don't happen to know about it are you familiar what's with what's going on with patreon with know is that there's like and that's like the bunch vodcast pay form thing or you can pay for shit with patreon or what yeah you can pay for things but it's not necessarily just for podcast but people do use it for podcasts but they use it for many things okay but there's this guy his name is Karl Benjamin and he goes by the name of Sargon our Cod and he considers himself a would you call classic British liberal okay which is more leans more conservative than our idea of what a liberal is but essentially it's more of a like a libertarian tort how would you how would you describe a classic British liberal look what would be the definite like Google that first the name would be Carl Benjamin I mean that's a strong name well sargon of akkad is his his screen name and he has a YouTube channel and he said something on a podcast not even his own he was a guest on another channel and he said something about white supremacists he was talking about these white supremacists that are acting up and doing all these horrible things and he said and this is it's a poorly formed thought but what he said was you guys are being niggers always you act like white niggers this is his word GZ see this is what he's saying you're acting like a bunch of niggers just so you know you act like white niggers I'm sorry if you heard that word and so offending you right now ladies and gentlemen I'm just reading said exactly how you described black people acting is the impression I get dealing with the alt-right I'm really I'm just not in the mood to deal with this kind of disrespect so that's a very very it's a very poorly thought-out way of expressing himself that's what I'm thinking I'm reading this and I think also sometimes people like using that word to shock yeah and they think they can get away with it and you know when you're using it what's this what's this incontinence or context of this here's it but you also said here look you carry on but you don't expect me to have a debate with one of your faggots like why would I bother okay now that is more egregious right because that is I mean and if you're you're you know just dealing with censoring words there's not he's not using that saying you are acting like the way you all gay people right you know he's not saying that he's like calling someone a gay slur yeah he's saying it again and again so this was just what they had decided to use now I don't agree with any of these things he said this what I'm reading this I'm like this is these are poorly thought-out arguments this is a poorly thought-out sentence it's not well just stop scrolling there for a second put that back up it's not it's not well thought-out not at all not good so they've but this has nothing to do with his patreon page doesn't even have to do with his his channel this is something he made this comment as a part of a longer wide-ranging interview with a youtuber named Michelle Kaitlyn and Catelyn and you can watch the full interview on this it says chatting with sargon of akkad about the liberalist community so he you know it was free-flowing many he said a bunch of really stupid things that but what he was trying to say is that these people are behaving exactly the way they do when they try to say racist things about black people yeah essentially they're behaving exactly the way they're describing yeah race in a racist way on example yeah it's just not well thought out I mean but this guy needs a class and how to fucking be articulate I mean Jesus Christ that's that's what I'm getting from this patron decided to remove him because of that uh-huh and there's many people that feel like that's not exactly why they did it that they were looking for an excuse and it's really because of his anti liberal bias so they a lot of people are disgusted by the idea that patreon is now censoring voices and the deciding who should or should not be able to receive donations from their fans based on their own personal political biases so this is the argument now and it's it's an interesting thing that's popped up because people like Sam Harris who is very left I mean he gets accused of ping all right which is kind of hilarious but he's very progressive and you know he's a public intellectual and he's decided that this is a moment where he is going to pull his patreon account down because he doesn't like the way they are choosing to censor people and D platform people based entirely on something that has nothing to do with anything he's done on their platform and it's something to do was something that was out there on another channel so it's one of those weird little battleground situation but do you think like the patrons of private enterprise right yes so they can do whatever the fuck they want though essentially they can and did so then people can decide that they don't want to deal with patreon because Patriot doesn't support free speech uh-huh so because free speech the argument would go that free speech is not just supporting speech that you agree with for a true free speech is letting people express themselves right now the way he expressed himself they're not very good clumsy right right heavier that's an understatement though yeah like your thoughts on it this year you've never seen this before now what are your thoughts on it I'm like to use I mean it's such a that choice of words is such a way to just if I'm if I'm person reading that I'm like my immediate my goes you said what you can't like it's such an offensive word where you're gonna even go there it immediately distracts from the point that you're trying to make so that's a good way of putting you know it's it's such like a you just need you need like I don't think that guy I don't know if he's racist or not but like I don't think he is but your immediate reaction is like this guy you can't do that that's right you have you have fundamentally destroyed whatever point you were trying to make because of your choice it's like you could be trying to save I can't think of the analogy now but like it's it's such a distracting choice of words yeah that's a great way of putting it you know yeah it's like he could have said and by the way like all conversations including this one like I'm trying to formulate these opinions on the fly so are you yeah that was what he was doing on the fly I don't think there's anything he prepared so I think you mean that wasn't vetted he's gone over that with a fucking highlighter that is the key points and once I hit there's have been a few websites I was trying to look up the ones exactly but I know for instance on Twitch in the last year they've changed things on the Terms of Service that kind of what you do broadly yes affects what you do on anyone's account the problem with that what you're just saying right now is the guy who's a CEO of patreon actually went on Dave Rubens show the Reuben report and said that they're only concerned with things that happen on patreon and that that's what they focus on then they changed that after this because here's the problem like I see their point with this this particular thing that this guy said I see how they find that offensive and if that becomes a thing that he does more than once and becomes a thing that he uses that all the time and uses that kind of that kind of language in that context a lot it's like hmm this is not it's clunky it's not it's not a wise choice of words it's it's sloppy and it's it's kind of lazy right and also it's kind of racist yeah but it's why is it racist well it's racist because what he's doing is attacking people who are racists by saying and he could have done it this way right he could have said you people rally on about black people and call them this and you say they're doing that this is what you do right you are exactly what you're the only thing that's missing is that you don't have the right pigment to receive your own hate your own self hate right you're doing the very things that you accuse that you in a racist way accuse black people of doing it's stupid that but it's the way to combat that I don't when you start censoring people and take away their ability to make a living by expressing themselves I just don't think that's the way to go because you're just gonna receive backlash that's that's the thing it's one of those that's that's one of those instances where it's like you've said a trigger word that is clearly a trigger word and what you just said is the way he should have said what he wanted to say right in hindsight if you gave him an opportunity like you say hey Karl here's a time machine or I go back right before you said that and say to get what I'm paid tree on the like I'm reading their stance on it mm-hmm as a web site they don't host anything like to say that it's something that's happening nobody do post logs like Jordan Peterson wrote a blog on patreon but that's what most of their content is links from other websites they have to take into account what you're creating as a creator anywhere almost right this is him as a creator though this was him a guest on someone else's show so this is not something that's his own content that he put out there they're stances that he collaborates with other creators and this would be considered a collaboration yeah I see that point I do not think that it's a wise thing to censor him though do you get that motherfucker a PR coach dog writes a very least maybe that this is the first dance which I think they're saying it is definitely a warning or maybe yeah but here's the thing man here's a fan temporary ban what do you but here's the thing what he does is he's he's he's a commentator he sees life and he talks about it and I've listened to a lot of his stuff and it's very good he's a smart man a lot of it's very good this is not very good so the right way when it comes to these things is let the people who contribute to his patreon decide that they don't like what he's doing so they're no longer gonna subscribe that's the correct use of the platform the platform exists because people who are fans are able to contribute that I say nimesh I really like what you do I'm gonna send you a hundred dollars every month and if someone wants to do that they can do that and there's a lot of people that do do that when you say something that makes them offended that makes them realize you're sloppy with your words that makes them feel like you're a fool they go you know what I'm not sending that fucking guy money yeah the marketplace talking nonsense and then they pull back if you lost 30% of his market because of that and then a bunch of blogs are written about how stupid what he said was that's the correct response correct I think I don't think pull but the problem with pulling out is then guys like Sam Harris are pulling out and they've lost somewhere around 20% of all their patreon accounts because of this oh she does there's been a backlash and by the way a backlash that's primarily coming from people who don't agree with what that guy said but do agree that it's a very slippery slope to start censoring people that's a good moral stance to take yeah like it's that kind of like I I forget which political figure said is like I do not agree with what you're saying but I will die defend fighting abilities ability to say it yes I think that's it's important because the only way that ideas get worked out is through discussion and as soon as you silenced voices then you no longer have that discussion now to YouTube's credit he's still up on YouTube okay because this was a talk that he had that's available on YouTube you can listen to it on YouTube he still has his YouTube account and he's still able to you know the some one of the things that we're seeing with deep platforming is it's sort of a cascading effect so Domino's Twitter takes you down and then Facebook takes you down and was a guy not Limbaugh but some other right-wing or that got like said some shit and they Gavin McGinnis yeah they thought boys guy they took him off of everything yeah he's off everything yeah yeah and that's that's that and with him it's even what was he he's like a hate speech guy isn't he's like fucking inciting violence and whatever he definitely did incite violence in that he wanted these proud boys to fight against an Tifa and he felt like the ante for people were thugs and that they showed up a conservative events and they threatened violence and then he won the proud boys to fight them I actually had him on my podcast long before any of this shit went down when I didn't even know what the fuck the proud boys was and I was asking him I knew him as the co-founder of vice right and I know knew him as what I would basically say is he he was essentially who's a shit talker he's a provocateur he was a clever provocateur and was a kind of a funny guy like he came the last time he came on the show he was dressed like Michael Douglas from falling down he had the fucking briefcase and everything in the crazy tie and yeah I mean he's duped but he did it on purpose he said he's dressing like Michael Douglas from falling down like he's he's a guy who would trick people into coming in and talking with him on his YouTube channel and they thought that he was liberal or progressive and then he would you know he would basically talked him into a corner like some Sacha Baron Cohen Borat shit or algae you know in a way yeah he was doing a lot of that and there was some of it was very clever I was doing on his YouTube channel then he got into this whole proud boys thing and we there's a video you can watch the bizarre origins of the proud boys from a podcast that I did with Anthony ku Mia from Opie and Anthony okay and he explains how the proud boys initially were just a joke it's it's a it was literally a joke and they did it to make fun of a guy that was one of the was he one of their interns yeah it's kind of a crazy story Matt and then that shit took a real life of its own and now they're fucking jr. take a cake under yeah exactly that's crazy they they be they all of a sudden it got away from him and they became an organisation where you could just join so all these people join and then they act as a proud boy and they were beating people up and all this other crazy shit and he double down on that he got out he quit he denounced his position in the party you realized like his life is falling apart yeah he's being labeled as you know they were they falsely claimed the FBI labeled him as a hate crime but they didn't but the Southern Poverty Law Center did label them as a hate crime and several other organizations did as well but the Southern Poverty Law Center and they've had some pretty crazy shit that they've said as well okay they're a serious liberal progressive organization that occasionally overstepped the boundaries of logic and reason they but he what he did was start an organization and I had a joke about about vegans my joke about vegans was the problem with vegans is a problem with any other group if you get a group of a hundred people what are the odds that one of them is gonna be a fucking idiot well that's a hundred percent right right if we're being like really charitable one out of a hundred is a fucking moron so if you get a group like vegans we're just anyone can join and you have there's 300 million people in this country that means there's three million fucking idiots that's generous and a lot of them are vegan and this is the joke was that the problem is not the actual people with good ethics and morals that don't want animals to suffer the problem is you let a bunch of people with no identity join your gang right and then they become a part of this plant-based gang that's the same thing with the proud boys I think some of them probably went into it thinking it was a goof and they were gonna go there and they thought these nt4 assholes these 90 pound dorks swinging by clocks at people and calling everybody a Nazi and a fascist and trying to shut down every single conservative speech there was at any any sort of university these people were preposterous they were calling Ben Shapiro and Nazi he's a fucking Jewish man who wears a yarmulke I mean it's crazy to call him a Nazi it's completely insane yes so he's conservative they all write in the alt left almost right yes exactly and so their idea was to have something that would be there to balance out the alt left and it got out of control and so he denounced it and he stepped away from it pulled away but it's too late because he's now what you said see you don't know him but you said he's the hate speech guy you said he's that guy is that hey that's how everybody's gonna see him right so look if you found out your sister was dating him you like what you're dating the hate speech guy like that's who he is and like no no no it's not that it's like it got away from him it's just it became this it wasn't him anymore with all these people that joined it were actual racist too late yeah doesn't matter too late there's no room for that in this world I'm out the game yeah yeah so any all these other groups hat once he started getting deep platformed these other groups got pressure 2d platformer him because I said hey you keep the hate speech guy you're telling me that hate speech guys on YouTube and they're like fuck okay we got to take him off and so that this domino effect does seem to take place so with this sargon of akkad thing though it doesn't seem to be taking place with him because people are examining what he said they're saying well this is a sloppy use of these words it's not wise what he did but I do not think he's a racist right and I don't think he was promoting racism what he was doing was he was using words poorly lawfully but yeah I mean that's what he's guilty of yeah that's the I mean that's a that's a good sign he's not being deep platform then if like like if people are taking a beat to realize like like oh I don't hate gays and blacks like that's that's the point that the whole this whole thing has been a lesson in patience and that's good to hear that like this guy is being afforded some patience about but in their defense he's already been kicked off of Twitter he'd been kicked off a Twitter before I don't know what for though do you know what he got kicked off a Twitter for he got kicked off a Twitter previously so he already had that scarlet mark you know there was already people are already looking at him you mean he's been inarticulate on Twitter before no I don't know what he had done if you'd they determined that he had harassed somebody what's that this could be a new account I guess he's on right now is it a new account it might be how many two followers is yeah thirteen thousand yeah that's probably knew he had a lot more than that he must have I wonder if he started a new account I figure permanently banned count see yeah he's permanently banned in April 2017 oh so it's pretty old ain't that funny April 2017 is millions years ago now uh-huh the new cycles so fast it's too fast it's weird right it's it's dude I'm telling you when I was at the show it was like a story would be hot Monday morning and then Tuesday morning is like what happened no no one gives a shit no gives a shit that's the more interesting things about this whole Trump story with especially the Mueller probe is that there's been so many of those quick stories that have just piled up like you remember that family where the the son died in Iraq and yeah and he didn't sorry I mean cut you off he was he'd said something he had mocked somehow another mocked the family and people like this guy and be and a lot of people thought that was gonna be the end of him and it's just like these things sort of pile out of the pakistani-american yeah yes yeah and there's been so many of those stories that but accumulative they they're they are starting to pile it's just little much it's little drops that are coming now they'll take he can he's been able to sort of roll with those punches and just sort of slide them off kind of but if this Mueller thing what I really like about the Mueller thing is that it's been a real slow build and you get little hints of what's going on but it's been like the you know we were talking about this at the show while I was there it's like FBI don't fucking they build a case yeah they take the fucking time and they got all the time and money in the world to build and when they come they don't come like yeah it's not like a they come a heavy that it's that they're knocking on doors they're coming a hundred deep and that's what it's gonna be 0 to 600 like yeah like that and that's gonna be interesting to see what happened especially Mueller you look at that guy as I calculated assassin that is he has taken his fucking time that's gotta be killing Trump he doesn't take shit and that the beauty of with it Mueller's that you know he's an independent guy yeah he don't take shit from nobody well the crazy thing was that Trump was literally considering firing him yeah but everyone's like someone was like a man you you cannot do that you cannot do that that you fired Comey that's when I realized like wow like this guy could just do that you could just fire the head of the FBI test and you just you're gonna do this yeah can I get rid of the Attorney General that I think was supposed to be on my side but sessions yeah but he finds out oh no Jeff is also there's races as he is is a man of high ethical standards when it comes like I'm not gonna fucking dude I'm I may hate minorities but I've respected the law you know like that's that's Jeff Sessions did you find out what happened there wasn't a really good explanation of it it was just one of those things like he had a I think he had a debate with Baked Alaska and then the next day he was gone with no real explanation of why he broke the private said some anti Sam and shit meme guy okay was just a meme guy but now he's essentially become this like really right-wing sort of he's he's kind of in the info wars camp as well right but Baked Alaska has come up with some fucking hilarious memes oh okay some of his memes are hilarious he had one with Alex Jones he had a bunch of him like that I've been out the game for that like the meme games just all of it like I'm so I feel old you know as an interesting lay lawful is the same far-right far-right neo-nazi what he's a neo-nazi mom what kind of name is aunt and team a and team a kind of name is Dinesh proud all right man let's wrap this
