still out okay two one oh and with live ladies and gentlemen with the Creator are you the creator of this no new rhyme brand yeah not a thing in Yeti is like I don't go that far Wray brain right brain cheers sir thank you sir the clink the famous Yeti jingle a Rambler Chloe what a great invention how'd you guys what you guys were just getting hammered and throwing anything in there same way for folks who haven't been properly introduced my friend Ben O'Brien is here and he's the one he was in the podcast for paradise hmm when we're in lanai my all-time favorites I mean the island or the podcast or web thing but it was all awesome whole damn thing but people are drinking those cat ladies now which is it's not to be that's terrible well that's not Dudley making that look like what the fuck are you doing he poured tequila and Red Bull into a glass of red wine oh we were looking at him like what and people had hashtags are wrong man would be rash tagging of course I'd do it sometimes just to poke fun at everybody but I've had probably a dozen people like man I tried the cat lady last night yeah it's great we're just drinking it just to say they drank it which is just don't do it people don't do it but ride brain is actually pretty good I can get that we were there were some need some triggers some bows involved and stuff just got put together I've had these before this actually tastes good yeah but there's like no benefit that you get from out listening yeah it's like all the science we put into alpha brain all the non science from whiskey out the window phones no well I mean it's a he's made zero leaps forward but we're good where we are currently maybe it might bounce us out though I'm it might keep on getting too stupid which that's a that's an achievement they can issue with whiskey what is this whiskey we got here this is I know Jamie just kind of like threw it out there gave us at The Comedy Store it's called Angels Envy oh that sounds like a think like angels are really envious of whiskey though I mean you're hanging out with God you can fly whiskey meanwhile you buy in a store with money maybe the sound balances it's got wings on the back maybe it's there trying to market with a Red Bull I don't know those are always the wings on the back of a stripper there cries a lot and there were an angel and NVR both the industries that I have that's I've never dude never seen that it's a really good point yeah the wings on the back is always a weird move right but if you're listen if you're drinking whiskey with right with alpha brain you can do whatever you want you can put whatever you want whatever kind of whiskey you want in there you're very open-minded yeah the alpha brain cancels it out it could be give me the worst whiskey in the world in the alpha brain makes it better did you have you taken this anywhere there's rye brain I have not I'm really counting on your listeners and and deadlies fans to do that I want it to be organic it's gonna spread yeah miss games Brett the next time you go like to some exotic location and they have like if you're in the ball oh I'm going to Northwest Territories with you or your boys on your hat they're the Eastman's are you really like a week I'm doing up there caribou and dall sheep oh wow so we're doing a film about there a Yeti film Yeti presents film about their family history in the Northwest Territories like technically what part of Alaska is that so that's its east of Alaska right east of British Columbia's up toward the Arctic Circle so we'll fly into Norman wells and go north from there up into the Mackenzie mountains which are about as far north as you can get before you hit the Arctic Circle so we'll be sniffing the Arctic Circle most days but it still it still Alaska right no no its own territory really yep oh wow say mizukami oh you think you can't moose or whatever they're all their own territories that's all so it's Yukon is not Alaska we'd have to look that up I don't want to be right I'd have to look at a globe and then looking I'm not quitting like I know I don't know either but Northwest Territories is its own territory it's not allowed so who owns our Canada I guess really yeah oh so it's like past Alaska becomes Canada again wow this is getting real deep I should never come on this pack you're like tell me the history of Northwest Territories so here it is rated on a map so you can territories Yukon is slightly east or at least rather east and then the north West Territories course is further east of Alberta Wow so you're getting up there into industry Arctic facilities it is connected to Canada yeah but it's also connected to Alaska it's no Yukon it's part of Canada it's one of the provinces I got it right I'm getting confused I doubted myself yeah I thought that the British Columbia section so I saw a British Columbia I thought that was part of Alaska you could read the Wikipedia it's always really it's really dramatic the wild mountainous and sparsely populated it's crazy that it's north of northern Alberta like people like you know what it's just not fucking cold enough here in the way we got to keep going well they have lakes they've got I mean to have lakes for like a month out of the oh my gosh I think when were up there we were talking about last week I think when we're up there they'll be know it'll be daylight 24 hours a day oh wow I believe now when you do that do you bring like one of those eyeball cover things oh yeah well after you yep the mask eyeball cover things have to you have to unless you're really unless you're getting a ten just kind of Zonk out but it's it's 12 it's 12 or 13 days up there so by the time you get to day five or six year I mean you're living out of your backpack you're carrying probably 50 60 70 pounds in your pack and I let them climb in every day so I mean it's by the time you get laid down I don't think it matters what's going on now when you do something like that how much gear are you guys bring are you living entirely out of your backpack so in the floatplane is what in the in the plane takes you to base camp which i think in this case is there's not a flow plan will so will it'll be a wheel plane wheel we can take 50 pounds and then 50 pounds each plus your body weight plus your body weight and then six days in they will either come in a helicopter and pick us up and move us if we're not having any luck or they'll just drop us more gear so you can so the plan would be take 50 pounds of essential gear and then have other gear as backup back at base camp oh wow so you fly into base camp it's like for me it'll be like Austin to Denver Denver to Edmonton Edmonton to norman wells hop a charter to base camp and then from there fly out into the hunting area Christ how many days travel is that I was like two days and change two days salad of just flying just flying cuz your overnighting cuz of yeah I mean they run like one out of Norman Wellesley run like one fly today or something one or two flight today you have to be really dedicated this kind of experience to travel just travel for two days don't you do it man that's like the only way to go though really it's once you it's not the only way to go that's do she just say but it's like the best most when you get back you're like man that sucked but I wouldn't want to change it if something happens to people when they do those like exotic location it's like when they go sheep hunting and they risk their lives like I've seen some video of guys like why I saw some video of you guys when you were in New Zealand yeah when you were those gnarly rescuing your lives with every step yeah it's the whole time too it's not just like oh we got up to this one area where the Sheep live you're just where we were in New Zealand with green tree we when you get up into so there's like beechwood far so you're looking at like a 3000 3500 4000 foot mountain right you're we stayed in a little Hut in the river valley and so when you're down there you're looking up you're like oh that's where the Thar live huh Oh for 3,000 feet from where we are right now bird caller for people who don't know is a crazy-looking animal the Himalayan Tahr yeah it looks like a lord of the rings' or something it really does yeah looks like a woolly mammoth but just a miniature version yeah really crazy wooly furry shaggy yeah goat essentially yeah like a goat slash sheep but I mean the funny part about all that is when yours is right there it's they look like where we were you would look across these little these alpine valleys and you'd see them look like a black bear looks like a giant black bear you're saying where am I and what is that thing God so it because I'm not like you have some really cool adventurers like on this podcast That's not me when I see that thing I think what and where am I like it's it's wild looking yeah and they live you know up in the Alpine so they're you've got the beechwood forest which is probably if I would just say hiking straight up for about an hour and a half or two hours and is that an invasion species for isn't New Zealand they're feral we're not fair that's I know they're non-native so all the mammals on the island they're not native all of them and they're all were introduced by and I wish I had really looked up some specifics but they are all introduced by some other countries you're upset animals over there Teddy Roosevelt sent some animals over there like hey here you don't want these and so the the problem over there to get on a whole different subject is that the the people on that island the residents of New Zealand don't value there's animals as part of the landscape they're just there I mean feral would be a good term to the way they view them to the value they have one and we have like yeah moose and mule deer that's that's part of our ethos as a country right and our ecosystem yeah and our ecosystem they've been here before we were at some level and so over there they just they'll jump in a helicopter and mow down like 40 red stag on a weekend because they want to control the population one because there's no winter kill no predation all that stuff but they also just don't see a big red stag the way we see a big elk they just don't they don't have the value for it down there well it's also the the weird thing about having no predators is how do you handle that do you bring in predators like if they don't they risk disease and there's all sorts of weird things that can happen like like they have on Lanai yes yeah and so that's it right and and we've had we've done that in this country with bringing down North West what's the timber wolf that we brought them down and put them in the States and that's while that may seem like a good solution and we when we were in British Columbia hunt moose together we saw some calf skeletons yeah we've showed that picture on the podcast who's counting yeah see the thing had just been decimated yeah those wolves and I've saw in Montana one time I saw them running circles they run in like concentric circle around like a bull's eye pattern when they're hunting I feel like the packs and I just watched we were I'd killed my open the first day of this hunt and I was watching and you would show there would be a different wolf kill like every other day in this valley and it's like the wolves were just run in circles and I did see a couple wolves fighting that but in that trip trying to call him in yeah I saw them financially yeah two of them Wow it was like twelve hundred yards away and I had a rifle out-of-state I was thinking about it but I mean once you see when you see a deadfall on every day you go honey it's pretty a new it maybe not new to that day but new that week you started to think like how if this pact worked this valley for a full year what could they do right and there's numbers to that somewhere it's some people figured out what how many elk a year upon the other Sun feel before the wolves were reintroduced there was an issue with overpopulation so it's so that's where I think that's probably were hunters come in yeah you know you could I I value that animal I'm willing to pay you for the opportunity to help you conserve that population right and so that's that becomes very problematic for people like when you start talking about wolves yes like dogs it does wolves are Oneidas are another one of those ones that black bears to I mean I think it's you don't eat him I mean I think more than any yeah wolves way more than anything yeah that was talking to it there was a Gallup my work that I was talking to and she lives in Austin Texas and is very not a hunter but works at Yeti and so she's around honey and we were talking about wolves and I just said look I don't have a really hardened opinion on wolves I've not spent enough time around them I just know that they're meat processors on four legs they give no shits about anything they don't they're not just eating they don't just eat what fills their belly they eat and then they eat more and they kill more and that's all they're wired to do right I've seen that in action so that's all I really know I don't know whether that's good for an ecosystem bad whatever and and she just said well I don't really know that it's hunting has really bad wolves wolves seem to have a good PR agent and hunting and management having a terrible PR agent you know so I think that you know that's that's part of the problem that there's a sect of people that are really glorifying a wolf for good reason I mean as awesome animal majestic animal but at the same time there's a juxtaposition to that that needs to be told to well I think a big part of the issue is that people know that they virtually wiped them out in North America yeah at one point in time and I think people feel guilty about that yeah well then they should feel guilty they should feel ashamed about the mallard duck and elk people don't know in the whitetail yeah but we brought those back to the point where the numbers are higher than they've ever been before but right those same people don't know how that happened though right those same people aren't aware of how they just see white tails around they're like that's annoying yeah he bought the car they don't know that turn-of-the-century they were almost all gone yeah because we market hunting them to hell and so that I think that's there's just it's just education man I just think people need to to seek the other side which I always try to do and you do all the time just seek whatever the other side is and the hunting is not always the way to go yeah but it's inconvenient because like it's it's hard like if you say if you're a vegetarian or a vegan you're gonna get your information from animal rights activists and it's going to be biased in that direction or if you're a hunter you're gonna get your information from hunting and conservation groups and it might be biased in the other way I think wolves are a good thing cuz they're awesome you know I don't not I don't not like wolves well I think no hunter is like wipe the Wolves I've never heard that I've just heard like what's the carrying capacity for this state this region for wolves right how many can there be and and I know in a lot of cases you know the biologists would say one thing like okay the hundred wolves in this area and then when it ballooned up to a thousand they argued for hundreds come in and help put that population down they were still a push back like wait a minute we said we agreed upon scientifically by biologically you know we you know the problem is that it's negotiable at all it should have been like once the Wolves hit 2000 starting then you start a hunting scenes but then the real issue is it's incredibly hard to shoot a wolf like it's not as simple as like you out and find a wolf and kill them well they're really smart they think about tar in New Zealand you can't just like if they're overpopulated in there you can't just like I will just walk up the hill and crack a couple I mean that's that's a pretty big feat so they jump in a helicopter they gunned down the guitar that way - mmm really goddamn so how do they determine whether or not they should be gunning them down it's a you know and I don't know like the holistic method they used I know our guide up there this year was just talking about he would go to the Sheep stations or the ranch owners or some of the areas some of those big mountain areas are owned privately and some of the areas where they were down a little bit lower they would just say go out today and kill 100 and that's what they would do and it was it was not it didn't seem to me to be too scientific in the way they went about it but it's a private land owned telling you hey these this is an infestation essentially yeah and my argument to them was like why don't you just these animals are here they're not going anywhere they're not gonna swim over to Australia why don't you just treat them like we treat our our wildlife well just accept them and there were some people down there that were agreed with me all heartedly some people in the guide now if any community just like why don't you just accept these animals as part of your landscape and treat him like that and I think that's that's a swelling opinion down there for sure well how do they accept me they just treat them like they're pests I wouldn't say pass because they do have some value because hunters from around the world would go down there like we did but don't they have a lot of a lot of that is on public lands or excuse a private land in those high fence places that's that's basically stag you can't really it's gonna be it's hard to high fans for chamois and tar they just live in places very year you'd be dumb to put a fence if you tried you'd be dumb but stags yeah I mean it's because they're so big like they people want to go there and get a big day rack of antlers so they're discredit like they have harvested the bad parts of our hunting culture and marketed it breelan they have and and I think there's a lot of people down there that would push back on that on that idea but yes I mean that what that means by bad parts and not just the American hunting culture because there's a lot of Europeans that go there too I think the parts of the trophy hunting that hey come down here and then work on this 500 stag we've got it here and they have agents that go around and sell it for 500 inch tag we're talking about folks is the size of the antlers not the size of the actual animal itself right that people get super obsessed and they fetish numbers like you know the score and what a score is four people don't know they take a tape measure and they go over very specific sections of the antlers and they calculate all the measurements together and when they do that they come up with some number and there's these milestone benchmark numbers like a 200 inch whitetail is a huge deer or a 400 inch elk is a huge elk it is they get stags that go to 500 and more more and more insane and is it as big as an elk looking animal body size not quite close not quite and and I'm in one of the sheep stations we hunted with originally they farm they essentially form Red Deer I mean red deer and stag same thing are walking around in these are the same animal no down there red stag red deers basically the same thing but you find red deer in Europe and they're different Oh hard time saying genius why do they call them a stack but isn't a stags Emanuel stands stag in high in time to be in the female H IND yep and so but you would call it uh you would call the animals a red deer I've heard it called low I've hunted in Europe and they call it a red deer there so I'm not sure those deer came from there anyway so I'm sure it's the same so they came and they dropped them off in the 1800's just to turn the whole place into a giant like hunting provision right some level yeah some level I'd love to read the history of that I don't really haven't gone that far back how crazy is it that before they came there was no mammals there yeah like what a weird patch of land it's a weird like New Zealand is is definitely coming from where we come from and all the things we have and we just find it normal that we can hunt how many how many huntable species are there on this you know on this continent going down there it's just such a weird but in and they celebrate the outdoor culture they celebrate hunting and fishing in the way that almost in the way that we do and they have public land much like we do and their public land is is more revered and more well managed and better taken care of I think than our public lands and it's more usable and so they have all these like similar properties that we have in America but at some level they just I think they just got poor luck they don't have native mammals - you know - they don't have the bald eagle to put on their masks that they just have these you know essentially chamois tar and West are aren't knit they're not native either no none of those you know he's not native native none of they also have Canadian geese that are not native right did you know that I used to have the biggest eagle in the world really yeah they used to have an eagle called the hosta ECAL and apparently they killed them off in the 1400s and they were so big there's speculation they used to eat people I'd kill my 14 foot wingspan I think is what we figured I'm not exaggerating if you've ever been over there it's it really is like if it's a place where that kind of eagle would live that's what it looks that's what a hostage looks like we're looking at an eagle that's literally the size of a big person yeah and a dance of the week yeah look at the size of that fucking thing and so this hospital it's Gandalf I mean look if it's as big as a person like that picture go to that first picture again like yeah look how big that thing is I mean if that thing spreads its wings over there the landscape over there and some of the alpine areas that it looks like a place where that would live that would kill you yeah that's that thing if they caught you hiking beef right it would just pull you off the cliff and just drop you off oh that's not a real hostile did the actual hostage that's the problem with Google Images we're getting all kind we got Gandalf riding an eagle we got but that was that one with the emus or whatever the fuck those animals are daddy scared that one scared yeah so when did it go extinct Jamie what does it say standing next to it the skeleton of a hosta and who is that dude that dude is awesome looking at him yeah he looks like a wizard no it does his robes that's an ancient intellectual everything open the door for 1600 ad so what it says the real thing actually lived on earth and of course it was known as the tiger of the skies tiger Scoob that's not that long ago 1600 holy shit I thought it was 1400s because they're six feet tall oh wait only 35 pounds and it hit a wingspan of 10 feet wow that's crazy because they're hollow bones I guess 35 pounds doesn't seem that much man how do you go back to that picture how the fuck is that thing 35 pounds there's nothing six feet tall ten-foot wingspan that thing's only 35 pounds that seems wrong I don't like it Turkey's heavy like you pick up turkey in like 25 pound range yeah look at the size of that thing every time I'm hanging around you I hear I hear about these like evil mystical animals well I think giant burial concern was that the hast egle they might have killed it off like the local New Zealand folks might have killed it off back then because they were eating people I do not blame them and any see if that's the truth that might be alive didn't know about this hosta you'd like doing de no I will hunted out of place called hostile when you're over there some alien connection maybe were really find and maybe find some ancient eagle skull big ol hook ball to see if it eight people relationship with humans your that Google that see where it says relationship with humans yeah mmm-hmm do do to do could have been possible to do even smaller Golden Eagles are capable of killing and yeah they said they kill humans which scientists believe could have been possible if the name relates to the eagle given the massive size and strength of the bird even smaller Golden Eagles are capable killing prey as big biggest sick up deer or bear cub yeah that fucking thing kill a few people yeah sure like a baby you didn't think yeah like a baby yeah you don't think that a predator like that did not learn what it could and could not go get okay so the sculptor's goofy ok the sculpture is that the sculpture we were looking at maybe yeah it was a approximation of it it says it's 7.5 meters 25 feet tall no that wasn't 25 feet tall well with a wingspan of 11.5 meters okay that's that that's the art park that we're looking at right that's just a giant sculpture at the end okay I get you but there's a really cool eagle that lives in the rainforest called the harpy eagle that eats monkeys you've seen that I don't want to know about this stuff man I think that's because I might find myself in a wreck in a rainforest a couple of months be looking up her harpy eagles all the time well there was a dude that was trying to put a camera in a harpy eagle nest and he got attacked by a harpy eagle so it shouldn't have been doing that he's a scientist should have worked in a movie theater [Laughter] see if you can stop looking at these terrible beetles cool-looking because it's kind of white look we and we were talking about this one here in Illinois I have a problem swimming in the ocean because I feel like I look like a seal all the time when I'm in there right and I feel like sharks will they're like look at that I just got this bolt is legs bitten off yesterday in Florida see ya this is awareness man chomp chomp and shrunk so now I'm scared of the skies thanks to this you know that the bull shark swims so far upriver that they live in freshwater and they have been found as high as Illinois they go up everything to fucking Illinois and they're the most aggressive sharks I heard that I've heard that before at least to live right on the Illinois River well they also the reason why the the movie Jaws wasn't inspired by a great white shark it was inspired by a series of attacks by bull sharks in freshwater rivers in New Jersey yeah talk about something else freaking me out yeah and they made the music like ah that's terrible dude yeah Johnny Senor psyche that stuff changed but with the music be for one of those big Eagles saying it would be death metal seem too much over in Nepal they have these big things called longer gyres it's like I think it's a Nepali Griffin looks like a big old vulture you look at that thing up see what the wingspan are on those but they'd be we'd be up on some mountain glasses for sheep and it'd be like giant thing with like an airplane 8 9 foot wingspan and you could see the the creepiest part to me was you could see their heads moving back and forth like look they or that they were looking for shit and they they take they take and kill baby sheep I saw the video but after I got back and I was gonna freaking out about these things and it's a vulture yeah it's like a Nepali they call it a longer guy and when we were there they told us all you're gonna see Griffins so it it had a variety of names like everything there seems to have but it's it looks like a vulture a giant I didn't know that they hunted that's interesting I thought they just ate current well I watched something on like planet Earth about them and that they showed them in packs and they were they eat bone marrow so they would they would get a bone off the ground fly up into the air and strategically drop it onto the ground to a crack open fly down eat the eat the insides yeah I figured that out the same thing you could just see their brains churning like a lot of times you see a an animal in the sky burden sky just think it's soaring around but you could see the predatory brain of this longer guy as it flew above us just churn and has looked around for what to get after well they say Ravens are stupid smart like its smartest chimps yeah so you think about this bird I mean the birds was brain the size of what I don't know lemon but yeah it's it literally found out if I want to get inside that bone I'm gonna fly up and drop his sumbitchin yeah don't eat the insects well somewhere along the line they figured a long time ago how to drop things off of cliffs absolutely they've been doing that with goats and stuff there's a ton of videos of them grabbing goats and pulling them out like eels in particular whoa that's the longer guy what is that thing that thing looks fucking evil man face on that thing I think when I was over there when we were in in the mountains I just wrote like a whole page about this longer guy we saw I don't remember it being so it wasn't that color that's amazing Oh Mike they were jet black the ones we saw imagine how scary that looks but just being jet black Wow the coloration what is that a bone above mouth it's swallowing whole yep Oh primitive creature just no like complete emotionless eyes yeah that's I remember looking up at some point and seeing this thing's floating in the breeze and looking around and thinking that thing is savage how big do they get Jamie what a weird name lumber guy er how they spell it la mm er GE I are over there they described it originally our guy described as a Griffin but a Griffin's like a mythologic yeah I know that's why I was thinking I'm gonna see this mythological I was waiting for something to land and like talk to it that's like that's a place in New Zealand it's like that's that's a perfect location if they ever decided to do like some sort of a Jurassic Park Toleration well even lanai right 4 feet tall 9 foot wings hair it is Wow man again we'll get this wait 15 pounds that's crazy got to be 9 foot was the Egyptian vulture I'm gonna have I'm gonna have dreams about this podcast that's its closest relative lot of fuck isn't it crazy that nature just designed a really creepy shitty looking animal to come down and eat all the dead shit that picture from right there could be in the power to bet over hunting has led to the endangerment of the species hmm it just it's weird how nature has evolved these animals or they have evolved to develop this that weird look like vultures like look disgusting you know but like look at that thing's face like there's something about the way nature is evolved or they have evolved and they're not yeah this is both to look scary yeah cute animals are delicious right a rabbit yeah yeah delicious deer deer delicious gorgeous animals right like if you eat a bear like you some people think bear acute but you got to cook the shit out of it yeah can we let's address something right now okay bear meat is is good it's very good it's very good it can be very hiding upon what they eat depending on what they eat where you're at like if you're going in September to Prince of Wales Alaska and you shoot one and it's just been eating salmon for a couple weeks clams on your age you don't want to eat that thing right if you're somewhere where we're good vegetation and it's it's well it's got a lot of fat on it it can be good I would argue it's not to be celebrated like it's not that good it's it is not as well it depends apparently if you eat a blueberry bear is one of the best meats ever yeah remember raves about see if Rinella does I I've had I've eaten a lot of bears and I like eating him I'm not I wouldn't throw him away or whatever so I would continue to hunt him but I've never had that same feeling of like an elk tenderloin or elk backstrap like it's just not an asset or an access it's not in that category so I feel like maybe we overcompensate a little bit because there's so much pushback on bear-hunting right we start talking about how great it is it's really good but it's not like it's not it doesn't get that next level have you had smoked bear ham now I have that's pretty damn good but that's one of those things where it's like it's smoked its Brian yeah treed yes and and that's the biggest thing right and you can most meats that you're gonna go hunting for you treat you look at the cut of meat and you treat it accordingly right and so there's no you have to obviously cuz of trichinosis you have to cook a bear all the way through to a certain temperature so that may be because I love rare meat that may be my problem I don't know I think maybe I think maybe a little bit we could address the fact that hunters a little bit of overcompensating for the fact that people are pushing back on them so much with and then they're like I love bear it's like it's good right but I wouldn't choose it in my favor I wouldn't choose it over a lot of other meats right if you have like it's bad but like if someone told me you have to pick one animal forever I'd probably say elk yeah and bear would be pretty far down the list yeah wouldn't it wouldn't make it in the top three or four right it would be all well that's a again the thing that you just said like I like eating things medium rare or rare that's where they taste the best yes yeah and so look I'm not I would never put something down for what I love bear me now you did all the time that's great I just that's the point I've always thought that I said it's like people like largemouth bass fishing but if you go to a restaurant and they have large mouth bass break Chilean sea bass and you pick the largemouth bass you're kind of an InDesign to yourself yeah come on man yeah good okay it's edible it's edible it's really good I mean if you pick that example because largemouth bass tastes bare tastes way better than largemouth we're going down the track like largemouth bass this doesn't taste that pays better than largemouth bass right did you read largemouth no it's okay so here's some delicious fresh water fish dilute he'll get Alaska and they're everywhere yeah yeah but yeah I'm not much of a fish eater anyway John barklow from Sitka was in Vegas this past weekend and we loved that did yeah he's great guy him and Dave Brinker were there and he was talking about how I love that guy dude I don't leave mouth oh yeah but I laughs you guys miss you guys you guys but John was talking about how he actually enjoyed brown bear meat and I was like really and he's like he does it tasted like a mule deer roast like he's goes I made it I gave it to people at parties and he said he doesn't like he cut it up into cubes and put little toothpicks in it and handed it out like as hors d'oeuvres at a party and people are eating in that wow this is delicious what is it and he goes it's a brown bear and people got mad at him it's a person I love that he bit it I love that he did it though I support I fully support that idea right but I would assume that if someone like John who works for Sitka this is probably the number one hunting gear clothing company in the world and John is a wealth of knowledge yes all the way through and you know a considerable amount experienced in the military I would imagine the people that would come to his house for a party yeah would be normalised well what happened in LA if you did like if you did that god they'd go crazy yeah there'd be a letter B riots yeah I should see the look on people's faces when my kids tell them that they've eaten bear cuz you know when the kids are like five and six like I'm eatin bear I ate a bear it was awesome do they have that like fierce look in their eyes like you just had a bear yeah they think it's fun to freak people out I do like that your sausage and your darts are cute like that's that's a wonderful thing coming out of there it's weird right it's you know the the bear thing is a very strange one and I I definitely don't like hunting them like I like hunting anything else and I struggle with that like I as a hunter I feel like coming on and talking as a hunter I don't want to like despair disparage anything but I also just want to be 100% honest about every part of it and hunting is this really complex activity and I feel completely conflicted about it almost every time I go like not about killing in or hunting but just got little parts of what's going on yeah and so bear much also sometimes you just want to like Rinella said this once and I never understood it until it happened to me he's like I just want to watch him sometimes I don't really want to hunt them and it's it's yeah what is hunting anyway is hunting killing or was hunting getting close enough to like or anything yeah it's the whole thing I think my opinion on that specific point is one I would go back to I always ask myself two questions why are you going and and does this hunting benefit the place and the animal that you're hunting and if I can't answer those questions myself and I always strip away conservation and meat from the first question well you have a very good way of looking at this but I think it's very honest I think this is super important is that conservation is essentially a side effect of hunting it's a byproduct right and to pretend that it's the whole thing it's almost like a weird it's it's a disingenuous approach to the argument but really saying you shouldn't be hunting will say well hunting is conservation and hunters of the best conservationists okay that's well that's true but part of that is true but it's not really why you're doing there and there's in here's the the biggest point to make there's semantic chinks in that armor right we've built up over the years as hunters like the use of organic meat and conservation is this like armor right right that insulates why we go and I think there's just jinx in that armor that if we don't recognize those points especially the conservation when I think that's a bigger deal like conservation hunting is a tool for conservation it's the same way as translocation is a tool conservationists you can move the animal to get them away from a certain situation reintroduce animal that's one way or bring in hunters and help manage the population that way but it's that first question right is why do I go and I always say it's like we've had experiences you and I together in the woods that I wouldn't we couldn't replicate anywhere else like you've done a lot of cool shit and there's some like when you ran down the road after chef boots like there's just something about that for me that is way more fulfilling and enriching to my life than any other thing I've experienced may I have experienced everything but all the things that I've done well it's so primal right and so it's that it's learning about animals you're in the woods too you're also in and really almost like you're a visitor in an alien world exactly and so you learn about these animals you develop skills I feel like you wouldn't develop any other way so and on and on it goes I mean there's probably a hundred reasons that I and I discover a new one every time I go and so I always say like that's the the first question why do I go it's not like man I'm real hungry and I want to control the population I'm aware as I go hunting that the two those two things are byproducts of my efforts then they're always gonna be byproducts in my efforts unless I'm poaching right you know I'm there is a biologist a state wildlife biologist federal biologists that determine what tags go where what animals they're moving pieces of the puzzle around to keep this thing the way it is right keep it healthy keep it stable but they're also looking at what's the economic impact of that all that's going on while I'm out there thinking I got to kill this big buck but I'm not thinking while I'm out there with my bow I'm not thinking well I'd like to kill that one because that'll really stabilize this area right I'm out there and I'm kill that one cuz I really like backstraps I know those two things are happening but they're almost like we pull that away from from what's actually going on and focus on why you're there like why do you go why did you go to the nigh like what somebody said why'd you go what would you say two reasons one to bow hunt for meat for sure because I wanted to eat access deer and two because I think that it's great practice one of the hardest things about ball hunting is just you can practice all day on a target but it's almost like never sparring like you could practice all day hitting a heavy bag but you've never haven't hit a person right like once you're in front of a person things get weird when there's a chink in the armor right so you so if I practice on the handle that's terrible I would say to that like that that's just another chink in the armor that we all know is happening like if we were conservationists we would never pick up a bow yeah but I'm not practicing on an animal like I've never practiced before right I got probably this is a practicing maybe being the wrong term like there's something in there that like the experience of stalking an animal is yeah pretty visceral and if you've never done it you could shoot your back are the hell you want well I say practice in terms of like when you compete as a young martial artist it's not really practice but it is and if like you're involved in competition it's like are you hunting or are you practicing we are definitely hunting but that hunting is practice for other hunts or you don't get nearly as many opportunities as you do in lanai lanai is the one of the best examples of a place that has no predators in a real problem with overpopulation you weren't with me and Dudley that one time where me and him and his son were hanging out and we were there at last light and we were watching these axis deer come off the mountain and we saw I don't know how many hundreds I mean it might have been seven eight hundred deer coming off this mountain and we were like what the fuck it was just crazy there's ten more there's five more there's six more there's 11 more there's a herd of twenty like what the fuck it got to the point we were like this is crazy so in a place like that I feel like you you have a a great ethical argument for like you they're going to shoot these animals period and the only other way to get around it is you bring in wolves yeah and if you bring in wolves wolves then you have wolves and these people also have dogs running around on the streets and you know like pet dogs so those dogs get fucked like immediately they're gonna get killed by wolves wolves want to take out all the very possible you can't have wolves on the night it's a stupid idea that's hey everybody is stopped we're never gonna do that but so it's one of the in terms of like since in since the animals are there and there there's no talk of eradicating them because they have a real value the people that live there live off of them like all those folks that we were hanging out with like Roman a lot of the people that work at that place they tax us all the time it is without a doubt not a net it is the opposite it is the most delicious gain me in the world I if it's not if it's not like number one it's not number one it's number two yeah it's amazing it's so good like we ate it at the restaurant they serve the restaurant we're gonna remember the burger we had that one lunch oh my gosh and then the steak place the steak place at that place terrible there's a terrible meaning good note arable I can't get out my mind sliders thanks oh yeah that's your sliders yeah but that's a restaurant serves tenderloin and it is phenomenal it's so good so why we like it that's why one thing I always try to separate and I try to do it only because I think I try to look at it from someone else who's a non hunter and it's not hearing us talk or hearing me talk or whatever and maybe thinking like that's a weird part of that like that's that's strange and so I feel like if I can say yes the meat is delicious yes they got to kill these things yes the local people value the animal because hunters exist you know they they wouldn't just gun them down because hunters will pay to go out there all those things I think set aside what am i there for like we were that group of hunters we had in camp was probably I mean I've hunted with a lot of awesome talented folks was probably the most skilled group of hunters I've ever been around well think about who we have we have John Dudley he's arguably if not the best bow hunter in the world he's in top three I think it's like it's like John well there's like top four like John cam Remmy and Adam they Adam Greentree yeah they might be all the people have fun it with that stop for I would say I think they might be the top four in the world and if they're not if they're not top four they're all during the top ten yeah right so this is a yes if you think you better come see us it's a clan of killers yeah I mean and then you got Shane Dorian he's a great bow hunter too and aesthetic wave sir yes to say about Shane he's fanatical like he would just I'd be like hey Shane you want to let go take a break get a sandwich and he'd look at me like what yeah he's like no we could be hunting why would we be eating sandwiches he was out there all day he didn't come in the bird is there in lunch time when everybody else was in cuz it was 95 degrees outside yeah he's out there on his hands and knees crawling all bushes crawling hoping to find one slippin that's just forever to crawl it but so that for me like one reason to do that stripping away all the things that I know to be right right in my own mind was that was those people getting them all together yeah then like meeting Ramon and me and Brandon and meet Alec all our guides and all the locals that were there like there's things I and I learned more about the quick twitch muscle when I got to here oh my god than I've ever learned so I feel like I've learned something I spent time with these people that that made me better at not just funny but everything well for people who've never been around and access to here before they evolved with Tigers so Tigers hunt them I mean you've never seen an animal more fast in your life how about that one deer that we shot I shot at this deer it was 60 yards away it was looking at me and I was like I think I'm gonna shoot it it's just standing there by the time my arrow got there it was four or five deer away it was swimming to Maui it build a boat and it was rowing over so sixty yards away the arrows going 275 feet a second and it was nowhere near it by the time it got there it's like they're so fast they're faster than any animal I've ever seen well that lets you say like what a weird scenario to be hunting an animal that has been trained by tigers to avoid you know what a weird thing so like that that's my appreciation yeah that little that little exchange of hey me and tigers both hunted this thing like that's that's something cool to me that's a that's outside of this thing so and talk about that all day and then the meat look if you're gonna if you're a person who values animal protein if you like ethically sourced animal protein there's no better way to get it than than like a place like lanai like all the pieces are in check do they need to kill them yes is there an overpopulation problem yes provide jobs for local yes yes all the good things I mean there's a lot of positive sides to it yeah and again if you're someone who enjoys bow hunting like look it's an uncomfortable thing for some people but I enjoy it I like it I like getting my meat that way I don't like I feel bad if I get bacon from a store I feel like are we talking about like a as predators like we are predators if you look at you know it's been millions of years we've been killing eating things no humans are herbivores and that's all a lie I don't know I've done some radium predator look you don't have to be a predator you could live off of but aren't we though we up some people but look you could live by pointers if you wanted to I don't want to disparage the way anybody lives their life you could live off of just pure vegetables you could live up and by the way there's a real moral and ethical argument if you are a vegan to eat mollusks folks because molix are more primitive than most plants they don't communicate as much as plants do they don't have any sense of feeling they have no nerve endings that would allow them to feel pain they're incredibly simple organisms the only thing that we have against them in terms of like when we think about them as being an versus you know like a plant people think eating a plant is cruelty free eating a malice you're killing a living creature right but that's just because they move but a fucking Venus flytrap moves too and it's probably ten times smarter than like a scallop like they're not smart it's hard to regulate that morality it's it is but I mean I just want people if you're if you're uncomfortable with eating chicken I get it but they're like clams and oysters and those things are good for you they really are and it's sustainable and the animals themselves are not feeling shit yeah the moral entanglements of all of it is just yeah and like we you know we say we're humans we wake up in the morning and you consume everything like you're just consuming you breathe air you pump out co2 I mean every other animal does too they just wander around chewing on the grass consumption engines like for us to to separate out one part of our consumption and then like beat the crap out of it even though we've been doing it for two million years is in and of itself kind of weird well you know what I think happened it's your mic on that was so weird sorry loud was weird I was like it was in my ear Jamie's on the ride really getting crazy but I think part of the issue is that people over the last 100 years or so have been so removed from where the meat comes from that when they're they can find a direct connection like oh you went and you shot a moose and then you ate that moose like you were that you killed the moose like you didn't have to kill that moose like that that becomes problematic because people aren't used to someone killing things yeah people that they know in particular know and I I enjoy the ideological conversation just enjoy the conversation right like I enjoy it because I think it's part of a human condition it's part of who we are and what we do so yeah we should probably fight about it a little bit and disagree because it's pretty damn important yeah this is an important piece of our humanity it is what we're talking about so I feel very strongly that hunting is like the essence of who I am as a human and has made my life better Brack and see how somebody else would say yeah that's your killing stuff I can too and I also think that those people are important I think so I think having vegans and having animal rights activists and having to be able to have dial with them it also makes sure that you keep people honest like people that are hunters like you you know like because we all know unethical people there's people that are unethical absolutely well and look at like if you I always think about it you know if you look at the trend of hunting and 70s honey was doing great and then in the 80s started to tick down look in Bambi that's what happened well I would say three we eyes we talked about this for like three things Bambi maybe Walt Disney's maybe a dick I don't know and then urbanization right which correlated with the klein and hunting and then hunters being a third one mentioning we have bad we're bad PR some of them are bad PR agents and awesome and people like Rinella that are amazing at it we're way better now than we were five years ago look better tomorrow than we were yesterday what I think like in general like if you look at that line graph right in the seventies it was going nicely and the eighty-two started to decline and I think 2011 was the first time it actually went up over a number of I think it's licensed sales or number of hunters participating I wonder what caused that it's like the organic food there was a study that said local wars they talk about more women they talked about returning military members I remember and reading the study I think that was the top three but I think local war was probably pushed out there is like the way to reverse that second point the way to reverse the suburban and urban rise was to take that suburban male or female and say you can hunt get your food right and then that's a way to kind of reverse the decline and I think that's probably what was happening hmm well everybody wants to go with locally sourced locally raised grass fed people are trying to go to farmers markets in connect with the people that are actually growing the animals and this is like one step better than that instead of having an animal that's in captivity go out into the forest but there's a rude awakening for a lot of these people that think they're gonna just go ahead and try it like it is not easy by any stretch of the imagination that's the other problem it's the Grand Canyon being I would love to I would love to procure my own elk meat and killing an elk is like being on two sides of the Grand Canyon there's no bridge to be built there you got to take it one step at a time and for most people that's just not enough time for that they don't have the want to do that so I would say was it like 14 million hunters in the world or something like that or in our country how many how many non hunters who don't either have like the wherewithal to be to get educated or want to mm-hmm or just don't fall into the anti on our side like the agnostic crowd how many of those are there out there right I don't know but it's hundreds of millions of people or you know there's a lot of them well urbanization one of the things that's done just just careers just careers in cities it's or eliminated almost all of your free time yeah and if you wanted to go out and procure your own meat first of all if you want to do with a rifle that's gonna take a tremendous amount of time but if you want to do with a bow multiply that by a factor of like maybe five or ten maybe a ten well 10 is probably pretty honest honestly and then you're talking about one of the hardest pieces is access right right even if you if you get with John Dudley and you learn how to be great Archer and you understand that in your suburban area there are some places where there's deer that you may kill you got to get access to rich places and then when you're done with that you've got to figure out a way to get that thing from dead deer to meat and all the other things so yeah this is just so complex how would you ever expect somebody just to be have like a desire you were like that at some point we - yeah well Rinella opened the door for me yeah super lucky forever grateful because when he took me into a wild back country Montana deer nuts it was very bright in the Missouri Breaks in October 9 degrees out freezing your dick off every night in a tent but he's like lifeless Steven Ella that's kind of loves it he loves suffering he loves it but I love that he loves it he's as legit as they come he really is and I think that's it right there is just this there's this big gap and my father got me into it but I my brother doesn't doesn't hunt and but I think has respect for and understands what's going on but he just I think at the time then I was introduced to hunting my brother was more interested in going out with his friends and Saturday mornings were not for getting up early and and so we're essentially the same person but I just went this way and he didn't go that way right so it's a weird so you could be in the same house with somebody in short a different way well Rinella has a real good way of looking at - he's like I don't expect people to go out and get rid of their own sewage why should I expect them to go out and hunt their own food like you don't have to well and he's I think he probably said this at some point or somebody smart did it was like I choose I believe it I choose - for me to be the one thing that I grabbed ahold of to bring into my - my skillset right I don't knit my own clothes I don't I don't make my own shoes I don't build my own houses you know we were just looking at some construction stuff a little bit earlier I'm like dude I don't what yeah what are they doing what are they doing yeah I couldn't do that I just picked this one thing because it's also part of my passion so you couldn't just ask someone who's a construction worker to go like go hunt get some meat I know you have a desire for that so that's just another hard part about hunting and non-hunters by-proxy are essential to hunting always an industry and opinion and because we could legislate ourselves out of being able to hunt that could happen mining is a privilege man that's not a right that's in a lot of ways so that's another whole nother can of worms but it could it could go away yeah I think the the issue is that so many people are opposed to it because they're so removed from the realities of the wild and they just feel some sort of moral superiority by either not eating meat entirely or by not killing their own meat they're not killing their own meat is really ridiculous like my wife was having a conversation with someone they were out to dinner with a bunch of people while I was on an elk hunt and the guy was eating a steak got from England in England they don't hunt or they do hunt these like foxes and horses and shit they were like tweed yeah pussies sorry guys carving a steak and my wife goes oh he's actually out elk hunting and the guy goes he hunts that's deplorable the guys had just a pourable while he's carving a steak I was saying something the other day like and I got I got a lot of like people were looking at me like I was weird at work one of my buddies at work was eating a chicken sandwich that from chick-fil-a and I look on the bag and there's a cartoon chicken on the bag and in my mind I'm like well that's like building a swimming pool by the lake it's fucking weird in irony that that we're like saying hey I'm eating the chicken but here's a cartoon version of it so we can celebrate the fact that we just murder this chicken and we fried it up like that doesn't make sense like a swimming pool with a lake as post smart because it's Paris on the rive rait wearing off time for a refill is weird you know what I mean well we definitely like to cartoon eyes these weird that'll work not really cartoon not personalized no well anthropomorphize is you take an animal you give it human characteristics personify no cartoon ofin this is go with it just turn to get into a fucking cartoon great drinks we'll do a sweet little cutie pie when really a chicken is a ruthless little fucking dinosaur that lays eggs for you every day but it is it is it weird to be eating a chicken and like there is where that chicken came from yeah it's a like a picture of the chicken right it's the kind of a seems like a weird way to handle it well it is weird but we like cartoons people love cartoons well that's like the personification of animals I think is a part of the bear situation yeah it's my kid my son's nine months old and from before he was born until now there's cartoon bears everywhere and there's like this you know personification of these cute little creatures that come along with being a little baby right and then and you look at so many Pixar and DreamWorks films that like personify animals yeah I think that's I mean it's there's some indoctrination into that right there has to be there is because in those those magazines or rather those movies and books even those animals are never like eating each other I mean if it's like the fucking if killed a hiker you know if a hiker fucked up on one of the episodes of Yellowstone and just took wrong the partners you know her and Yogi's like eating his rib a bunch of people show up to bear and yo you're just going out and ripping it apart eating Cubs ya eatin some dude asshole first screaming swatting at it with his fucking hiking that play in the circle of life in the background yeah yeah there's this I feel like there's some indoctrination and maybe maybe that's what happens I just don't know I have no idea why bears get this thing because bears are around it's not like there aren't bears around there in almost all states aren't they like yeah but what it is is people that don't experience them firsthand and when they do experience the first end usually they're in their car like look a bear and they drive by I would say that Tommy that one bear that was walking on its hind legs and that was cute all that one that had a broken front paws so there was that bear they called them like pedals or something like that yeah there was um my friend Tommy who lives in Connecticut sent me a picture of these bears that were in the middle of street duking it out in Connecticut like they're invading Connecticut now and they don't have any pressure so here's the thing about bear hunting as opposed to anything else like California is weird in that wood they don't hunt mountain lions but what's good about that is California has very little deer now it's not good if you like to hunt deer but it is good if you like to drive down the street and not slam in a fucking deer like Iowa doesn't have mountain lions but they do have a shit ton of deer and when you drive late at night in Iowa you gotta have your foot on the gas but ready to hit that fucking break at any second I just get the ranch hand girl garden juice Mad Max real people like everywhere you look in like Iowa and Montana these people have pickup trucks with these battering ram front grille things that they deer do we kill on Lanai where you and any of the deer oh we must have hit we think har oh yeah with Brandon's truck I think we hit at least two or three deer did you while we were on Lanai any romans a better driver than brain must be it's what's going on man if you're listening we never handle ten - we didn't even hit one yeah we hit multiple but they were telling me about them they're like people just slam in almost you know I'm sure the insurance industry would really enjoy well in Cam's town last year a guy died because a guy in front of him hit a deer alright and the deer flew through the err and went through his windshield and brained him for luck that's a shit luck that's not like having a longer you hear a story like that you like I would've ducked do you hear that like I would a dog that guys are pussy I've been like no I would have been driving my car and I would have seen this deer flying through there and I'm like well it was a good run it's been a good time airborne deer like it's bad luck the 150 pound black tail yeah into the air fuck the hell antlers and hooves yeah I'd have been like Jeff wells I lived all these years without this happening that was lucky that's probably more lucky right yeah yeah but that's I mean you know you start to like break down those things like more animals less animals the value of them and all these things what a complex freakin thing to have to figure out I always just get more you read the more you jump in the more you go you know going to New Zealand going to you Northwest Territories going in Nepal you go to these places and you just realize that everybody has the same essential problem like how do we cohabitate how do we live with these things that that we were in some ways meant to consume like there's evidence of two million years ago in Tanzania humans early humans hunting and so a hundred thousand generations of people have ascent to have lived on the hunter-gatherer diet you know then you had the Industrial Revolution couple generations of people kind of were introduced to a new diet and then the last couple generations you have processed foods right and so you like everywhere that I've ever been you find people struggling with that thing okay we're not it's just not us in America right but you can exist on a plant-based diet yes no a lot of people really absolutely can be done and I'm sure in there's a hundred thousand generations there was plenty of people that didn't you know exist on the hunter-gatherer diet alone but the majority of money there were honestly because I feel like people were just really super opportunistic back then I mean if you were just trying to serve Ivan struggle I don't think you would could say like hey I don't want to eat that rabbit no yeah that rabbit is the way I live and then you know where it spelled and that's oh yes different I was writing a piece one time and I got into reading about these basket weaver people that were in valley of fire state park in nevada which is really close to vegas you should go if you've never been up there basket we were yeah basket basket maker or basket weaver people they're like Native Americans yeah they were essentially a roving band of nomadic hunters yeah I can't think of the year you probably could up and find it but there was different generations of this essentially roving band of tribes and in that area the next time you're in Vegas it's like an hour drive north there's a bunch of petroglyphs there that's a pick like deities and sheep and all these different things there and you could just go visit them but you know what's fucked up about those petroglyphs man they're not protected like there's a ranch in Texas that a buddy of mine went to and he's like you could just go over there and touch these things and they might be 5,000 years old I did that when my wife and I went up there you could had a can of spray paint they weren't shit like fucked up is that it's strange it's strange that you wouldn't find a way but also probably you know it's probably okay because it's a natural occurring you know this is a natural place you won't put fences up or no guard standing there no it's actually pretty badass that no one's fucked with it yes far well and so you go up there and you see these things and you're like holy crap so I started reading a little bit about those people and they were part of a nomadic band of hunters gatherers that lived in caves and essentially followed desert bighorn sheep much like any of the planes followed Buffalo alright so they were they essentially followed these things and into this valley eventually the Anasazi Anasazi Indians move in they start cultivating the land and planting crops and you get this like oh my gosh agriculture and hunting which one is better what do we do and so the whole story of that interaction is interesting to me because it's kind of the evolution of our culture right hunting has created this social structure ways for us to communicate it's created all these things ways for our body to grow and expand as we were you know early humans ways for our brain expand and grow and function differently and then you have this like oh it's a lot easier to plant crops in the ground than it is to go kill a sheep right guys right anybody is this easier so then you get into this weird thing about what do we do now you know and so I think their their story was very much like the Anasazi Indians they go in they cultivate this area and as long as they could grow crops that's what they did you know and so this nomadic band of hunters kind of settled in this area I'm sure they still hunted to get me because they have to because you can't grow the whole year's worth of food for for a valley like that but I think agriculture kind of won out a little bit in that in that scenario and as it would it's easier way to live yeah evolutionary what I mean the whole thing is filling your belly that's the whole thing and everything you know you can do to do it whether it's with deer or whether it's with corn or whether it's with tomatoes or whatever you can grow and you know you just have to eat I mean that's that's the whole the whole picture is staying alive back then that's not our whole picture today so that's where it gets really complicated and that's where I think that hunters have done a really good job over the last X amount of years describing to people like if you are going to eat meat this is the most ethical the most cruelty-free and the most natural way to do it and you're talking about an animal that literally like okay here's perfect at deer that mule deer they looking at written that deer had no idea I was alive until it died and it died instantly it was boom one shot it dropped right where I shot it and that's it and then it becomes steak you know and it becomes delicious food that we ate and that's uh that's way better than any other animal that you're ever gonna buy in the store I don't care if you're talking about farm-raised grass-fed you know locally sourced I feel like your evolution as a hunter has been accelerated more than most practice that's how you do everything but you went from when I first we first hunted in British Columbia was three three years ago yeah so where you are now I mean you've evolved in this like what you see is hunting and in our community and in our old and doing different things and in some ways you evolved from when I was a kid we just shot deer oh here's a spike here's a four point she'd this deer and that was a great day we dragged it off and eat it and it's great now I understand way more about what I was doing then and what I'm doing now and I think what at hunters we need to be cognizant of and comfortable with is you change your sensibilities change over time you don't become a trophy hunter you're not a trophy hunter but you do appreciate the difference between a small and learned animal and a large one as in terms of its maturity and it's how awesome it is to see 380 inch elk or 200 inch deer you know you you your pursuit is different than one was only shot that moves it is also but the also part of the pursuit that's different is that I understand that the benefit of going after mature animals is if you're getting a mature deer you're talking about a deer that's five years old that deer has had five breeding seasons that spread its genes and by killing it you're gonna give a chance to the younger bucks that are coming up to breed so it's done its part it spread its genius its created its progeny and now you'll take it out about mix and that's the right way to do it because then you ensure a healthy herd that like especially for bear that's the big argument you want to take out the dominant males because the dominant males actually eat the cub Marauders of animals that's the craziest part about it is by shooting a boar you're gonna save the lives of many bear yeah it's a week in many ways it's kind of a catch-22 because you're talking about controlling population isn't it isn't it catch-22 that the a younger deer tastes better yeah it's so like you're out there like I really love access to me but to dinner when when we're over there they're like we have certain call box and there's certain things you want to shoot it's like I really have access to here and if I was out there just for meat I would shot the youngest right not the youngest but I would have picked a certain age groups know but I'll tell you here's the argument against that with access deer that deer I shot was not young that was a big-ass deer and that fucking thing's delicious like you so they're better than that when they're younger I don't need that it's a fact that a younger animal is or tender there's a better better cut of meat than an older animal for sure in most cases it's not all cases yeah but that's that's the general that giant elk that I shot where you saw the antlers they're all delicious that's amazing I've been eating that thing for eight months now it's fantastic yeah I do the same thing but I'll kiss great no matter what yeah yeah you're talking about two animals that it's hard it'd be hard to mess it up yeah but in general that's the that's that's the hard to matter right since there's there's that argument though you know why I don't like that argument I don't mind chewy meat and I like I like eating what I kill right so like it feels good to me on top of it tasting good like if I eat a deer that's a six year old deer there's two things going on there one there's a satisfaction that I know the six year old deer is very difficult to hunt yes you know so most of the places where you hunt other people are hunting as well a six year old deer has seen people that are hunting deer period that's right so that deer is going to be on point that's a tough deer to kill so that by killing that deer you get extra satisfaction that's one and then on to you your your your your eating this animal that you have this connection with so it tastes good because of that and I'd like I like meat that tastes like me I don't want like filet mignon you know I like I like a deer steak you know like uh it's the best a sirloin from a mule deer are better that well I would say like if you took conservation and organic meat right and you say I'm going for I understand both those principles I'm going hunting everything's great you're shooting that six year old mule deer right if you if you remove conservation you're probably not going to shoot that six year old mule deer right because you're gonna get a younger deer that's easier to kill more 10 or more delicious turn you gotta shoot that right you know our doe Garcia the chef in Montana yeah he gets shit from other hunters cuz he'll shoot a spike on purpose look I'm here for the meat guys he goes I'm grocery shopping that should be in general that should be ok but there's principles that say like the shooting them mature animal is more beneficial to the herd so that's yet another complexity that we should all just say like man this is here I just gotta continue to talk about it that's important I think what you the way you approaches very important because you're entirely honest about the good and the bad and then the bear thing you know it's like it's not the best for me it's good mean it's good but it's not as ELQ yeah I'm not gonna stand up and be like hey pussies eating the berries the best thing ever it's not some people love it though I don't know if they're telling the truth they're telling the truth but it's just I'm just I would assure them if they would dabble some other meats they'll find one that's better I'm pretty sure well I guess it depends entirely about the way to pace prepare it right but the thing about there's an argument for hunting bears is different than the argument for hunting any other animal because you do eat them and you need to kill them because they don't have a natural predator the problem with bears is like especially if we went in Alberta Jesus Christ they are everywhere people who think there's a shortage of bears need to go to Alberta they're people that want to have one of those experiences where you walk away from that be like don't just do that yeah they're 20 fucking bears hanging out over there with Cam like I wish we get can call cam cam please text in your job cam poop your job cam and telling you for years quit your job you're too cool to have a nine-to-five uh it's he's got a 7:00 to 5:00 Lord takes two hours lunch to go work out and run the mountains well that's savagery this savagery he does pretty good for half a second to five Scott damn Sam did you am I gonna get my ass together he's a legit savage I know well every time I'm complaining about anything I think about campaigns getting up at four o'clock in the morning to run think about that like 198th mile 205th he's gonna do 234 this summer Elliot's worse my dad was an ultramarathon runner growing up and it just gets worse it's like smoking crack oh they just get deeper in water how much look around or that's probably a terrible analogy but jeez I'm scared of it because I keep running further and further distances I'm like what am i doing and I'm doing it more and more often what am i doing you're if you're feeling that runner's high well it's a little bit of that but it's also like I feel improvement and I'm an improvement junk ya know I can keep I'm pushing further I'm going further distances I feel better when I hit the top of the hill yeah well my dad like when I was a kid I remember my dad just being you know a regular he must been mid 40s maybe late 40s and he mode we have like a fairly small backyard and he mowed a little circle and he would go out after working his jeans and his loafers and like jog around the circle it was very good I remember looking out there being like what are you doing man how big was he hard it was like maybe an acre I don't know what very big he was running like just little circles in this yard let me get to the end of the story you'll you'll get eventually but that was that was his way to run right and so after a while he started running you know got running shoes and started to get into the actual sport of running and then it seems to me like three or four years later he was like I think I'm gonna run this 50-mile race in the mountains of Maryland JFK 50-mile and had he run marathons no so 50 mile races like what it was not like six hours seven hours I just didn't really good shade or nine hours I think eight or nine I think only started or maybe ten I think twelve is like the cutoff one interesting like eight hours for 54 for a hundred it's 24 of course it is it's like listen bitch my dad used to run he's hunted places it was like the JK 50 bothers up over his Mountain it's not like I remember you used to tell me stories of like people falling and like busting themselves all up on these rocky cliff trails and he would come in and this is gonna make my dad sound weird he's not he's he's awesome but he would like save his toenails all this time I was would fall off during the race and he like save them put them in a little jar no save his boogers - no no just toenails and he was almost like this it's like I can take that right I could see this thing and then he's ran 50 and I think one time he ran 100 and then he ran the entire C&O canal one time 183 miles and I was like I think it was in maybe a senior in high school and I had like had to drive to the checkpoints and like give him food and stuff so he never started until using this 40s guy maybe fifties it was 40 s probably I would say yeah later did he keep does he still do it how old you know he would still do it if his knees would allow him to he's mid-60s and a sixth he fucked up but he's still he's he'll still bike and he'll still he hikes all the time now so he still has that like need to push push and and he all in like when he gets around one of his buddies in particular that they ran together they're like old army buddies and talking about this like experience that they shared together like maybe that one time a mau mau 94 when you trip and fail and and that it's just like they're telling old war stories it's like that's this visceral thing that they share it's really cool he did it past I mean maybe it's a midlife crisis man I don't know but yeah he wasn't predisposed to run 100 miles until he decided that he wanted to yeah it's weird right that that compulsion is a very odd one that the need for suffering like cams got it bad it becomes a thing yeah he's got it bad in a weird way my dad like he got a knee surgery and then like well they said it was ACL I think it was right it was the scope of his knee get an Easter scope scope it's an easy one so what it they cut his knee open remember what I don't want to say the wrong one but he had knee surgery they're like give it for four or five days before you're up and moving around and he was like Josh walking around the backyard on day two limping around just you could just tell he was in pain oh that must have been meniscus yeah something like that some tendon of some sort but it was just like you just see this dude is this is if he can't do this man it's not good for his psyche hmm if he can do it he's a happy guy well there's something that happens to you when you push yourself like that where it makes regular life easier and that's part of the addiction it's that's real I went to Nepal man that's exactly I came back I was like I brought back a sheep I killed and all that stuff but the perspective was what you were telling me how you were hallucinating I saw a baby I did tell me about that all right how high were you we got will have to start we were there we were like 13,000 maybe 13 or 13 5 13,000 feet above sea level yep and since sketchy is far it's sketchy it's not something to mess around with I found yeah especially on this trip so we were wanting blue sheep in Nepal blue sheep blue sheet what does that little get up looks kind of like an awl dad it's got these oh wow it's got really really you can really see their annual I like the the age rings and their homes and that goes straight out they're short and stocky it'd be cool to look at them they're a cool animal and it's one of those things where we went to hunt him and I didn't really have much of an idea of what blue sheep was until until we started getting into the thing there's one oh wow that's what they call them everything wow what a cool looking animal yeah yeah mine wasn't quite that big and that one looks like it might be at a farm but uh this is mowed grass and yeah maybe we don't do goats motor grinds that looks like more I saw a very disturbing video of goat eating a whole bucket of chicks a little baby baby chickens yeah it was on what were you watch it was on an Instagram page I think it was either was Jimmy Jew or clownin the homie yeah that's it right there look this fucking will goat I was just sitting there eating this is on YouTube and what's the name of the video Jamie they're amazing goat eating live alive baby chicken so there's these two there's several bins of baby chicks and this goat is just standing there and it just reaches in choose one down and the goats aren't carnivores so they don't have the teeth for this and I think this baby chicks trying to fucking claw its way out he reaches in he's just like I can't catch it lost that one that one lived the look he gets one here we go I got your bitch just start shit one just starts chewing like what we this one wild Impala fights back is its guts fall out feel really making the cases easy Christ predator hunter yeah look at this this will know paula is getting chewed apart by this wild dog oh my god do it don't stop it oh my god but it's just low it's in it's in the cavity yeah oh Jesus Christ that's like where the bacon is god the Africa your dirty mother look at this this impalas like come on bitch you need me I'm stabbing you motherfucker I know I got weapons I'm look at your tail oh look at this showdown this is guts are literally hanging out to the ground and it's standing up how tough are these things man and I mean I would not want to get gored by that Impala oh yeah and a horn the dog doesn't either they on a road yeah they sure are there's a road right there paved road look how it just circles them too we can't catch them on the flank isn't it just messed up like wolves and coyotes they hit the back legs first yeah they cause that shock and blood loss I'm a big fan of cats because these cats will grab you by your neck I really hope there's some motherfuckers not doing that there's a whole minute thirty left of this yeah oh there's more oh wow more come in yeah that's it that's a wrap oh and they just grabbed the gun oh look how much more is falling out now oh how can it be alive I have no idea I don't understand and they're just going after the leg here comes another one yeah we're having some vegan Oh dinner it's like what six of them seven seven it's dead hopefully it's dead look at that chunk I just pulled one watching look how fast they tear that fucking thing apart look at that it's just body cavity now holy shit no jokes and those guys are nothing compared to hyenas yeah it's hard out there is the point like if you get hit by an arrow it's way better than that folks I was like sorry minute of Terror yeah we're going for the vitals we're going for double lungs go for a heart it's gonna end nice this is the biggest problem the internet you get from like what's a blue sheep to that shit yeah well you can go way deeper than that you know yeah I saw a guy chop his dick off the other day what oh yeah yeah I just for a goof I was looking at different tags online and I looked for hashtag triggered I think I might a road hashtag triggered in something so I look for hashtag triggered thinking I could find a post that I wrote oh good luck there's millions here only one of them was this one dude chopping his own dick off and they somehow another got on Instagram I was like yeah nobody nobody caught it before they pulled it down look there's no way they can take down everything fucked up there's hash tagging it though that's Savage guys are like they're like well we're getting ready to get this done what do we do for the hashtag cuz that's we got to market it like we gotta have people triggered triggered yeah they have to market it isn't that funny marketing marketing is a big thing right you know what I was reading some inhalation some fuck in YouTube not even YouTube rather some Instagram person was talking about what they do to market their brand and all they really got like a fitness person looks like get the fuck out of here man you have a brand you have 10,000 followers are you a brand or are you just some dude who does squats yeah you can't be like Tuesday's arms and back that's my brand's my brand my brand marketing swinging working hard on my brand it's like those those those kind of phrases people use those a lot and they won't do something because it's off brain that's even although that's an extra level of douchiness I feel really it's not like my brand like I won't put that up because it's off-brand for me my brand right exactly quite preposterous social media so tell me about seeing the baby in Nepal let me finish Siegen yeah so we're looking for the blue sheep so I'll start off by saying that we were hunting in a very rural nice a rural it's like six days walk from the nearest road where we were at because the blokes days and I said how many days walk to the paved road and they're like be like I don't know if you're talking about like we don't know we could engage that and so we're in this remote region of Nepal in this district called a Roku district and to say that the roken district is full of this like primal these primal people and animals in this is really this out there place I think you know to be out away from civilization that was the the furthest I think you could feel I mean we were out there and the people the people there were part of a civil war than the Poli Civil War from 1996 to 2006 this district was maybe the epicenter of the rebellion there was a communist party rebellion against the government we can still monarchy and so the people there are amazing because they've lived in this abject poverty for their entire lives and not only that they've lived through this civil war in recent times I think we think about civil wars this like thing we go to see a National Park so anyway we're we're with these people we're hunting we go into we get helicopter into 10,000 feet which is this just knob in the middle of nowhere we hike about a full day to our base camp which is a little village called dule yarsa in the middle of course nowhere it's like this terrorist village and we meet our Sherpas and meet a bunch of locals and from there we go up we're gonna do I think we had two or three more days of hiking just to get to the area where the blue sheep live so you're hiking from about 10,000 feet and at our highest we're at probably 16 or 16 and some change and so the first day we go up and we acclimate we cite in our rifles were hanging out and we go into this lady's little mud dirt hut essentially it's just like prized half the size of this room with a little with a goat standing in the corner and a little fire pit we're sitting around this fire pit and they start she starts telling this story about how right where we were sitting during the rebellion the police the government police came in and shot six men right where we were sitting and buried him oh Christ and this is like this lady must be in her mid-50s and she she looked like she was 80 I mean she's just like today this it was this transformative thing for me sitting there listening to this being translated like holy crap where are we and in admits that story they're passing around they had made this moonshine which they called Roxy it's just like made in a ceramic thing outside of where we were at and so we were all just drinking and I wasn't thinking much about drinking it and then we had one more day before we left the next day everybody was sick but me I'm talking shit your pants puke out the tent we had two or three people shit their pants the next day like it was the the Katmandu flu like everybody everybody that wasn't native to that area got sick I didn't on the first day so everybody recovers the next day we're going up the mountain we're going up we had probably climbed about 2,000 feet we go over this pass and I'm feeling good I feel like everybody else was probably feeling pretty crappy and we're going up down this ravine and this river valley to go we're on these like 2 or 3 foot wide goat trails probably it's like you if you go to the right you're dead if you step two feet to the right you're gonna die you're dead you fall off in you're dead we've got 24 Sherpas and porters we've got three or four mules with all our camp gear going up this mountain in a string of people probably 30 people long I'm in generally in the middle and we stop at some point after we had crested this High Point and we're going down and I remember feeling pretty good got my trekking poles I'm going it's warm outside and I'm going like enjoying the view and looking around just thinking oh my god and then out then I remember pretty quickly being laying in the snow like oh I'm laying in the snow that's cool like wow I had no recollection how I got there what how was happening at like so you're hiking and then I wake up I was laying I don't know that I lost consciousness but I just didn't I don't think in my mind I understood what was going on like I kind of maybe stumbled back against this rock wall and then just slumped down in the snow I don't think anybody saw it and so I kind of stood up and I'm like you're okay you're good you fell down whatever maybe a little weird and I keep going we had a little problem with the mules these mules we were going over this snow pass and the mules couldn't get through it so they had to turn these meals around send them back they couldn't get through it because the snows yeah I got videos of snow stood deep and you're talking to trail half as wide as this table maybe and they're trying to get these and you're you know a thousand feet down to the river yeah and so we stopped we all stopped a second time to let these mules go back by and like I had to hang onto a bush on the side of the trail as they went by and I got back up on the trail you hanging onto a bush for dear life well I mean you get yet footing but we had we had filmmakers with us that we're doing all kinds of crazy shit like hanging off hanging off cliffs and doing stuff to make a video yeah let's make film yeah they were and so we stopped we start going again most everybody gets out in front of me I'm slowing up and I'm feeling dizzy and I'm like man okay maybe I just stood up too fast I didn't eat enough today I'm going we're going and at some point I just like it's snapped in the room was just like spinning like crazy and I was thinking and I knew about altitude sickness and I knew that I live in a place that's basically sea level and I was at a place that was 13,000 feet and I've never done that before and yeah prepare for it at all she-she's can I mean there's not really any I trained I did for about we didn't really know we were gonna go until later so I trained for about a month and a half but not you can't train like there's no they told me before we go like altitude sickness there's no predictor you could be a rookie or you could be a veteran you can get it like that like it's just it's part of the way your brain loses oxygen at those altitudes and this is no real predictor for it and so I don't think physically I was having any problems but so and I don't know that I had altitude sickness but anyway the effects were I kind of sat down I shouldn't go anymore because I couldn't get I wasn't out to walk on this trail and I couldn't freakin stand up right and so our medic slash interpreter slash producer Cameron Ben Ayers comes back to me and starts talking me through he's you know this dude's climbed everywhere had been everywhere and is a medic and so he's talking me through a little bit of the situation he's like this is not good like if you're too dizzy to walk no good so let's get some water in you let's rest let's get some food in you see what happens meanwhile up the valley gear the rest of the crew to the next camp so him and I spent like 20 minutes just going really slow and I couldn't do it I was like I can't stand up dude I can't catch my I can't get my head to get back on my shoulders and so we sit down and we're sitting there and I look across this little bowl in this valley and I see this wolf oh my god cool man that's a wolf to get my binders out I'm looking I can't find it put him back look over I was like been its wolf over there I see I see it it's like it's laying down he goes shit looks like crap there's no wolves here man like oh my has no wolves in all of Nepal he's like you're not gonna see a wolf here basically I don't exist there they don't exist where we were in that district in that and the hunting everywhere he's like that's not nope so you were hallucinating I was hallucinating but it was not one of those like you see it and then you shake your head it's gone it was like looking at it and it was you know just this like what it could have been a stump but in my mind it was a freaking wolf losing my shit a little bit at that point I'm like this is not good and so then I'm sure in his mind he's thinking Diamox is a is a pill you can take to help with altitude sickness and he's thinking about okay are we helicopter and this guy out of here on day two how do what are we gonna do cuz it's you know not you know pulmonary edema cerebral edema that's nothing to mess around with it was only day two was yeah well day two of the actual trip we were four or five days into being in Nepal what they two of the the trek in and so we sat there for a while and I like I'm just looking and I remember just looking after like 10 minutes it's still it being there like this is not good and so we get up to go and I'm like I can do it man I'm gonna do it because I don't want to leave I want to hunt and we get going a little further down this trail and at this point I'm trying to like find some levity in the situation joking with him he's joking with me we're just like trying to be normal and when I know that my head not normal we're going real slow and I look on this like side hill of this trail and there's a fucking baby I thought that's I thought come on baby like I didn't say anything to Benz I'm naked I feel like it was a really big naked baby you might have a diaper on so I don't know Joe it was unusually size like a baby that you know if you saw it on the street you'd be like whoa what a whopper that's a serious baby science should be studying this and so I'm thinking like I'm not saying nothing to Ben because this baby is like my ticket at home like this baby maybe like cue the chopper right see you buddy right you can't make in this Bay it wasn't like the wolf it wasn't like I saw it and I stated like I saw it and then I looked back and it was there and I look back it wasn't there so I kept going I'm like you know what baby if you're really there fuck you we shouldn't be up here anyways it's not my fault wow you got harsh yeah I got harsh with them with it that's my fake baby let's fake baby like I'm just going man I'm not whatever baby stay there Wow so I didn't say anything to Ben about the baby like right off and we're getting going and eventually I just kind of collapse and like look at me that you know I was talking positively and I wasn't hallucinating any more than the baby and the wolf which is enough and we get down we get going down this ravine and the camp you can start to see camp guys putting camp together and essentially he's like just give me your pack commune tracking polls giving everything and he held my shoulders and just kind of one step one step one step Wow for a solid hour and a half or so until we got to camp Wow a lot of breaks a lot of just him and I talking about here's the scenarios are you is this really you know is it acute mountain sickness or are you you know what did you get sick like the other people got sick yes so that's out in the next five day so tonight in the next you think it was because of drinking that moonshine I think we got sick because of the moonshine it could have been water and that man do it could be anything how are they making that moonshine I've no I have a picture I'll show you like it was look like in this big ceramic thing but we all did everybody in there got some level of sickness that wasn't used to that area it wasn't used to beating DePaul and eating the food and drink the moonshine and all that so who knows it was the moonshine that was burning good been anything so we finally make it to camp and we're doing a film so they're filming me while I'm all messed up and I was kind of out of it I mean we're coming down the this switchback trail to go into camp I remember like not I much like when I felt like I'm aware that my feet are hitting the ground and these trekking poles are hitting the ground and like I'm aware that I'm doing this but I feel like I'm I can't control it I feel like I could be floating through the air just as well as walking he's a weird like head detached from body feeling Wow is gnarly and at the end of the day I think what they thought was like it was this sickness that everybody else got coming on at the same time as altitude and it was just my body was fighting this battle against itself so we got back to camp I think I just kind of sat in a chair for awhile and said a lot of weird stuff and they think I said what's the name of this mountain because that's you gotta know the name what's gonna kill you or some weird like Dartmouth wow this mountains out to get us Joe we thinking about your family yeah oh yeah right that's the first thing you think about what's your in a bad situation in the woods and why did I come here why do I have to be this adventuring asshole and that yes that a hundred percent I think I was more focused on levity and more focused on like making jokes and like making it seem okay because that's the only way that my mind could wrap itself surround like oh hey you dumbass you trained for a month you went in Nepal what are you doing you're an idiot right you got a kid you live in Texas you this is not this is your brain and body telling you like when dummy don't do this but at the same time like I'm here it's amazing these people this place the feeling spirit like you know you got to get through it like if there was anything to get through then you it would be this right and so you get I got hardened to that fact and I think you know as essentially I had some water and I went to sleep and I woke up in the middle of night and I been de Matic was in the tent clutching his a little medical bag and sleeping in there with me so I feel like that serious I think they had a discussion while I was sleeping about do we just does he wake up in a helicopter you know does he wake up going back to Kathmandu which is probably the right conversation to have it's a Bob Seger song wake it up it Katmandu did you tell anybody about the baby oh yeah baby eventually eventually right at the moment when the baby was there I'm like listen baby Wow let's make it let's make a pact I'm gonna keep you under wraps for a while so you're basically like tripping balls yeah I don't know the science of it somebody smarter than me could tell you like what actually was going on whether I was just a pussy or there was some actual like scientific stuff going down I got a Farkle joint since it's illegal and it's legal here in California has just hit me hard keep going I'll keep going while you're doing that so the next day there's more to the story to tell there's price so much to tell but the next day we get up and I'm feeling okay feeling pretty weak still not it's not poisoning week yeah like that weird thing we feel like you can't really make a fist like a key yeah kinda so we did a little bit of filming in the morning and it was like hey O'Brien can you make it up for this acclimation hike right can you go up this hill right here can you make it up this hill right here if you can we'll let you keep going you so they give you a test yeah I could test you O'Brien and so I get up there I go with one of the guides Raju let me get up we start hiking we get up over this rise I'm feeling pretty good shit okay that was a bad moment in time I'm going home we're back sheep come on with sheep let's do it and we're going I think we probably had a five or six hour hike into the next camp we started getting into sheep country at that time and we're hiking and I'm feeling pretty good and we get to a spot where our main guide maan had spotted some sheep and so we get to where he had spotted some sheep and I'm feeling tired I'm like that we're going up as we go so we may be there 14,000 feet or thirteen five at that point and we sit down he's glassing his sheep and I remember glass and I'm like okay they're like so far up you can't imagine going that far to get him and then I've my stomach just like oh no oh God my stomach is completely screwed does your butt start going and get that muscle but muscle or you know that butt muscle like when you're holding a weight that you're gonna drop let me say this about shitting your pants everybody on this trip was okay with it because it was happening right it was the shitting the pants was like a it's not like you're on a plane yeah and it was like our camera guy one of our main camera guys ran on it was an amazing person the whole nother podcast about that guy he shit his pants I think during like day one and I don't know how many pairs of pants he had but I remember watching him like scrubbing the shit out of his pants thinking shit that's gonna get interesting but by the time we got into sheep country we were all okay with like the occasional shart or whatever's going right I think it's fine cuz your body's just like you realizing that your mind has a directive that's right but your body is dealing with some pretty extreme conditions and I wonder I always want her now looking back on it look how well I would have done if there wasn't sickness and like I had some stuff like go to Katmandu and it's just dust and dirt all this craziness and I had going into it like respiratory issues and then sickness and then visions of things and so I feel like by the time you get in there you know it really makes you respect the fuck out of Jim shocky oh yeah for people who don't know who Jim shocky is Jim shocky is extremely respected in the hunting world but let's just step aside with that he's an amazing accomplished hunter but maybe even more important than that he's got a show called uncharted and his Uncharted show is so good it's so good that it really shouldn't be considered a hunting show because what it really is is him exploring cultures in the most remote parts of the world Jim goes to these strange villages in the middle of Russia that no one goes to Ivan I got all kinds of stories like last time I was at Jim's place up in Canada like it he's what's she doing this weekend I'm like I fly home hang out with the family what are you doing is like a bison and Poland same kind of thing right and then when I was I saw Jim about a month before we left for Nepal and Jim had been and you should if you can find foot the the full episode of Jim's Nepal hunt with his crew it is it they film that they're like two in self filming that's kind of it's how I felt dislike you're just a here's a mess just a mess and I I said to him it's like I'm going an apology him and like a month and he goes what thank I was like what can I expect he's like it sucks it sucks and when somebody like Jim shocky who's traveled the world literally the world it says it's gonna be terrible for you little fella I was like oh no this is real now I'm gonna be in trouble yeah Jim shocky has a video or an episode of his show where he went to I think it was Mozambique where they're hunting crocodiles good Island because the crocodiles eat all the people that work and that live and work in this village it is so crazy these poor people these people live under the threat of monsters on a daily basis like half the people in the village read their missing arms or they have a chunk taken out of their leg and one they were there they lost a woman she was going down there either to fetch water or to wash her clothes and she got taken out and these people were screaming and weeping it was so hard to watch man to watch a bunch of people wailing just wailing oh because they know this woman that they loved got taken under by a monster remember the end of that yeah the end of it where they cut the croc open and pulled what was it like a shoe or something out of the Crocs belly sometimes shirt something like that I remember we were talking about that later on and they're like that should be on a different Channel yeah it's so good so it should be on Discovery what's his son's name that films up Braylon Bram Lind is a motherfucker he is a bad motherfucker Emily Eva their daughter but you know how he is here's my criticism of outdoor an air quotes TV there's episodes like Rinella z-- that are just brilliant I mean Rinella show or shows rather like Ryan Ellis Rinella show is just a brilliant show I mean it easily could be on any other network it's it's shot by zero point zero the same people that shoot Anthony Bourdain's show the same people that shoot a ton of award-winning Emmy award-winning shows it's a brilliant show and then you got these things that look at they shoot them with trail cams a bunch of dips yeah it's they're all you know they're you know the Lord blessed me when this bull came over to Ridge like okay you think they just think there's a rampant anti intellectualism like an embraced sort of like fake simplicity to it yeah there's like Heartland pandering that goes on all of this pandering way look but then you've got Jim shocky who has this like legitimate appreciation for these cultures that he visits all over the world I mean it goes to these incredibly remote places and communicates with these tribes people that live in the jungle or the Mount or wherever it is and you could tell that this is a guy Jim is like what does he buy probably sixty or so he's getting up there yeah and he he realizes that he's lived a long life and has experienced a lot of wild and amazing things and now at this point in life would have really desires or extreme experiences of a human kind yeah and also of a wild kind like in nature there's like a different level to him yeah I thought our TV thing is funny just because like I do appreciate and have friends that are like fall into that you know buffer zone Baba zone yeah alright and I appreciate what they do and like it's not for me I don't wash it and I'm a fan of it but I appreciated other bubbles like it and it's a thing like it's it's it's hunting right but I will agree with you these are another level there's there's just a different level you could watch Rennell as coues deer episode where he just kind of like the whole theme is like sitting in silence and like if you're looking for them talking about his dad I'm talking about growing up and there's no music it's just wonderful and so you can watch something like that and then every once in a while you'll see one where you're like there's such a juxtaposition between that what what Steve and Jim and some of these I like Heartland bowhunter these guys are able to like even cinematically produce yeah Heartland bowhunter they do a really good job with their editing and their footage and they do a really good job it's an reme like solo hunters are really great timber - yeah and so like there is this really good and like I don't know if they're pulling up the the ones that aren't so good or they're being brought down I'm not sure I don't I don't think it's either/or you know like you know what another one of those my favorite is western hunter yeah that's a amazing show you know and Nate Nate Simmons is fuckin so good on that and I would say as a hunter it's hard like you really all you care about hunting just want to read read read there's a lot of bad information there's a lot of on television television and but then you got like Western hunter which is a lot of really good information it's public land and he what he does is go deep into the back country hiking sets up camp and does it the hard way that's the real hard way there's a lot of the man it's hard to tell people to tune into a show if they've never had any appreciation whatsoever for hunting it'd be hard yeah what show do you tune into you know mmm I mean it would be either in my there's three I feel like Western hunter there's a few look into the backcountry is really good too but meat eaters probably the one I would send them to I'd be like narration that you're gonna get and the intellectual understanding of like how to present these subjects and how to uh yeah you know I mean that's what's important to me like as I get along in my life and career and like I have a son now and I'm trying to figure out what I want him to know like it's important to me that there's good there's people like Steve Rinella out there representing kind of my thoughts and feelings in a way that I probably couldn't you know so I don't want to strop I don't struggle with that I don't want it like if he says hey dad let's watch Outdoor Channel I want to be like oh I don't know man yeah like so I I do appreciate Steve for what he does and there's a there's a bunch of them that are really good and I guess I would say at the end of the day I've always struggled with being in a room full of hunters and watch in the Outdoor Channel because we're hyper critical of every little thing yeah how do you draw by any draw well there's that but that's that's different you don't think that flows into the actual like the quality of the content how you know because I feel like if I'm watching Nate Simmons or Steve Rinella or Remy Warren or those guys I don't think anybody should be second-guessing what those guys do in the field because you're you're you you have a level of proficiency to me that's like the layman watching a UFC fight and go why didn't Conor punch him there you know like listen fucking crazy you don't think he knows when to punch and what not to punch like this is a stupid way of looking at this so if you would compare UFC to hunting television there is no meter for how you get on hunting television you have money and you buy airtime you're there you know there's no that is there's no qualified I'll explain that because most people have no idea so on the Outdoor Channel in sports like if you if you want to put a show on Comedy Central you have to make a deal with Comedy Central this is good for real producers for real writers you have to package they're gonna invest in it it's a big deal yep they're gonna launch it right after tosh point-o on you know what are there gonna be invested in it - they're like this if this is good we do good everybody combined in the cable channels that are out thorn sportsman's channel is the business model is not that you you pay the network for the airtime essentially right you deliver them content they have very little oversight over what you deliver them there's rules you know how many times you show a kill shot there's like there's there's what they have rules yeah oh there's rules what yeah hold on they have rules on how many times you can show a kill shot fairly sure so you can't like shoot a deer two minutes into the episode and just watch the close-up of the deer's eyes close-up on the arrow death metal and if deers dying feet up in the air kicking it could be a show like that I mean there's a lot of nutty fucking shows those are you there like kind of metal inspired like you know evil but so there are good right there are like I'm trying to be diplomatic a Rogen there there are some really good shows but but you pay and there are some shows that are owned by the network but that is the the minority the majority of shows are people who are paying for air time and then companies come in and sponsor their show and pay that for their for that weird though that a network on actual regular Direct TV like you can get to a Channel six oh five six oh six and six oh four that's not you know what's interesting the hunting channels which are like I would say overwhelmingly Christian like in terms of viewership and in terms of like the people that are on the show are literally two or three channels away from black dicks and white chicks on DirecTV the porch else the porn channels are like 596 597 and then he goes 604 hey this route here representing God's great earth and the beauty the bounty of Jesus cries out here in the far like well you're always two clicks away black poles and white holes next on DirecTV click click click Jesus has blessed me with this Turkey longer Guyer and a freaking hyena massacre like you're always two clicks away that's the internet this is television like you know it's those lines are going to get super blurred they're gonna get super blurred they're more blurred now than ever before Stephen Colbert said that the president of the fucking United States uses Putin's dick like uses his mouth as Putin's cock holster what yes but Stephen Colbert's very religious right yes he said that we don't say that we said it on television recently yeah his own show yeah his idea was he was gonna this is the inside story he was baiting Trump to respond to him and finally after he said that Trump did respond called him second-rate not funny all these things ratings dying ratings bad all the stuff and then Colbert gets on TV and he goes mr. Trump out of all the things that I know you don't understand the one thing I thought you didn't understand was show business like you responded to me that means I win and he told the president fact that the president is trolla Balazs an issue he's trolling as well as being troll of bull it's like Joe Scarborough and his fiancee do you know that whole story where the president believed out of these that the woman came tomorrow Lago but she had facelift surgery and she was bleeding very badly and he did not go did not hang out with them he tweeted that I'm on this last week I got to get back on Twitter it's so bad that Scarborough left the Republican Party what is happening in Scarborough is like look if you guys are gonna support this he goes I'm not a Republican anymore he goes I'm going into penny goes I still have Republican values I felt still belong but I'm not gonna do this we live we live in strange the strangest the changes of that's why my tour is called strange times go to Joe Rogan dine at Ford's house mmm seeing Utah this weekend will be there you're gonna be there I'll be there yeah we're gonna be there for its total coincidence my wife doesn't believe it but that Odori total archery challenge is actually there at the same time hunting is total coincidence total coincidence wife I can't believe this baby its leaves I'm doing a show in the wilds of New Mexico in September I always wanted to visit this Native American reservation it turns out that they invited me to hunt mice in there I mean I don't wanna go but I don't want to there's 75 people coming to the show don't want to be disrespectful well strange times it is I don't I must not like I do every once a while flick on CNN CNN or something but I don't I'm not one of those people I've seen people in my life that get so wrapped up and that stuff that becomes it becomes their reality I've never been affected by anything Donald Trump is done in my daily life the health care thing is a different deal that but I think in my daily life there's few things that directly affect me other than something that seems existential other than the environment and freaking health care right but that doesn't even affect you where you feel it that's no fun if you ignore it mmm that's part of the problem is that we don't like on a day-to-day basis it doesn't touch your skin yeah it doesn't make your your nerve endings respond so you can choose there's there's a choice right man you can choose to not you can choose to create some sort of bubble for that news and politics and let only what's important in that's kind of what I try to do I mean if I'm always doing it but I don't just turn it on and sit there and watch CNN and think Russia right oh man okay I'm if I see a Russian on the street I'll punch him right his face well you saw that news report where the reporter he admitted that this whole Russia day is kind of bullshit it's just for ratings yeah and I was like well as a job a journalism major I'm like of course it is yeah of course it is of course it is if it bleeds it leads yeah it's I don't know what's real anymore you know I really don't I don't want to ever say I mean I want to look into things for sure it's not that I'm not I'm not thinking about it but and I watch house of cards too much what you drinking energy oh really this is a not a sponsor it's what's important it's Sevilla do you know it's Eve is not I'd like to know it's a stevia flavored soft drink mmm yeah it's a hundred percent no sugar this one is their energy drink I think it has 120 milligrams of caffeine which is like a good cup of coffee not a Starbucks venti I think as 200 so it's not quite mmm but uh not quite a Starbucks venti not even a grande but it has zero sugar and it actually tastes really good would you like one I would oh let me shut down this soft drinks - do we have any soft drinks in the fridge or just the energy drink throw some of those soft drinks in the fridge for the night as the first time visiting California I got a do shit like what you like drink this stevia yeah people in California just don't respect if you haven't been here like oh you don't even know what to do yeah I've been to your many great airports but never like this morning our way now and get like a parfait yes with granola yeah there was some good all in there and then I got I went to the pool a little bit and did some emails nice and drank a sparkling water mmm did you see any hoes there we know they were in you gotta travel if you're gonna travel next time you got to land in Beverly Hills or at least go to a hotel in Beverly well we have the rest of today like we can you know I really need to see like the Comedy Store I poked my head in there and I can't go there tonight though yeah unfortunately I'm back yeah we would have been those cold or no well the our grape soda so it is grape soda but it's zero sugar try one of those it's good they're delicious and by the way not a sponsor I was gonna say man I get in trouble all the time for shit they're not in trouble but people accuse me send me those bitches they always think that for whatever reason I'm getting paid for stuff I guess people got mad at me about that Yeti thing that I did which by the way my friend Ben works for Yeti I'm gonna be honest here this is a Yeti Rambler he'll send me like some Yeti things but I bought Yeti shit before even worked for Yeti and I was telling P of all amazing Yeti and he made that very clear to me too I was like man I work for Yeti now you know do you need a cooler or something Yeti's bro already had two yeah these ones O'Brien they're the best it's I can't there if you've never had one and people go for green spoons if you're right you're right you don't have to have one but I'm telling you if you have the money and you want a crazy fucking cooler they are the shit this is very good what how do you feel about the ones that there's one that that that totally copied Yeti like every way many but I mean they copied the way it's very flattering the way the logo is and someone was saying hey man this one is like half the price and it does just as good I'm like right okay and then there was like this battle after I posted that in the comment section of Instagram for people like their copycats it's know that's there is debates I mean it's a good robust debate on what's the better cooler it's funny that Yeti has kind of well yeah created the premium cooler category and then and and when you create a category like that when you and become a business like Yeti is you're gonna have people that follow along for sure and they kind of need us and we kind of need them of us whatever but as long as there's not they're not infringing on the things that are and like I promise you as far as that goes I know as a company man we look forward like we have stuff we're coming out with now things were doing I'm not worried about people that are that are copying us cuz I'll just continue to follow along yeah I mean like coolers or coolers it's all good but what I I mean I when I find something that I like that's good I tell people about it and for whatever reason people always says why is that such a hard thing to get their heads around well because it's they're cynical and they should be because people are full of shit there's a lot of people that are full of shit but I swear to fucking god if there's ever a time where I have an ad for that like the ads for my podcast everybody knows their ads people pay for those out that's what about when we were talking about that was my argument I'm like people pay for ads and Joe leads the ad he never he never just like throws in during a pockets like yeah let me just pull out this doesn't happen that's why just like Sevilla Ivan zero I bought this I died ran out I ordered these all on amazon.com for him it's very delicious yeah they're fucking great I drink this shit all the time you know why because it tastes good and it doesn't have any bullshit in it like this is all just zero calories zero sugar you know I mean it's grape soda but it's clear it's great but look clear looks like red water it's like the Zima right yeah it's great it still of Zima it's not a Sevilla ad I don't have any fucking nothing to do with that company they're not a sponsor but isn't that the whole world like facts are you know people assign their motives to facts and like everything right I could say I work for yeah I could say yeah he's a great cooler it's the best I've ever used I use them all the time more than any normal person it's my breath and I found it to be I'm proud to work for the company because it's something I could stand behind I still have people be like whatever man right you're just shilling for your company bro I just isn't it smart though that people are that cynical I mean look look but here's a perfect example I rant and rave about the glory of a 1965 Corvette I don't work for 1965 Corvettes okay it's just like there's a reality about certain things that are awesome that people have created that I celebrate and I don't I don't say I'm not going to talk about Sevilla cuz they're not a sponsor or I'm not gonna talk about Yeti cuz they're not a sponsor it's it's interesting to me it's all interesting I like I like when people get it right well you have this like sister podcast where you've done your closing in 1000 episodes and if you remove like all consumer products from the conversation it would suck the problem is people boiled down an innovation to a consumer product they boil it down to a material possession that somebody has to purchase right I'm not looking at it that way I'm being honest when I'm when I'm looking at something that someone and someone creates some new innovation I'm looking at like oh look what they did oh yeah I wish I could figured that out I don't even think that because I'm not an inventor but I do I do get excited about only on the archery side of things bluetooth is that really that like I say yeah that is real it's real what's it called what's the name of the company breadcrumb Tek Bluetooth Knox the problem is fans listen there's not gonna be any Knox poking out we can track those things a lot of people tell you know through me to tell you just to just dial it down a little bit Joe yeah a little bit for real yeah for real I've had a couple people say like I can't be promoting shooting that much poundage I don't understand why people don't it doesn't factor into their mind that some people are stronger than them it's true like if you pull 60 pounds I don't feel bad I'm not upset at you look at these things look so they shoot this arrow and then with your phone you can track the knock through a Bluetooth device that has some sort of a GPS locator on it oh you shoot it in the grass which I do often you missed it as my buzz brain Bates Brandon Bates from Cara Mia or MAF Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation good man look he's got America head on by new America I got America case from iPhone America nothing better wait we have the new studio and I have America flag in the background we got sitting back there Jamie damn have you previewed the new suit the new studio he knows anything okay there's not a new studio when it comes it will be epic yeah you just don't worry about but these knocks it's it's gonna be a good way to find arrows for sure but what's what's interesting is it'll be a good way to track animals if you shoot an animal like a lot of times people will shoot an animal and the animal runs and it's in thick cover and you can't find it it's dead it died quick like an animal can run 200 yards inside of a few seconds and die immediately and you might never find it if you shoot exactly where to aim and you put a hole in each of his lungs yeah with a two inch dynamic diameter rage brought a tour Court or whatever whatever it is it can run a hundred yards examples that place we were out of Texas oh yeah this place had these scrub oaks that were six feet tall and you could not get into yeah and the animals you would shoot one the guy the guys were talking to us about pigs like yeah we had a pig contest we shot three lost two yeah what and it didn't make sense until you go there you go oh yeah how you gonna find that look you can't get in there how would we go there how do we do that well we do just need to trim that stuff yeah it's just here to talk to him about that I don't I think they kind of knew what they were putting it off but it was just like Jesus Christ yeah so much bush well there's any place you hunt like especially when you think about recovering game even then well not you think it's fairly flat place like if I shoot a deer I'll see it go down or whatever it goes behind a bush sure goes over a rise and you go and you're like oh whoa crap well how about the place that we were at the last day where the grass was six feet high and the animals were in the grass they were waiting what's crazy was Ben and I were there I shot at this one deer and other deer that were like 30 feet away from us jumped out of the bushes like they were hiding they heard us talking they knew we were there yeah they just laid low yeah well they like they laid low and then you shot an arrow and they were like I know what that sounds like yeah and they ran off and I knew and we knew they didn't cross into the next little paddock like the next across this road so I circled around and got up on this like mound so I can see into the grass and I could see him in there they're just like talk to her like shit what do we do sighs Joe Rogan's and I was trying to get you to go in there but you were what like six feet away from these things by the time by the time we got to him I was no no further away than 15 feet yeah and you target an axis year that has swords growing out of his head yeah multiple pretty crazy but they're just animals evolved to experience whatever the dangers of their environment are and their dangers are a hundred percent people yeah in that that animals probably four or five years old been around people for four or five years it's like oh I get it when people around they're trying to eat you man people have never got me in this grass yeah nobody has ever been able to do it so how did you how did the Nepal thing end mm-hmm get it together I did get it together I think we left off at I started to get sick well the whole next day I was puking shitting and just I had the flu everybody else got but I just got in like two days later and so it was that day the it was the first day we had seen sheep so we were three I think four days into the end of the trek and we were camping somewhere at 14,000 feet and the next day the guy was with other guys had tagged Cole goes up shoots a sheep and like six like they climb up 2,000 feet 60 mile an hour wind bursts microbursts frostbite conditions like these guys when they came back looked beaten and these are Cole Kramer who we went with is a Kodiak Alaska bear guide in a mountain hunter and his hardcores gets and I looked at his face when he got back and I just been my 10:00 all day puking and trying to stay alive and I looked at his face and I thought I can't make it over there to the latrine let alone up this mountain to kill a sheep and so I kind of had resigned myself to like this is it man I can't I wish I was healthy enough to do it but that's I don't want to get up there and then have these shoes and not be able to get a helicopter rescue and so we we talked about it but the worst part and I'll just have to tell it's just because it's like the low point of my trip there the third night in the when we got the camp I was puking in the vestibule of my tent and all the although the the nepali guys were you okay you okay okay no not okay AB you could and then fell asleep walked back up had to go to the bathroom been the medic is there he's got helping me to the bathroom like that cam I'm not gonna make it can't stand up so I literally just kind of like huddled over in the snow pull my pants down and just right in the middle of camp just let it go and I just remember do it like just thinking oh my god and I look up and there's all these porters and Sherpas with our headlamps I like you okay okay look at me and so that was the lowest point of the trip and that I think the next day Cole killed his sheep the day after that I went up the mountain with a homeless in mid day just for another like acclimation could I make it we got into a group of sheep didn't make it happen but I went up the mountain basically probably 1200 feet just a good climb went back down there like okay tomorrow was kind of the last chance cuz we're almost out of areas to hunt these sheep and we went up the valley I want to say like eight miles like I got it written down somewhere 88 miles and I'll be on death's door after his ass door and I wasn't to be the hunter on I wasn't carrying a pack or anything I just had trekking poles and a bio harness and I was just like one foot one foot we got into these mountain passes in these valleys where there was like you know two three feet of snow and it was frozen on the top and you were just like every step you would crunch two feet down like boom boom and it was this hour of that and there was a time during that where we we summited this the private highest peak we were at which was mid 15s close to 16 and I was just like I can't this is I hope the sheep are right there because this is it like this as far as I can go and we rested and we glassy sheep and there they are like a mile and a half away down this other giant ravine and up on this other flat and I remember even the guys we were with looking like he's not gonna go over there and I just I just remember thinking like this is what I'm doing it like I'm just gonna go and we slid on our butts like down the side of this mountain me and two guides slid on our butts down the side of this snowy icy Bank got up walked a half a mile popped up over this Ridge there the sheep are within 300 yards been about 20 minutes I got what got on a bigger aim and shot him Wow and yeah and there was no celebration there was I wasn't even happy I don't think who's you're so out of it yeah I think I just kind of like slumped over on my pack I was laying prone as I slumped over my pack and like okay did you eat it that night yeah they ate the whole thing not all that night but Joey oh yeah I was too sick like the spices that's very spicy even the smell that curry spice I couldn't even take so I need a good bit of it oh they curried up your they shed on everything but even the tent smelled like that so I like the the cook tent I couldn't even really be in there it was I was eating rice for a couple days I couldn't walk couldn't stomach this is such a gnarly experience so everybody ate your sheep like you didn't even bring it back no you can't bring the meat back here anyways so the point was so they had they had mostly already eaten coal sheep within a day and a half or two days not wolves and I'm telling people was worried for 25 of them oh wow yeah oh yeah that burning through that burning and not only did they eat like eyeballs we so Cole I try to sheep and he was taping out the head taking the hide off head popped the eyeballs out and I think jokingly handed to one of the porters like haha eat this and I'm watched that dude put it on his stick and put it over a fire and eat it yeah why wouldn't they I mean that's me so they I didn't see this personally but they were picky yeah they took the punch licked the gut Sakon and cut it open flat out the inside and took it back and cook that too you know it's kind of like a ripe haggis right and so I mean they just like they just devoured the thing would you go back yeah really yeah yeah I'm going to Northwest Territories that's gonna suck then we thought yeah that's what I think about like I often think of it like what if I'm glad it happened the way it did because I get I got so much perspective like on the way back because we still had two days to hike out to get back to Tia picked up to go to go back to get man do it was two and a half three days hike out and hiking out the first day we were hiking out after I shot my sheep and had a night's rest and I remember getting back in like midnight no we got back like 10 p.m. had left at 6:00 in the morning from killing my sheep and I was just so like emotionally spiritually just my most fucked and I remember thinking well tomorrow they're gonna give us a rest day and the guide was like nope like it's too hot it's - we're all getting sunburned I had like blisters on the roof of my mouth on the Sun my home the roof of your mouth yeah from life going up and the Sun bouncing off the snow hit your mouth what yeah so you get sunburned on the roof of your mouth did that's insane I've never even heard of that before I feel like that's a pretty common thing for guys that go that elevations hikers and stuff Wow it might not be so do you have like sunscreen on your lips and your face and all that - I did but I'd like I didn't really think about that because I was hot but I was in the field burning up but like there's photos I look at now and I'm like my lips are cracking open and bleed and I got wow like it was yeah and if you wash Chalky's episode when he was in Nepal it's similar like their self filming and it's like this pretty miserable did you get something out of that though other than the survival yeah I watched out of that I got like I've written this now I probably wrote like 20,000 words on the trip but I got this like amazing feeling first being around people that are that not primitive is the wrong word but that removed from society right they don't have they don't really even have the option to be modern like they don't have they couldn't get it they couldn't get a chainsaw if they wanted to like they have an axe and they need to chop wood and like just being around that level I've just primitive people and that they're primitives are the wrong word I'll think of something better than that but their spirit was so infectious like they're happy people and you have these Sherpas and porters who you know there's big Sitka bags the big roller top bags we took one to base camp cuz they told us oh we can leave it we won't take it in the hunt these guys would take like a 90 pound suitcase put it on top of their head just go walking up these trails I was describing like it was nothing put on their head yeah they'd balance everything in a basket on their head all these Porter's a 90-pound bag and they would do more than that 200 pounds what yeah your head head strap basket back here 200 pounds yeah if not more than that what kind of disc issues guys they don't care I mean like and they're wearing like these guys are wearing like all like sandals and some of them we've learned like old sneakers and they're just wearing like whatever clothes that they whatever together and they're doing these amazing things and when they take a break from something that you or I could never conceive of doing they're like happy as could be their their perspective on life is only hardship in poverty that's all they know but that's the only thing they'll ever know but yet they're happier than then I think maybe I could ever be does a big part of Sebastian youngers book tribe mm-hmm a big part of it is like how living easy and not not sustaining massive amounts of difficulty like most people do in these impoverished communities is one of the reasons why people aren't happy is that people actually need struggle which is very counterintuitive for a lot of people it is and I remember coming back there was a bunch of moments I could describe all these moments where I just like I'd be at my wit's end just thinking I'm just a regular dude like like some adventure what am i doing right but I did not get to a point where I'd be asleep please awesome hmm and I would look over and here become this Porter this you know 25 year old kid with a basket strapped on his head with you know 100 pounds of stuff wearing sneakers and I got $400 Italian boots on and sick gear and I'm like and it would always come at these opportune moments where I'd look over and I see that big oh crap like this person is Here I am you know I have em in physical pain and things are happening but like to have the mental fortitude those people have and they don't know they have it that's just how they're wired and so I came back after the whole thing and I remember hiking out being like in the front of the group all of a sudden like really feeling good my packs back on my back I'm like energized again thinking like this best feeling in the world that feeling of overcoming that thing and being on the downhill slope yeah I'd give back just for that feeling if I could catch it again I think a big part of the thing of that is just you don't really appreciate what it feels like to be healthy until you're not healthy I don't advise anybody to get food sick food sickness or food poisoning but one of the things about it is man once it's over you realize you owe God like being healthy is so critical it's like everything it doesn't matter your status your money your friends none of that means shit if you're unhealthy yeah I mean and it's and the people in Nepal live in this and I just went through a civil war in the recent decades and these people were like at the epicenter of it and they're you know you know our trip gave them jobs it gave them purpose it gave like there's a lot of things our main guide Mon bahador didn't have shoes until he's like 13 and they used to go hunting and they they would build their own guns and he described to us about a couple times where like they were hiking and hunting sheep and like the gun would blow up on his back and blow his shirt off they were like making oh my god primitive muzzle hodor's and using matchsticks as powder I feel like so there was all these stories like that that um perspective perspective and like you can't and look people say oh you turvy hunted that sheep maybe but there was so much more to it that if anybody would ever I mean know yes just hate it we ate it yeah I mean what does that mean what it means is people make a distinction that you did not have to bring that animal back in order for you to survive that's right so that's the only way that there was any motive to me then right if they call me a trophy and I would say this I would say look you go into a war-torn area of the world where after the war they don't have a lot of chance to make money like the tourism has kind of died once you've been through whore it's really not a happy place to be and plus the place we were hunting the it was I think that the ROE patan hunting reserve is like the only hunting reserve in Nepal right and it's heavily regulated like there's 19 blue sheep tags a year so you're thinking like everybody that goes how many people you go to Mount Everest base camp thousands I don't know what the number is but it's thousands I think there's we were probably within a couple a dozen Westerners that had been to that area post-war and had brought 24 25 jobs plus the people that prepped that plus all that stuff so like seeing that it's pretty powerful me and shooting that sheep and not even giving a shit whether the horns made it back or not I mean you somebody could question my motives all they want but within the system and the structure that's set up there now hunting is one of the more valuable things that they one of our valuable tools they have to to get better at everything their lives that they're having it's their resource yes their resource it's yeah and you know we can look down upon that but it is a natural resource in along the same veins as like if you live in an area that has fracking that's a natural resource if you live in an area that you know they dig minerals out of the ground that's a natural resource it's not a good or a bad thing it's just the reality of their environment and so there's so many I think that there it is arguments against what we did if somebody like broke it down like I always try to break it down from the other side I think people say like why you just take pictures of it you know what are you doing you just go up there pay 20 grand or whatever you pay for hunt like that take some pictures well partly the challenge people don't understand how difficult it is to do what you did like to do what you did and then have this final accomplishment which is to get close enough to an animal where either it doesn't know you're there or you get in a good place where it can't wind you it doesn't smell you and you can take it out and kill it like it's hard to do well now it's really hard to do I've got all my own personal reasons for wanting to kill that sheep and I would also say like present a better plan then are you gonna pay what hunters are willing to pay and are you gonna be a part of conservation regulation the way that hunters are as a as a trekker and a photographer like give me a better idea okay but here's the problem with that their their response to that could easily be you know what about if you decided to hunt people if you paid a million dollars to go hunt a person and that that money fed all these tribes people in Mozambique is it okay to go out and hunt people no there's surely still have it ethical and more elongation put to them it's a animal rights activist you have an ethical moral obligation to let that sheep live yeah and I'm on your side but I'm just saying no I'm late seen both sides like I I really do like because we only ate it there because we didn't have a freezer full of backstraps and because that thing didn't occur the way it normally occurs for me there was like some complexity in of that yeah my mind I'm bright crap man you know am I really over here just to collect this sheep and bring it home and show people but you're also filming yeah we made oh we made what will be hopefully an awesome film and so at the end of the day I check myself and I said did you do it for the right reasons and and after I look back the trip I'm like man there are a hundred reasons why I did it and they're all good and and it was what we did was a good impact on the place we went on the animals that we hunted like it's it's to me it's all good and I and I would love have argue and somebody that feels differently about that plus you got to trip balls and see a fake baby and a fake wolf people pay a lot of money for expensive you might not see a wolf you might not you might not see a baby on the road I'm sure there's still like a log sheet or like a wolf-shaped log to be something it was a wolf crazy yeah we got to wrap this up man let's do it um Ben O'Brien what is your uh your Twitter that you don't use again my Twitter's at Benjamin Hobie I never use that so instagrams always the better way and it's Benny OB b NN y OB 301 how did you get 301 that's area code where I grew up Oh holla hello but I didn't shout out to 301 yeah man I created that handle when I didn't know it would be a thing I thought nobody would ever see that oh well now it's a thing now it's a thing we blew up when you had that competition with the people you work with alright folks we're out we're out for a while we'll be back next week
