three two one boom what's up brother see my friend always thanks for having oh man yeah we've both been busy it's crazy and in the meantime we'd became legal yes you guys were at the forefront man you guys were way ahead you were ahead of everybody you know we took a shot you took a shot you know as donors and advocates and whatnot you know we were stoners at first right you know that's how you start like you know your friends as a man tried this or you're the one who says try this right it's one or the other and you know eventually you start getting into the High Times magazines and stuff like that and looking at the you know the centerfold pictures of the weed but also we like we like to read to who hazily so you know we'd get into some of the activism aspect of it as well and that's when we heard names like Jack Herer who pretty much opened our eyes to everything and then you know I think we became real advocates you know at first you know we thought we were yeah you know sort of we read the tide times magazines that we were stoners so we thought we were advocates but like in reading what other freedom fighters were actually doing out there and protests and rallies and all that stuff you know we we really weren't advocates like we thought we became that later for sure yeah Jack was way way way ahead of the curve he's such an interesting story rest in peace because he was a Goldwater Republican yeah he was just a button-down old-school rep√∫blica and then he got a girlfriend and then his girlfriend got him smoking weed yeah and then all Sunny's like man this is fucking amazing God why am I such a dick what's wrong with me Who am I what am i do in my life absolutely it totally flipped his life around yeah the Emperor wears no clothes the fucking great book man yeah it holds it holds strong to this day because everything that he said in the book is sort of happening right now all the stuff that they you know they tried to prevent from happening through all the anti cannabis propaganda yeah you see it now and now you see those very companies try to get into industry they were always on the outside of waiting you know there was oh look at the launching block not quite ready to run but any minute now it's gonna get legal yeah exactly I mean you know they're they're lying in wait with fields like acreage that no one can ever come close to probably right yeah I mean that the the thing I heard maybe like five years ago before it was legal in Denver or was a bit longer than that before we got legalization here that you know companies like Philip Morris and and you know companies like that we're already buying land and already trademarking names yeah you know for some of the cannabis that we know today so that when they come into the game you know they have ownership on some of the names and some of the brands and trademarks and stuff like that to that and obviously the acreage to you know grow vast sums of cannabis yeah you know who knows how true that is but I don't doubt some of that I don't doubt it either the sneaky shit was Ohio Ohio was they were trying to make it legal but if they were gonna make it legal there was only like it was like two companies that will change from law I think like for but I I think that is how it would yeah they were the only ones gonna be allowed to grow it and sell it for fuck yeah monopolies that is not legal weed that is you being a cunt that's monopoly yeah and it's crazy you know yeah because you know you had like people that got those licenses or permits or whatever that had no knowledge on the cannabis culture or or business how to cultivate and and how to run retail stores or any of that they didn't have any of that knowledge and you know they'll usually give it to an insider because they know how much money they stand to me that's like if there was just one distribution center right and everybody has to go through that distribution center how much money does that distribution center make because you got to pay for your shit to go there and then you know who knows if it well you know if it passes because you know as a cultivator what you did so you no it'll pass cuz it's clean but you still got to pay that fee every time and it's got to go through them fortunately here in California you know they allowed people to have distribution licenses so that there's not one distribution center because that would be a monopoly for sure and that's what they wanted to supposedly you know the lobbyists that put 64 together we're trying to stop it from being a monopoly and corporations coming in and taking over and stuff like that you know so interesting because pot is such a non corporate drug you know such a non corporate thing that these corporations were trying to get a grip yeah on weed it's just it seemed it seemed obscene you know it seemed it seemed disgusting yeah it's it's a little out of place you know a lot out of place right yeah you know because you you think about where it comes from and it's been outlaw for so long it's kind of like you know the way out alcohol was for so long wait longer than outfit but it's demonized longer yes yeah and now you know you have people trying to come in and throw money into it and they got you know and some of these guys don't realize it's it's not just about the money into it you got to do the diligence on what this business is you can't cut corners on the cultivation you know you can't cut corners on quality because people you know they're there there's more information out there yeah you know so people know you even if they're not a connoisseur as a consumer you know they can they can read about shit they can learn about stuff so if you're getting over on them or if you're putting some shit quality product out there I mean people are gonna know and and all that money that these guys put into to trying to get into the cannabis business they're just throwing it into the fire yeah some of them will come out of it you know they'll partner up with brands that exist in people that have knowledge but you know it's it's the corporations that come in in the next five years it's gonna be it's gonna be interesting because I do think that it's set up for them to come in the taxes are so high right now for the consumer and for the cultivator and for the retail shop that you got to survive this wash right now that's happening in order to still be you know doing business when the corporate structure comes in because please believe they're gonna lobby so that those taxes come down because the margins are not right you know as a 40% tax is that what it is now it was 39 in Denver right yeah but in here in California it's you know 40% into the consumer the consumers like who gives a fuck if I could just pull in and get some weed ray should give a fuck they should but in comparison to alcohol like how much it cost if you go out for a night for some drinks that cost way more you get high for a month yeah what it takes to get pretty much a few drinks in a night it depending where you go those fucking drinks are even doubled yeah yeah and with less alcohol well the other thing is that these companies they don't understand the culture it's a different culture you can't bullshit us you can't bullshit us with marketing and advertising to work you can't have like the most interesting man in the world selling weed steady state thirsty my friends not that now that ain't gonna work you got to get somebody like Michael Phelps I would buy weed from Michael Phelps how funny was it that he got in trouble for that you know what I find it funny is how you know they put these stereotypes on stoners for so long like that we're lazy and productive and all that stuff this guy is one of the most decorated Olympians in the history you know I mean what does he got like 15 gold fucking subtly preposterous yeah mr. big lungs that's what we call him mr. big lungs I probably could take a rip on a bomb think about it my god making shit right here probably crazy capacity there it is probably snap a to grand boldest who was the person who ratted him out some low kid some yeah derp little dickhead what a piece of shit yeah imagine is going to a party trying to have a good time some kids there with his phone he that social network for you though they want to go viral so they'll get you in that moment where you know you're supposed to be a friend but that was like before all out of that shit was happening like what year was that let's guess what gear was that 12 mm oh well before yeah before let's just say before you know Instagram kicked off but it was still YouTube and Twitter yeah you know if you wanted to put somebody on blast or you wanted to have a viral video YouTube has been there for a long time yeah Twitter was like 2007 right well I believe so yeah yeah I think when was Michael when was it Michael Phelps when did he get in trouble I'm looking it's I I'm seeing different stuff so I saw a picture of it on YouTube from 2009 so that means it would have been in 2008 Olympics but oh that seemed that make sense like it was a long time ago yeah that makes sense though cuz he came back right yeah he retired and he came back well I think he was suspended I think it suspended 2009 is when he got caught and then and then he had to you know do the suspension and he came back and got some more medals like haha fuck you right I love that was he suspended because of the weed yeah well you know hey listen on on Oh in a lot of places it's still on a banned substance list oh yeah Texas Texas is real bad February 2012 2009 he was only 23 apologize an incident where he's caught on camera the party smoking a bomb that was allegedly marijuana you know he shouldn't have apologized for I had to have apologized for that thing is that they have those guys bent over a box because they're all just trying to get that sponsorship money right yes yeah you have to be squeaky clean if you want to be on the Wheaties box yeah if you're in Olympian yeah they're not gonna put Cypress Hill on the Wheaties boxes Jesse hadn't that be great though but take the th out out of E and then put a D and IES then let's go Wheaties yeah I don't know man you guys wear it so far ahead of the curve though you know I mean you you were you had weed songs like when like what year that was the first album was in 91 and we started writing for that album probably uh four years prior Wow and you know the weed songs those came about because we were weed heads you know we just fucking let's be ourselves right a different thing no four people that were were fans because uh I when I was listening to you I was just getting ready to move from Boston to New York and back then you would hear about new hip hop bands from like friends yeah like you know like yeah sure I would hear about it like somebody that I I think somebody I worked out with had it and I was like what the fuck is this and then like that's Cypress Hill is a damn and we were trying to be different you know not sound like a typical West Coast you know group right there's a lot of a lot of West Coast groups at that point you know what the labels we're looking for were NWA you know types and you know things like that like either you know gangster west coast gangsta rap they were looking for that or either the the kid frost Chicano type yeah and we didn't want to do that we don't want to foothold ourselves like that you know mugs being from New York he wanted to sort of blend both worlds right so you know we went with with the East Coast type sound with LA you know type of slang mixed with with East Coast slang and so people you know they were like we're fucking these guys from and people thought were from Cypress Hill New York because there's a Cypress Hill down there and you know people just didn't really know at first because we were one of the first groups that didn't put our images on any of our first you know any of our singles or our art covers we never did like the the shots like you know that that we're existing at that time were it's a clean shot of the group or the artist or whatever we were always on some you know cuz we were metalheads too you know before the hip hop we like the obscure metal album so we didn't we were like we're not gonna put ourselves on the covers we're just gonna do these crazy obscure covers and make people you know try to guess who we are be mysterious we talk about longevity I mean you guys you guys been around a long fucking time craze dropped off at all it's crazy you know um we we didn't expect it we didn't know how long a run would be we just kept working you know we always had a strong work ethic we were never the types just to sit around we're always doing something you know mugs is always making beats you know I'm always riding to something I'm always into one project or another so it's it was always just about keeping busy and that that suited as well it's crazy 28 years later still banging it it's crazy what you say yeah again you guys never dropped off for a second not once you were always there so you have to be consistent in hip-hop you know in music in general especially like if if there's a time where radio stops playing your music or you know as MTV stopped playing music videos and they went for more reality show type programming you got you got a stick out there so for us it was you know constantly doing shows we didn't put out as many albums as we could have but we thought less was more you know instead of like driving the music into your heart like a steak or something like that we'd just you know let everything breathe for a while and there was there was a time where you know we sort of let go of doing everything it was like a six-year period where we just kind of took off we we didn't we weren't away completely we're still doing like sporadic shows here and there to keep up the profile but we weren't like touring and working on music I was off fucking around competing in paintball tournament secret oh man yeah I had a team called stoned assassins and and it was competitive paintball at the time I was you know training martial arts as I've done throughout my life and I was also playing competitive paintball martial arts we doing Shotokan I started off with Taekwondo and I got sort of I mean it's it's like it was uh it was the dojo was cool you know and and I was progressing quickly but I sort of fell out with the master there with the seafloor whatever I can't remember him yeah and one of my partners who I grew up with who was one of my partners in our dr. greenthumb Brandon whatever his father was a was a you know sensei and his sensei and became my sensei I went from Taekwondo to Shotokan and I started training with him I mean he had been in the dojo since he was five years old training with his father so you know I came into that it took it took a little bit of convincing for me to go from one thing to another because it's such a different style hmm but you know I adapted to it and I liked it and it was very different less flash but his very disciplined and his father you know his you know born in Japan raised out there and he he you know there there she is kind of different they go to to to martial arts universities and they get degrees in different martial arts so they can go and take like okay Hapkido and jujitsu and Shotokan and all this and you know get their their degrees you know they worked their way up in the belt system and all that stuff but they become teachers through through that University I guess I'm fascinated and yeah his his father was one of the guys in one of the Federation's that he's one of the three or four sensei's that have to come in and give you the black belt when you actually get it ah yeah it what was it SK FA or something like I got you know just gun yeah something like that yeah so you could imagine when lyoto machida came on the scene you know we were like yeah someone representing the style that you know we were training under it he had a lot of people got excited when he came about he was sort of the first guy to legitimize karate in the modern era of mixed martial arts you showed like if you could do all those other things if you could stuff takedowns and you you knew submissions and all those things on top of that you could live yeah you could and you could do it in a weird way that people didn't really understand its timing yeah a wonderboy Thompson similar to that - it's got a weird timing weird timing it's it's you know and then the faints with the hips he was good with that shit like you know he he would throw people off with that and you know we I just happened to go see his fight against Rashad Evans oh shit and man I mean it surprised all of us I mean we thought he would win but we didn't know he would win in that fashion I mean yeah he was something special yeah you know I mean and he's doing he's over at Bellator now right with his brother his brother Qin's owes been uh over there for a while his brother though I think his brothers a bantamweight or featherweight one of those but yeah that the I think it's good to go from Taekwondo to other styles because Taekwondo gives you a lot of dexterity you move your legs easily yes absolutely it's a good foundation yeah it's a good way to start off it for little kids to they get sure that doesn't you know it's not a lot of head contact there's no coordination yeah yeah and then when you learn if you learn if you really actually want to fight you want to learn more Thai and all those other things you have way quicker legs yeah just move better yeah for me you know I was never good with all those flashy kick kicks like that so you know big dude yeah I was harder for me Taekwondo like the Shotokan was definitely hard but it was more suited for someone less hard style shoulder comes hard it is and he you know he when he was training us he would not like let up his ego be reals here let me go light on him nah everything I did like you know that that I did outside of music when I try like for instance paintball when it went into paintball there was a price on my head every game everybody wanted to give me extra shots core so like if I got hit well I'm walking out I would get 10 20 extra paintballs to my back oh you know and we'd give it right back to them you know in the very next game when we played them guys again we were making sure to give them that right back you got deep into this oh yeah I was man it's addicting man I got to tell you if there's any physical activity that is addicting it is paintball cuz it's chess with guns yeah because it's so fast and so close and you got to think of a strategy you know it's not all shooting straight way it's all shooting angles and getting your guys to positions to get those guys out to keep moving up to get their flag wipe them out and bring the flag back now other restrictions on power like the PR the guns yeah yeah I believe you can't shoot above 300 psi I think it's I think it's a the the highest you can shoot is maybe to 85 to 90 at least at the time if you go balls-out if you wanted to get the ultimate paintball gun what is that oh man it's it's it's hard because we were using different guns at the time that's because it's it's like each year a better gun comes out the technology gets better so you know we were using at first when we started these these guns called angels and then we went over into these other guns fuck I can't remember the name of them but they were light I mean the best thing is to have a light gun with with the trigger that you can fancy because that's technique to get it to shoot like a like a Uzi right you're not supposed to be able to pull the trigger and multiple balls come out with one pull it's supposed to be that the the the gun shoots as fast as your two fingers or three can toggle so if you get a rhythm you could shoot that thing like a fucking Uzi you know and everybody has a different position you know like mine I was like one of the quarterbacks which is the last three on the line see it's like a football field right you got the 50 and there's obstacles at the 50 and in between and it's mirrored on the other side the quarterbacks play the back and they shoot a whole bunch of paint so that the other guys that are the front and mid guys can get into these different positions to shoot the other guys out so the guys in the back we're shooting the most paint so you have to use that Fanning style so using three fingers three fingers because the the trigger where you're where the the base where you're pulling the trigger you can fit three fingers there yeah it's really for two but you could fit three yeah this this was our team right here we were always pretty stoned when we're playing did that help yeah the the the the furthest we were we took third place in one tournament Wow you guys so this is crazy like you guys off these barriers and these are all blow up barriers right here it's like a football field yeah that that's what they would replicate like a football soccer field and you know you put all the these these obstacles up these blowup obstacles and they're all just positions to try to take to get a better angle on the other side and what's the what's the ultimate goal to take everybody out it's uh you get points for taking the other side out but you get the maximum points getting their flag and bringing it back to yourself and you know you get points for how many guys on your side that are still alive so you know you would get a hundred percent if all seven of your guys were alive you killed all them and brought their flag that ever happened oh yeah damn who are you planned you know you guys crawling around the thing about paintball right is that let's just say there's six tiers right there's the pros there's the semi-pros there's the amateurs there's the novice there's the rookie and each each each tier had at least 200 teams competing in this Wow per tournament and these guys back in that time I don't know how how it is now cuz I haven't competed in a long time but they would do five tournaments a year one would be in Huntington Beach the biggest one and it was awesome they would throw it you know right next to a surfing tournament so like it would just be cross people crossing up watching the surfers and then come and watching the paintball then it would hit - you know Boston and Florida and Las Vegas and one other one other place I can't remember but we would do these tournaments I was doing them for like four or five years and the guy before me that was the the ambassador was one of the one of the Bee Gees one of the Bee Gees the one who passed away first Barry Gibb was it Barry no he's the one that always wears a hat he was the shorter one so he was a paintball he was a paintball fiend like myself if he owned a store he had a team I think it was based out of four out of Miami and he would compete up until when he passed away he was like the ambassador and there is yeah I came in and took his spot when Rhys yeah Maurice Maurice Gibb that's crazy I had no idea yeah wow you guys are armored the fuck up huh yeah these things must sting oh man I mean I'd leave with at least 20 paintball bruises you know / you know in one one sitting and you know you look like a leopard coming coming off after that you know who else was a big paintball enthusiast was William Shatner really yeah he would hold these crazy tournaments like in Trekkie style where it's a scenario game meaning that okay here's the castle I'm gonna be in the castle right here you guys got it siege the castle and if you guys can come get me out of here you guys win this round and they would sit through the three days they'd set up different scenarios like there you go see I would have never guessed but how does he run he can't run well no he doesn't run they they put him in a central place in he'll shoot sometimes he would go out there but so he would just stay put yeah he would stay put you would have to protect him that's my old man paintball he would fight to him he would fight to but he would he would you know they would be trying to protect him oh that's so crazy yeah Wow and uh I mean there's a bunch of celebrities that dip paint bald man Will Smith was paintballing before he did I Robot really he did that he came down to the park where we would practice that we played with him and his team but it was a scenario game Joaquin Phoenix we Mekhi Phifer I mean be surprised how many what looks like fun I guess I shouldn't be surprised you let off steam yeah how many people on a team on a competition team you have you have eleven for the roster and seven play at a time and you can you know switch guys out but now it's different now they do like five men and three men teams I don't know anything about the new style but you know they they constantly call me back because I'm in better shape than I was when I played I was a little bit heavier than that's why I was that quarterback you know it wasn't running too fast but you know that they always hit me man I'll always get hit on my DM on IG or Twitter like hey man when you coming back to the paper feeling like when I get time which is probably never but it seems like a big time suck loved it man I'd love to play in the game it was so addicting it was hard to pull away from it I would even at times be coming home from from a tour straight into a tournament like I'd get off the plane I'd have somebody have my paintball shit ready and boom straight to the tournament I can't tell you how many times I was doing yeah it's fucking crazy it's it's funny when things get in your blood right they get in your bones yeah that got in my blood like martial arts did cuz I was always like an enthusiast like you know for a long time you know and when I finally started training I was training like seven days a week man I wouldn't give myself any time off cuz I wanted to learn fast and I wanted to absorb it you know did you ever fuck would you just say no idea I always wanted to but I never did I kept I thought about it and I come on down tenth planet management right in I think I will you know like a lot of people have asked me and invited me because they know you know I'm a UFC Fan I'm a mixed martial arts fan I'm a boxing fan you know all that shit I'd you know a couple of my cousins are well one of them was a champion professional boxer which was Michael carbajal and his nephew was your cousin yes ma'am I meant might go mm-hmm I met him one day at the Comedy Store yeah a long time ago man yeah when he was uh when he was a chap he was a beast he was a beast and his nephew is now now boxing Keenan carbo oh cool so yeah you know we're rooting for family right there from Arizona right yeah from a-z yeah yeah yeah so yeah I've been invited to you know come fuck with some jujitsu and and I think you know I think I will cuz I mean you gotta know it I think I think you you know it's something that would benefit anyone from to know that yeah but you don't actually you know get in a fight and have to hurt somebody bad or they hurt you you know saying yeah just choke him just choke him up I saw Everlast choke some guy out one night yeah and it was the fucking because you know he he fucks around a little bit you know he knows people that teach jiu-jitsu and they've taught him a couple things and we're at the rainbow one night where we were holding court just smoking like it's Amsterdam down there and we were having a conversation and he kept here and some dude across the cross a couple tables over kept sin Everlast this Everlast that and he beats yo money say my name one more time and he goes Everlast and he went back to talking to his people cuz he didn't dick ever lasses could come up and dude nothing ever lasts when walked over to this table looked to his face turned him around real quick and started choking this fuck see my name again muddy say man it was it was hilarious but yeah man 10th planet is downtown right near were your places yeah yeah so your studio your your setup that's that's real close to ten plan jujitsu yeah man just let me know so I will you gotta avoid any flat earth conversations to come up all right you know I'll get yours and keep moving I get those from I get those from time to time you know I gotta stay the fuck off of YouTube man man yeah they get confused yeah that's it that's the craziest shit because I always argue like this about the flat earth right so hey listen if we got a flat earth there's an edge right and there's always thrill-seekers looking to do something thrilling and there's always a thrill seeker that fucks up and falls right off of that edge right so how many motherfuckers would be fallin off the edge of the earth if we really add Wow for sure you know there would be climbers there'd be a bunch of dudes who would try to hang off the edge of take selfies think about it right 12 people this year have died at the Grand Canyon that's the Grand Canyon who is that really that many that many so far in this year and some people died of a heart attack there because you know it's too much for them to be that little bridge that they have there that it extends past the edge of a canyon they they put in a little bridge way so that you can go and look down you'll have heart attacks and people have had heart attacks from that but the other guys are the ones trying to do selfies falling off fucking bridge in plummeting right so you got to think man if we had if we had a flat earth how many people would be visiting the edge taking a selfie bet there's no no come on no doubt there'd be teams of people teams they would travel to Flat Earth and they would they would like rope we'd apparently like Alex Honnold would probably try to climb off the side we'd hear it on the news another person has died from falling off the edge of the earth yeah it would be a hundred percent Oh that'd be our hundred people tell you though that the government guards that yeah nah right yeah you can't go too near it bro yeah battleships well there wouldn't be just one edge though right that's true they didn't think that through yeah no there'd be several edges if we're flat yeah but see you gotta have that YouTube mentality you got to put your head in a little box leave it in there yeah I could turn the oven box on and stick your head in it government's blocking the edge man you can't get near it yeah well it's like we're living in a dome mmm you know that's that's the other one yeah the dome the dome theory yeah there's no space space is fake people want to believe in some crazy shit you know I wonder how much of them are stoners like most of them right how many of them are micro dosing okay yeah probably you know cuz cuz that's a thing now everybody's like fucking micro dosing right now and it's not bad for you they say it's actually you know kind of good for you but Ron White's doing it but on white micro doses psilocybin never felt better in my life and they like to talk when they're microdose yeah yeah especially psilocybin you just have these ideas that's the thing you have ideas in your mind becomes open to shit that normally you know you're closed off to obviously you know you but you know I think they think that the earth is a disc I think that's what I've heard recently they think it's a disc a disc some sort of a floating disc you and then we live in the firmament or something like that it's like some sort of a cover over the top of the disc and that's what the here it is what is this Jamie it's the case the crews next year that they are yeah oh my god yes eventually they're gonna get to the fucking glaciers in the Lord told you the wall the Flat Earth I hope they jump out they eaten by polar bears that's the funniest shit I have to use like GPS to get around so you know how many scientists do they have on their side all of them that's the funny issue no it's fucking ridiculous there's there's there's gigantic satellites that take huge high-resolution photos of the earth every 10 seconds the orbit from thousands of miles out those are doctored yeah it's just the whole thing is so fucking stupid all the shit to believe in like to invest any energy in that like why would someone lie about the shape of the earth that's the dumbest blurt about you want to know what I think is is before the Internet in all these different platforms where you can get information they you know our government and other governments could debunk any information on UFOs anything because they you know there wasn't like the wide communication that exists now right so I think now they put in people who are saying this crazy wild way out shit so that people are that are really trying to expose truth on certain things they get look at as whack jobs like the rest of those that are trying to say oh well Flat Earth or we're on a disk or we're in a globe or blah blah you government spying on you they'll throw all that together yeah if it is spying on you yeah if they are that is for sure no they really are that it's it's you know since George Bush jr. was president they've been listening to our phone calls I mean that's a fact I mean that was one of the the things they enacted with the Homeland Security that they can record every American's call and you know whatever conversation mentioned certain keywords as we were saying earlier they would you know they would get shuffled off to a certain Department and those guys were red flagged and looked at and that still happens today to still to this day you don't need a warrant you just listen I mean I'll tell you this right there was I've been traveling what 20 20-some odd years at this point where when I when I was coming back into to the United States for a long time I would not get randomly checked or anything like that they just let us go by and I made a few posts somewhere you know with an abundant amount of cannabis right and right after that at post each time I came back into the United States they send me in the secondary for a search and I started asking like hey um been traveling for X amount of years now every I've noticed that the last four times that have come back from another country you guys are randomly you know check-in my bags now what's the deal in my red-flagged what's going on with my passport um well you know where I'm not really allowed to tell you this but I mean have you been what kind of postings have you made on your social networks really yeah and I said okay say no more and I renew what it was because I had put like you know a post with like four or five six pounds in it what is five pounds of weed it's a lot though right that's like giant pillows yeah so you know right then and there I knew you know from that reaction that he had that anybody with any sort of that's involved in entertainment music athlete you know whatever actor/actress they're watching all of our shit all for sure they're listening and they're watching so especially someone like you who's been at the forefront of pushing cannabis legalization and always talked about it openly flagrantly even when it was a Schedule one substance oh yeah everywhere you know yeah did you get a medical card we're the the year that it was available the first year it was available was that like 95 or something 94 yeah they got my from from doctor item and he was like one of the dr. Adelman hooked me up to a lot of a song I should go to him even when it was way more expensive because I'm like yeah oh gee yeah hey bro he like he told me he goes my god cuz cuz I died lost track of him for a minute you know and when I went back to get a renewal some years back and he's Lois you've been with me a long time I mean is it what it looks like is that your patient number four number four on his first he keeps a list of all his patients I guess you know and apparently I was number four yeah even though there was doctors out here I'd always go travel to see him in Hollywood just out of respect yeah and he was how these he had like og stoners in the waiting room oh yes people that were just like barely holding on to reality oh yeah he had he had all sorts he had the hippies he had the new you know new gens hip-hop people I had vitamin drips and shit - all kinds of weird stuff in his office yeah he would yeah he would try to sell you on some some different technology anytime you can this will help you stop smoking cigarettes well I don't smoke cigarette like a thing they put on your ear electrode yeah they gave one the red band didn't work yeah you know you got to try something right yeah it was like a battery powered thing right give a little charge to your ear that's how I was supposed to stop you from smoking cigarettes like ya tinkin I didn't smoke cigarettes those little smoke cigarettes did you ever get your lungs checked out from all those years of weed smoking yeah I mean I've you know I get physicals and stuff like that and uh you know occasionally I'll have my lungs checked and they tell me they're great isn't that amazing it's crazy you know because I think if if you keep active you know like you train in and a lot of us train now like oh this generation they're not like lazy stoners and don't just yeah sit back and do nothing they're still are those but you know III don't think it has the same carcinogens is you no people expected you know like cigarette it does and so you know you might look at someone's lungs who smoke cigarettes and and you might see something there and like hey you need to you know slow the fuck down over here but in in every time that I've had my lungs checked or whatever for whatever weather I've you know gotten sick or whatever they're always telling me lungs are in good shape and it's a funny thing because you know in they can 1987 you know I was 17 and I was gang banging I got shot and you know that I got hit by a 22 and in it as hollow-points do it it it broke into three three pieces the hollow-point and one of them from punctured my lung on my left side and you know they were telling me well you know do you smoke now I don't really smoke because I didn't smoke cigarettes I smoked weed but I wasn't gonna divulge that at the time I was 17 and you know and they said well you know well that's good cuz you'll never smoke again they punctured your lung and blah blah blah they thought I was gonna have to work off one lung but in the three days you know they were able to get the blood out of the lung and I was able to get it back you know through the exercises they told me you know to get it back to its regular size and I've never had a problem since then knock on it take the piece of metal out no I still got the three pieces that's like when I go do my physicals and they do that you know the MRI the MRIs in the x-rays and all that the doctors you know sometimes they forget because they see so many patients mr. freeze um these appeared to be bullet fragments look what is that well you just said a doctor bullet Frank you've seen him a dozen times you know and yeah I was very lucky I was very lucky because you know punctured my lung and then two of the pieces one was by the heart one was by my spine but I was at Martin Luther King Hospital in Linwood and we call that place killer King because you in there for something small and end up dying or come out you know gimped out or something so you know I wasn't gonna allow them to try and get to those bullets or those fragments so open you up yeah no no no you know they didn't have a great success rate what kind of lung exercise they give you pump your lungs but they give you this breathing apparatus that has like a ball in it right and it has two lines and you know this it's that the first line you're trying to they're telling you every day for five minutes to ten minutes to blow that you know not all in one shot but like to keep practicing getting the ball up there and that will in help inflate the lung and get it back so I had to do that for probably like three weeks and you know the puncture wound it healed itself pretty much and and the pieces are still in your lung not in the lucknow it's it went past the lung it did shot passed along so you know it's uh I got a piece up here and one on side in the back well when it's really cold due to the the nerve damage I'll get like stinging like you know like when you're when your hand falls asleep the little needles though yeah I'll get that here and then and then back here where it entered they had that they had to cut right in between a rib here to stick the tube in to put the the hose into the lung to get the blood out of the lung damn yeah I was you know I was living crazy before I got into the music the music saved my life pretty much really yeah how long were you gang banging for some years you know I started I started young I was probably 13 years old whoa came banging in and I got out of it probably I didn't necessarily get out but I changed up what I was doing cuz you don't ever really get out per se unless they jump you out and you know I was too into it to be jumped out like that you know what I mean that wasn't something I was gonna do because you know for as negative as it was it taught me a lot so my boys that I you know ran with they understood I was trying to do something different you know I made a choice to try the music and and leave that shit alone because there there was no way that you do both he if you do both you see the results of that what's happening today with a lot of cats you not I mean they try to ride the line be professional and be in the music but they're still kind of in this world over here and when it bleeds in one bleeds into the other it you know it fucks everything up you know and so I chose you know I was gonna do music and just talk about those life experiences and whatnot and I was probably at 18 that I started taking on the music and that's that's where it went you know like when you said you learned a lot from it like what did you learn from it well you know your street you know there's there's common sense and then there's common sense on the streets and then there's being aware and looking out and you know not being a doormat and just it's it's a whole different type of schooling when you're gang banging you know that's the way you carry yourself the way you communicate with someone and know whether they're disrespecting you or not and how you deal with that disrespect which is you know a whole different world in the gang bang shit but it's uh it's a different kind of education you know I wouldn't I wouldn't take it back some of the things I would you know I definitely regretted while I was doing it for sure but it made me see things from from a different perspective you know and and why you know things are the way they are in gangs and stuff like that from lack lack of opportunities you know for these kids to be doing something you know cuz not everybody's good at sports you know but there has to be other opportunities other that other than that to get kids interested in doing something else because falling into the gangs it's it's easy if you don't have a good home life at home the guys on the street are your second family and they eventually become your first family you know what I mean and if you have a father-figure at home one of the guys in the gang you know becomes your mentor he could become like the guy you look up to as like your father figure you know there's that and you know again there's not enough programs out there to keep people into doing something different than falling into that and then sometimes you know it just it's a matter of you know you growing up in this neighborhood if you have to walk down that Street and they approach you and say hey you live in this hood you got to be with us if you don't we're gonna make it hard for you so there's that peer pressure and then there's the legacy shit like so if my father was a gangster in this gang and he still lives in this neighborhood pressures on for me eventually to take up where father left off hmm you know and it's it's all those things and then some people just start thrill-seekers and they choose it you have nothing you know in common with none of that they just choose it for some people too it's so appealing to have somewhere that you belong right in and that's the thing because if you don't feel like you you belong in your school or you don't belong with your in your family and in that that she can totally take hold and and you end up there you know fortunately I had good friends there weren't gangbangers you know that they had talent for music which was mugs and sin and since brother Melo you know they were you know I did music as a hobby you know before I got in gangs and they got me back into the music because they recognized something in me and said hey we want you to come back work we got these opportunities over here come join us did you always have that style no I didn't when did you develop that what once we started working on our Cypress Hill demos mugs came to me and said hey man you gotta do something gotta do something different otherwise you're gonna write for sin cos sin had a good voice his shit was locked in my voice I was rapping in a voice similar to the one I talked in and although the rhymes were good it didn't cut through on the style like on you know on the beats it just sounded like you know some regular shit so you know I don't want to be someone's writer you know I wanted to write for myself so you know there was a guy that we used to listen to coming up was name was RAM LZ he was on this record called wild style and he was in the movie he was this rapper who is very obscure but he was artists too you know like a graffiti artist but then also an artist artist you know but he was also a rapper and what he would do is he'd rap in a regular style like his talking voice this is the brother they called the rap battle he had a deep voice like that and then he would flip right in the middle take it up town to Cypress Hill with the shotgun bow like that and you know we were always freaking out on that he had two styles so I tried throwing my voice in that sort of similar style and it ended up sticking I didn't really like I didn't think anybody was gonna like it I thought that get the fuck out of here with that but they ended up liking it and I think the first song that came about in that style was the song real estate off our first album it's uh you know that was where I tried it the first time they liked it so then kill a man came next and I tried that song and that's down and hand on the pump and it just became a flow after that and I really did not feel it at first I was like fuck I can't believe they got me rapping in this voice and it took it took a minute to get used to that you know like doing it live because you know I had a tendency we as rappers you know that don't know cuz there's no school for this unless you have somebody who's done it and they teach you okay this is what the get-down is and we didn't have that really it was all hands-on learning I know for the first few years man I was trying to do the voice and I'd end up you know getting over hyped because the crowd is hype and I'd start yelling the verses instead of like rapping them like on the record I'd throw my voice out my voice would get scratchy I'd be sounding like Busta Rhymes and shit you know and it took me five years to actually harness how to actually do the shows with this voice and I had to go to this opera singer coach really the name was something Elizabeth Sabine or something like that she trained a lot of folks but she her shit was like to teach you the operatic way of singing which is from the diaphragm tighten the stomach take little breaths but those little breaths make your lungs expand you know a lot and it's less projection from your throat and more from the bottom and she taught me that technique and I never went hoarse again after that I like with you know people often compliment me on you know sounding so close to how the records are there's once in a while where I might get excited and start saying it louder than it might be but I'm always sort of right there and I got it you know I got to give all props to her cause if she hadn't showed me that technique I'd probably still be yelling and screaming my shit out locking up my voice yeah that brings up an interesting point is this her yeah way let me hear citko we can't play this on youtube and she was and she was the opera singer at one time Wow but she went on to teach people the technique no kidding man that is why see because if you try to keep your breath and sustain a long note like that from your chest you won't sustain that note long enough but if you tighten doing it from your diaphragm yeah if you tighten up it's almost like you're gonna take a shit [Music] Oh instead of from the throat that makes sense yeah you know like it it allows you it allows your lungs to expand while you're breathing mm through from your diaphragm so that's what she taught a lot of singers and it's a another method is to cheat the word like pronounce it you know like you're kind of like it's it's like what these mumble rappers do when they they pronounce the word and they kind of mumble it and they sort of cheat it you know what the word is but they didn't pronounce it all the way right so so in other words if she's gonna you were gonna sing the line come he come with me so it sounds a little bit cleaner he'd say gum with me but in the way you would say it is more with the G but it's so talked in that you here come with me and it's just a cheating way of saying it to get the line a little bit cleaner and in fucking uh you know in the breath and she taught me all that shit and and it worked for rap I didn't know if it would because I mean it was it's she primarily taught singers I was probably the first rapper that she taught this technique to and it stuck how did you find her um what am one of my friends had heard of her you know because I mean in the in the industry we you know become friends with other you know your peers and stuff like that and you know I knew a couple singers and they'd they they were you know noting my problem is just you know screaming my verses and coming back with the raspy voice so they were like here why don't you try this person right here this person taught or or gave this technique to so-and-so and it was another singer I can't remember but um I thought well you know what have I got to lose I mean if it doesn't work it doesn't work but maybe I learned something from it that I could use somewhere else right and fuck she she taught me the the warm-up she taught me uh you know the certain words that you can cheat to you know for for certain breath control purposes because the way you pronounce certain things you know sort of add to and just that the tightening of the diaphragm man like if I hadn't learned that it would have took me a lot longer to do the shows the way that I can do them now so do you warm up before shows I don't necessarily need to like from the first song on my voice like gets in like the first few bars it warms up right then in there and it's not really like singing where I got a sustained notes and stuff like that so I don't have to do those same kind of warm-ups if I was gonna sing some shit yes I would definitely have to get my you know get the pitch right and the throat warmed up to to do those different you know melodies or whatever the hell but fortunately I don't sing you know the whole rap world has always been fascinating to me like how someone gets in like how do you get started are there open mics like what yeah back in the day man that someone had to be the guy endorsing you you know like saying to you know these guys over here a man listen to this these artists right or this artist right here they're the new shit they're gonna be the one and then you would have to do a couple showcases and stuff like that and you know win some people over I mean we definitely did our share of showcases in the beginning but we were getting passed on left and right because you know people thought you know what are they talking about with this cannabis shit and we and we didn't sound like a West Coast group you know because we're trying to sell our shit to West Coast labels here and they did not get us it wasn't until you know mugs had had you know he'd previously been in a group called 73 and he had worked with these guys called the rhyme syndicate which was ice tea's guys so he kind of you know he was the guy that people knew and then send dogs brother Melo man ace eventually would get in the door and so people started hearing about us through you know through more mugs than Melo metal Melo didn't really do shit for us you know all all truth told but mugs you know they kept hearing about a group that he was forming outside of 73 which came to be Cypress Hill and so you know the guys that worked on him worked with him on the 73 records which was Joe's Niccolo of roughhouse records you know he wanted to sign whatever mugs was doing and you know he eventually ended up signing us and they had a distribution deal with uh with Sony Music so you know we you know put out our records to rough house Columbia or rough house Sony something like that and that's how we got put on you know and and again it had to be word-of-mouth because if nobody heard it you heard of you you had to have some really fuckin dope music for them to even like consider you if you didn't have like someone back in you it was tough you know you had to have someone come speak on your behalf and say hey these guys are the new new shit and and fortunately for us once we put out our snippet tape like when Sony put out our snippet tape guys like EPMD right and they were one of our favorite groups in the world man over the top five for Cypress orders you know Public Enemy Beastie Boys EPMD yeah fuck they were the shit and those were the guys that took our snippet tape and they were showing our snippet tape to other rappers like hey guys look at these new fuckin guys cuz you know bust a rhyme told me this story yo I've ghost on our just shit from EPMD way back in the day and they was playing it for Public Enemy and I just happened to be in the Bowman wah and you know Ice Cube when we met him for the first time you know and we had our ups and downs with him but he's one of my homies he told me yeah man the first time I heard of y'all was through EPMD they knew we was on tour was doing the show and they can switch out taping that's how I heard of y'all and and you know that they were like our first street team man fuckin EP our fame our favorite one of our top three favorite groups was out there like with our snippet tape telling people hey these guys are the new shit together they do they do stuff occasionally but I think they do more work you know individually now I know Eric's sermon is putting out a record right now he's just promoting it on on some radio show and uh I mean those guys still acted stay active I mean he's a producer so he's always making music but as a rapper they don't I don't put out as much stuff as they used to but yeah they're still active you know who I miss Kool G Rap Kool G Rap I still must out ain't a lot of guys don't have a style if he doesn't you know if he had never come out so many people were influenced by him yeah bad motherfuckers a lot of people forgot about him a lot of people forgot about him and he was one of the baddest dudes I mean a lot of people you know would talk about Big Daddy Kane and Rakim chore but you couldn't talk about them without talking about Kool G Rap cuz he was like one of those guys like spittin mad verses man like his bar work was incredible yeah he was incredible I still listen to it song cock-blocking yeah every now and then I'll throw that off and I got to tell you you know like if you hear songs that he does today he is still fuckin current like he is he's still got that style that cuts through like you know some of the older artists they sort of lose the style that and people love and they don't know how to transition into you know what their style would be right now you know like updating whatever that style is you know a lot of a lot of the older artists had troubles doing that you know but my man coogee rap not a final Street Blues feel he's still ill fantastic yeah yeah I always got confused why he didn't get bigger I didn't get it he's got so good you know I think it was it was just the wave that came after him you know it's it's it's like he was such an underground force and if you're an underground force you know you had to make a conscious decision whether okay I'm gonna go main if I go mainstream I'm gonna lose these hardcore fans I might gain you know these mainstream fans but how long are they gonna stay with me as opposed to these core fans that you know that they're but with his style he couldn't just keep him because like I thought he could I guys captain brain you want to know something I think it was due to um you know the record company not wanting to take the chance because as an artist you want everybody to hear your shit right you know for us we didn't play those games we said fuck it you know if we felt it was the right look for us we were gonna take it you know no matter what anybody thought you know and again you face scrutiny for shit like that but in the end you know if you didn't play yourself people remember that you know and we said fuck it we're gonna take our music mainstream even though that was not our intent you know we always meant ourselves to be a more underground group but insane and the brain didn't allow that it propelled us you know so we were like okay well we're gonna take our underground asses up into this mainstream and show them how we do it and it it kicked the door open for a lot of other underground acts to go into the mainstream and we proved that if you do it right and if you stay on your game and if you keep working in and stay present and put out quality music that you can sustain those those mainstream fans that you gained right there and the core yeah you guys sustained so well that people covered your shit yeah like rage that was awesome machine when they covered pistol grip pump on my left at all times holy shit one of my favorite bands still a Rocha Jelena yeah that that shit was awesome I mean he took a totally different take on it but like a cover but it was a cover but it was his take yeah it was badass it was one of my favorites man you know and it was an honor to me because you know like I was really good friends with them to begin with I saw them come out the gate before they exploded and became Rage Against the Machine and so for them to cover one of our songs we were like man fuck yeah you know because they they they helped us get better you know there was a lot of groups that we look to it for influence even if they were doing different style of music like Public Enemy wasn't influenced to us Rage Against the Machine was an inspiration to us to like push the envelope a little bit more on what we were doing not necessarily like how they were cuz they had their own sound just like we had our own sound so they made us push you know in groups like that made us better so when we heard this guy fucking doing or this band doing the cover and then they asked us to come play this song which would be their last night as Rage Against the Machine for a long time this was like their last show right here Wow we got to do that with them that must have been amazing I was wearing a dad hat before dad hats were cool I will not wear one right now I know what I was thinking that fuck it it was a fun show man I went into the mosh pit before that song before they called us up for that song for most of their set I was in the mosh pit and there was you you us see a front lineman down there record shop of the monster I was in there with him they were protected me I was like oh shit be really open up like yeah we record shop together it was it was awesome there's a video of Dana White in the mosh pit once I don't know what the fuck he was thinking he must have been drunk he jumped in the mosh pit like years ago he's a big dude though he's a big dude jumping around in there marching around yeah I did it a girl got ko'd in the mosh pit one man it's crazy man I used to go into a lot of different mosh pits there he's in the rage mosh pit yeah most of it is safe but every now and then and you run into a dickhead I'll tell you man that the the craziest mosh pits you know that I saw well the craziest mosh pits I've gotten into there was a limp Biskit mosh pit that was crazy and but the craziest was was the rage mosh pit but the ones that I seen from outside of it not being in it that were crazy was there was a Soundgarden mosh pit there's a song garden yeah at Lollapalooza early on it was when they had Badmotorfinger out oh man that fucking mosh pit was like a whirlpool of chaos bro I was loving it and I was on mushrooms watching this shit so fucking amazing and then and then a Slayer mosh pit man there fucking shit is brutal yeah that sounds like there's just a pace of slayer it's crazy but I got to tell you since joining prophets of rage in us you know when we tore your up and stuff like that and we do a combination of you know Rage Against the Machine songs probably giving me insight for sale along with our own material the mosh pits are fucking crazy but you know there was one one one thing that I saw that was not brutal but it was cool as fuck and it was in I think I believe it was Sweden or Switzerland but there you know out of like the the 60 70 thousand people that were out there there was like maybe 5,000 concentrated people who sat down on their ass right and we're like the fuck are these people do it I don't know like are they protesting ourself fuck is going on right and what was crazy as you know you you're not gonna stop playing you just keep going so we start on on I believe the song was guerrilla radio that we were playing at at that point all of a sudden we see him start doing this the Rowan they were wrote it was like a Viking row it was a fucking move it was a move that the crowd was doing so there's five five thousand people out of the 30,000 that are sitting in you know like next to each other lines rows you know just fucking of people rowing on beat dog it was the fucking Vikings man how crazy that DNA just stuck with those people and that was just the little section of it man if you were to see from stage Daryl was like it was spot like spotted groups and they sat down and they sat down and were rowing [Laughter] fucking crazy yeah have you ever seen there was a they did a Viking chant once at a soccer game crazy oh man it's wild cuz a whole fucking arena did it and you feel it you feel that shit like wow you got to think man when they they were going to wars back in the day and grabbing all their guys up just like that yeah grata to know this fucking boats gonna go sideways yeah you know I don't I don't know where that move comes from but it looks cool with seals fuck it it's gotta be an old-school Viking thing yeah they probably do it when they get drunk yeah I mean you know think about it you know they used to conquest motherfuckers so they're like fucking row and like see if you could find that the Viking one at a soccer game because it's like I think it's at a World Cup or something like that but they're like yeah yeah you hear it in the crowd he's like oh my god imagine hearing that shit over the way they're coming to get you is your village like grab the baby we're gonna live in the woods fuck yeah gotta get out of here yeah yeah and those are big dudes yeah there it is oh oh yeah look at that dog doo-doo together man they're all insane look at the hand that's spooky yeah Meadows now the fuckers if somebody reignites them medinet Matson that horde connections run fucking crazy line of DNA you know a line of people that just were conquerors sturdy motherfuckers sturdy giant motherfuckers who did mushrooms yeah they would do it blaze up mushroom their fucking heads into oblivion and just go slash people go get him it's crazy man is it there's another one sit another what so that's like their thing with Viking club I guess the NFL Vikings sort of adopted this recently they do it in their football games yeah but look at that dork with the glasses put your fucking hands down man stop you beat you stop that sorry oh hi oh I get it he's are spiking so when you first start wrapping like you wrap them with kids in your neighborhood are you like aspiring to be a rapper and write and shit down and trying things on your friends like how do you get started well the way that I started I was writing you know like poetry first really yeah what kind of poetry just like you know like hood stuff you know just stuff that rhymes but like just sort of writing it down like it was it was almost like writing raps but it just you know that's without saying it right because you read it and shit like that whatever but I would just write poetry about you know everyday shit you know I mean nothing you know wasn't like doing like the I don't know if there's like categories of poetry but you know it was just stuff that that would happen from day to day you know and I had a knack for writing I realized that now I always wanted to be a journalist that's you know what really that's the thing that I thought I was gonna be at school right do you right now I was for a while but I loved that stuff just again everyday stuff or you know I'd like randomly pick something to write about so if it was Kent about the cannabis industry I'd write something about that if it was about the music industry I'd write something about that like I every now and then I would there was a back in the early 2000s there was a magazine called industry insider magazine and occasionally I would write articles for that I wasn't really that great because you know I was so spotty in school that you know that my you know it needed work you know but they they left it raw the way that that I would put it out there and people got in my point and now that was cool but I looked at it in the way that the the music that I've done in a lot the song serve as a a certain form of journalism for me you know like you know bringing up certain issues that people don't necessarily hear like throw your set in the air as a song on temples boom and it's a song about how you would get you know in inducted into a gang how you get put into a gang how you fall into it and some people might think you know by hearing it that it was glorifying it and praising it but it wasn't it was basically this is how it is this is so you know the signs to look for if your kids are you know fucking around with the wrong people you know and that's you know I took it like okay you know maybe I'm not a journalist like I intended to be but this is my way of it you know I can enlighten people with certain things and you know like anything somebody's gonna read something or hear something and maybe misinterpret what you say but you know it's all about who's who's listening and who's reading and who's watching and stuff like that and their interpretation of it and some get it some don't and that's just the nature of it but like most people get it and I've I've come across people that have come to me and come and said hey man your your your songs on temple of boom men you know they helped to get me through these times or you these songs raised me they taught me this this and that that's awesome and to me you know that that's that's the impact right there that's the shit yeah means more than anything right because I'm sure you remember songs that got you through like oh yeah for sure do you know there was songs from k RS one in Public Enemy that you know got me through and fired me up you know and inspired and stuff like that eris ones another one people forget about man I'll be in my car just going that's the son of the police yeah I mean he he taught me how to be a bullhorn you know the mean like tell you know like yeah tell the truth you know you're gonna tell get the word out and and and not be fearful of what might happen because he could have been one of the biggest stars in in hip-hop but he chose not to be he chose to be a voice and sometimes in being that voice you know you get objects put in front of you and certain opportunities don't you know get put on your table because he says some great shit man you're talking about getting mad at the president it's like being mad at the manager at McDonald's yeah you know for the way the corporation's being run yeah it's it's he he is uh very insightful in the shit that he says and he is very unafraid to state it in state his opinion for you to get like people coming up to you when they first start coming up to you telling you that your music got them through things that it means so much to them when that first start happening that must have been so real you know yeah because as an artist as especially as a young artist you that's not something you think about all these songs are gonna well it depends on on the artist you are right guys hit how old were you like 23 years I'm like that old were you when that was like we released in 91 and it really started going for us in 92 so I was 22 yeah that's so crazy oh there goes the baby fro yeah but I mean think about that man that is so crazy for you to go from the guy who yo MTV raps yeah who remembers that I did a bungee jump at this spring break with Treach from Naughty by Nature was that the one that was in Cancun no that was Daytona Beach right oh okay when MTV was still when MTV was still allowed over there was back when MTV had music yeah when they had music format empty was a MTV was music videos yeah good luck finding a fucking music video now they still I gotta go to YouTube yeah exactly yeah wow that's wild what was it like when it first started popping off and you were 22 years old was it did it feel real it was a it was a crazy thing because it's not something that I had ever envisioned happening you know I didn't think that you know the music would blow up like that you know we were doing it to obviously try and make a name for ourselves and and make music that people liked but fuck we didn't see that coming at all especially with insane in the brain when they told me when like when kill a man started going it was like surreal because you know we didn't think that song would take just because it you know of the chorus itself you know fuck what the song is about that you know we knew that the chorus was you know what they were gonna hear more than anything and so I you know we we thought that we're gonna have a good underground album we didn't realize it we didn't think they were gonna put kill a man in the juice movie and that would blow that song up even more so than it was it was getting because we had released funky Phil ones first and it was a double a-side single funky Phil and and kill a man on the other a side which means at that time the DJ's had the option of which song they wanted to go whereas most of the time you had a a side B side and the a side is most definitely the one that the record company wants you to push we gave it a double a-side because we thought maybe the djs would like kill a man more they went with funky Phil when the record company because they figured it would be easier to market right and then the DJ started flipping the record of course and we started getting traction behind that our record was out like six months had dropped off the chart and they flipped the record our shit slowly starts to go back up the chart we got back on the chart and started climbing and we were getting a whole lot of mix show play and then we started doing a lot of promotional shows that being one of them and it started going and killing man started getting us going and I mean we toured for probably a year and a half like a lot of just a lot of promotional shows and not getting paid you know just you know Sony having us out there promoting the record and by the time you know our record got back back up into the middle of the chart so I mean it was still rising but then they saw that they're like we got to get them off the road and making a new record so that's when we got out there with black sunday and with black Sunday and insane coming out again that's not a song I thought would blow up when they've chose that for the single I'm late right there's better songs but fuck it that's the one okay so it comes out boom it explodes and now we have our black Sunday charting at number one coming in and our our first album had come all the way from the bottom to hit number five so we had two two albums in the top ten 200 top ten of the 200 songs you know on the chart which no one had ever done in hip-hop before we had one in five slot and you know fuck we definitely didn't think that was gonna happen I mean you know it was all a surprise and it went from one minute you could go to a mall and be you know unassuming and nobody even knows who the fuck you are and you know you're getting about your day - now you go to the mall and the whole fucking mall is swarming on you like fucking you're like you know Paul McCartney or something it was the craziest shit they would ask us to leave the malls like really yeah like we used to I used to go to this one called the Montebello it was in Montebello I can't remember what the name of the mall was but it was in Montebello the only one down there at the time and we knew everybody there you know as we're coming up because that's where we'd go shop so you know you make friends and people in the shop and stuff like that and when we come back off the tour this time and go try to go to that mall you know one of our friends fucked up and wore Cypress Hill jacket and that's like a fucking billboard when you're standing next to one of us right so before you know it boom we get swooped and and you know some pretty cellphone - yeah and the mall security cuz I hey man you know I know it's fucked up but you guys gotta go really yeah man it's a commotion you guys gotta go they're telling me I'm like they think someone's gonna fight I'm like all right I never went back to that mall after that Wow all right cool because you know what I didn't want to cause them problems - it was now it was tough to go somewhere at that time and not get you know swarmed that get swarmed yeah it was it was it was quite quite an experienced man like you know cuz you only ever hear about it till it happens and you might you know if you have friends in the industry and it's happening for them you might see it indirectly you know like through that through their shit and you know we had friends in the business you know for it kid frost was one of my friends before we got out there and is he still around yeah yeah he still does stuff you know um I don't know if he's putting out so much new music these days but he's still here and there he's doing some of the cannabis industry stuff too because he's a big connoisseur I got to tell you my man smokes he used to smoke like a train man like him and I would trade joints off left and right but you know for a time you know I would go hang with him at his gigs I'd be his bodyguard cuz I was the one that was not afraid to carry the hammer meaning the Magnum in my waistline you know I was we were Cowboys man we were always armed at that time from 89 to probably 97 or 98 we were holding pistols on our hip like Cowboys and you know he knew that so he asked me he would ask me to go to the gigs you know Ted you know double as his bodyguard I wasn't his bodyguard but I was his bodyguard you know me right and um I'd see the way he handled it and let's see the way you know people crowded around him and in and you know I saw I learned how to deal with it watching you know how he would do it in a negative way or a positive way cuz you know he was sometimes embrace the crowd sometimes it's like fuck off me you know like a lot a lot of artists are you know and that sort of prepared me so that when you know we got in our lane you know I knew how to sort of deal with it and I you know was always courteous and cool and respectful and never the guy there's like nah man fuck that get out of here because I see it in some of my homies were like that you know and I didn't I hated the feeling that when the fans would walk away just totally fucking wind out of their sails and shit like that now they don't like this artist ever again you know and I saw that and I never wanted to have anyone walk away with that experience I always embraced it even when it was a pain in the ass you know so when was your first time ever getting on stage do you remember first time that there used to be a club called Radio Tron here in the 80s right and it was the hip-hop club if you were into hip-hop any aspect of it whether it was rapping breakdancing popping graffiti all the people went to that spot and it was hard to get in there and it was hard to get on the mic no less but we had a homie who was like a legendary DJ out here when when the a.m. station was playing hip-hop his name was Tony G and he was the leader of the Mixmaster show they had Mix Master and he had a residency at the radio Tron so we grew up with one of his um when his boys that was his like his protege so they invited us over and myself and Sen got on the mic and mellow and I froze the fuck I tell you I froze up I forgot every rap I ever wrote or ever memorized I was like it would be one of the two times that I would freeze in my life and and it was that was the first time I was on stage and all those people looking at me waiting expecting something I totally blew it you know and I told myself okay I gotta get over the nervousness and then the other thing we were doing like it was a it was like um they wanted rappers to do this PSA for some bullshit right and they wanted us to write this rap and put all this certain information in there and I had it I had it memorized I had it locked in the minute they said go and they were filming it you know this is film it I kept fucking it up horribly like I didn't even get through it I was like I'm sorry I can't do it fuck I you know I I was getting mad at myself to that fuck what's wrong with me I know I wasn't maybe that was problem that was probably the problem you know cuz when I'm not high as when shit like this happens right so those are the two times that I totally fucked it up in I like from the last time I said I'll never do that again I'm gonna be prepared and I'm gonna get through the anxiety or whatever it is and so those were the first two times but the first time on stage where I actually pulled it off was probably one of our first showcases it was at a it was at this place off of the 10 and it wasn't a showcase it was actually a competition you know I used to do competitions it's clubs like if I can what do they call it a forgot what they used to call him but you know different bands would it was like a battle of the bands right so we went in and I'm coming off of that horrible fucking deal that had just happened you know maybe a month or two before and I totally got over it and we were performing real estate you know in this showcase and we lost but we made the biggest impression there because the song you know we performed it like you know the way that it supposed to be and then at the end cent dog jumped on the big judge's table and he you know he grabbed his balls right in front of the fucking female judge and then as he jumps off the table it breaks in half into her lap you know and everybody loved it we lost to these dudes who are like new new edition wannabes we call them titty rolls but we don't remember they won but in reality we won because the that's what everybody was talking about us at the end you know like how raw that was and after that show I realized you know this is this is how I'm supposed to do it and I seen Kay rs1 do a show one time where the sound went out he didn't have a stage they he was on a couple of tables that were put together and he just got up in front of the whole club no microphone no music and just started rapping his verses and people were rapping right along with him not giving a fuck that the sound turned off but the fact that he just continued to do the show and that right there taught me a lot about how you control shit on stage yeah sometimes when when things go wrong it's a great opportunity oh yeah yeah did a show at the improv last month like maybe my last month or the month before the power went out and they're like what do you want to do said fuck it let's do a show I could yell yeah so we just did everybody just did the show with no microphone but that was us you know The Improv is a small room it's only 180 people yeah I mean that that that place was you know a small place too but I mean it it goes to show you man like if you got it you gotta do it yeah it's probably better sometimes because it's unique yeah cuz people will remember you know the other way yeah you know it probably would have been a great show and people would be talking about it but they'll remember the fact that you got over that adversity and were able to still deliver and that's the shit that K RS 1 did for me he showed me through the adversity he kept doing the show and the people were still with him and I thought okay one day that's gonna be me and I'm gonna do what the teacher does and you know that that that had been one of the most important things that I learned you know and watching others do shows and stuff like that and what I would do when I got up there you know and I applied all those those you know lessons men you know and and it's made me who I am as my part of Cypress Hill and when I do my solo stuff and when I'm with prophets of rage that you know that got me prepped for everything that I do now in terms of music now how did you well it's good that did you for you to tell people that you had a real hard time your first time performing oh yeah there's probably a lot of people out there think I'll never say inches yeah a lot of people never say that they'll lie you know but that's I think that's important and there's nothing wrong with those feelings man it's it's good you're gonna learn man your head it's it's it's like you liken it to to like college stars that are coming into the professional sports knowing basketball players for instance you get this number-one draft pick he comes to a team and everybody has these high expectations no one knows that this you know some people own the space like LeBron and Kobe and Kevin Garnett came straight from high school and they own the space the minute they got in it I mean Kobe had to work he wasn't the greatest you know when he when he started he had to work to get to where he was at and and a lot of these guys do some of them you know again they come in and they already got it you know like LeBron he was you know playing and groans met grown man's game right when he got into the league thrown into the fire but he was ready for that he got better and and learned the role and learned who he was as he's gone but he was one of those rare thing rare people that can just jump into it some people have to get better at it yeah and you know it's the same thing with music like you get thrown on on that big stage for the first time if you're not prepped for it you're gonna definitely be nervous you know you could either embrace that and you know it'll be your first show and you could do a good one or you could do a horrible one but either way you're gonna learn from that yeah and if you don't learn from it then the run is short if you learn from it you know you know you learn how to get better and and sustain a longer career how did you learn how to get over the anxiety like your first show having a the first show suck like that what was it how did what was what did you learn like how did you how did you take classes did you read a book you know what we did that helped me was that we rehearsed a lot because for me it was like more remembering the songs it wasn't like the nerve to go out in front of people because we came from the breakdance in b-boy culture the popping and stuff like that so much of that is going against someone battling someone in front of a crowd and if you can be in front of a crowd doing that cuz that's vulnerable I mean you know because in a battle you could either win or you lose and if you lose you know obviously you can lose in an embarrassing way or you lose in a close battle but either way people are sitting there watching you judging you either cheering you or booing you wouldn't you know any one of those so that help me be able to get on stage and perform in front of people it for more from me it was more about knowing the songs making sure that I know him through the nervousness you know and so for us we did a lot of rehearsals in the early days just so that those first shows that we did that we were locked in and we made an impression and you know when we did that and we saw the results of how people were reacting to our show it gave me more confidence so you know I I'd rehearsed the songs in my head you know when I wasn't around the other guys I'd be kicking the songs and I'd be or be on a treadmill working out saying the songs you know getting them in my head and just gave me the confidence I know this fucking shit I go up there I'll rock this fucking thing I'm not gonna forget it cuz that's always the problem for me it was never getting in front of people it was do I know my shit and now I know it in such a way that like you know it's it's second nature do I still get those nervous butterflies yeah for sure some shows depending who's watching who's on the side stage or how big the crowd is and whatnot ya still get some of that but you know I I do a quick meditation before I go out there you know just in my head real quick and then our band prayer and then that's the that's the switch right there and we go and we're ready and it but it took me a while to get to that you know because it takes work it's like anything if you're a athlete if you're a boxer you're only gonna get better by boxing all the time training all the time not overtraining but making sure that you're in there putting in the work and it's the same thing when you're rockin stages you know a lot of us sometimes forget to go and put the time in and rehearse and you could see that when there's a sloppy show or someone's out of breath or they're not saying the whole line or they said the line wrong or they're changing up fragments of the song to make it easier for their performance and it doesn't necessarily fit that's when you know somebody ain't putting in the work but for us you know we always you know that was a part of the draw for Cyprus that's how he won a lot of people over was the energy of our live show so but it took that the rehearsals men and I would tell any artist coming up right now man before you start doing your shows you cuz you may get a hit like that fast these days and you may be called to go do that show now if you don't do that show right and you suck as good as that song is you're never gonna sell tickets when they fucking say hey so-and-so is performing at the you know this place ah fuck that I'd rather just listen to the record he sucks life you know so the rehearse man rehearse and then after that hey take you know do what you will but those they fucking help man you know for your confidence on performing the song that's a wise thing to tell people man be up professionally a pro you can be a professional decide you're a professional in that fucking work that work does give you confidence and it works with fighting it works with comedy I'm sure it works with everything yeah man you got to be proficient professional at D professional and official at the same time protocol what is the meditation that you do just the self-awareness you know what I mean like the the circular breathing you know and concentrating on that and in the moment and then you know just letting that clear my head you know I mean just focus focusing on the breathing I mean that's what they tell you pretty much in any meditation to focus on the breathing and all these things are gonna come through your head but if you keep on focusing on that you know everything sort of goes away mmm and your your reset so you know I'll I'll do that when when I feel maybe some sort of anxiety before going on if I don't feel that I don't necessarily do the meditation I'll we'll just do the prayer and that's sort of like you know sets it all in but yeah like some shows man I'll have to like go in a room and just sit there and you know do the breathing man and it helps people might think about what the fuck is I gonna do is gonna reset your mind and give you some clarity you know for me at least that's what it did what's the biggest crowd you guys ever performed in front of I think the biggest was with Woodstock 94 I think it was 93 94 and that was like three hundred and three hundred eighty some odd thousand people we've done some big ones yeah small European country we've done some like you know like at you know hundred thousand people in hundred videos Jamie oh my god I got to see this I just cut my hair right there I was like you know oh my god see the little guy next to mugs mmm he was our our miniature knockout guy he knew jujitsu Taekwondo Shotokan he trained with with my boy Kenji and he was like he was like our unofficial security that's cuz unassuming right yeah he's a little guy I mean he even did even did a few MMA fights I almost lost my shit right here because you know seeing three hundred and some odd thousand people jumping around to your shit God you know it could give you some equilibrium problems because it looks like waves crashing into each other then it's that big I mean that's got to be one of the biggest concerts ever yeah anybody's ever performed in front of in North America for sure I mean in all of human history yeah it was one of the biggest how the fuck how do you get it more than 380,000 people together yeah it's nice that's probably only happened a few times it's it's crazy I mean every band they had on this this particular bill was huge at the time you know so it was yeah it was it was pretty crazy trying to just get there we like some of us had to get in through boats some of us had to get in through helicopter why cuz there's sooo many because they they had started parking on the roads like the old school with star-ledger up the highways and stuff like that they parked like they pretty much shut the shit down and I went in through helicopter and some of the other guys went in like after that's when you know you're on top of the world they flying into a show and a fucking helicopter now to use a girl that's when you realize why you can never get away from the cops when there if I can see everything but that's a funny thing man when you watch those dudes that are trying to escape from the cops on the ground and then you watch the cops in the helicopter the spotlight just stays in the car the entire time yeah get that that's yeah that's and that's just a piece of it right there and they had a rotating stage what are you doing you have to take a shit how long does it take to get from the front row to the back tell you we walked around in that shit right there and it was super muddy and crazy and people were like butt-naked it with mud smeared all over their fucking bodies and it was like people went primal awesome people made babies that day in their tent I'm sure they did for sure they did I yeah sure there's a lot of people out there right now it was it was it was fucking crazy man I got to tell you there was there was people out there totally hippie doubt like straight-up butt-naked and you know and there was a good portion of them I mean not not in terms of the whole concept of is a small percentage but like you've seen just naked people walking around free out there it was crazy as fuck we like like are we is this really happiness shit man and then the mud was so thick man it was the type where like if you walk through it with your shoes and your shoes weren't tight or you weren't wearing boots it was sucking the shoe right off of your foot it happened to me a number of times hell in that show I jumped into the crowd cuz normally I would jump into the crowd and you know just be floating you know stage dive style but I would still be doing the song right and on that particular show they took my shoes and socks I got back on stage with no she was in socks and you know about 15 years later you know I had one guy with once you come to the show in fucking have me sign it and then the other shoe somehow some chick had it and had me sign it years later so I caught up with both shoes what about the socks didn't catch up with the socks the socks but the shoes yet caught up with them what do they have a limited amount of tickets for Woodstock I mean what the fuck's do they do when you get that many people I think they probably started with some sort of limit and became K and then it became chaos you know like did something they couldn't handle I mean if you lived there I know they were pissed off they had a break for like fucking 25 years they had a break they sold a hundred and sixty four thousand tickets but the crowd estimated size was five hundred and fifty thousand okay bullshit I was too short but that's 200,000 short because the rest rushed the gate you know they took the fence and you know took it down and they just fucking roll-to-roll dog yeah I would imagine yeah it you know cuz when it's an event that everybody wants to get to they're gonna find a way to it and it's outside and it's outside and that what those numbers man that's just you can't stop that now no in it you know it's it's a great part of their history because I mean you know that one was a good one where no one got hurt it was no crazy no crazy shit happening like the next one after that I mean they had so what happened the next one uh well shit they had a bunch of women said they had gotten raped or molested at at the one the following year and fires yeah and then there was fires there was a whole bunch of people lost their fucking minds at that one and they had some great bands too so you know it they don't do that anymore right what starts know that they're doing it it's move sell your house yeah do something do something it's crazy though cuz there's a fire holy shit man yeah I had bonfires yeah I believe when I owned this gift what corn went on it was either limp Biskit or corn and the fires just fucking started people were pissed too because they were charging so much for water and like they couldn't they couldn't get to the bathrooms like you're asking like there's they didn't have the facilities set up as well yeah they didn't have adequate facilities for what what the fuck was popping to me you know you know a spouse is Christ look at the fucking what it looks like after it's over listen a thousand Andy Gump's for 500,000 people is nothing you imagine you need like 10,000 imagine being the dude who gets in there after 5,000 I mean they totally took over the fucking that was crazy they shut down the fucking highway they just parked their cars they made yeah they made the highway the plan is crazy look at that yeah at least it was kind of orderly sort of sort of they shut I'll tell you this though they weren't cold-blooded that the organizers because these guys had some fucking moxie I'll tell you that hey listen you know after every band was done with their set they expected you to leave right away because the next wave of bands was coming and they were getting your spot so like if you had a dressing room once your set was done you were expected to get the fuck out so you had a helicopter out of there if if yeah it was best if you did because if you didn't take the ride when when when you were supposed to you were getting stuck there they couldn't guarantee that they could give you the ride back to your shit after that you know because they had all the other bands to think of and they might not have room for you when they take the other bands so it was like saying that picture is insane yeah it was that that's that's the one I'll remember the most I mean we've we've done some huge gigs but like that one by far you know never have we played for another five hundred thousand you know is it sound like it was five hundred thousand people scream much like that Viking chant I mean we had a small nation right there half raised you know legitimately like when you leave there and then you go do a regular gig afterwards does it feel weird yeah well it depends but yeah adjusting it does take some adjusting you know especially if the next gig isn't as hype as that you're like fuck we just came from Woodstock but fortunately the smaller gigs that we had after that you know in terms of playing festivals they were like you know in between 30,000 70,000 hundred thousand and we felt that that gave us such an experience that we can handle any fucking stage so it became easier for us to do festivals after that and the reaction that we would get at these festivals were smaller versions of what we did there you know and it was it was a great experience because we did we had been doing like a couple of European festivals before that so it sort of prepared us for that but we didn't we didn't I mean the fucking numbers we were definitely not prepared for we're like whoa what the yeah that's like that transcends reality yeah I mean listen we know that that's not our show they're not all there for us you know cuz it's a mixed bag right bunch of different artists and you're winning over people if anything you're you're you're they're playing for your your base of people that might have come to see you but you're winning everybody else over if you're doing it right and for us it was like a victory because we saw you know half a million people up there jumping up and down though all our shit and they knew the words and they were singing with us and you know it was like a a big notch under the belt in a boost for our confidence knowing that we can get in front of anybody play with anyone and get that reaction I mean because after that you know we were getting booked on metal driven festivals and stuff where we're the only hip hop on it but it's all straight-up metal I mean we're plan shows co-headlining under Metallica right and Metallica Cypress Hill biohazard Deftones Fear Factory and all that stuff you know to mean and we'd be in that mix playing those festivals with those guys and with hip-hop music and you know the boost did it gave us in the confidence it was like fuck that we can play with any of these motherfuckers it doesn't matter who it is and and we went to those metal fence metal festivals with our hip hop and got metal reaction mosh pit stage dives everything what you know and in it felt good to be able to hang up there with them Metallica I mean yeah what they do to a crowd is crazy but we realized that if we were playing on the same venue going before them we can in in a festival form we can fucking hang with anyone in and that's that pretty much put us over the top with doing festivals like yeah we're gonna fucking rule this shit people are gonna have to people are gonna have to up their game when we're on that festival with them that's the way we took it I would imagine you couldn't sleep for days after that chair the adrenaline was crazy I gotta tell you the adrenaline was crazy and when you're in the helicopter leaving were you like what the fuck does happen yeah we were we were tripping out man I mean we were like totally in awe of the response that we got and that's the the you know the enormity of the fucking crowd man I mean it was fuckin huge used to be a part of something that's that I mean that's like something that no one there is ever gonna forget we took it for granted I've got to tell you when we fuckin duh they're well they want you to do so okay we'll do Woodstock whatever and when we got there that's when we saw just how fucking crazy it was I think this yes this is you I have to hold my shirt forward so that I don't get choked out and there goes there goes the first users like oh fuck there goes watch you there goes my white sock yeah that goes the other is so ridiculous and there is no fucking security that can stop 500,000 people save all that shit no you're at the mercy of the fans he's gonna grab from my sock pretty soon that is so wild than just stealing socks look at it still your pants yeah hey listen you know they tried in big grab you dick no you know they tried to grab the weed in my pocket is that sometimes you know when the adrenaline is kicking you're not really thinking you know what's in my pocket shit like that but yeah you know throughout I had chicks trying to grab my shit for sure of course for sure yeah that was a little you know crazy for me you know but it is what it is if you're gonna stand close yeah you know shit like this happens right yeah man I mean if you're gonna stage dive you gotta assume some weird shit is gonna happen yeah I mean for me you know people were mostly respectful you know but they would go through my pockets to see if I had weed in one pocket yeah I did I had some I had like an ounce of weed in one at one show and I jumped in and I totally forgot I had it in my pocket boom if I can take my goddamn hope you enjoyed that I bet they did oh they did but they're rolling that joint this is real weed man I know they say straight from California this is the real shit yeah California weed to this day still holds up yeah I mean you got some good Colorado weed there's some good weed all over the country but most weed is just it's like okay okay other places yeah righto in California and then the rest is kind of Seattle's got real good weed Seattle actually blow your fucking mind they'll blow your mind yeah I gotta say or again they'll blow your mind people have stepped up they're still behind California you know in terms of how much good weed there is here like I mean there's so much you know from north to south and in central cow there's so many different strains that are fucking good right you go to other places and they have a few strains that are good but that's because they're still you know they're still trying to catch up in terms of knowledge and cultivation and stuff like that in in in how to make the strains that they have you know it maximized the flavor in in the high and all that stuff some have caught up and some are still lagging a little bit behind but I gotta tell you man when this last trip I just had to Vancouver I was just there for 4/20 and they had some shit that California boys would be like yo this is fire right here you know if they had animal cookies that were really good wedding cake which is a strain it's you know popular here in Cali you know Thea the jungle boys and and burner and stuff like that when they were when they were working together on exotics and and they also had this this joint called Black Diamond and tri octane and all of them man I I gotta say all of them burn sweet they tasted good that that white ash did people are looking for now you know people think you know when they see why - it's the purest newsflash even if it has a little bit of black ash it's still you know there's still you know people clean flush their roots you know what I mean it's just that some of the nutrients if you're using salts as your nutrients you know which most people are these days you're ash comes out white if you're using nutrients that are already pre-made like an advanced nutrients and the others sometimes you know you might have a little bit of black ash because some of the components into those nutrients doesn't mean it's not clean it just looks prettier when it's white but anyway these guys they're shit all white ash and the taste was fuckin beautiful in the high was definitely there and I I say the guys in Vancouver man they have stepped it up even runnin weed through Vancouver for a long time Jeff said what was Adams Cordys documentary he had the culture high and then before that there was another one the documentary that was all about uncovering mm-hmm how much of Vancouver's entire economy is based on marijuana and if you pulled it out like when they talk about the Union that's it the business mind when if you pulled weed out of Vancouver you took it out of their economy the economy would essentially collapse yeah I mean it's responsible for so many people being wealthy up there and it's so it was now it's a hundred percent legal throughout the entire country yeah but back then in 2007 I was in that documentary that was 12 years ago it was just tolerated it was was weirdly tolerate yeah where it wasn't legal but they didn't ever arrest anybody for it but there was a lot of gangsters a lot of Hell's Angels revolved a lot of dudes were selling weed and they had flashy diamond colored white covered watches and shit there was a lot of that yeah yeah yeah you know it's still sort of I mean you know listen the black markets always gonna be a you know anywhere especially right now that the taxes are so high to buy cannabis and to grow it and all that stuff everything that involves it it's pretty expensive right now so they're encouraging organized crime right yeah which my point was you know when the corporations come in that shit comes down and then the black market has a bigger problem at that point because then prices of cannabis will come down but you know it's always gonna exist in in you know we sort of went through the same thing when when 215 came about here in California where it was you know cops didn't know what the fuck to do when they caught you with it they didn't want to do anything you know because they they knew as well as we were this shit is eventually gonna be legal they don't want to be wasting their time and putting people in jail for for cannabis because you know there's other people that need to be in jail for real for real crimes but yeah I think what's happening in Vancouver now is that now that it's legal yeah people are still making money and they're still you know they're still on top of the game but it's it's it's harder to make the money right now well at least well maybe not for Canada because it's federally legal but you still got to jump through a number of Hoops you know in terms of regulation and fines and fees and shit like that to operate you know and there a bit different than ours obviously we're not ours isn't like federal yet but I mean you know from what they were saying is it like you know in a few years all these companies will be making a whole lot of money right now they're making money but it's basically about survival getting past a certain time when all the all the legislation all the rules and all the regulations are finally set in place and they're not gonna change from year to year like they like they have been so you know well Denver had it real weird for a while where they weren't allowed to use banks yeah you know like us right now here in Cali we can't use banks yeah what do they do with it so they can they use credit cards here they used to be able to yeah you can use credit cards but realistically it's it's if you're making money from from cannabis in terms of if you're a cultivator or you're or whatever if you're a business entity in the cannabis world they won't take your money if they know it's coming from the cannabis cannabis culture right but you know in the last in the last two months they've you know Forbes just put out a story about that the federal government is gonna still start allowing banks to to allow banking in the cannabis in the Canada it's not going anywhere they'd be crazy to not you just leave money on the table even a whole lot of money California considers plan to encourage marijuana banking yeah yeah and that and that just came out yesterday you know the Forbes story came out like maybe last week or something but this is you know one of the residuals of it is it you know in places like California that we had problems with banking yeah that is no longer going to exist so now if you needed to expand your business or something you get a business loan now or you can actually put your money in the fucking bank you know whereas before you had to fucking buy some sort of vault or some shit and keep it there and you know obviously that ain't safe because you got pirates out there still to this day trying to figure out okay where did they keep their money because it's not a bank well when I was in Colorado when it first became legal and they were having a real heart that they couldn't use credit cards and it was all cash and they just had SpecOps guys everywhere bulletproof vests just covered with guns just ready to rock at any moment's notice and they were worried that they were gonna get you know yeah someone was gonna try to take over the store and take all the money yeah I mean there's still issues that they got to worry about moving into the future in terms of transport portation right you know because throughout throughout the history of doing any sort of business terms of products going from one side of the nation to the other you know trucks get hijacked a lot yeah for electronics for any sort of goods so you know when you're transporting cannabis from state to state they're gonna have to have that you know figured out too because there's you know people that are gonna be trying to jack those trucks yeah and hitting that into the black market you know what else is weird that there's people that they post up on people's private land and start these growth these grow centers they put up a garden in people's land like I I've a friend who works on a ranch and in like central California and they were doing this run they were checking gates and checking fences or where the cattle are and they found like a fucking acre of wheat like what the fuck is this and there was some dudes there they had campgrounds set up and shit and yeah it was like they were just they were cartel dudes they just like set up a spot yeah find a spot set up they don't know who fucking owns it and if they'd you know it'd get dropped off there apparently they'd think if I remember the story they got the guys and the guys basically explained how it worked that they get dropped off and they get you know they leave them with seeds and this and that and then new guys come in every couple weeks or a couple months and they lived there yeah just watch the weed until it grows to the point where they can cultivate it and then they move on after it's done yeah over the place oh yeah people find them in like state parks and forests and shit yeah thinking that's why it happens mostly up north and in central cow here we don't really I mean the way they patrol the state parks is slightly different down here in the South though they'll catch that ya know that's why they did it at the ranch because it was Tejon ranch which is like 2,000 acres yeah huge place yes I could believe natives owned that that ranch right yeah you can find to this day these stones where they ground up acorns where they have like a little like a pivot like a hole we rounded up I took pictures of it it's pretty crazy because you got to think like that's probably a thousand years old yeah somebody was probably grind in acorns in there a thousand years a thousand years ago I've never been up north to Humboldt I've never been up to that area oh then it's it's a it's unique there's a lot of nice flavors up there if you're into glass a lot of good glass blowers out there that's a long-standing weed culture oh yeah I mean that shit is generational right there from the 70s yeah Humboldt yeah and in in I'll tell you man you know it as quiet as is they've been in this cannabis culture you know you would think that there that'd be one place that's like celebrated and whatnot but I mean they still are coming up with you know incredible flavors down there you know in terms of you know breeding certain certain um certain strains in creating new strains in doing it in outside you know like as they call sun grown or or a greenhouse you know which is not something we do here in the south in the south weed we do hydro it's you know indoor because we don't have the same type of moisture well we don't have the space neither you know the forest diging and the moisture and you know we have we have insects that would eat those outdoor crops if they're not in a greenhouse you know I mean like fruit worms is shit like that up there and you know up north after dark you know it gets cold so some of those those insects can't live in that that environment but in the south it doesn't get as cold as it does up there so they can live here so you know if you're gonna do a greenhouse here you it's got to be a greenhouse it can't just be outdoor exposed because they will get they will get fucked with for sure those photos I've seen of that area is everything so fucking green that's crazy it's like Seattle almost yeah it's awesome man yeah we were just there not too long ago playing to show up in that guy in the middle of this forest of wheat yeah on a hillside no no you know it's not even a flat ground he's just he got it going yeah that looks like he's just in the woods yeah he just started growing it in the woods that's crazy but it has a different feel to it right out there with nature like I mean I think it's drawn to hippie to hippie dippie but I would think that's something that lives in nature with all those other trees and shits communicating with those trees oh yeah I would think so you probably get more of like a natural feel for the weed yeah they're probably hot damn look at the weed plant affected fucking bushes Jesus Christ California black tail right there whole Lumbee a black tail that's a big deer this is a big deer for that part of probably eating a wheat plant probably probably healthiest fuck I mean if he's eating the seeds you know easy yeah probably fertilizing some of that shit up yeah for the longest time we used to have to get you know um I'm one of the owners of on it and when we made hemp protein we still have to buy our shit from Canada it was so stupid it was like this is so ridiculous you have to buy hemp from another country yeah bring into this country stupid well that's gonna change yes there's got to change I mean for for everything for clothing even building houses you ever see that hempcrete that shit they make so yeah up concrete yeah it's crazy lighter it's better it's got better insulation values it's harder to burn this is the type of shit that Jack Herer was trying to tell people and Emperor where the Emperor wears no clothes yeah all this stuff that we we use today hemp can be you know the alternative at a cheaper cost including plastic yeah biodegradable plastic all these people that are worried about plastic bottles and everything how bad they are for the environment hemp bottles you could make plastic at a hemp and it would be biodegradable yeah it sounds like horseshit there's so many things that you could do with weed that it sounds like you're making things it sounds like you're making it up but it's actual its actual in fact yeah and dude over the last like couple of months I've been fucking around pretty heavily with CBD like every day oh yeah I've been taking this this is a it's a 1 in 1 it's 10 milligrams of CBD 10 milligrams of THC I take this that's that's the perfect like one morning one in the afternoon don't give a fuck juice that that's an interesting time yeah you know for someone who was you know used to have to hide it before yeah in you know that's the beauty of it now is it you don't have to hide it and people that used to you know you got people now that you never thought were smokers and you know now they're coming out and just being totally free with it and that's great man you know because that hep laptop what the fuck is that I'll just be a cover but yeah that's pretty cool how could it be a cover of its you like the USB ports and everything about they have those like skin covers it could just be a look-alike but it looks like it they should make it for time it is I gotta agree it is it is well listen brother you're a bad motherfucker I really appreciate you thank you brother forever for a long time so it's cool to get in here and well in the hot boxes we could yeah we're gonna to get in that Slovak been asking for you for long time I got and I say this you know in some of the some of the smoke boxes you know like because it's the realest shit like we just had Mike Tyson in there you know and how weird is it the smoke weed with Mike that was I've smoked with him before and and I've smoked with him on a couple separate occasions aside from there but one of the places that I smoked with him was at that fucking lyoto machida Rashad Evans fight when we all left you know after the fight we were sort of getting to our cars and he ran into me and in my partner Kenji and we were smoking a fat one right there and they'd be real was like alright fuck ya champ where do you go and and you know we always knew he smoked out well it was crazy about this interview real quick that did I'll say it like because you asked me this in this interview like what did you do for the anxiety's before like you know let's say we're gonna go on stage or do the shit right so I asked him that similar question I said you know as artists as athletes before we're gonna go do our thing in front of a mass amount of people you get this nervous energy what did you do to you know deal with that and he said I used to get hypnotized before fight yeah you know and he was saying how he would the guys that work work with him would uh instill these certain words like calmness you know that would be a reoccurring word that they would do in the hip you know in hypnotizing him before a fight so that he would always be calm in the fight and never fight desperate and always be in control of the situation no matter what happened and that's how he would you know get that nervous energy down and and and be able to fight with such focus but the other interesting thing he said was that he never fought I mean he was smoking the whole time you know he's big weed head since he was like ten years old apparently but he said that he was smoking you know but not necessarily when he was training they would give him pharmaceuticals when he was training you know shit that he wouldn't feel nothing but he didn't have focus what kind of pharmaceuticals he said some of it was fentanyl some percocet some fentanyl wasn't even around but well it's a form of it you know like whatever yeah I was opiate that was whatever the defense and all of that time whatever I can't remember what he called it but there was two or three prescription drugs that they would give him and he said he he wouldn't feel nothing he felt good like there's no pain no nothing but the focus that he had was was not not there right he said that he smoked weed in one fight Mikey smoked weed before one particular fight and and he used the Wiz inator to get through the urine test somehow he fucking he says it in the interview and you know he said that the fight that he had where he was smoked out was with Andrew Golota why he said he'd never had so much focus in a fight that it made him realize he should have been smoking weed through every goddamn fight because he focused on everything he was supposed to he said he broke his cheek he broke his cheek air his orbital ba broke his orbital he broke a rib and part of his back with a body shots Christ and he said you know that was the fight that was the one and only fight that he you know smoked out beforehand and Andrew Golota got he got the flat lined he Andrew Golota left the ring he was like fuck this and Andrew Golota had been through Wars oh yeah man I mean Riddick Bowe fights were crazy Riddick Bowe fights I mean cuz Riddick Bowe was really good you know but he didn't hit like Mike no no no no no I don't think no one hit like Mike if you look at like some of his early training how crazy he looks if you look at some of Mike's early training in his footwork it's almost like you know almost like martial arts-based mm-hmm the way that he attacked and then he shifts mm-hmm on his attack in his custom ah no custom ato was a master master yeah I wasn't until he switched up and got rid of Kevin Rooney and you know where the destruction starts out I think it was also his you know his life was just too crazy it was just two years he no one can manage that from the time of these 22 you know by the time he retired I mean it was probably just a whirlwind of chaos and it's crazy cuz he realizes that like looking back at it and he says that he doesn't train anymore because it awakens a beast and yeah because he said that to you too right yeah yeah yeah cuz that because I was watching you know your interview with them and one of our guys that was in the back seat asked him hey do you ever train do you ever you know he's like no I don't do that no yeah use every time I get on the treadmill and I do some running on the treadmill but that fit I would imagine it if he got back in training he get in shape real quick I'm sure it but you know it would awaken a beast yeah they're like you can't quit you can't quit he's like fuck you walk you around he just got up and left push that guy away he's like you're not feeling these punches he knew something was wrong well he knew oak was eyeball was broke too there is look they try to put the mouthpiece he put it in its Lou Duva yes Lou Duva but no it's not who's that guy looked like Lou do her for a second yes I mean you could tell his fucking face his bus is right there look fairly normal but I'm sure it felt like shit you know like it doesn't swell up real bad until later he listened you know if Andrew Golota you know who's been in wars and it you know with riddick bowe and other fighters like he he was a no slouch if he's telling you I've had enough of this shit as he knows yeah once they found out that his back was broken in his face was broken their product okay sorry yeah I mean they think about that his a corner guy was like trying to put his mouthpiece back up it's so stupid once a guy doesn't want to fight you can't make him fight more it's like he's ready flip that switch inside of his head you know what I told Mike that he didn't realize that this is the last thing because I know we both got to go but I said do you know that all the dudes you fought to get to that title including you know the dudes that you know that that you took titles from they all stopped fighting after you beat him none of them wanted to come back and get nothing they didn't want no part of that heavyweight title after that he retired so many boxers oh yeah he doesn't even realize that Seldon Tony Tubbs down the line all of them didn't retire Larry Holmes Larry Holmes wait until he went to jail and he's like I'm gonna come back yeah yep yeah that's the only guy Bonecrusher Smith yep yeah tyrell biggs biggs he definitely retired tell ya they were rivals at one point in time yeah he fucked Tyrell Biggs some pretty good Leon Spinks yeah yeah Michaels yeah you know what I had this title too long yeah enough check please and he told me just like I think you know what I didn't even really like that yeah man no I did he retired a lot of people said we all saw it there's a force of nature yeah and I told him the other thing I told him real quick too was you know like that explanation that he had on his documentary where he as he's come into the ring he knew he had the fight one yeah he could see it in their eyes and then once he steps into the ring he's a god they're done right and I told him you know how I was at that Bruce Seldon and I saw exactly what you explained in Bruce Seldon because Bruce Seldon was knocking fools out left and right he was like a really good heavyweight the minute he got in there with Mikey fanboy doubt tasted that glove didn't want no more yeah it was an experience it wasn't just that you were fighting a guy who knew how to fight but you were fighting Mike Tyson he was your idol he was this thing this cultural phenomenon he was thought to be at that time everybody was thinking he's the greatest heavyweight of all time does a destroyer yeah no one had an answer for him no you know Sal didn't sell then he pretty much you know he was a fan that was as an idol and he took he got totally got rocked he was so huge at the time that when Buster Douglas beat him even though I knew he beat him I watched the fight afterwards I couldn't believe it I'm like this is he's gonna get up yeah Brucella look out Jack Bruce Seldon was yeah he's a big boy man fucking tank yeah and he was he was knocking people now to me like 29 dockets and he was fighting good guys oh yeah cuz I'm WBA heavyweight champion yeah I mean I've followed his career to you know what I mean and yeah he totally found Boyd out on Mike man Mike well look at the staredown you seeming to stare down you looking at that yeah it's like oh no you made a tremendous mistake this mistake no yeah look how much bigger Seldon is do it he's a big boy bro it wasn't taken under that shit Tyson's footwork and his ability to close the distance bobbin and Weavin I mean it was like there was nobody before him like nah man don't never be another guy like that yeah as a heavyweight he was just so fast - because realistically the guys who trained him yes they had a certain technique and nobody uses it well I was not just that it was what Mike talked about in the podcast about being hypnotised yeah I mean from the time he was a little boy and you know the fact that he had nothing before that everything was his life was shit it was all pain and suffering and poverty and all sudden some guy comes along and rescues him and takes him teaches him out of box and then all sudden he gets recognition and positive feedback and he felt like he was something special boom he fucking hit that campus yeah yeah you don't want it I kind of forget sometimes what it was like watching those fights to go back and watch him now I mean there's there's amazing fighters right now like the like Terence Crawford who just won Saturday night amazing amazing boxers but what Mike was was something he was something completely different yeah he was something that like transcended sports yeah everybody wanted to see him fight you know if you believed in conspiracy theories right he didn't even hit it right there he just fell on purpose right if you believe in conspiracy theories right you think about it like this right Mike was knocking guys out in the first round and people were paying a whole lot of money for tickets and pay-per-view you know when you look at it it looks like they weren't trying to slow his roll and put in a guy like Evander Holyfield who was a brawler hmm he could box but he could brawl and take the fight 11 rounds and you know make it a fucking great pay-per-view where Mike would totally ruin the paper of you had knock your ass out in a minute and when you look at it the way boxing was for such a long time I wouldn't put it past it that you know a lot of the shit that happened to him was manipulated so that it would slow his roll what what what kind of shit I mean well you know the people that he had around him I mean you know certainly not hang around I mean he took all his his his people that he trusted away from him put different trainers in his corner different people that were influencing him and it just took him backwards a man and all the people that actually helped got him there were fucking gone and those were the guys that was actually giving him guidance as to you know how to conduct yourself be a man and all that stuff and he got around the vultures a man and they and to me I think Don King being Don King he stood more money he stood a chance to make more money with someone taking out the fight you know 11 to 12 rounds as opposed to one well he just he gave Mike the worst deals ever - yeah and the whole thing was terribly stole money from him to this day Mike hates him yeah that's all terrible anyway thank you my man thank you brother see you negotiate for sure I don't looking forward to it right now everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
