hello freak bitches now they're judging everything you say you you've had that before yeah I drink it a lot of unknown bars and you just start like well here's stories well my favorite Doug stories is with the fucking boxing match in Vegas and you were tackling and hold him down and fuck his face it'll destroy his confidence this is the prelims this is the prelims of this boxing listening audience you have to understand when you go to whatever is boxing or UFC the undercard no one's there they're all out getting drinks and waiting for the thing that they don't understand to happen that's at the end so it's dead silent bingo hall Church silence so you can heckle from the back row but Joe Rogan got a second rope so it's absolutely quiet and we're in there heckling let me take this Douglas doesn't do marijuana Joseph does marijuana Douglas does alcohol Joseph does marijuana Joseph's freaking out cuz Douglas is heckling and I'm on your ticket fucking you're the one who brought me and so I'm kind of your responsibility yeah try making him come that always knocks me out like a light wait till two seconds to go and say you just got punked five fights in a row with no one in the arena the boxers could hear you well no no he's being too too humble here he got a start getting laughs and that became a problem I think it was holding down and fuck his face that was the one that broke the waterfall that'll break his confidence let me tell you something about Doug Stanhope will heckle boxing when he starts the right way he doesn't just dive right into the holding down and fuck his face he starts with some like light jab yeah yeah and then he builds up kids more and more bizarre and then the gods are the whole look down and fuck his face but when he said hold him down and fuck his face I remember just hear people go oh shit well Don King showed up with some don't think I remember the Don King heckle but Don King showed up while you could still hear of my echoes and what was the name of his movie only can you I yelled something only in America can you fuck over somehow you had so much fun once but he was there and could hear every word I said I did a thought experiment a while back and I thought you know it's interesting cuz when I was when I was in college every one of my college buddies know me as Arnold they don't even know me as Mark they call me Arnold because when we were in college there was a TV show called Green Acres yeah and there was a pig on the show called arnold ziffel and i could eat more than anybody in in the in the college I went to including the football team and so people would call me arnold ziffel and so I became Arne's Arnie Arnold for most of my life just gets the amount of food out of food I could eat and did you have a contests or is this no but I did everybody know it's like you're gonna eat that dessert you're gonna eat those you gonna eat that steak you know I have that but I was running a hundred miles a week I was a skinny shit I weighed 30 pounds less than I weigh now but I just the throughput was was where it was and because I had a leaky gut probably a lot of it just went on your butt went right out of the butt so the thought experiment was that my whole life I was guilty of this like how much food can I eat and not gain weight and not be uncomfortable you know that's and I think a lot of people looked at ways like all right we're gonna go eat lunch how much food can I eat and and and not gain weight or how much of that cake or that pie can either whatever people I think tend to this is this is the what can I get away with part of it well what if you shifted that around and you said what's the least amount of food I can eat and maintain muscle mass and maintain energy and and not get sick and most importantly not be hungry and you find if you do this experiments pretty interesting if you become good at burning fat your appetite so self-regulates and so mitigates that you find yourself pushing a plate of food away after a couple of bites or not being hungry or eating just the right amount of food to to to get you through the day and a couple other people out they took a trip out of Japan I popped out there got out there January 3rd I was hanging out with this girl out there we go to this bar it's a nice bar in Japan called jbs jazz blues so also a lot of the bars out there the names of them in English are very on the nose it's a hip-hop Club alright it's club Harlem shit like that likes it I got the auto club to play solo let's call it evany like shit like really all right on the nose so we go to jazz blues so if you have it in Tokyo check it out is this it's a small bar I don't know the owner's name but it's full of vinyl records and you can just request he has all types of vinyl records is it a lot of Japanese people there were Americans who some Japanese people but it was a man in in Tokyo at this bar in Tokyo in Tokyo is some but not and like you don't see a lot but the bar but the bar itself it only holds 1015 it's a small spot 10 or 15 people if that yeah packed like tip 50 like it'll be praxis 20 something yeah it's this room maybe it's might as small in this room whoa bar they also had this area called the the golden guy which has a it's an area full of small bars that only hold four or five people that are smaller than this smaller than that place like super small places so at this bar the guy just know the collection is it's a wall full of vinyl and in his son behind it behind the bar also so you I was just saying he what you want to hear say uh let's do Stevie Wonder songs in the key life and he just walks right up to the spot me as long as it's Stevie but he just walks up to the a bunch of Records he'd even flipped through on another just do exactly just what he just meant folk grabbed it put it on that so we hanging out and it was just I'm with the girls half Japanese half white but she knew Japanese and English and she saw a friend there so they started talking in Japanese there's this white chick there that's super drunk like blush on her eyes is all fucked up and weird like she had that stereotypical like C looks central casting drunk you know I mean like C was going to an audition to be a drunk lady right after she was at the bar so they start talking in Japanese she talked to me a little bit I found out she lives in the same neighborhood that I do Williamsburg bro she starts they start talking to Japanese stuck you know what that sounded like nah she's just being played and then she says is this your wife I said no that's not my wife is that your wife I said no it's not my wife it's not your wife I was like why just ask me the same thing three times in a row cuz I just asked me I guess he was that faded talked her face turns and she's just I just see her getting upset she starts flipping out like fuck you you don't have to be disrespectful no fuck him he thinks cuz he's with a Japanese girl he's well like started you know you know it you think you're some cool comedian so then it was real that she knew I didn't I didn't tell her who I didn't save my job or anything so so she knew me she didn't soda so now she like is in a difference like she's a super upset fuck you you came all the way over here you doing and then she started getting raised she's like he's a monkey he's a monkey and you know this is Crimean called a monkey by a white woman from a Williamsburg in Tokyo right now what the cluck is why you should take pictures of her put it up all around Williamsburg this dummy have you seen I should I thought about starting to filming but it was just so weird that she for real all I did objectively I wasn't that face so I have
