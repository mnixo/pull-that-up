why is that I don't know it just feels when you it's when you say turn my shit up the engineers and the producers feel like oh shit this nigga just started shit up he's about to go in it gives you the impression that you're about to spit the hottest 16 of your life 16 with a 16 16 bars in a song like a I get in you don't know this no so nobody's ever come up to you say nobody's ever come up to you to say um let me get your 16 spits at six uh a hot 16 nobody's ever said and never in my life ever heard that expression you need to change the places you hang out cuz I'm pretty sure they're place you would have all the people all the black people you know all the rappers and nobody nobody nobody ever actually to spit no no never I've never spit have you ever practiced never come on yodel never I'm not lying over no you don't have any time you don't is that time for black people time for reps meet a rap I like listening but I've done zero right you like you like I don't know people got slowest loquacious no I don't have any time to so you limit my my what I try to do okay you don't have time for it I don't have time to do it I like listening okay this is the point I'm making about spitting if you listen to it there's probably a song that you like and there's never been a time in your life you've been in the mirror out of the shower that it felt good to you and you tried to spitting is the same as repeating that everything that the person said right so now one's not one song that you like you've never tried to sing a verse or a hook from that song I've definitely done that but no one's ever asked me to spit so if I actually what's your favorite rap song could you spit it would you be able to spit it I don't have to think about it my favorite would my favorite be I like old school shit like I like a lot of like Kool G Rap alright so like old shit yeah so you take all you go on that almost a Sugar Hill days for sure hip-hop nobody excited about it but if you remember that song you remember whenever song first came out and I'm know I'm dating myself you literally could get pussy if you knew every word to unwrap his delight I remember I was in junior high school and people were playing it in lunchroom on a record player not record players but it fixed yeah I remember thinking wow this is like a new kind of music it's a new kind of music not only the way you had to learn it like it wasn't like now you could skip through the time line into a song whatever you it was a cassette so it would play do you have to rewind it right back to that same spot he keep doing it he had to keep doing it till you learn to all the works but cassette players were fairly recent back then so that was like when Sugarhill came out was around the time cassette players were out well you could walk around and play the music you didn't need a record player you don't have recommend what people would do with those boombox you will record your favorite music from the radio from yes from your boom box yep yeah so you would have a nice little tape you have a nice table you think it's like all this shit is clear did you hear somebody say please get the fuck off the stove because it was right it was it was recording right in actual time remembering a lot of them had two decks so you could record other people's shit too yeah a lot of black people ahead of white dudes in the suburbs had double double deckers yeah we had to sing nobody else for nice because you get a friend and he had a cassette you could copy that cousin and you and then we would copy them we had coke in DC that was really big with go-go music go you know gogo shores go-go music it's like African funk jazz beat it's like is a lot of percussions what's a good go-go music artist rare essence that's a band a trouble funk is a band EU I'm old school so these were the biggest bands back then Danny had this band called junkyard band you know junkyard band the way they started was they was really they kind of like copied the cosmic you know cosmic cosmic show we had that too they was on radar radiators and stuff and these were guys will just take buckets and cardboard and card and cow bills and wood blocks and just basically get a beat but you didn't good sorry did you ever listen to when the brand New Heavies got together with a bunch of different rappers and the news is a very interesting album but their dislike I think there's only one that they put out but you could get it off of iTunes I think but like Kool G Rap did one a bunch of the a bunch of the guys did one but they did like they rapped over like different kind of music oh yeah yeah and it did get popular it was pretty popular back in the 90s I think what was it was it Aerosmith and um one DMC run DMC yeah that was a big moment that was some crazy shit yeah I mean you knew for being a black person we knew rap was going to next level wheels like this yo they fuck with the white boys now once you put that white boy vibe in here man it was like it was out that was the first time I had ever been done one of the things that we talked about recently I was saying like think about the number the sheer number of white rappers who have actually made it it's a tiny tiny number like it was a white rapper it was kid like if your kid was a white rapper and he's like dad I want to be a rapper yo because first you got to get them yeah but you gotta give him a lot of black friends first lot because they're gonna beat his ass down not physically but mentally mentally and that's the same thing the black community deal with I'm Eminem right right where Eminem first came out every black person that appreciated rap or lyrics or flow knew he was good but there was just wasn't gonna give him a pass it's like when you go into military you know they treat the new green person the Jeep's and they treat them like shit and that's what I deal with Eminem Eminem just kept coming coming with fire kept coming with fire to a point where I'm he he's respected as one of the best to ever do it by the way happy Veterans Day thank you I presume our veteran this is the funniest veteran probably on the planet Earth right across I appreciate it I appreciate that um probably the reason why I got out of the military was my sense of humor really yeah kept getting in trouble I kept getting in trouble I can't get a job to the point where this was what I used to hear almost every Monday airman and that was a position of attention airman Rollins your blatant disregard for established military policy shows a lack of military burn and integrity Wow everyday that's what they do when they give a give you an lor a letter of reprimand mm-hmm and it's like a thing that you put in your file eventually gonna stack all those things I've been trying to kick you out but when I was in military I got out I didn't get out dishonorably the only way you get out disarms believe if it's like doing wartime or something like that I got a I got an honorable discharge but I was that close to fuckin my whole life up if I would've stayed yeah yeah they was gonna kick me out I just was this was on joke time all the time I was on a job Channel when I when I left I was stationed in South Korea I left Kunsan Korea and I'm with the Bolling Air Force Base Washington DC and I'm from DC so I was they knew I was close to home and every Monday they would give me a random drug test every month like every Monday and 11 o'clock I would get randomly tested for drugs I always pass but I knew today thought something different I mean I knew it was time I did a four-year commitment for me for you enlistment and then I broke out what was like being in Korea for me I just I was when I went in I wouldn't air force I was 17 you know you when you underage your parents have to sign give you permission for you to go why are you going so early because the way my birthday felt felt some kind of way when I graduate I was I was only 17 and I didn't plan on Devon wasn't gonna go to college I didn't really have a trade-in therefore a lot of black people that's the alternative that's how you explore the world it's probably for some black people's the first time you have got on the airplane first time you've been off your block so it was a good it was a good transition from going to high school not not doing anything but I was just I was a little kid like when I went to Kunsan career like they didn't I didn't know that there was no drinking age over there when you're in the military over like a remote base they do what they give you rations for alcohol you can get four cases of beer or one case of beers equivalent to a fifth of liquor so you get four bottles of liquor two bars liquor two cases of beer but um when they told me how many how do you want to separate your rations I said I'm too young to drink this ain't no drinking age over here first time I ever went to a liquor store in on-base I ordered I got like four fifths of tequila mix Wow and you were 17 I was 17 I got four cuz I thought I didn't know what the fuck she liquor was in I have thought they was like you want to give me I'll call this as I oh I'm sorry it was just the fucking fruit flavored shit did you um add to it the mix mix it where that's how young I was now when when you when you get this ration of a case of beer or a month a month oh it's a month yes so 24 beers a month you get yep mmm but then people will hustle shit I'll be like this time all right I'll give you a case of beer it was almost like being in jail I gave you a case of beer four cartons cigarettes mmm you know and then people that didn't drink they were selling ranch and so as a way if you really had a problem there was a way to get around it I was scared of the military when I was a kid why because I thought it well first of all though I was thinking about joining because I didn't know what the fuck I was gonna do but you were thinking about joining to actually fight for your country or just no there was no war right back then but but there was a they had a Taekwondo team and join just beyond ot yeah yeah well I needed to figure out a way to make a living while I was competing right you know when I was a kid when I'm throughout high school and into my 20s that's all I did was do fight and Taekwondo tournaments it was my sense there was a dude named clay barber he was a national high-level highly ranked guy he was like 2 or 3 in the world 2 or 3 in the country and he was an army guy he had a job in the army and he was on the army Taekwondo team the army had a team and I remember thinking oh well maybe that's the move like to join yeah especially if they knew you were you were nice because that's what I deal with I mean that was a case with some guys that couldn't um pursue a NBA career mm-hmm you know they knew you were like extra talented in certain field they would they would put you in it just like you wouldn't have to do the normal stuff you'll just been traveling the world just beating the shit out of people yeah well you remember Ray Mercer yeah Ray Mercer started in the army yeah that's that's when he won a gold medal he I believe he was in the army just before that we won the gold medal which heavily fighter joined the army after he was a Riddick boat Riddick Bowe joined the Marines because he was trying to get some discipline man that was the dumbest he was struggling look man there's a reality about getting hit Ned right and nobody wants to talk about it until it's too late most of the time but to get hit our branch of service you start making bad decisions and for him he decided that he needed discipline cuz Riddick we used to blow up and his he had a problem with discipline had a problem with like conditioning you know when he get in condition when he be disciplined he was a motherfucker like those Holyfield right but then he would have fights where he just came in and he was just not in quite good enough shape and he would fall apart because of that and I think he had decided the way to get real discipline was join the Marines that's interesting to me because I'm pretty sure when he joined he wasn't like probably pressed for cash I don't think it was a pressed for cash thing man I think he wanted to disappoint he just wanted to figure out how to maybe felt like if they just whipped him into shape he would you would get past that hump because when you're a guy who's a multi-millionaire in your world champion and you're still lazy yeah like fuck what what do I have to do let a white man yell at you my black man you know a lot of black drone so that would be that would be so fun to fucked up Riddick Bowe is in your squadron or whatever you yell at him and you notice one person just kill your ass man saying like it's always got to be something separate like this guy can yell at me so much cuz nothing you can do about it really probably could have fucked up after people that he was enlisted with a hundred percent of the people not half did it change anything no he quit he got out quick they let him go I mean he was only in for a short period of time yeah but like I said I think I think a lot of that has to do with just trauma brain trauma making terrible decisions it's it's a big factor man it's a big factor and if you listen to Riddick now he has a real hard time talking it's real rough to hear it so many of those are boxers when they get out of the ring I think sugar red linen out of all the ones is still out like publicly and doing things he's probably one that I can listen to and you can understand nothing like this his faculties are off too much not too much but somewhat he's definitely struggling you could hear him he's there's a pause to the way he talks that is noticeable like he can keep it together and he can string together good senses but I mean you don't get over those Wars and he had with Roberto Duran and Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler yeah what that was a welterweight division mm-hmm that division at that time was so far and then sugar eight people fucking hate him so much because he was so pretty yeah he was so nice looking and I said you like put a scar his mother fuckas face that's how Duran felt about him yeah he beat you as an take your girl in the same fucking fight man he was so good - so good yeah but then he's like another one who stuck around too long Hector Comacho stopped him and Terry Norris stopped him and later in his career man he was getting fucked up it just was wrong he shouldn't have been fighting it seems like when I look at like boxing stuff like then people can have like unblemished record but it feels like I feel like they'll never quit until it's almost like you got to get knocked out the ring or somebody you have to give you the reason to quit well Andre Ward did you know and I was just talking to him real recently because they offered him a rematch with canet war fight rather with Canelo Alvarez because Canelo just knocked out Sergey Kovalev in the light heavyweight title and they said look this is a big super fight you know Andre Ward came out of retirement still in his prime it's like 35 years old he's like no thank you no thank you a hundred percent undefeated Olympic gold medalist - division world champion he said I'm good I'm good but no he said he's like I have money I have a family and this is his wise words he said I'm a better asset to boxing if I'm retired I'm a better asset to boxing as an example of what's possible that you can do all this and come out with a hundred percent of your faculties in black you talked to that guy he's a hundred percent there and he's making money as a commentator and analyst he's got a great career he made money he's good he's like I'm good yeah I don't want to lose my brain and and everybody is different ways to do interesting thing to me as wishes and no toys as Mike Tyson used to be and probably still is it's just something that makes me feel good knowing that this mother fuck is funny and I know this may sound crazy but he's like a lovable my yes very low you know like lovable high as a kite although what I would make that would make you lovable well that's what he said it makes him a better person like we talked about he's like he was like I think it makes me a better person it does matter he's nice he's a nice guy to be around somebody just posted a came back that that interview when he was promoting his a one-man show hmm and he was sitting down on a couch with his black guy and the black guy was trying to oh shit shit yeah man I had so much fuckin respect for Mike Tyson for doing it because people always use the excuse I'm the media ya know this is a question the people want to know that's not the questions people wanna know that's the questions you want to know and that's the shit you want to say to provoke somebody exact to turn it to a motherfuckin piece well he didn't want to promote him he wanted me to make him feel bad yeah make him feel bad yeah and I'm and I'm pretty sure you don't go like your PR person we don't go ahead we try to promote this Brandon somebody put him up to it but when he just looked at something like your piece of shit yeah and it was realized he's like 6 feet away from one of the baddest motherfucker that's ever married I started shaking where is the tape of what happened fucking listen that is what it is that guy was a piece of shit that was nasty he tried to fuck with him on TV corner him and you know and and have a gotcha moment and did he try to flip it and go back to it right was like no I'm already pissed no no you are a piece of shit yeah identifying a piece of shit and distinguishing extinction shit imagine being him and sitting across from that guy and the guys all friendly with you up until that moment and then when the lights are on the cameras going and then he pulls that shit on you a lot of people don't know what to do there he knew what to do he went real on him I mean he probably probably felt that it could come up but like maybe even like yo your brother don't do it to me you know what was he Busey promoting back then that was promoting the one-man show the one-man show yeah I'm just what was it unjust undisputed yeah and I was a good show I watched it on I think was HBO Showtime well I watched the documentary the documentary is incredible documentary is incredible yeah but it's just so good to know that like from heaven as much fame and fortunate yeah and basically to start over and reinvent yourself and now me I guess he's gonna be just generations how George Foreman yeah in a lot of ways right yeah well George for him reinventing himself while he was fucking people up though yeah George Foreman came back a preacher I remember when he came back he was 36 years old he had a big belly he was huge he was like 300 pounds and people thought it was a joke like this comebacks a joke right meanwhile I kept losing weight kept beating people up kept losing weight and then when he fucked up Gerry Cooney everybody was like hey wait about how but wait a minute he's legit but he still looked like a fucking regular dude no not quite I mean he drowned he had like a barrel chest but he had these giant fucking arms and that dude has canned hams for fists he has some of the biggest fish in every accident he does he hits wing axes and all of his kids name was George his daughter you thought his daughter like George really no ya did good he did really good who doesn't have a goddamn George Foreman grill that's a great grill yep when you're like a single guy and you need to cook something quick College military bottom chicken cutlets and you get grill marks women are pres no matter if you live in a a hundred square foot dorm room if you got grill marks oh I see you got grill marks this motherfuckers gourmet gourmet grill marks know it's a good way to cook it's easy easy - in his clean do you do elk George Foreman grill that's like sacrilege really yeah I really was expecting just a slice of some elk dude you gotta come over come over and I'll cook something at my house I want to do it I would be happy to cook for you good guy no you're a good cook - no don't that's not what you know cuz you talk shit to be not a good cook I didn't talk she no yes you did Joe did I say I said I said I want a piece of elk I think that's what I said you said well you know for a new guy this is the best way to do it for your first time and if you new to cooking you said some shit like that both and I new to cooking wild game it's different it's there's no fat in it it dries out really quick you got to cook it low and slow you can't cook it like you cook a beef steak I could cook it away I want to cook I'm sure you could yeah I know you can cook the way you do it you got very offended that you haven't cooked elk before I wasn't saying you never cooked before I don't have no knowledge whether or not you are so hot give me a piece of elk I got a hundred pieces back there yeah you get everything for you alright give me a piece of elk and I'm gonna do my elk magic to it and I'm gonna let you know that's without you telling me how you gotta cook it slow okay and if I want to do that I could use I could do it the what is that thing to seviche what is that on okay sue V V that's watch it oh that's that's a great way to see now I don't want a different level right yeah I love it that's if it feels like you're doing some type of science project I know right you know you gotta have a temperature right make sure the app is right do you see this big-ass bucket of water and then you keep putting your finger and it like is don't feel like it's hot enough this shit and the weird thing is you're cooking in a plastic bag that feels fucked up - yeah it almost feels like you like a dope dealer doing that shit a little bit you got to have a food processor not a food processor but you have a vacuum sealer a vac a food saver and you gotta have a thermometer and you got to do it take time but it's kind of fun no it's great you know you can cook a steak for like five hours at 130 degrees god damn that thing will just melt and you're good for eggs - it's good for everything su v--'s great I love it but you got to be in that sous vide mode because I value like man fuck this man do you blowtorch the outside how do you finish it what do you braise it in this like I don't want to see it yeah yeah cuz you still gotta get that crisp but the texture everything's good and I would think that would be something really really good for like four Wow oh yeah yeah yeah a lot of people use it if you ever cooked any wild game before no no wild pig is great that way - Suvi and or or barbecue so what's the big difference it was to notice what difference the taste of it or the texture of everything the taste the texture it's a firmer meat it's the texture is it's like an athlete I mean you're eating like a fucking thing that can run up hills so different than a cow cows are just sitting around eating they don't use those muscles very much and so that's why it's all mushy so it's down there and okay so it's more it's more tough but it's not too tough especially like I'll give you good cuts like like a tri-tip is nice you know or backstraps the best so it'd be good for roasting - that's what oh yeah I got some roast back there yeah and I roasted it like 250 degrees then i sear it on the outside after it's done see you gotta keep telling me your process bro you could do it I do alright that's the most competitive people always dude I'm not in the competition with you true but I've been training for eight months to not be in a competition yeah that's true everything is competition healthy competition competition that's right there's two guns yeah yeah but uh I'm I love you know who was a really good cook Ralphie May that motherfucker could cook yeah but he went to a stomach stapling operation and he couldn't eat meat for a while I think he just blew through staples after a while just gave up he did a couple times two staples yeah they had to redo it yeah yeah Ralph you like to eat I wonder what sandwich he was eating to me sad to be uh that's a subway footlong you get back to eight inches you blue you blue plastic just like whenever a famous person dies from coke you know they're like oh this is a coke that killed that dude you know like who's that dude you play for the Delta Isis go who's the do to play for the Celtics who died of a heart attack Lenny bias yes yes I remember everybody man shit that killed Len Bias people wanted to sell it to you they was calling shit the debye yes yes that was such a tragic story because I'm from the DC area you know he was like a cool guy and didn't especially like when somebody especially in the black community if you got generations and generations of projects and welfare and everything if one person busts through it's like a whole bunch of motherfuckers and it's unfortunate sometime because that's kind of to downfall for a lot of people finances but you feel like I got the whole family and everybody gets excited if for him not even to ever play a game yeah it was it's this awful man well there's so many people dropping dead now from fentanyl you know so many like print that's the white person drug no it's not Prince died of it also that's what I was doctors prescribe yeah well it was well it's it's pain medication like Prince had hip issues from all the dancing but uh you know Tom Petty died from it a lot of people I think David Bowie died from it did he die from it too to David Bowie died from fentanyl it kills a shitload of people a lot of times they get it in something else and they don't know they get it in Mali or they get it in in Coke like Artie Lange was telling me that he accidentally had it in coke and he even know it until he took suboxone and he was sick for like a week right yeah it's um I don't know too much about it cancer yeah why don't I think yeah duh he definitely didn't die from a drug peacefully after a battle with cancer oh wow okay maybe I'm confusing him with somebody else must be George Michael maybe maybe that's it but doesn't make any sense yeah yeah I don't know too much about fentanyl's and oxycottons and all that types you know that's like soccer mom drugs hmm well those are painkillers it's like a lot of times it's the people start off they get a back injury you know you get hurt on the job or did go lifting weights or something like that you pull your back out like ah the doctor hooks you up with some oxycontin and you can't get off that I did the only time I did I did um I had surgery on my knee I took my patella trying to dunk on an 8 foot basketball room trying to impress some kids and you know I was like oh man I'm not taking no painkillers fuck that I'll just have a a wooden spoon in my mouth I'm a man up man I laid down that first fucking night in that fucking blood started hitting that wound I was screaming for the oxycontin I took that shit I was blamed I was I could finally realize the Leary's and most of these trap songs when I was hopeless so I'm like this is what designer was saying all room enough and a panda panda I really thought was like dishes great I can't see our people I mean I can't see because I've never been addicted to anything like that but it's just weird to did to see people get one being a state of mind all you know I think it's a lot a lot of the people were sexually abused or physically abused and they just there's a thing about heroin they say I've never tried it but I've done morphine when I was a when I had knee surgery they gave me a drip while I was in the hospital a little button you pressed anytime you want you get hit it and I was like so was yeah you hit it bang give you a little drip of morphine anytime you want bang bang bang bang you could hit it but I think for a lot of people that get addicted to it at least has it's been explained to me there a lot of them are suffering from physical abuse sexual abuse and there's a thing about morphine or heroin that gives you like a womb feeling like you're protected you're safe everything's okay that's a parent's supposed to make you feel like that yeah like a hug like the world hugging I did um I played a heroin addict on HBO's a corner years ago oh yeah you know I was trying to figure out like what how do I get my mind set to be high right right I was like what could they because you see those heroin addicts yeah they'd like they leaned in a nodding to come back up and I'm like what could they possibly be thinking about to take him into this world and I in in the way I've related to I was like they're probably thinking about it takes them to a place when they were feeling younger it just takes them away from the real real world and just feel like like zombies they just floating you know yeah just floated in like that umbilical cord fluid embryonic fluid just in the womb just with no we're note with no thought but that's a tragic it is tragic joke well sometimes people just feel so overwhelmed by life you know so overwhelmed by pressure and stress and bills and relationships and jobs and this and that and this it's needed escape everybody need escape everybody has problems few people the biggest thing now people talking about like the biggest thing in the news everywhere mental illness yeah mental health is real it's real it's been here forever but people just cope with it you know like I know in my community they say black people especially like don't address mental issues you know I'm saying it's like a black person they have a problem the way I just need to I need to shine ass you know I mean I need I need some unis I need to smoke a joint I need to do a line right you know right but everybody has mental issues but how do we cope with it yeah people have different coping mechanisms there's no way you're gonna get through this life without some mental struggle there's no way no way it's not possible because if you just sit around and do nothing you'd be filled with a it can't do that just because of the world address so much there's too much shit going on everybody's got struggles there's no way around it no way around yeah and a person don't have struggle dumb motherfuckers probably that close to being suicidal mm-hmm you don't say people have died it are the ones that go first I think a strong community is important you know I having a lot of people around you that you love you know family friends like that's that's important to people that you could talk to like fit well you feel loved I think one of the real problems with people that that just just it doesn't feel fixable when they feel alone they feel like them by themselves yeah yeah yeah they don't feel like they're there in like a group they don't feel like they're in a community don't they just feel like nobody gives a fuck about them whether they live or die and that's one of the saddest feelings I think you could have how could you make somebody feel I did that is awful to make someone but then those same people probably have don't have that one person you can find in that one person there's not gonna bullshit him the one person doesn't want anything right if you don't have anyone in your life you don't have anybody that's telling you the truth or lying you know this and there's a lot of people out there that are real lonely that only exist on the internet you know an internet is the the Internet is the most fabricated lonely place in the world and it's so it's it's interesting because it's like like especially what we do is like you feel like you need it but after a while you should have just so fucking overwhelming yeah and it's so easy for a person to carve out the perfect life people to tell you like oh my god I thought you was having so much fun on vacation this and that you know how fucking many takes it takes to get that perfect picture to show everybody that your life is the fucking bomb yeah it's just a not it's not an accurate representative of anybody's life and is everywhere and that's where everybody wants to show their last I said I've did you tell average chicken right I won't say on the street but just the average one if you tell them that I want to take you on a vacation anywhere in the world you want to go but you can't bring a phone you know what have they let me think about that because nobody wants to have a memory and share memory just from the memory they have right it's like they wanted to get validated want people to get the thumbs up and everything and nobody you even would to show your shows where I was so weird like when I first started doing those shows where they lock your phones up I was like the first comic going on stage and the first comic going onstage in front of a room with everybody phones locked up they get in the heat the fuck man I've seen people trying to bite them shit so I see people cut them motherfuckers open I seen motherfucker answer answer try to answer the food paper and it feels weird at the beginning after Wow he gets to a point where it feels kind of cool it's like you feel like you're in a moment you connected you're connected who fuck wants to watch the show how can you enjoy a show like this yeah well there's a lot of people doing that too you know why I realized that when I went to Comedy Works in Denver they were the first place I ever went to that locked up phones now The Improv does it they do it every show yeah it's the way to do it man you know I wish people would just put their phones away but they don't want to they want everything everything has to be recorded and everything and you gotta always show people what you're doing every second well they want to see a picture on stage right now I want to see somebody with an Instagram just looks at your fucked up life see see how many likes you get for your life beer everything Bologna cheese for dinner shit on the carpet again fire not the fucking oh my god best live yacht life living my best life yeah but it's it's that thrill of you know showing everybody that you're killing it you know yeah that's why a lot of people try to do well they do try to do well to show people are doing well oh yeah everything is for the gram weird that's what minutes like you and but then on the other side of it you want people to see you doing good things people want people want to follow your momentum yeah and people want to ride with your journey you let me say that to many others like you you promise that to me people like like can live a social media free life and still make money doing real hard Dave does it yeah he's one of the only people that I know that does but he's so intelligent about that kind of shit he doesn't engage in that he doesn't engage in other people's opinions of him he's like he used my phone does he he don't use it so should me whatever he want to see through my phone he checks it out through you oh my mother fuckers addicted to worldstar Izzie yeah we'd be on the road man we'd be on a vote and all you see is always a shit somebody know about he's on worldstar that's a laugh but anything that's dealing with pop culture and stuff like that are you I'm usually like they did like the gods it brings him into a but does he just keep no fault no apps on his phone I don't think I don't think he has app good for him yeah good for him it's a good I lost a phone the other day man and I was saying to myself I was freaking out because you know if you lose a fucking for the minute you do the pocket check mm-hmm you do like all four pockets in first thing you say is fuck right and if you're the worst thing is a person that's going when you're going out with a group of people and a person lose the phone just ruined the whole fucking night yeah because then you gotta go fuckin search for it all right back be quiet call my phone right call my phone could y'all be quiet cuz ya'll call my phone cuz ya'll call and I told myself I was like fuck cuz I'm I got the UM iCloud and shit now so it's not as fucking tragic as it used to be like where's your phone you losing which is in your kid being born and all this and I lost the phone and I was like fuck I just lost my 4 months ago I lost the fucking phone I was like you know what Daniel you can't let your phone fucking regulate your life like that you a person be on that phone I went to sleep right now this sleep was it was so peaceful and I woke up in the first thing I want to know was what time it was right and I don't even think they look at a watch or anything I was like where the fuck is my phone and I went right back and got a phone I did 10 hours out of phone I was about to go crazy how do people fucking do

around Asia went to like he went to Vietnam yeah but he was already loaded yeah yeah yeah you don't just you just have like a minimum-wage job but just leave you know for four months no you kind of can't now but what's crazy is this is a real recent thing our smartphones are only since 2000 and what Jaime 7 2007 was the iPhone I think so right cuz X iPhone X is 10 years that was two years ago so 2007 was the iPhone before that is like flip phones and not everybody had him you know and and then ten years before that nobody had 1997 there was no waiting Adam it was a way for everybody because we look at it as a phone but nobody uses it uses it for the phone feature know unless you're old like only people who leave voice messages of people over 45 but Joey Diaz calls you that's one thing he's over he likes to call but he likes to talk it goes I'm insecure he goes I want to know what the fuck your voice sounds like because I want to call you wanna hate I want to hear your heart yo

Miocic steel pick red you gotta love it and then if this is after he just fucking dismantle the Rubies always now like I mean how to fuck him ugh into my next joke thank you I can just segue that right into my shit uh Cho Asus he's a national treasure there's nobody like you in there never be anybody like him no you got certain people get that you know and I'm not wishing bad anything on Java that just live forever I mean you hear stories oh yeah for them forever and then you have stories this is what I respect you know as long as you have people don't con me for years and years right but a lot of them don't stay sharp right you know I'm saying they don't do spots yeah you know I'm saying the only time they come out as like okay I'll talk to my account is time to go out and make it come a million and get it but they're not out there and that's one of the things that I really respect about him is that you see somebody that's been ripping not like a year their whole career and still you could feel the passion you don't say yes you could feel you know you know calm easygoing and I call them money comics yeah so was that going in looking at a watch okay I get the light at 40 give me quicker like let me get my money to get out of here yeah you can tell people that really still enjoy the engagement of the audience the response they get and they they enjoy getting better yes they enjoy ripping the stage up for the next person to have to rip the stage up they really enjoy that the the skill set and what it takes to be a great STEMI and that Joey is one of the people that you're not some people you could just watch him yeah you know I mean even if you know something here is gonna come on you just you it's going to be something some nuance that they do to make it different from the last time well Joey does - is he gets in the pit he gets in there with you know 15 comics on a you know Tuesday night that's that's big man those spots are big when it's you doing 15 and another do 15 and there's some and no one's there to see you there did you see the whole show right and you're you're there working with guys like you guys like crystally uh guys whoever it's just jam but I did comic but that's what makes me that's what makes motherfuckers funny yes yes motherfuckers you you see you see a group of wack comics like birds of a feather flock together you don't saying you only learn it if you around a wack comic all the time you never test it yes you know saying you know those you never see those nights with people everybody is bombing yes everybody's bomb is so bad they're motherfuckers have a have a bomb material ready they just need to get into the bomb yeah you know they just be what all you need is one like oh oh oh here's my bomb they're my my bomb shows but they don't well fuckers don't go hard right they don't go hard anymore man where's like that in this bus the Comedy Store motherfuckers go hard some people don't you know some people also they get to a certain point where they have an an audience and then they just work for that audience yeah and they know the people gonna come see them because the people like them and so they don't they don't do any of workout sets they only do sets when they're on the road that's why I do when I go whenever I go like I came up through the chitlin circuit whenever I'm in Brooklyn and I fly through Philly you know on the black cautery circuit everybody has these rooms you don't saying and as much as we get big well people say they don't do anymore I like to dawn because it just really knows I really know the climate and I know what I'm working with yeah you know I I love doing rooms those those rooms like the rooms like that they challenge you because is taking you out like you say your comfort zone yeah you know I've been blessed enough lately to when I go do my con yourselves and people buy a ticket from me issues these some good people but every once in a while I want to go in a chant I want to go in the hooded spot ever and see if I still got it yeah you know that expression don't forget what got you to the dance yeah yeah I mean that's it it's like what made you a great comic in the first places is being tested like that defining moments motherfuckers do not want to deal with a defining moment yeah motherfuckers I want to deal with that moment where you did 45 minutes you gassed out and you get that stretch sign they say stretch we don't have to checks up whatever we need to do another 15 minutes that test your skill a defining moment when you're working out what is that don't we did Tacoma Dome Tacoma Dome and motherfucker Joe Rogan just comes and just bazooka torches the whole motherfucking arena shit I never said I don't know if I've ever shared that story but that fucking day was so dope for me when we did that because that fucking place was fired and I know that was your crowd your energy like like Joe Joe Joe and just to be in that room I remember he was on stage and I was kind of getting my head together like yeah I'm gonna get my shit ready and you gotta laugh right it was like and I was a whole shit I'm about to go on I thought it was like you saying good night and it was a segue into another joke I immediately smoked a cigarette Oh cigarette or what I was kaho you better do some push-ups motherfucker this today gonna be easy sir but that was a fucking that was a that was a great moment there was a great moment was good there's a lot of fun there was a lecture I've never been it felt like I was um if fuckin one don't you see UFC fights and shit man for so many people there's 25,000 people in that place and Dave is about to go on stage and he looked at me he goes not a whole lot of motherfuckers get to do shit like this just the way that hold Nightwind and i we were right behind him like the night was just like it's something when you say okay it just it's a level did it's another level did it's another level then it's another level and then when he came out man it felt like when we walked it feel like we was walking on Tyson yeah into the ring yeah that song if you know you know that I'm Pusha T song and it was just like that night was like I mean pandemonium it was amazing and those nights the funny thing about it people see that and they see you in front of 24,000 25,000 people but what people don't understand is those those all those nights stacked up of doing 15 minutes here working on shit because people see you do these arenas these amphitheaters they don't know that you in the trenches always you know I'm saying always done I'm like damn don't just think I got enough money right now how's that waiting man hey but not about the money and it's all about is just something very addictive about constantly training to be prepared for anything and to be better my ladies something like you going out you you going out tonight I don't know if women understand they call it going out you know right I like Morgan I'm gonna work out and even if I'm if I said I'm working on and do the same thing it's just something that's just such a rush about going on stage even if you find something small a small attack mm-hmm cuz a joke never ends you just now telling it yep yeah it never ends it stop tell me some people like you know where did you get that from because you know the comedies comedians mindset people like write that down write that down we don't always write it down just thinking about how dope we would be if we vote everything down but it goes to a hard drive he goes to a hard drive and you might have thought of something funny like this year the next year you might have never talked about it the next year something to happen and then to come up from the hard jab boom you got a banging ass fronting bit yeah you never know and if you don't go on stage you won't that won't blossom you got a water those seeds I was in um I was in fucking them Pleasanton please' California over the weekend at the Tommy T's and this is a young young guy he's a fan of yours wants to do Kai me and I know his mom about four years I put him on stage and he didn't really do well the first time he went on stage right and then I appreciate that and then like he tells me he wants to do comedy right tell me when I do comedy I was like okay do a guess but I call it a bubble that's how you test a motherfucker they be like yeah I want to do this I've been writing I've been working on my material and everything okay go on about opera no I gotta wait because I got a no motherfucker you don't gotta wait and I told him I like to get a lot I said I'm a comedian Kimmy don't talk to me about comedy no fucking more right because that's the opportunity go do it go do it right now yeah and then he still was not talking I was like maybe this is not for you he said well you know what maybe I needed this talk I was like you don't need to talk for me motherfucker you need to talk with yourself either you gonna do it or you're not gonna do it he'd never been on stage before ever no he'd been on before he plays around with it every once in a while but it was a it was a filled room you know I'm saying yeah can I just you know I just don't know how things something could be that intimidating I don't know how you could want to be a comic you want to be a comic but you don't want to do the most important thing a comment has to do and go on stage it's scary for people especially if it's a packed crowd they know they're there to see you so there's he a pro and they know their materials kind of whack they know it sucks yeah but you still should try it I mean how much time was gonna do five minutes that's a Kevin Smith lead oh that's my dog doctor I'm from the movie Jay lollipop yeah that's his JimBob we with the UM with the uh with the cartoon on the inside of it yeah yeah I went to the premiere I was in that film I went to the fucker for me I know dude yeah he's so dope he's a great guy he is the best man he's a I worked with him on something couple years ago and he said he was a fan any keep fuckin calling for projects but he's so fucking cool when we were doing cuz people been on when we did a show called Holly weed right we played we were we owned a dispensary in Hollywood it was a funny as pilot and it was part of this rivet TV they had this process where a lot of you know you people do pilots that never get greenlit they lay the pilot and then you you pledge if you want to get the pilot to green-light okay copy fell apart the fucking on the show did well we got Snoop Dogg retweeted people were enjoying it and and it just it just stopped we just started but he was so fucking cool and we did Holly we reset and I talked to me he said Donnell I'm at a point in my life I'm at a stage in my life where I'm not gonna do anything unless it's fun is what I want to do yeah and that joint was posted here we didn't get a palpable it was a good time man and he filled me up in on chainsaw about reboots you know him pre weed a new oven pre weed I met him pre weed and then the second or third time we hung out he started smoking weed really I was like what's going on what what was that after he had a heart attack no no no no way before he just went hard with weed like out of nowhere he was like no weed and then all weed yeah creative people can get oh and I know his strand is like a hybrid sateen yeah but it was just interesting to know him before when he wasn't smoking and then I mean he's just he's all day hi I'm good he's all day hi yeah he's one of those dudes he's one of those like Wiz Khalifa type dudes those uh it didn't just just start pounding out right and shit yeah we were we were working on Holly we we got up to three other scripts and I would just go up there and just chill and I'm like I can't believe I'm chilling with Kevin Smith and smoking a joint and we're just talking in the motherfucking and the goddamn keyboard is just going crazy yeah yeah he's a genuine person very very good person yep and then shit man he said off he did things nobody ever diamond just to create a brand that could last for fucking 2025 an independent filmmaker and did you ever see that movie red state that he did didn't you ever see it was one of his best movies as a weird man it was so strange because he didn't tell me anything about it because I just want you to see it so we sat down we watched it and it was a horror movie it's like it's a horror suspense thriller movie it's not funny at all doesn't try to be funny at all but did he tell you that it didn't tell me shit uh-uh he literally didn't tell me anything but I'm assuming it's a Kevin Smith movie I'm assuming it's gonna be fun you know but you know what they've got many people like that you know somewhere deep down sided like I want to do something fucking different right people know me from yeah you know yeah yeah yeah for sure but once you get to something you get into a groove and getting a brand that you known for something you make money of why would you you know a lot of times why would you roll the dice I think he's just a creative guy he just likes doing a thing like he I just thought his head to do this kind of movie you know who else did that Bobcat Goldthwait he made a Bigfoot movie man like a scary ass Blair Witch Bigfoot movie do you know but you know the history with him the history with him Bobcat what in what way with Chappelle show no I don't he was the first talking of the first season of the Chappelle show when I did New York boobs I ran into him yeah I ran into him and Dave and then when you is so weird cuz you know him is crazy dude right and just to see his demeanor away from that you just wait for him to have an outburst but Bobcat was the first season director of Chappelle's Show he's a very thoughtful guy I like him a lot and a funny thing with him with me he well he he liked me but he said my name wrong every time he says he said where's Durrell where's Dontae yo where where's Daniel let's do two I was like fourth when I was like just got to be racist he just named everything with a deed that was my name but he was um he was the first director of the Chappelle show before rusty kind of took over what is that movie he made Jamie what is it called again Willow Creek is it Willow Creek yeah I think it's Willow Creek it's fucking good man I got a check he's obsessed with Bigfoot Bobcat believes in Bigfoot really all in I think or it's like a long jewelry type bill he's so smart it might be a scam I think I think he's telling the truth though I think it really is obsessed with big I knew he was a good actor when I knew he was a good actor when I talked to him I'm not being a character from police academy cuz that you know you got too many cards do you ever see that when you see their face you want to hear a certain voice right yeah he had a hard time with that when he started doing stand-up really yeah he started doing stand-up again you know he had done that Bobcat character forever and we start directing stuff remember me he lit Jay Leno's couch on fire Oh what he's on tonight shall we let the fucking couch on fire Yoshi you for whatever man he used to do interviews and just blaze it yeah he was great never seen anybody the only person I'm Robin Williams used to do interviews like that right yeah Bobcat so he was a wild man but he says thoughtful person like when you actually talked to him like hillocks I mean he's got sort of an explanation that makes sense he just wanted to be a little wild and he didn't realize what a big deal it was gonna be coz he heard it yeah yeah he murdered that but he's um he does a lot of different shit when he was doing stand-up again he wanted to just be himself and there was a time where they were they wanted him yeah they wanted that Bobcat character that's a tough thing to pull away from especially if it's like you know if it's how you paying your bills you know I assure you it's like we who we gonna get the crazy dude that's got to be a tough not a people can pull yourself out a lot of people can't reinvent themselves like that right like if you're Gallagher like everybody expects fruit if say I'm just gonna talk now PK like come on bro but we wanted to talk in the fruit y'all right people like that have weird weird crazy fetishes and shit it's like the heath fucks with watermelons of dinner he likes looking at naked goats and shit something something something crazy of you that Wow but Gallagher are you gonna see Gallagher anytime you see Gallagher you gonna think watermelon off for the rest of your life yeah you're gonna think sledgehammer you're gonna think everybody's covered in plastic remember I remember that one we that that we're not I hate to keep but you just said it when when I was with Chapelle show and I used to pitch ideas and um they used to just throw my ideas like get that shit out of here Neal using I used to pitch ideas here and then a guy gonna come down here to do go come and just somebody gonna have a had one right they're gonna come and they're gonna shoot him again he used to be like this he's to smack that shit out of it he was like do that shit ten years ago son like my shit was so dated and I couldn't think of anything one day I was watching Comedy Central and Gallagher is on and for some reason Gallagher looked like Dave Chappelle to me and I think a day like skateboards and shit I've seen his skates and I just said and of course I was mother I said what if Gallagher was black I was like what if Gallagher was I just said what if Gallagher was black that was my pitch line I said what if Gallagher was black right and did not called Neal Brennan and I said I got a DS here what son I said black Gallagher and bam Wow I forgot about this character yep black Gallagher did you were on without a doubt the greatest sketch show in the history of the world I mean it lasted only a little while but those are the the classic sketches there's some great sketches it doesn't put anybody's down I mean obviously Saturday Night Live has been around forever they had a lot of great sketches but it's hard to beat the black KKK dude it's hard to beat that it's like it's hard to beat they don't know where as an all-time sketch I don't know what thought process you got to have to even yeah was when that sketches going on you're watching go on yo whoa it felt like when that sketch trapped bro when that sketch drop when I say when I sketched JA I was like oh shit it was just like what are we talking about it's like one of the funniest things that's ever been captured on film when Neil's head explodes yo great idea it's just such a great idea a blind black KKK member and he just runs around figures like a whitish shit oh and that she still stays in fuckin pop culture it's just one of those things it's gonna be Clayton Bigsby forever forever there's a bunch of those his Rick James was one of the greatest sketches of all time I remember we were on when we were doing the wrap arounds then when you show the sketch to the audience and they played the Rick James sketch and every time we played it the room just exploded I mean just exploded like wow oh my god yeah it was it was you knew something different you never know why no one ever knew that it would go to the extent that it went but you just knew something was big in that moment - there was a moment where like people would just yell out I'm rich bitch there was just yelling out and shows people just yell it out yeah I just kept yelling it out I'm ranch pants there's like something they wanted to say they had to say it did that show had an impact a crazy impact if you really stop and think about it did it's amazing that someone somehow or another through whatever didn't keep that going I don't know what happened I don't even but god damn how do you not keep that going just back off yeah back off and film it and just let him do it what happened here how did you fuck that up let's how did use it how'd you fuck that's how I felt when he did SNL a couple years ago you know I was like it's like that show us pastors and everybody's doing different things you know I mean but the show was so the show was just so iconic it's hard to forget about it but it was like when we did SNL when he did Walking Dead spoof mmm when he did Jamie did you see that sketch he did the walk indeed did a spoof for The Walking Dead I didn't see this oh my god and this is a recent thing oh this was a snow you want to Emmy for this this was SNL a few years ago when this scene right here man I was saying myself this shit is like because I hadn't seen him perform as a character actor since Chappelle's Show hmm and he fucking body just the beginning of this shit is ridiculous it was funny as shit that won an Emmy for like their you know I have a little special category like special like a commie special not the not the premiere um Emmys but the you know yeah that's that's a crazy scene to spoof - right that was a terror that season yeah and the walking dead but he did it that's like one of the most brutal scenes in all of television if you really stop and think about it like I couldn't believe what they showed like when they first episode out - of like the season right right I think so they killed off two or three people the one dude who they what was his name - Glenn that they kept hitting in the head and you can see his eyeball pop out I'm like what do we watch that gory shit I didn't fuck with it after that I was like I don't know yeah but he made that shit funny it was a funny shit yeah until it was any glimpse of what would be men killed that brought that back it was well you know I mean again when you talk about all-time sketches yes it was fun man any how many episodes did it do all total I don't know what would whatever two and a half years be I don't know I would say probably 50 episodes maybe if that 50 more was it that many it was a lot and another part not even the sketches the music did the music mmm that would be a fucking dope ass fucking show just to show the guests young Kanye common merica buy do everybody used to stop food what a crazy fucking show yep do you think he's happier doing that or he's happier doing stand-up I think stand-up you know he shares the similar personalities just similar personality you share that shit did Joey Diaz shit that want to be on stage want to perform as a stand-up mmm you don't mean like I don't think I can't speak from I don't think isn't I don't think it's important for him to be on TV I think is important for him to be the best comedian he could be right you know you know you know how you feel when you think you walk working at the top of your game you just hope everybody acknowledges at the same time I think also too you know he did it and now you know now it doesn't have anybody to answer to you know he did it the show's done he did it still in my opinion I think it's a great sketch comedy show of all time and then the do two things like it's hard not to talk about him because you know he's what some people consider the greatest to ever do it you know I'm saying then you have a relationship with that person you know you're not exploiting it but is this interesting you know like I've seen his career go to the point where and this is why I say the last specially Diaz sticks and stones was so important for comedy because critics and a couple of people were dictating the tone of comedy and people ii get some people second-guessing themselves right you know I mean I've heard I was hearing comedians like well I want to say this but I don't feel comfortable I'm like what the fuck is happening you got to say what you want to say right you know and there was a um there was a comic I won't mention their name but they wrote a critical article about Dave and sticks and stones and if they mean I found interesting it was that they wrote a crit they were a comedian and writing a critical article which is all fucked up right out the gate and I feel of you as a comedian if you don't know what specials like sticks the stone special and like would be a birth special what they do for the voice of comedy is saying this is what we do that's it stop yeah you know well it seems like the expectations cultural expectations of how we shouldn't shouldn't talk about things they're shifting so quickly and people like demand compliance for you to you know behave a certain way but our profession we can't come this is not a professor to comply it no no don't do that it's also like this move towards compliance I don't I mean I think we should just be all nicer to each other I think this compliance is like something that people because they think they're right they think they're gonna enforce their ID on people but it's like the worst way to talk to people nice nice nice just be nice muffled I tell you this Joe you've probably had this why oh why it's because I'm gay no it's because you're an asshole no it has nothing to do about who dick you suck any of that is because you're an asshole you take the asshole out of anything yes asshole could be in anything it could be a gay it could be in white it could be anything take the answer and you said it yo just what is so hard Joe about being nice what so hard we could be better at it but yet I'll see you you're nice to me I try to be real nice to everybody yeah yeah I've never felt like you're nice you know yeah that's all we got to do is be nice I think people's disagreements are far less than they we think they are I think we get caught up in in in this there's a fucking team thing that happens with people and we're seeing in this country right now when it comes to like ideology are you on the right are you on the left just you know and it's just so it's a weird time there's a be nice yeah be nice be nice be nice whatever sigh you own yes just fuck it be nice yeah you don't gotta be we're all nasty about shit we're all Americans too I mean it seems like we've gotten worse instead of better at like the two sides talking to each other man I was at on a function in DC and I was Jeff breelan it's one of Donald Trump's right-hand he's in that camp and then there was another guy I met he was a White House correspondent right and I'm in this party and I'm talking both sides right and I'm understanding both sides you don't say I'm just yeah I understand yeah I'm having a drink right I'm doing the shot we I'm doing a shot with him I understand it and even though your size differ you don't have to be nasty yeah be nice like you say be fucking nice I think people have gotten teased weird positions of just constantly interacting with people in negative ways it's like patterns confrontation yeah and then we think that you know this is a country divided I don't think it's as divided as everybody thinks it is I think the problem is people divide us you know you a guy who's your guy and your guy gets voted in and you know you get excited about it and you go against the people who they're a good woman or their guy didn't get voted in and you have this little conflict with each other and it's a stupid conflict it's a stupid compliment because it's just dangerous because you're basing it on a team thing and if the problem is having a fucking president in the first place having government in the first place you seem like we need it but the problem is having anybody that's got control like that aim one person of extreme power it doesn't make any sense it doesn't seem like it should be a thing anymore it seems like a thing we should have figured out was a problem a long fucking time ago do but I don't think we would be in a place where we feel like somebody with that power is abusing it and that's oh yes and that's what's so interesting now because like there's no way to deny some of the things that Donald Trump have done for America some of the things he's done for the black community it's on paper and everything it's on paper you can see that when it stats is the lowest unemployment whatever but jobs always been here is just if a motherfucker want to go get a job or not do you understand that like how does how does someone increase jobs do they provide government jobs or do they open up avenues for businesses make it easier for businesses to succeed I think it's business businesses I think you gotta create a certain mindset right but I mean if someone says like we added jobs I wonder oh how how you make that direct connection there policies I think that I think you inspired you can I think you can inspire your movement of jobs where jobs are always you could be like like I don't know like little language like hey we've been hiring we're starting to hire down at the coal mine or whatever you don't say well you can inspire people to get jobs that are already there one of the things I really hate is that almost everybody feels like they have to get into these ideological arguments right now because we got to do a strange president such a polarizing president this what I understand about motherfuckers when it come to trump how y'all motherfuckers still let me um make you mad like like yo I'm telling you sometimes I wake up I'm on seeing it I'm like okay we get it you know I'm saying like come on man yeah the other thing is I mean I don't understand how people are keep getting mad about the same shit you know a person's character you know how you think they feel about them and you continue to let them make you mad like they can make you upset it makes no sense well everybody knew who he was before we got in there - it's like everybody knew he was but buddy doing good things economically I don't I don't know that could be an argument I don't understand it that could be an argument that he could win cuz he got the numbers right it's the argument he could win how does that work though the way told this I know I sound like a moron to anybody understands economics but I've always heard that there's basically patterns that they can almost predict where the economies rise and fall and a lot of it is based on policies they enact but a lot of it is based on just things you know have like natural cycles to them almost right and sometimes it has to sometimes shit is on the way up because of things that a president did and then this new president catches the wave like you always hear that right but that was the case and that's the case with that's the case that's the case with and it shifted to trump and everything then you know Trump won you won fair scare however you want to feel about it you know I mean the um the motherfucker won but people getting upset people getting angry because somebody chose to vote for somebody that's the that's the dumbest shit ever who read my lifetime it seems like this is the most most polarizing people are versus Trump supporters or not supporters it's the most polarizing you know you're either with them or you're not you know it's like there's a culture battle but you don't got to be angry about your battle no you don't have to be angry most of us are wasting a lot of fuckin energy man if you can't correct it if you don't know what the next Superman is gonna be just shut the fuck up about it you know I'm saying like you keep boiling man it's like you keep on you keep on just find out who is going to be Mayor Bloomberg said man he looked he looked at the feeling say fuck none of these motherfuckers can be Trump I may have to run yeah he he might jump in it and he's a data he's a numbers guy yeah you know like if you're not gonna like like it's just senseless to continue to be mad it's just so weird right now people are saying people want to take away people's guns and people saying they'll fight to keep their guns like what are we talking about here man I don't even know a lot of my friends don't even know the argument of guns because when we see a gun is never in a place where it's a gun law dude I said the first time I went to Ohio bruh and I was going to department stores and shit and they had signs outside to say no guns allowed right they had signs like no smoking like no guns and I'm saying to myself wait a minute motherfuckers have guns where you have to tell them not to bring them in here there's a lot of guns out there there's certain places we have like Arizona I think everybody open carry state that's always gonna be scary to me that is Wow well shit hmm I bet that cuts down on road rage though cuts down on everything that's the thing is that okay though are you happy with this crazy arm society where everybody's nice because everybody's got a gun on them at all times I mean just don't pop the shot that shit I wish we didn't need that I wish people were just nice yeah and I don't even know if that's really needed as much as you have the right to do you you know some people just they love to exercise their right to bear arms you have the right to bear arms because you don't have to bear arm something you know of guns they love them they can't wait to shoot them bang bang bang can't wait to fix them they want to polish them and clean them and they want to add new ones their collection and bang bang bang they were good at using them and they just what it just Oh some of them are lovely people they're really nice people it's not a knock against them I get it I could see myself getting really into guns well that's a problem not not really but it's it's they're fun okay go into a range and shoot at metal targets is fun and it's it's something where it could conceivably in this life it's it's possible and it's happen to other people where you had to save your life right unjustly a gun that's real but it's people don't want to they want to deny that yeah much rather if that was not true I would much rather that but it seems to be true that sometimes people do break into people's houses and sometimes those people defend themselves I wish nobody broken anybody's fucking house I really do and I wish nobody had to shoot anybody that broke into their house I really do but we can't deny that that's a thing and we can't deny that people have saved their lives with guns because some of them we can't deny also debt I know this sounds crazy too and this is how black people look at guns a lot of black people have lost their lives to guns and they've lost their lives to guns with people of authority you don't saying so when it comes to guns with black people I can't speak for everybody but that's a really strong place where to distress in the whole system of a gun for a black person that to feel I mean total sense you know I'm saying I even even even with cases now I'm not trying to get radical thing we have in the conversation even in cases where there's a young black man that had a license and was legit by law he could carry a gun and he's still at the end of the day was the victim of what people can consider to be an overzealous police officer unqualified police officer or untrained police officer but that's how that's how a lot of black people see guns and the other side of black people see guns as they use it to commit crimes themselves you know but it's when you when you talk about gun like even when you're saying you're talking about you talking about in a way the people know the NRA they know gun laws have the motherfuckers in these different states don't even know that how easy it is to be able to have a gun hmm Dave Chappelle said it was a funny joke it means a lot he said you really want to change the GALT gun laws have every black person in Ohio Ohio register to have a gun and see how quick the gun laws would change then you see all these things with guns they'd be like well we got to do something about this shit man that's the only way I can see you can effectively change it but it's different different arguments on the whole thought of guns with different people you know I see both sides I want to be able to protect myself yeah I'm sure but then you gotta ask yourself what environment are you living in where you have to actually I'm just trying where where where where you have to actually protect yourself and where you live where there's a chance that you could be in a parking lot and you're Walmart cart bumps the car and next thing you know it's a shootout that's a mindset that is a mindset that's the mindset damn shootouts or that means preparing for shootouts Jesus Christ I always have a scenario always a shootout scenario no but everybody would agree wouldn't it be better if we just didn't do that yeah watch people didn't ever put themselves in a position where you were gonna have to shoot them that goes back to what you said early you know had to be nice yeah just be nice yeah I don't want to be honest I don't want to be in a situation where someone had to think about shooting me exactly I know where those places are that's the problem with being nice right there's places where people are stuck in these crime ridden environments and doesn't seem like there's any way out that's what the problem is being nicer so you think they got a can to survive yeah get out or you can't go there and you can go to it sometimes but after a while you have to UM you have to show people another side you know you got to show people another side you have to you know people can you said it before people make excuses but eventually you got to say to yourself what can I really do to change the cycle yeah and you got to work at it what do you think anybody could do to change the cycle like when you see impoverished neighborhoods that are same way from the 1970s as there are 2019 how do you fix that yes sir it's a tough thing to fix I think you have data that people have to see other images people have to see other images you could brainwash people with advertisement you know you people have to see other images they have to see they have to see other things you have to show them something that they don't you gotta show them success some examples of those people that have made it they've really got to really care and get involved they got to be around they got to be able to see something different cuz most most kids in the inner-city whatever they dream about it they dream about it and then when a couple make through when a couple people do good we don't put the energy into supporting them and recreating them we put the energy into other stupid shit opposed to actually honoring this a person that broke through a politician yeah yeah I mean and and and and in and get with them and dig in the kids have to see that you have to see this as possible as possible yeah how to see as possible yeah people need to think that they've got hope and that's if you're in a spot where you're stuck in a crime ridden community that's probably the worst place you could be as a young person in this country it's tough some people make it out of it a lot of people don't some people make it out of it a lot of people don't but how how often is that addressed when they talk about like if someone talks about running for government no one says anybody ever had a real feasible idea how to fix that how to like take all these impoverished in inner-city communities we know have been crime ridden for decades and stop it how do you stop it what do you do what but what's the plan how do you go in there how much money would it take how much money would it take to take all of the take one city Detroit impoverished communities in Detroit and bring it up how what would you have to do how would you have to fix this how would you have to have community centers how much would it cost to have counseling and guidance and a positive community like foster a positive community with people that are like professional like psychologists and healthcare workers and andanddan doctors and people that can talk to kids and tell them about potential careers and things that they can do and it just weighs out and then foster them in the community programs that can get them tutoring to give them a little bit of a bump before they can go to college so if all these different things that just don't test it a lot of it don't exist but it's got to start it it's got to start at home it has to run at home it has to it has to because you can make all the plans to programs you want somebody has enforcement that they have to enforce it a teacher can have the best lesson plan and the best curriculum of ever of she couldn't teach her a year whatever you don't saying but what if she was she's teaching and what she's trying to get them to understand if it's not reinforced at home did it goes nowhere right you know and it's like the I don't even know how do you address the mindset of a parents or some people aren't supposed to be parents but that's where everything starts yeah well everything starts I think some people it's a cycle right some people had parents that were unqualified to have them and then they became unqualified to have their own parents and whether or not the shooter shouldn't be responsible we could all agree they should be responsible they're not those kids a lot of times the ones that get fucked over in life they get a bad start yeah but if if there was some way some way through some sort of a community program to ensure that these kids always had a place that felt like a community felt like family they can go there it's safe there's always got somebody somebody there they can handle them and take care of that man motherfuckers gotta get rid of mentality of fucking their own shit up man that's one thing they fucked their own shit up sometime man like everything you're saying like Nipsey Hussle the rabbit had passed away um that was well respected hip hop all of all across the board he was an example of everything that you're saying he was an example of how to fix it he was an example of everything that you said he was doing getting people up on their finances he had a realty company out of the UM the marathon clothing shopping mall he had he employed people that came out of prisons people that didn't have a fair shake in life you don't saying he donated to the community he had kids and videos he was doing everything he was trying to explain to people how important is to have business by property if you know where his store was a train line was gonna come in soon so all the property he brought around he knew how much was going to be worth then he tried to pass that knowledge on to a lot of people he passed it on through his music he passed on how he lived his life he passed on by his associations he gave everything he didn't leave the fucking hood he stayed in the hood he built his name in the hood he came from a place where people's comparing him to Snoop Dogg right out the gate he snooped out buy buy buy he had to beat through that shit he's selling his own shit he record his own he's doing his own shit he won't leave the fucking hood he's letting people see his life he's letting people see his motherfucking life and with all that said in his parking lot in his hood another nigga shot him too and that's fucked up that's type of shit make me be frustrated about being black sometime goddamn nigga and then you wonder why people say this about you our community needs to check motherfuckers and get garbage and rodents and roaches like that motherfucker out of here as much as we trying to figure out the problem as much as we could put a million people in the fucking right okaythis blah blah man if motherfuckers don't stop fucking the own shit up you nobody ever gonna fucking care what's the biggest place in the world that we've tried to rebuild the city was like Iraq I mean but have they really tried to rebuild Iraq and what did they do once we took over I know very little about how much money has really been pumped in I know it's been an extraordinary amount but how much money do you think it's been pumped into like Iraq if you had a guess so I there was that protest going on there last week I thought we Pleasant be pulling out of Iraq we pulled out of Chicago I was dirty but I just took the more deaths in Chicago they're always more definite and muhfuckas needs man that's the part of the point I'm making man it's the whole mindset that was a part of my point was like what if they just cut that money in half whatever they're doing over there and just put it all in industry put it all in places like Detroit Chicago any place that's overrun with crime and violence if they put the kind of money but didn't they put in other country I didn't yeah they do but but I think America things like just okay what is my investment what is my investment they'll give it up but what do they get out of return they get more successful people more successful people contribute more to the society it's better for everybody the more successful people we have of work community we all agree the United States is a community for our community we'd be better served all of us would be if more people were successful if more we're doing well there'd be more money for the economy that makes sense yeah it's possible there's a drain when people aren't doing as well Denese education yes it's education it's inspiration it's people showing you guiding you people showing you the steps that you can take people that have done those steps themselves there's a lot of people out there they know yeah I figured and it's a movement man cuz like a couple of my friends I'm DJ envy and Ceaser they enemies on radio C's is a real estate guy and they've been out like really trying to educate people on the importance of creating generational wealth yeah you know real estate and just being a different being a different person you know I think we all need Mentors we all need mentors we need someone who understands what what it is we're talking about to sort of help us and guide us through - comics we are silent mentors to each other a lot of it because like you you'll ask a guy had you set that up like what why did you switch it that way oh they saw it coming this way I mean this way they don't see it coming so those conversations it's so interesting you say that with dementia one of my mentors named fat dr. he's out of watch in DC it's a great name fat fat doctor in the 80s fat doctors was dopey shit Joe you know like in for like back then like he was a black comic there was mainstream he do the black rooms and he do white rooms Richard Pryor said it was one of his favorite comedians and fat dr. um he was a reason sigh he was because he's not really doing good right now you know like is you know health wise yeah and he was he was that mentor to me he was that mentor to Martin Lawrence he was that mentor to Tony woods he's one of those guys that like if you know DC you know fat daddy every comic has some piece of fat dr. song with whether is being that mother fucker they can work a black room in a white room whether it's being that dude that can fucking just demolish a fucking room everybody had a piece of him why you know and he's not doing well you know but I'm just giving him a shot a beautiful I'm sorry here and shout out to Tony woods I haven't heard that name in a little bit don't love that guy he's a funny guy yeah he said she did a writer put him in a New York Times talked about his lineage 2dc commie and PP work with everything and Tony's one of those do is it you know if you mentioned a certain city or something like oh de troit or DC you like Tony woods right right right and all those guys yeah yeah Tony woods funny funny funny comic man I always remember watching him in New York he's I was that funny for years I was surprised that more people don't know who he is like when I talked to comics you know even comics might not even know he did a lot of stuff he got you know with whatever we do you know we got to go what money is that think I blot of a part of his career was like that his money was overseas he's very overseas so you know you gotta you got to get your cash where you can get he's an elite motherfucker though his comedies always top-notch yeah always yeah he's got a smooth style to men like a very unique style of dude that was um ship one of Chappelle's mentors when he came up yeah we all have to have those right yeah like for me in Boston a lot of it was Lenny Clarke who I'm still friends with this is the there was these guys who were these uh Boston killers you know that would headline that Knicks comedy stomp and all those comedy club stitches and all this place really there was there was like the Mount Rushmore of Boston comedy right they were nice to everybody they told us what to do like hey you got to write more hey you got to stop saying so much you say fuck too much kid you broke the fuck meter I got the fuck meter yeah the fuck meter like they would tell you like if you say fuck all the time it doesn't mean anything it doesn't what if you say it when you need it bang yeah it's like what the fuck boom it means something now cuz you know you only said it once and they would tell you you know about like with what's a hack premise like you might think you thought of that yourself but a hundred other comics also of thought of us and what makes you different what makes you different what makes you different that's how fat doctor was he's did he took me through the trenches okay I was funny yeah you're funny but you curse too much did I stop cursing you curse him but you only got five minutes and I have ten minutes you got ten minutes but you can't do clean you can't it was like they were always gonna have something yeah contested but I know fat doctor he always used to say no matter what do in this game and we all have problems he said when you go on stage you put the problem to the side you do your show and then you pick it back up when you're ready to leave you always gotta pick it back up yeah but I wish you well and I hope he does he gets better yeah I wish him well too is he's shit online can I see his stuff is on YouTube yeah he probably got something deep down in you too deep down in YouTube but he's one of those guys that we knew for years we all have mentors there's no I mean even guys who just you watch them fabulous fat doctor there's even guys that you uh you know you don't even know them well but you watch them all the time like if you work at the store you know you get to see like just some that go up over and over and over again tighten up your shit like even if you don't know him well like you kind of if you're a young comic working the door you're kind of getting mentored just watch the box tweak his act and change your heart like how mom used to watch fat dr. Martin used to what that was his mentor before Monday's star says they were like they were like really cool and and and fat doctor took him on his wing just like you took a lot of us on his wing and tell you a little jokes those little things that help you in fact I think when I'm Martin first had brought the um got to show Martin fat dogs ah he I think he wrote in a couple of episodes to some of the worst bombings I've ever had in my life had a fall Martin in the 90s oh man I can't imagine Martin I was I was terrible and he was on fire nothing was hotter nothing nothing nothing I remember I remember I remember I was in DC I was in the bed with this chick and we're watching HBO whatever and this one HBO specials were HBO specials right and it was a HBO special they said give it up Martin Lawrence and Martin Lawrence came out there I don't know if I said this he said when you give it up for a brother making money the right way when you making money the right way you could tell your lady shit like shut the fuck up he said shit shut up to she be like oh you so crazy man let me tell you something I was in the bed I stood up I like this I said who the fuck is that motherfucker yo I was like and he came out like you know he came out like when specials was like specials was really special like if they came once a year yeah twice a year yeah and then it was usually with some big HBO production you knew it was coming out post you know mm-hmm he said you could tell you ladies shit like shut the fuck up and she be like you so crazy it was like boom and it was off to the fucking races that's who inspired you that's what that that inspired me that made me and then I saw him at the comedy connection a dream it was a little small spot in Greenbelt this was where we all started I saw him there live this is a little piece of shop they make it to a comedy room it only holds like 110 people and I was in the fucking front row like this bro I was like this and Martin was on fire and I was watching I was like this naked saying all this shit I want to say you know I'm like I'm like I was like he just says regular shit and it's funny like he just saying some regular shit some everyday shit and it's just funny and I was like this man I want to do this shit Wow yep I was like I would like it out and I wouldn't even I was fucking around and open bullshit open mind just heckling and I said I want to do this shit and I was Martin Martin fucking used to tear rooms up he used to destroy it was terrifying he's on to I'm on tour with him next year really eight what is it AEG AEG the tour enjoy hmm they tell a shit I did it's called elitist fuck lit is fucked or Martin Lawrence is the host of the lit is foul that's great that's enough oh yeah they they denounced it recently and I'm gonna do some dates coming up I'm excited just to be a dude from DC that's like buck Alicia he's one of the rare leather suit guys right he's war you know everybody wear leather look at that first check you gotta put some metal on yes that was the fucking outfit full leather punch or leather that must have been so sweaty not only that but I'm just I mean think of it that like you gotta ask yourself what the fuck was he figured but he was in the moment he was in a moment without a doubt you so motherfucking that shit that was amazing so that was around the time when he was coming to Comedy Store to work out of shit oh yeah and I was going on yeah oh yes death I know that rooms those had to be people just get up like 90% of people would get up to say you so crazy was like there was that was when it comes to like like hashtags and shit yeah and phrases you so crazy probably would fucking go against our rich bitch back in the 90s yeah probably hashtags back then and nothing was funny at in mud right I don't TV no he just had this energy man and he played different characters yeah he was now I was dating this girl I had to break up with because she said Martin Lawrence's corny I was like bitch I said look I just does not go to work I was like there was nothing else to talk about like it's a wrap what the fuck are you talking about yep I was like nah that's over especially in the 90s I'm telling you I got to watch it live it was one of those things where he was on fire he was just in his own cousin Marky's think about it think about it um you know some comics are hot there's one thing we know they're hot and didn't need like they got a hot TV show yep you know I mean like it's like hot movies yeah it's like just pop in man yeah I mean I can imagine and did come and Will Smith it's coming out you did doing what's the third one yeah I mean he's doing a action fuckin movie - with me yeah what's he did what's he did a TV show he did it he's all he did it fucking action movie with Will Smith he's doing comedy specials and I'm telling you like it was for me as a kid you know who started in Boston I'd only been doing comedy for six years by the time I was out here already right and when I was out here and I'm working at the store and six years in and I got to go on after Martin and I gotta watch him though just feel it to be in the room watching a legit comedy superstar you know six years in like watching I'm like I'm watching him all the time I wanted some 10 15 shows just murder man it's just a Razors Edge I had you feel how did you feel going how did you handle it going out terrified terrified just ate shit most the time shit shit pretty much every time I went on after him you couldn't transfer the energy they didn't want to hear didn't wanna get he was so good he was so good yo the funny figures were you do that shit like I go some places with Dave and like he'll get on stage it did a whole crowd and just leave the fucking stage I mean leave the room I fucking this has to be over now that's funny yep yeah man I mean nobody starts out great if you you had to go back from the jump I swear to God you never had a dull spot let me tell you it was bad it was I was five mid-month sin that's amazing I came through I just was like I had already been just practicing my whole fucking little jokes just right yeah and all I had to do is figure out a way to make that into a bit but no I hit that shit it doesn't seem like it's an art form but it definitely is because when someone talks shit to somebody really well and everybody's like yeah we're all laughing like if you can do that to a roomful of guys this is like five guys sitting around talking chat and one guy says something that's so ruthless that all of us are on the floor dying that's it that is stand-up comedy you just doing stand-up comedy for five guys you just need a different platform and so I tell it E is so weird because I'll meet people and I'm like you should do comedy like oh I bet you tell it no you know a certain energy you could tell certain energy like you know what certain people you see and you're like you know what I would love to see you try it one time yeah yeah you don't say I know exactly you don't mean like no I'm not saying this is a career anything but if you ever thought about it why not fucking you never know yeah you do never know it's I encouraged too many people to do too many things I encourage everybody to start a podcast I encourage everybody to do stand-up I do it all the time and I people get mad at me going you should encourage everybody to do it but if you try it you might be good at it like it's not a special talent in the sense that like if you look if you can't run fast you're not gonna win a track-and-field he's not he's just not the almost anybody who thinks they're funny who loves comedies got a sense of humor and is smart can at least make some attempts at stand-up and I think if you can just get a little bit of traction get going a little bit you can get better everybody's got a different pace your pace was faster because you had been talking shit your whole life right but other guys like we're more silent and introverted it took them a little while to make it their thing going but if they can do it even if they do it they gotta keep doing it yes you gotta keep you can't just like just you know like that guy my friend it's the grind some people can't grind I started I started I you know I didn't start my podcast start started but I'll record it one today Wow by myself it's half 44 minutes do you just do a Bill burr style the reason why the reason why I did it because I didn't want you to talk shit to him I was like this I was like this is motherfucker got a knockout punch so listen you're so good you're so good on podcast for you to not have a podcast as an atrocity but I did it for for ID this is the first time in my life I talked for 45 minutes with nobody else but myself perfect this is the first time I ever did that it's easy for you you could stay in his room for three hours and just go I'm Way better off with people but you can do it like you you could go to distance you could just do whatever but it's a thing that you get better at doing that's all it is it's like everything else I could be being on a pot like doing podcast is the thing that gets you you get better at being on a podcast you get better at doing it I think I have fun yeah it's um but I knew I couldn't go in here listen I know I couldn't come in here but now I'll show you the time I knew it was the year Sonny was like five months ago so every time I see you I just wanted to say what's up like stretch it out and shit he's like what's up with that podcast I'm like man I tried skipper something you know my son has a birthday yeah that's cool everybody has a birthday what's up with that podcast this which is what I say this is whatever and I really mean it everybody like the one of the reasons why I encourage every comic to do it because if you just put some energy into it you have a thing that's all you and if it's successful it's all you it's you it's like you and you don't have to worry about getting fired you know what to worry about it people being mad at you it's you I know it's bullying yeah but me not used to talking to himself but you could talk to a friend I don't I couldn't I didn't have a friend than Sonny I'm your you don't want to talk to you on yours first all right and then we can come and do mine second day I do one today how about we do one today I just did one okay I just did when I got 44 minutes okay I did one and I'm gonna tell you it started off I don't know I was honest listen I want you to critique and say okay you got a critique you say okay I just I think you just kind of put him out I have the first ones aren't your favorite ones it doesn't matter but that made me i'ma tell you I felt I was excited cuz you wouldn't be to talk shit to me I was I was like fuck that fuck this shit I was excited he was about to get on podcast and I decided that I got 44 minutes of me talking that's beautiful and this is a start I'm telling the truth yeah if you go back and listen to the early bird once who would do it on a phone he would like to make a phone call to a place and like it would be him on the phone it wasn't even like a recorder on his phone like if this builders first ones he was doing way back before there was like an app on your phone that you could record on yeah talking shit about people at the airport just talking shit about this guy look at this fucking guy you're a fucking master at it man I'm 100% should have a podcast 44 minutes well more people do it the more comics do it the more it empowers

said that all right we're in it's moving the train is on the tracks to to the little engine do you have been reading this book about the Wild West holy shit but it's an audiobook I say I'm reading but I'm really lying I'm listening I'm listening I always do Empire the summer moon holy shit holy shit is it good it's terrifying Empire the wet empire of the summer moon it's about the wars between the settlers and Native Americans and I'm in like it's track for whatever that means I guess that's chapter four and holy fuck is it horrific some of the things that happened to these people mads you like gory like no it's not that it's the history of the United States I'm fascinated by what what happened with these tribes and when these these white settlers showed up and I'm fascinated by what the tribes were doing before the settlers showed up too and there's they detail a lot of that too it talks about the Comanche about what happened when the Comanche got horses and they they just really started getting really good at raising horses and they had way more horses than anybody and they slowly dominated it's fascinating stuff man I mean this isn't that long ago that these folks were riding horses dominating landscape with bows and arrows and Spears and hunting Buffalo and cooking them over fire and now it's fucking amazing their life was I'm it is like like sort of a fairy tale movie type shit of like Avatar people but this is how these a lot of these folks lift me and it's savage to like that the murders when it talks about the murders and murdering murdering settlers and babies all kinds of crazy shit like if you can't handle that don't read it but few not really listening to it son you're right you listen so I listen to it yeah is that better than reading it it says I can do it in my car I'm always driving around I mean I try to read but I don't read as much as I do listen I listen way more than ever you gotta go on the beach or something where you flip the page I might have to check that out I will check that out how bold is it to buy a house on the beach in 2019 how bold is it to say you know what I think everything is gonna stay exactly the way it is look at scientists don't know jack-shit like if you buy a house in Santa Monica or something where you're on those stilts right over the water it's gonna go soon what are the odds how long do they have odds on what parts of the shoreline get a rate eroded completely over the next 10 years what are the odds I'm pretty sure somebody knows that though well somebody's predicting a plaintiff or it'd be my people are still buying those fucking houses imagine trying to unload them putting the water starts rising it's like oh we're 12 degrees I listen what are they gonna do maybe they really gotta lose all those houses or do they get to push back maybe they get to push back push to push me to push the highway back a little bit knocks the houses back a little bit pick them up back up before the ocean comes not take that Elden rebuild man take the El this is a real cockroach no that's a tarantula walk yeah tarantulas Hawk tarantula hawk is there something no my friend was on the podcast talking to me about it and he has a farm and who's telling me about these fucking things they land on tarantulas and fucked them up and lay their eggs in a tarantula it's dark shit but hey and they look they're enormous looking and he was just describing how big it was and I was like what and so then I get a package and it's one of these motherfuckers show him a picture of it we put picture of it in a day just kinda do of one fight okay but that is what it's that is an actual real dead one and he has them around his vineyards do you know the band tool also he likes them there well he likes them there to kill it I think they're all apart and I don't think they'd want to kill tarantulas I think everything's apart it's all part of the ecosystem there the only thing you want to get rid of his stuff that fucks up your crops look the size of these things I mean they're they're goddamn enormous I mean if I could describe this how big is this for people that are just listening is if it's straightened out it's a good solid three inches when you say when you say it's three inches I think they have to half the size of it sir I don't want to hear any small dick jokes I was a cockroach two inches at least a small cockroach it's hard to tell because it's curved folks cuz it's dehydrated and dead and it's curled up in a ball but I feel like if you straighten that fucker out it'd be four inches that's a big bitch that's a big cockroach it's a big bit that's alarmingly large cockroach so we're looking at some shit from the Animal Planet what is this what we're looking at Jamie is this one Bob laying the eggs in the tarantula nature so ruthless man man this is gross but that's what was so fascinating about that book when they're detailing the lives of the Comanche cuz they were brutal brutal I mean but so also like they were living like yeah in the 1700s they were living in this way in the 1800s they live in this way that uh it's incomprehensible for people from Europe is it a series or anything only a book it's just a book I'm someone my friend the Jackalope on Instagram he's a hunter s Thompson that sounds like something theists series it seems like it should be someone if they did like a real accurate account of these settlers trying to travel across the country and what happened to them what happened to the Native Americans and the war with the the soldiers and the all the treaties that were broken and all the horrible horrific shit that happened to them but it's just it's just all that aside which you can never ignore all that aside it's fascinating just to think of how they were living their lives just riding around on a horse his spear and buffalo that was there a fire they didn't gross shit they didn't have baskets they weren't doing pottery they weren't they were just eating meat over fire making bows and arrows and fucking things up and dominating the West but it probably still had the same problems as everybody else they certainly had problems they probably had the same problems as everybody else it's just crazy to listen to the depictions of how they tortured the enemy and who it's hardcore but it's just to me when when you hear what's you know a well researched accurate account of something that happened in our past it's it always makes me think like it's hard to even believe that life was any different even though we know it was in 1600 and 1500 was hard for you think about it can't even think about what it would be like to live a bow and arrow I was in Sandy last week you may have some type of exhibit going on and it's do we had like some real bow and arrows like so long as like American ones Nate and I've almost stepped and I just looked at I was like god damn you know you think about the man and if you could build a tool like that he was the shit in the trial back then if you could build a good a good boat and and practice that shit or something wonder when the bow was invented when did people first start fucking each other up with bows let's guess you know the Mongols had it that was in the 1200 s because and that was like this was no gauges anything he's just like something that bit was a bow yeah well sometimes I mean some of them they were really skillfully made and they got really good with their arrows too and they got really good with the the right size and the right kind of wood so they would weigh like a similar amount and there was an art to teaching people how to shoot the bows and arrows but God they were so crude in comparison to what people have today but it was the shit it was the shit the Mongols they had a boat supposedly according to who who had a who had a piece on the the bows of the Mongols there was like an article that was written about the bows of the Mongols what are the Bulls of the Mongols just giganto suppose pull back that were the Mongols was a tribe the Mongols yeah oh the moms Dan Carlin's hardcore history has this amazing series on it called the wrath of the Khan and Dan Carlin said that their bows were like a hundred and sixty pounds to pull back and so some guy wrote an article I can't I cannot remember what it was in but it was all detailing the science behind the bows arrows chain you stretch it out you can't aim until you have it stretched right right yeah I'm not good I don't know how to shoot one honestly I mean I kind of know the principles behind it I've made me shot 110 times every what I use has a release the clip the released yeah it's a different kind of thing what they're doing is called a recurve bow and that guy I mean I don't know what what he's pulling back well I bet these guys are strong as fuck man looking back at the dude as has his bow already back and some of them had deformities and their skeletons that they believed were were probably caused by the injuries that they got from pulling back these heavy ass bows like they developed these you know calcified joints and all sorts of weird bone deformities just from pulling back these gigantic and bows that's it's so hard to pull something like that back man like a lot of people can't pull back like a 70-pound holding it and hole yep about a hundred times a day 200 times a day and keep going I do to find your fucking bulge your arrows this shit like dude missing like shit dude they had to be so fucking strong but they got it done I would have you know if I could have a time machine man and just drop down and watch the Comanche like run down a herd of buffalo and see them like if I could just be a fly on the wall and watch what it was like to be like a Comanche in the 1800's that would be fucking fascinating to see me that would be an interesting I just people living in this really wild nomadic hunter life they barely even gathered they barely even like ate nuts and berries and shit apparently yeah and they were there with using all kinds of fucked up methods man they would like the fields on fire and chase them into rivers and shit what about flows yeah yeah it's wild shit man and this is life or death for them right if they don't get a buffalo they don't eat fuck it's it is so it's there's something about it that so you gotta come home with a motherfucking Buffalo you have to eat what I know they wonder where they liked man we sick of these fucking potatoes motherfuckers I don't think they had many potatoes there's a lot of Buffalo what vegetables you think there there was a guy named Dan Flores that wrote a Pete a piece about what was happening once a Native American tribes started riding on horses and running down buffalo and there were like the numbers were getting decimated they were like even if the market hunters didn't come along and kill all that Buffalo which you know they did they said if it just would have taken longer but these Native Americans on horses were so effective eventually they were eventually gonna wipe them all out crazy I would love to have seen what that was like just to see those pee you seem like you would like to live that life no no I like I like air-conditioning I like food no like you would go if it was a weekend of this shit well I've done it on weekends really yeah I'm sort of like I've gone camping and hunting it's sort of I mean it's way easier to do there is to do it with you know ancient bows and arrows that's hard to do but there's probably arguably way more animals around back then - yeah oh my shot up son those guys lived there their entire life with no knowledge of the Western world there's there was many generations where they didn't have any contact and then all of a sudden you know the Spanish come here and the French came here and then all of a sudden here's the 1500s I think they didn't even get horses until the the Europeans brought them over and then they got once they got horses you start kicking everybody's ass especially the Comanche apparently it's amazing man this book is it's got me I think they do they take horses yeah they stole horses from people there's stories and in there about them stealing horses from soldiers didn't know what the fuck they're doing Comanches came other horses yeah they they would steal all their horses and leave them to die because you know you're in the middle of this fucking area with no food no water no rain good luck they were just leaving to die and they knew what they were doing by taking their horses and that was fun for them I mean they could have killed them easy they decided you know what I'm gonna kill you well let you slowly run out of food and water you're about 300 miles away from anything to eat so yeah good damn that's highly planned we've engineered hardcore dude dies hardcore they'll just starve like they just had fucked up it's just reading these depictions of what combat was like and the the raids they did on these settlers villages and shit like these people tried to they sold people land in like Cherokee or a Comanche infested territory these are sold they gave these people this giant swath of lands I here build a house this would be perfect for you and like oh okay and so oh love and then Comanches came and killed everybody and took people slaves and oh my god who was a real estate agent on that deal did the United States government Uncle Sam's got your best interest I don't know who it was it told him to do that there's I think was a Homestead Act it was one of those things we were trying to get people to settle the West and the way they were doing is they were offering anybody who would go out there you'd get a certain amount of land for free if you just go out there and get them and fucked everybody up and that's what this this story is about at this point it's fucking terrifying I want to watch this series man I know right and that's definitely seems to get on it somebody's gonna get on it just fell to like really cowboy I don't know that so this theory seems like I could watch this it's a wild romantic connection that we always have to the way Native Americans live but I've never really seen it just depicted in this way as this book it's like very fascinating just amazing to hear like what life was like hundreds of years ago right here then I mean the change out of nowhere imagine if you looked at the Year 1400 and then go back through time you go hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years not much changes but it all kind of looks the same then all sudden 1,500 1,600 buildings buildings 19 2000 2019 planes pollution infrared mall 5g occupy Mars I got a Mars t-shirt quick it dudes fucking cruise ships what it was gonna say that boat what the fuck is that giant boat that can't stop or slow down the Jang in the harbors you just you just waving at people just docking this shit Cleveland they got a lot of those boats they just they just wait on the side when I was in Venice the boats let out you got some peanuts or something son are you hungry are you hungry no I can use some peanuts we don't have any peanuts but that's a fat bomb I don't want this shit good for you I don't want no poor no no man oh by Windows I thought don't say no what is it is mostly nuts and fat healthy fat but a liquid no it's like a gooey paste called bombs no this is salted chocolate macadamia one of my favorite but what is it supposed to do gives me healthy energy okay like say if I just need like a little bit of a snack like I'm gonna go work out or something like that but I want to eat a full meal Oh in between meals I'm like a little bit hungry oh you just squeeze nutrition yep that's not it in a bag that's a free ad for f-bomb I love that shit I love delight ëthis II can't say that without sounding gay but I love nut butter it's almond butters a little different the peanut butter and the wait I don't know what that's basically name I don't know who nut butter I don't think what do you think is more this is a good question so I never really what's more nutritious peanut butter or almond butter do we know let's find out let's Google what's more nutrition neutral which company makes it cuz it's gonna be ad that's true just maybe there's like a pure definition though maybe by definition or just just by fact almonds have X amount percentage of this or that that peanut butter doesn't or vice versa I don't know almond for the win but most people aren't allergic to almonds not that most people are allergic to peanuts but my people being allergic to peanuts and almonds right because you always hear it on an airplane they have similar nutritional value almond butter is slightly healthier than peanut butter because it has more vitamins minerals and fiber both nut butters are roughly equal in calories and sugar but peanut butter has a little more protein than almond butter so pre-set more and then in the neighborhood bleep but people get up Callens mom's got an allergy to Brazil nuts which is kind of crazy how do you find out what not you really allergic to questions with some people who they barely survived it some people so they're so allergic to peanuts that if they get on a plane they will ask other people on the plane Oh eat peanuts they'll say that but you know what I mean I don't know about that I'm pretty sure out of all the times you've heard that announcement right right somebody has had some peanuts on that plane some fat dude I don't think fuck about the world I don't think you have a flight yeah yo planners bitch he just eats it like this so no peanut dust gets in the air yeah but he's got peanut breasts for the whole fucking flag he's secretly hoping here's her coffin that's a weird allergy man nuts peanuts peanuts it's a weird one it'll shut the whole thing down well it's also a deadly one it's not like an allergy to milk I want you to milk makes you fart you feel terrible to get learning toast intolerance you know I want you to peanuts a serious one that's a dentist like I could kill your face deforming and everything yeah what happens I mean the people that well that's I've seen that allergy reaction to like seafood but I can imagine it's probably the same type wow there's so much shit that can kill you if you really wanted to sit down and freak out you could easily easily you know that's what's hard in life it's hard to keep your eye on positivity just move forward and purely positive it's so easy to think about all the shit that could go wrong stuff that can kill you and all the poisons all the subtraction oh and it's like you say it's easy to figure that but you want to know that stuffs are out there right you don't want to be ignorant you have to have some knowledge you have to have I think you should have a a minimum amount of knowledge normal and a lot of shit you hear about this shit that's going down in Mexico what's that were those Mormons they got shot out by the car but didn't I try the first report they try to say they made a mistake they made a mistake yeah it was like oh they don't think that they think that it was a hit went wrong that was rational reporting but now Anna's just say it so the day now they think it's just a head it's not a mistake yeah one cent and some of the Mormons a lot of those I fucked that we a D they should should get out I must and plagued by deadly attacks members of this Mormon community or foe Vaughn I was like fuck use of Mormon brah oh it's the video before it there yes that's him that's the Oh taking a break backstage on a stadium tour that is this time SEOs doing stadiums and it's like hey we'll say that's fucking funny he's a fine dude that Theo von ladies he's a very funny dude he's a unique guy like his funny is very unique yeah he makes like if you see it written down on paper you wouldn't know why is that funny and then you see him say it on stage you dying it's cuz it's coming out of him thought of him like he's kind of act like nobody could rip his act off good luck good luck no how are you getting what are you gonna do with that you gotta be that you get he's won you can watch him and you like yeah yeah man he's one of one deal Vaughn's one of one I don't know a number instable he he's like that other guy oh yeah no there's no not nobody says you like the yeah you're right he's the theá-- he's a feel Vaughn that's like saying like you're like Brody Stevens and I've never heard anybody saying he's like Brody Stevens shout out to everybody can't read and write y'all could work harder at school but whatever hope y'all are doing well amen he's all about the Lord man he's all about the Lord man y'all could have worked harder in school but whatever and you hear coming out of his mouth I remember he told me the story of why he didn't like black guys coming up cuz one of them jumped him on a school bus he was like he's named he was like it was Tyrone jinkies right he knew the name and all I could do is respect the story man oh my god yeah he's been fuckin that forever he's a hilarious guy he is such a fun time for stand-up man there's so many killers out there right now yeah you know like any night if I go to the Improv or I go to the store any night it's just murderers row I saw Damon working his new hour oh yeah he's doing his new hour in the lab it's good the comedy scene known is just it's so on fire now and he's Damon was he took time off you know so he decided to come back just do the show have you seen him work it out yeah the other day it was funny man yeah he always he's ready by the time he goes onstage he's ready yeah he has a different approach he films every show every single show he does he brings a tripod and his camera in he films it and he watches it and analyzes it people be interested to see him to remember the one special he did The Last Stand he called it his last when he dropped the mic yep yeah he was doing movies with Bruce Willis remember he did he was on fire he was on fire he was on fire he's always been on fire yeah yeah he was on fire he dropped a mic like yes so does this start off with him picking a mic back up I got money hilarious yeah have you started this next special that way picked the mic go I don't know if he's right ready get ready to do this pressure I think he's just putting together material well it was fun listening to him though we were all in the greenroom of The Improv and you know we're talking about just stand-up in general like his approach and you know he's he's a guy who works you know a lot a lot of respect for the way he puts together his shit he's not just going up there winging it and not he's covering all the bases he brings a fucking camera and then we feel lazy he's got a goddamn camera and a tripod that he's carrying around personally he's setting it up he goes home and edits the videos you put some on his computer I'm sitting there going oh my fuck I'm lazy like I need to get a goddamn tripod no so everybody got different systems that's true but I when someone takes the watching and analyzing that deep I gotta go hmm you might be on to something because you don't you think that if you do a set and then you watch the set it's almost like you did two sets no sometime I watched I watched shit sometimes oh I watch it with don't sound mmm just to see what you look like yep how do you look I look like I move around a lot I look like I'm telling a story you know I'm saying like yeah I look like I'm telling the story right you know I look like I'm fucking telling the story but if you were going over new shit right like say if you release is special and then you want to write a whole new hour you would want as much feedback as you could get like personally like oh wise you're formulating the but you know how bits are just yeah in the beginning you don't know where the fuck you're going it's a little clunky you'll be good if you could see it too yeah but you know you feel it more than anything you know yeah for sure you know saying like you know like I think you have so many thoughts you might want to you know write something down just so you can have all your thoughts in one space but you feel it yeah you definitely do you feel it like shit you start talking about doing it more special you write chunks of material mm-hmm you know and then you know this one once once you feel good about something you know yeah I was just thinking his method is one step further than mine which is just listening like I think he's probably that's probably the way to do it if you're gonna record your sets it really should record record look you really should have a fucking video of it you know and watch it it's like that level of discipline that's like next-level discipline but then with the way he writes is interesting he was like I never really write things down in terms of like write the whole bit out he goes I have ideas I got a I have to say it and when he's saying he finds the funny I was watching him do this bit was really interesting because we were talking about then I'm watched him go downstairs and do it and you know in the 90s when I was just getting to the store he was like a hero in the in the comedy world you know just be able to work with Damon Wayans at the comic store when I was in my 20s Oh like this is crazy that's damon wayans from the fucking Wayans brothers exactly this the other the other candidate for the great sketch show of all time those like to oh my god that's the other candidates I'm seeing I'm working with him at the fucking goddamn Comedy Store it was weird I mean that's the weirdest thing man when you're a young guy or a young girl you know you just get into comedy and you start to break through hanging out with comics that you used to watch well on television you're like oh shit you realize it's just like what the fuck is happening what the fuck it's weird but you get used to it you go oh they just did you're hanging out with them for a reason though because everybody know hang out with them yes that I'm saying like your your your is the reason why you're hanging out whatever not everybody else yeah you know yeah at a certain point I mean there's only so many people that are gonna get past the store see you had at Marlin damn man so you was all here when they were really little I the comedy scene was on fire it was interesting it was really interesting back then didn't wasn't oh yeah the comic store was for sure like the the all the killers you know there was Fat Tuesday that was the biggest room like the biggest promoter homeless guy Tories and of course Joe Torre who did def Comedy Jam right so everybody know the Torre brothers so that that was a that was it wasn't didn't Tupac pull a gun out at one of those or somebody with him wasn't there some crazy story from The Comedy Store about like Tupac almost getting in a gunfight in the fucking main The Comedy Store was wild back then yes yeah there was there was moments world's wild there it is guy Torry recalls curving Tupac at the height of east-west tension curving wasn't mean stop in defusing oh okay yeah I think there was a some sort of firearm in the premises yeah but anyway it's like then but then other than those guys though here's the thing that was crazy it was like there was a lot of guys that were there they were laid over from like the 80s that you like you you don't hear from anymore it was really funny people too they just for whatever reason they just never never quite caught on for them and back then they missed what we have now because if you didn't get a television show and you didn't get on a movie you're fucked yeah it wasn't nothing there was nothing else to do it it was so few guys all the road just got famous from doing standing yeah is that everybody did something else and then and that's all oh yeah but you you wouldn't get Fame in New York but you could make a living in you you can make a living in Boston - the same thing you can make a living you can make a living there gonna be no extreme living but no you can make a living you had to have some kind of TV show or something where people would come to see you you know Martin had everything obviously we just talked about it yeah but most most people relied on something else and some of them it just passed him by and then they were in their 40s and 50s and they had never really hit with anything and you'd see them hanging around but it was just like fuck it didn't work out and this new crop came in after that new crop came in like the 2000s they're only 2000 you start seeing these new guys coming in and you start seeing like this one Ari Shaffir was already killing at the club by then he was already doing like smaller spots by then you know he's I think he's probably even I wonder when did he become a paid regular yeah but it was you know I was on the combat it goes it went back and forth till now and now over the last like four and a half five years The Comedy Store is on fire now it's not like anything else I've ever seen it's

to farm it out to have a bee promoter she's not around seven every week if he doesn't want to do it every week I get it I get not wanting to schedule it every week but that is a good place to for the

over there it's cool yeah yep I have a good time I do chocolate sundaes I do a lot of Jay David shows great room the way it's designed it really is a room you know the ice house is a new owner now I heard about the ice house I haven't been our new I think they're gonna just keep it basically the same pretty much Leah and Bob is like he's consulting for like a year oh yeah they run smoothly yeah I mean that's a good room to work too oldest room in the country is it yep it started stand-up comedy it started with like variety acts and then it went to full time so it was originally an ice house like back before they have refrigerators people would buy ice oh yeah that's why they call it the ice house and then it became like a variety show place where like that bands and they have a few comedians and then they just went to straight stand-up but I think they went to straight stand up in the 70s so it is 78 and so I think I don't know does that make them the oldest comedy club it seems like the Comedy Store was around back then The Comedy Store wasn't full-time in the seven most famous but you listen what year to this store was at 76 fine I went year the store was was opened you ever did a la jolla store I love that love that room is amazing I like those people I like San Diego people about San Diego people they're like there they're like less la but more California they are and they're like chill people they are they like nice California yeah but they're not did not Hollywood tell all the California with none of the Hollywood like regular folks you have to live in a nice city in California with the great weather but they're not Hollywood exactly yeah I went down there and they had of some festival going on downtown tell you this restaurant it was nice they're beautiful I love them I love Santa Barbara - you ever go up Santa born I've been a lot of times ow Santa Barbara is beautiful it's beautiful same thing not too many people yes like it's nice it's pretty these like the comfortable the both air economically designed yeah this is the Comedy Store open in 72 April 72 but the ice house was running from 1960 to 78 whereas like a variety show some unions were going the entire time so that's why it's distinct it as ongoing longest ongoing comedy club because it's been going on there so it's had comedy forever but it had other stuff as well right whereas the Comedy Store was only comedy and that was 72 right okay huh what did it take to get a weekend at the fucking ice house that was probably crazy right oh man but the problem wasn't that many clubs back then right how'd you get work you get a weekend at the Ice House shit there's only one club isn't that that many fucking dumb I know they had a shitload of comedians they used to be a place that my friend Adam Ferrara used to work at that was in it was in like fuck like Westwood or Brentwood or something like that that was a real clean place had to be clean to work there I know you know what I'm talking about I know the club they say I think they said spot that Lindo hits own like oh you see any of the comedy magic club in Hermosa yeah wasn't thinking about that no that was thinking that there's a place that Richard Jenna used to work out at all the time oh god damn it I wish I could remember but I remember Ferraro was working there and him and I were buddies and I was in the back of the room going god I wish I could work here but I'm dirty oh yeah but those were I found the rooms to be challenging to on the case super clean rooms yeah just to say I could do it it's weird they're weird I saw like a wave club I love that place and when I go there it seems like it's my crowd but I've heard people say that you know they're told they can't talk about certain things you know they have a real nice clientele they've had them forever they have like a certain vibe and I don't begrudge the guy that's his thing you know and he's never I when I would um I would understand going in he's the only club that ever told me I couldn't have Joey Diaz open for me though Joey doubt it was like he's too crazy because I love him but I just can't kiss he's a great guy a great guy Joey didn't care Joey loves I'm still yeah I got it I got it I'm talking about eating mufflers I get it I get it enjoy the food is fantastic they have one of the best comedy slips Club stakes yeah everybody really oh my god the food at the comedy magic club it's like a really nice restaurant like if you ate there as a restaurant you'd be happy so the food is very good yeah you have to wear a suit now do you I hope not there's no amazing cast of Magic Castle I think they're well that's different that's the Magic Castle the comedy in magic that's that that comedy magic club is in Hermosa Beach the Magic Castle is in LA okay it's in Hollywood yeah yeah that's how I've never been in that one but that one you have to wear suit I want to go Jimmy Schubert as a member of that he's very old-school yeah I keep a deck of cards somewhere that's hilarious just in case you got to pull out a magic trick yeah comedy and comedy and magic together is a weird combination when they have those shows at the comedy magic club they'll have a magician too 15 then you do stand-up afterwards it's real weird it does it back but it's and people enjoy it it's like a cool variety thing down I could do it I've seen guys the magician guys like they don't get to go up so he's just going around the party's just like right just like flipping cards right till motherfuckers will suck all the women out of a fucking room with trickery oh my god yeah why do women like that kind of trickery they just want to be I don't know they just want to feel like they want to see some sorcery yes some type of source they whenever they go it's all you see them like fairy tales are real and that's when you start shit start disappearing evening I've been fucking David Blaine fucking took my watch off before really yeah he do some crazy they take your watch off I don't know man he just did it some David Blaine shit that makes me this muhfucka regurgitate some frogs before I just it just makes me nervous that a guy would be so slick he would actually be able to take your watch off I know they exist yeah people cook you did you said it it happened to you I know other people have said it happen to them he's done it that's a game of them it's always a negative team oh I just I believe it but I've never seen it but I think there's there's levels to everything if you give you some elite world champion gold medalist in the Olympics level of watch picking you know I mean some dudes like yeah like you've seen dudes do shit with their hands when they move cards around and it's fucking confusing their hands are so goddamn fast their dexterity when they're moving the decks together and doing that kind of shit I mean there's some dudes have control of their hands that's just off the charts and if they're there about picking watches they could get you they can get you you just made me what look for my watch I'm like you just pick my shit have you ever been pickpocketed I don't think so I don't think so either I've been robbed before but never been pickpocketed I think it's like what's this that's what he threw up the fucking frog oh where where was the frog in his stomach really is the Frog dead no it was alive what kind of torture is that he swallowed three but they stayed in there that's what's crazy did it freaked everybody out in that fucking room bro that takes balls to swallow a frog but what happens if that thing has bacteria in it or some weird disease and it breaks down in your gut what if you don't throw it up in time what if that motherfucker don't come back out yeah he just until he run out of breath like he's just down it till he can't breed anymore it's watch right there on the right really he's always shaking his hands he just did it but how did he do it I mean see that again isn't ten seconds he's already jiggling it right now you can see him fucking with the stir and his David Blaine see how he's fuckin with ya now it's almost undone that's gone why I was paying attention to that dude that is impressive the way he shook it and it seems like he did some sort of a magic trick with the cards too I'm sure you might that's the part that's what they're stunned by right yeah yeah it's a mystery when people have that kind of hand control stay the fuck away from them that's a dangerous person yeah what do you have time to practice deception at that level I don't want to get anything from David Blaine that month just look you just oh he gave it back bro you're a Whitney Cummings bit about magicians no she was they don't like women liars that's why you never see women magicians I was like oh shit she said that was one of those when someone says something you go oh shit find me a fucking woman magician there might be like three of them ever I don't think the woman's magicians Association of America is now outraged I'm sure there's some meet women magicians but you don't know we don't never I don't even know any of them I don't know any of them I know a bunch of male magicians but maybe I'm a sexist piece of shit yeah I don't understand how no woman has broke them the magician all right barrier I think magic as like a Penn & Teller form or David Blaine form I think it's an incredible art form that's very difficult for anybody and if it's not in your culture right like if it's not it does not like a bunch of women magician guides and you know mentors that could help you figure it out and get it's probably weird for them like who the fuck why they don't have trials why aren't there a lot of female magicians people like magic shows right that's right you ever go see Penn and Teller it's great you haven't seen them live it's a fucking great show I believe they're to Professor they've been doing it for a while shame or anything well I think there's no female magicians how many of them there are there let's guess googled famous female ones that I have never heard of any of them top five let me see what you got give me a top five hi I don't know there we go hey presto she's probably all right never heard of you either motherfucker misty Lee um say that name ninj chi ming kai mink named Kai maybe I mean Kristen Johnson Dorothea Dietrich Dietrich Dietrich um okay I don't know who those people are either sistent I don't know if there's some problem with crossover Oh like maybe if you have you have assistant she's like super hot she's like I want to magic to like baby I'm the magician you're the assistant like but I can fucking do it I know how they like put babies after a while you know she's hot and you're not and he's just trying to keep her I think okay okay okay let's try so you can do if you just taught me with like a little more patience maybe I could do exactly what you're doing but you're afraid you're afraid that I'll be better than you is that what this says that's how she would be I picture her with fiery red hair tight waist but I really never ever that's so crazy I've never seen a female magician when Whitney said that joke I was howling I was like that's one of those ones we like oh my god how come nobody ever pointed that out before she caught it with it that's such a good point too it's why we don't like women liars cuz everybody has to go oh yeah oh Jesus Christ what is it there aren't any female magicians you know everybody's have to go it's one of those things you hear it you go fuck she's right she is right what has a job is there with us like no females there's a this is a not the reason why but this is an interesting point so cast this question an article in 2013 and one person said the reason that some kids get into magic is because they got beat up oh I had to find magic and that's what led them to find making friends and like a lot of girls don't not have enough that makes sense I'm telling you it's a gift you'll get it it's a chick magnet right they can that's a really I could really see that as something to for a guy this is what is this confidence though this is what we combine there's not a lot of money in being like a fitness chick on Instagram sticking your ass out the markets kind of flooded but you could separate yourself from the pack if you're a fitness chick who does magic with big tits and spandex come on kids that could work that could work that magic in like the most revealing ridiculous yoga outfit oh yeah lazy barefoot make it disappear bending over for nutritionist Marc Macklemore says he's a magician now releasing magic rap album good for him I like that guy good for him I bet he could do it magic what can stop some what maybe he loved magic already what can stop someone from being a magician that's one of those gigs well it kind of anybody could do it well yeah I mean not anybody could do it well don't get me wrong there's a lot of skill to it but I'm saying nothing's gonna stop you from practicing you could get a look you could take classes right you could you could buy a kit right people learn how to do magic nothing could stop you first-ever magic rap album interesting what do you think that could mean anything he wants it to mean he's crazy you know you do maybe it's just to get us to talk about it not us but you know everybody I mean that's what it was about yeah it's good marketing move some brilliant fella he nailed it we're all like what that's the move you gotta trick people these days chicklet just confuse them it's almost witty things like what if I can buy my sign soon son yeah leave I got to see my son son I just came in today is one of those days did I dread being on a roll I just came
