three - ladies and gentlemen the champ is here my man salut salut last time behind last time you were here he would neither the interim nor the undisputed now you got it all at the double interim champ you got it wow I saved up keep saying that double interim double into room I don't know cuz there's a champ yeah he was he's not you know the channel cuz when I was there you know I've in my last fight I feel like it's my first title defense to be honest because I was waiting for something to change I was waiting for that feeling that I had in Atlanta what never came and within three days I was like I felt like I just defended the belt because technically I was the champ as well I was the champ and he feared beat me here - got one of those rubies you put on this so I'm looking for my Ruby as well thinking of Ruby yeah like that's the thing you don't get you know I used to get a new bill yeah you don't get a new bill anymore so what they do is they send this off this isn't actually I want my one Sims at all this isn't yours yeah but I sent this plaque off this plaque on the side and then you sent it off then they put a ruby and sent it back to you didn't you put a root in the plaque yeah so you collect like the Infinity stones or whatever yeah dude I used to not like this belt now I like it better it's grown yeah it's like maybe two days after everyone complained about it and I looked at it and I when I first saw it I think was at the P I and I was like you know what I fuck with it yeah I'm for a while I was like ah the old ones better and now I'm like I don't think so anymore I like nostalgia yeah yeah gets you every time this one's cleaner yeah it's like char more legible the old one it was cool and that's the light so I could buy one on the website hopefully yeah but it's a light yeah but you just were like nostalgic purposes and just because you know I've been a fan I should have got one of those I came at the the end of it Kolbe still walking around with one man don't get attached to these things man I'll heat AI flex with them for a little bit you know cause I've even my um my last after after Atlanta my coach he was kind of worried cuz I was going to Nigeria I was going to all these shows I gotta like show it off flex it but he's my coach so Eugene's like man you know don't think you're the champion but I'm like hey I'm the channel but then there was a point when we move gyms and I just kind of alright put in this box with everything else and then he kind of posted about it cuz he so like okay the switch happened like his game time now the same thing I'm doing my tour right now victory to a walk around do all this shit but then even being at the fights last we can I go for more because you know after the fights I got you know I see what's up people talking about me right a right or us I'm like me I got to get back to the gym so when I get back I don't even look at this thing that's interesting so you're aware that you could get to into the moment yeah you can get too wrapped up in the fact that you won the title and maybe slack off a little on if I'm able to take yourself too seriously yeah that's cuz I mean a lot of people this is their goal they're like I want to become the UFC champion they get it done and then what happens after in the next fight they lose it or they lose sight track of what really matters so some guys like Kobe for example he's walking around with the belt when loose man whoops his ass if it was meant was asked and what's gonna happen you're gonna walk around with that bill how you gonna feel well I the Kobe thing is interesting and I don't know how much Colby wants people talking about this but I'm gonna I'm gonna spill it as much as I can that's an act man it's a strong word on when they were ready to cut him they were ready cut you talked to that guy in real life he's a very respected just being around them just being in cities and Isis guy he's a nice guy he's playing a pro wrestling he'll man he's got the whole world rose up itself yes and here's the thing though this is where it's interesting it tricks people because he seems like a goof he's wears a stupid fucking cheap blue suit he wears that Magga hat or that smile he's got the old belt you know it's not a legit belt right but he did win the interim title and they took it from him for no reason it doesn't make any sense so this is thing about him where people somehow another thing like maybe he's illegitimate maybe he's not real then he fucks Robbie Lawler yeah he can work and you go oh Jesus this guy doesn't get tired he could strike his wrestling's on point is fuckin cardio's off the chart he's tough as nails yeah I was a blissful man when he put Robbie against the fence he was right this lipping and ripping oh yeah some things you know everyone has holes in a game I have holes in my game but he was really impressive the way he was right there in his face yeah Robbie Lawler he's not an elite striker in his sense of like he's a guy who will slip and then blast someone unconscious with one shot he's a vol guys look he's throwing 60% 50 60 % just on you on you on your desktop yep never let you rest never let you rest and Robbie in that fight and Robbie's a fucking all-time great welterweight champion I mean he was a legit top of the food chain motherfucker and he was looking for those openings that were never there he was always looking for Kobe to slow down Kobe never slowed down he was waiting he was seeing my just waiting way up and he was just like buying this time to explode get fuck fuck yeah here it is here it is and there's ways to do that I did it against um Whitaker as well you see it I always got a burp uh-huh his tires weren't here like I'll put a clip of this is like a simple one shifting real simple subtle thing you just move to step one two that's it I could see it when he like balanced bounce all right I'm ready to go you shift you disrupt the pattern okay reset reset but about to attack you know even wonder boy did it to omluke a past weekend you know whenever he was bouncing he's either he's gonna bounce bounce and then Wonderboys shifts so he was doing it with no offense balance bounce bounce attack yeah so he was just it's all about rhythm yeah well you have something that wonderboy has that a few other people have in that you're a specialist in that being a specialist and obviously you have a full game there's no way you get to where you are without a full game but you were you are an elite striker thank you and with that that's that's a giant advantage because on the feet you are a step ahead of everybody every fight star standing on their feet you see it with Whitaker because Whitaker's a great striker he's a tough guy but he had holes in his game that maybe he didn't know he had yeah but you you could snow what it was I got in his head and everyone like when I can see this kind of stuff man before the press before the fight the press conference when he was talking to acting oh I'm bothered and stuff like that and I was like what he's acting out of character people he put this meme up right and then people thought I was affected by the meme but all that showed me was like you've never talked shit or poked fun at anyone you're fighting with somehow suddenly you're poking fun at me that's showing your first card showing your first hand and a lot of things he's did throughout the like back backtracking and whatnot I was like you're showing me your hand you're acting out of character even my coach said the same thing and I said just do got you to the dance don't try and talk shit with a guy who knows how to talk to you and know he knows how to talk shit with his friends and shit like that but not with me the internet kid that's different don't make means against me I'm a mean majesty but like yeah so and then when he couldn't when he came to the cage you know so he saw me when I walked up I stomp the yard stomp the yard and I entered the cage and when he came in I could I could feel that he was as fucking car you know beating us just ended and he took about a minute and a bit before he looked me in the eyes and I was I was looking at in the whole time and he like a cat you corner even the chicken get one of your chickens Corner it like a rooster it's dangerous when you corner any kind of be still attack you at any point so I could see him pacing back and forth like a caged animal in the whole time like he was a hunter he was the hunted and I was the per hours I was a hunter so I was watching him and I could feel it like you know really about this and he's trying to hide himself blasphemy God and I could just smell that and when I went on my stance I said whoa whoa like this is something I was doing during sparring like during my my training camp so I was just triggering this dismember my muscle memory in my head and I was just having fun this is the point I looked at am I kind of smart like fucky I got this and I just knew from that point then I was on his in the first round I thought I lost the first round without the knockdown just like I let him have it but then I washed it back I threw less strikes I landed more he threw more strikes and then it lists all I was doing was just and me and Eugene talked about this light let the first round the first half of the fight let's see what he does just get all his attacks draw it make him show his hand make him draw you know draw draw the attacks out of him and I did that and after I watched it again I was I yeah without the knock that I still had around he was a brilliant performance and the knockdown at the end of the first round was essentially the end of the fight yeah he was fucked up it was there was a bad knockdown you could see when you went back to his corner there's there's a moment where you see his eyes are just not quite there yeah like after the even before the second round he stood up and when Kelvin rocked me after I got rocked my first time being rocked in the UFC in the second round I was before the second rose eyelid let's go let's step it up he was looking at the screen Robert was looking at the screen like or me won't hit me and I was like hey hey that's in the past that's done focus on me right now anyway I was alright then let's go yeah um when it was over when they stopped the fight raise your hand what's that feeling like knowing you're the undisputed champ I felt like just my title defense honestly yeah Atlanta Atlanta was the one where I put my hand up and I felt like yes why my Atlanta why that because I'm so hard yeah I think is the way the fight went the back and forth and then me that that fifth round like I I found out who I was after that like that fifth round I found out the depths I'm willing to go so when they put my hand up and you know you beat up and all that kind of stuff just and also I never had a belt before so I've never had it wrapped around my waist as I visualized it so once that happened boom I felt like yes and also I was looking I was like please judges don't screw me over and over in this man and I knew I had it but you know you never know exactly balls bro dude look at the Darren so guessing fight so when they put my hand up I was like yes but then this time they put my hand up I was like alright what's the end thing is my brain wants to move forward because I did it in kickboxing because I was undefeated for so long so it was always alright cool what's next what's the fight maybe wants to study alright what's next but now I have to like chill relax look at the tape look at what you've done and then soak it in smell the roses for a little bit and then move on yeah cuz once I had my first loss I took winning for granted because it was just a habit I was always winning always winning always winning so now I have to like when you win when you do something amazing like I did in Atlanta like I did in Melbourne his chill smell the roses and then move forward when you entered the fifth round against Kelvin you said I'm ready to die and was I looked at him and I remember I call it sa Diablo he was looking at me and he just had this like look and he's just swinging his hands and I said you're not gonna beat me I'm prepared to die and I meant that man I swear to God on my life I meant that I'm even getting goosebumps thinking see that like I meant that shit cuz I was like look and I sign I signed my death warrant right now as I look if this is how I died this is how I die but you see me I was try get him I was trying to kill him I knew cuz for me if I'm ready to die I'm ready to kill you have to be willing to give something up as well so in that fifth round when I was throwing those shots when I was I think I dropped my four times or something crazy like even the last one like went from heaven hit him I wished I didn't like follow and like roll over on them because I probably could have got him out with like two seconds left but I was trying to get him out of there man and it's sad to say but I was ready if he had taken it to me and he had done that to me and I didn't wake up so be it well that was evident in the way you fought because you didn't you know it was a close fight but it looked like you were ahead on the judges but you didn't take I mean any break at all you know you just you threw yourself into the fire instead of being cautious you know and I told that to Dana you know Dana and I were talking about that fight and he was he was talking about hype Diaz for Whitaker they tried to get me to fly to Australia for me try it like right now I've cancelled a lot of my trips cuz also you know my knee but also just formal being away from the gym like you feel it after a while shows level like after the fight cuz you can see the target on your back people smile in your face you know oh yeah and then yeah I know what's up I'm not stupid I've seen a lot of people in this game rising for 100% all the time so I want to get back to doing what I do best Dana and I have these conversations sometimes we get hyped up and talk on the phone and we were talking about that fight and I said do you know what he said you literally said it and I got on my um as a highlight I made by myself and then I had it and the captions that you know you're not gonna beat me I'm ready to die I'm prepared to die that's the movie type shit that is movie type shit especially when you win yeah understand Dana just went holy shit yes I do watch it just watch it again he's saying I'm mounted yeah yeah what was intently fight yeah I don't want to have much much like those but you have to get it cuz after that fight even like probably about two minutes after I was like I can go and load the two rounds I felt it I was like this is like the third wind Wow shit I'm not just saying this yes you up I'm saying like I was like I can go another two rounds you can see it like I felt freshmen I've never this is my I was my second 55 around fight when I fought this time last year against um what's-his-name on July last year bride to Vera's fifth round I was just having fun I didn't even like I won't say I took my foot off the pedal but I was having fun with it in this fight like I said you know fifth round I was ready and I said that for the Romero fight and what's his name Whitaker if I said look look how he looked in the fifth round he's got gas don't get me wrong he can be king cracks a memorable Romero and him they don't have the same kind of spice as I do when I'm when I'm in the trenches when it's time to go I can go because I do it in the gym every day you wanted Romero for your next fight sometimes man I'm a shadow guy you know I mean he's coming off three out of four losses three in a row so I'm like yeah but all of those could have been his yeah I know but also the people the people the casuals they think this is the guy well first of all I think Brunson was a guy and then gasolin was a guy yeah and then Witek is the guy they think this is the guy to beat me so I'm like all right this is my charity work for the year well he's an interesting fight for anybody yeah hold up was it because he's a freak athlete I mean that you look up freak in the dictionary you see picture Yoel Romero flying through the air hit and Chris Weidman with a new cut here I mean he's just a freak I remember his first fight I saw him he did the same thing to the black guy bald black guy flying knee boom and just kind of starched them different--and but this is leather so what this is what Rises me to the occasion this is one challenges me cuz a guy like that like you say he's a beast Saint they're a robber he's a beast yep but these levels to this and if you can make that look easy it just makes you look that like your status legendary goat all that shit that's not you want yeah so you want this nice looks good you know I'm saying but it's all about the the challenges taking out Robert Whittaker in the second round in his home country you know doing that to your Romero maybe not in Cuba I don't know what the situation is like there but like in Vegas in a big arena TT mobile arena that would be fucking dope yeah but the Dana say you know he's got to get a win first their thing is they don't know how to sell it like to the people and I might fuck it let's do it anyway and I've said and leaving his manager at the fights for whatever reason why was welcome his room we signed the contract I was like I didn't know who it was and say we sign the contract just tell Dana I was like okay I had my drink in my hand walking like cool story bro we signed the card what the fuck is that Dana said this yeah I was trying to say that's the hype and then like right someone might they sent me this other video of him in the gym say Israel why are you back in now why are you back it up you know just tell dinner the fucking day I'm like I'm saying like I want to do the fight I said look this is a guy right this is a yeah he's gonna take me down and beat the fuck out of me okay no one's been able to do that yet so let's see if this guy can do it or let's see if I can take him down well yeah the thing is - you have to get him now yes he's 41 now I think 40 40 why he's oh yeah that's what they're gonna say oh you know you beat oh yeah he's selling when he fought Robert Whittaker they didn't have that narrative no beat Whitaker I think the second time he'd be with ya I said he dropped them yeah he heard of that and if you look at those ten eight rules you know the the new new rules he won yeah I feel look at you you judged by the system yeah I thought he won period I just thought he won yeah I mean and Whitaker's a fucking animal man he hung in there with that guy blasting him on the chin but he hurt him and he hurt him bad several times but uh the pole Acosta fight oh my would get my gun yeah favorite friend leaving La Veta Costa let's go I felt like that that fight was legit either one could have got that time I think III agreed with it when cause to one-up said okay I could see that but if they gave it to Romero out there like I could see that too I think Austin won that fight like I say he just stole it just oh yeah that's the way to look at it just don't rot when he dropped them in the first round that really solidified it and Romero was trying his best to come back but just a step behind in my eyes anyway like you said if they roll the dice sometimes but the thing is shocking about Romero's how well he takes it shot there's a picture of Costa kicking him in the head that I put on Instagram where it looks like his soul is leaving his body like his eyes are rolling back in his head that Shane is wrapping around his head his whole head is restored in things the drinks lynches all those mics right yeah I just hold his head in place hold his breath place them just move well you know he had a pretty severe neck injury if you look at the back of his neck he's got a giant scar up his neck or at his discs fused look at that picture Dan why didn't know fuck dude just gonna send his face into the fucking black hole of another universe I mean that is full impact that's it you turn the hip on the acid that's all in Robert did one on him as well but this is a lot cleaner yeah nicer goddamn I mean he's taking giant shots I think Bronson hit him with a high head kick as well wrapped around the neck nothing I think his neck is like one solid piece Yeah right fuck they did in Cuba to his neck when they did an operation oh he's all fused up and he won't cut his teeth you know I've seen him around he's efficient when he's not cutting away like he's nice you happy boy he's Hugh but he's you know I can move before y'all ready God he's real flexible I've seen their reflexes seen him doing the splits on that dance on one clip did that Cuban Olympic program is no joke I mean when he described it he came on with Joey Diaz and did you benefit yeah it was amazing because Joey was translating from Cuba to English and they were talking about the program like they just train them and they put them in this situation where if you win you get more food and you get a better place to stay you get two meals a day if you lose you get three meals a day if you win and these guys are there competing it's the best in the world yeah and it's just every day is battle battle you know it's like everybody always wants to kill me and you become on my gene it's like you know and you see the dude first of all when you sitting across from me like okay with you I know you're heavier than 185 pounds but it's feasible what do you like what do you walk around that like right now I guess 203 yes feasible you look at America Panama you gotta realize man the food oh my god like I forget every time you gotta order small because you order naturals like large they come in in a platter yeah people like your father yeah we like everything metabolism for me you like it yeah yeah we like everything big over here everything outrageous no no this outrageous country use a blowtorch well you were saying even drinks they pour bigger drinks over yeah like I'm surprised like I think it's part of the culture as well why you order you say a double they're like no it comes in a double on my Oh double double and then literally you have to ask for more coke or more fancy yeah yeah ice helps them in do you like New Zealand like there was a time from I think it was on going into the New Year's of 2011 I was driving down from Auckland to Whanganui and I was just going through by myself in my old car chewy rapping singing just having fun and I was just looking at the landscape and that was the moment I decided that this is what I want to stay this is the country I'm gonna living because I always had this idea that I'm gonna go to Canada or America eventually but also cuz my gyms over there my teams over there Eugene's over there my family I've made friends I've grown up that's my it's my other country you know so I love it over I love the vibe as well it's a beautiful you haven't been I thought chat Mendez went through and got a big red yeah you go out there you can catch something man like that's like a 13 point I counted before yeah you can also shit yeah if Giants tags are I just imagine like that with something that's 800 pounds behind it yeah or what is that thousand pounds something yeah the one that I have out in the front was over a thousand pounds yeah when you walk in yeah it's huge I've seen some next to cars as well on YouTube he's gonna just get some perspective yeah if any of that see I told you the story this made ya what it was the place Costco acts they are gonna go to Utah not Utah is gonna go home to Alex Falconer skis fight so I asked her where can I go get a chilly bin and I went to Costco while they were cleaning out the Airbnb and I also had some Nigerian food I ordered as well from Texas so when I got back racks to everything and I was like fuck and I you text me how to cook it and everything and my coach usually cuz I really wanted a she's a avid hunter like after fights first place it goes in the bush because he wants to get away from all and so I was like I'll share this with him and then yeah they were acts that man I'm sure they kept it they threw it in the bin I'm sure they kept it but I hope they enjoyed it yeah yeah but I got to try some milk one day definitely I will any time any time you run here you want to set up a kitchen in here in the studio this is like the new Fantasy Factory but actually you walk around I'm like man I need one of these you do one day ya have a gym I'm right next to the gym a fun house yeah it's good to have everything where you do it all in one place - yeah cuz me I just don't have any time yes you need everything right yeah it helps I can come in here two hours before show get a full workout in shower everything even sauna but you know get it all done in one spot if you get a kitchen definitely I coulda gonna make me a sandwiches yeah man we got a little baby kitchen but we got it we got to set up a grill in here um what I was getting about New Zealand is the beauty man like there's something I think that like when people think about places and places to live you know I think oh it's convenient this is an easy commute this is you know it's a nice apartment or it's a nice house whatever it is but there's something about natural beauty and it doesn't really get much beautiful more beautiful than New Zealand in the South Island as well like the North Island school is some sports there's a lot of places like for me I travel all around the world but whenever like I fly in and I see the Sky Tower and you can see the grant like the landscape with the place it's beautiful and I feel like like Marshall when he sees the hills and he's about to go for a hike it's like yes almost home almost home for like it's such a beautiful place and we're Queens Queens Queens Queens sound the South Island the snow there I haven't been I've seen everyone posting about it but one day I'm gonna go there's snow in New Zealand fuck yes oh yeah yeah Marlborough whoo that's where I've been snowing snowboarding years ago South Island I've been two years ago when I was younger like 12 but definitely I was an adult I gotta go it's different we go with your parents and we're going as adults so I got to go out there and it's fucking beautiful it's a crazy place when it comes to wildlife because they brought it all from Europe yeah they did even like I'm surprised I'm in Auckland is an island called why hiki Island at some probably about a 20 minute ferry ride from the city and his Wallabies on there I had no idea and I apparently they're invasive species because the guy brought them from Australia but then luckily they kept on the island now but I've heard rumors now they've kind of found their way because you know some crazy folks I'm gonna keep this and of course their weights are like Rotorua the redwoods and all that kind of shit it's always a crazy fuck that wants a pet I know Florida's got a giant problem with that yeah with was it anacondas on Khan does he call it a why was that guy at Tarzan guy he catches them all the time iguanas iguanas as well there's a lot of them and they killing them now they yeah they calling them they give you money if you kill it go on really yeah cuz they're digging under houses Oh they dig tunnels it houses a base stations shit I don't even really dig I put there just in trees I thought so too yeah something new every day they have so many pythons there they said there's no more rabbits there's no more Marsh hairs raccoons deer everything's gone all pythons pythons are eatin alligators yeah oh yeah I've seen I see them and they burst out makes it the lake stick you manage it like that I even found Nile crocodiles in the Everglades really graceful crocodile yeah they have a kill on sight warning isn't it like the even it was a Texas they have more Tigers yep or lions tigers and your exit somewhere and then all of the wild of the world crazy yeah so crazy he's pretty much time out there I've been there when I first went there was when I think when I first met you UFC 192 DC Gustafson hmm yeah I was there it was a good time I didn't really I just ate that's all I did there just eat army yeah yeah BBQ cutting away this is when he was a featherweight yeah fuck that guy ever made featherweight or he be like I asked him how you feeling he's I feel great I'm like yeah you feel great he's like not the lightweight you see him I lightweight now motherfucker he's the one you can't say I was yeah well I've seen some things man he's a tough guy I've had him on my back for four minutes over five minute around sparring and he's hard to get off and he's good like you know some people in the gym they shine as some people under the bright lights they shine some of we can do both and I'm telling you yeah he's the one like people don't know yet there's some things he hasn't shown of his game that I'm I'm sure that like huh so I was in the room when DC and John henyk we're doing like the you know the fighter um what do you call it interview so I did my one first and then they did Dan and Dan was telling me like John asked about the champ you know so that you know how would you be could be and he said he just so DC go like lean in like one and then he had to kind of just you know say some bullshit whatever boy right yeah like I know that because even like DC asked me to help me to help him train for the Jones fight the second one and I turned it down because they had Rockhold in their camp and I wasn't in the UFC at the time but I knew I don't want to give them anything right I don't want to give them anything I don't want them to say all he came to our camp like I did with Blackzilians and then they said well you know we see holes in this game right which is all bullshit but yeah I just you just don't want the chat I don't want anything I want nothing I don't give him nothing yeah because I always knew this was coming so I get planet plot your way but you and I talked on Instagram 14 yeah yeah and weird times like one yeah but I said give me my time let me work yeah I'll be working man I'll be working well I pay attention the attention of dudes who shine thank you so outside you know I know guys were coming you know I know guys are coming up but I knew you had been thinking about MMA and I've been a fan of you as a kickboxer yeah I've been working about it well I'm always fascinated by elite specialists that make their way in MMA because I'm always like oh how's it's going to translate is it I think that it seems harder it seems harder for a lot of grapplers who don't have a background in striking I mean I think grappling can be the most important thing in MMA because if you can't stop a guy from taking you down you're gonna lose but you have to start every fight on your feet and when you see a guy who doesn't have good striking fight a guy who has elite striking like a good example this past weekend was Kevin Lee versus Gregor Gillespie yeah Gregor will SP is a fucking fantastic wrestler elite wrestler and Kevin Lee is a better striker and you see that every fight stand Kevin Lee has a slink background Tussauds it's no picnic taking that guy down but you see one of guys a better striker as more weapons and then Gregor gets high kicked it's a different kind of feel and also one thing yeah are you Jean and Andre my arresting cards alluded to is people forget the takedowns the wrestling starts way before the clinch mm-hmm starts way before you get taken down away before you engage it's all about positioning foot positioning and so about distance control so once you have that and you understand the principles of that you're wrestling becomes easy like I might have I don't know if it's the highest takedown defense percentage in the UFC's missile pretty good as I attire but and this I mean the only time was in my second fight when the guy in the third round I didn't break the grip and he sucked my leg in immediately after cuz I'd normally room 100 just kind of told me what to do like okay ever since that in training no one ever gets that on me or really really gets that on me so I uh I'm always improving men like I said even right now for more I feel my fear of missing out because I see everyone who keeps the demo or fear of missing out that's not yeah acronym yeah it's what the kids are saying I know the kids that's fear of missing out so like all my I see like on the group chat what the team is doing and I see them working 10 a.m. score shots at the table squad were they at a hundred percent yeah especially like just the young guys coming up you know I see it and I'm not stupid man I know that had the targets on my back it's easy to get this but it's hard to keep it so yeah I want to make sure I'm I want to do what Dimitri's did I want to do what silver did you know I want to be one of those guys who just racks it up get all the Infinity stones all the gems now what happens if they over run the outside of the gems give me a new belt every time I know I'm putting these ones all the cheers on these bits are guys like steep a steeper has a shitload of belt would have been cool I can buy some of them yeah it's what you think about the BMF belt mm yeah it's a touchy subject I don't like I feel well I like the idea you know ideas you know he ain't no Wesker gangster you know and then yeah you know from Miami you know whatever they should have kept that between them the company didn't have to get involved he didn't have to get involved to like try and solidify this but what it was was they needed a title for the MSG car because Kobe and Osmond and what yes it happened but look at this Miesha Tate vs Holly Holm was the co-main event as a title fight but Diaz McGregor one right so that fight itself would have been fine without the belt without a rock with all that kind of stuff but it happened and yeah it's cool what's gonna happen now is he gonna defend it because even the ego of me is like there's no point because I think gonna defend the bell are they gonna I don't know yeah I feel like Moz Vidal's championship cow I might put some fucking spinners on this now and then do like John Cena they call this the freestyle belt yeah I yeah I you know I see where he's saying but I feel like monster dollars world champion fuck yeah percent hundred percent I've been a fan of that guy since way back yeah everyone's just finding out now these guys on our street Jesus I'm like well I'm on a hipster like I knew before he was cool man you know probably that guy but I like his resurrection I like the fact that he rebranded himself because you have to do that I see it in movies I see actors do it entertainment you rebrand yourself new package and then boom but also I was with him he said he went away he did this reality show yeah so I watched it but he said he went away it had time himself smile and yeah but what happened was he was on this reality show and Dan Lambert said it was terrible terrible experiences by himself all day no phone he had to go into the village to get food there's no fucking food like was the island I forget somewhere in South America but that the experience was it was several months and it was a disaster and he didn't like it at all and and then it forced him to think about where he's at where it could be and one of things he was saying is like all these split decisions and he was thinking like why you know why did it go that way instead of the other way like why did I lose that fight instead of win it because there was a lot of them gonna really close yeah and he was thinking actually maybe I could just done a little bit more and won that fight and then said why am I thinking like a fucking peasant he goes why don't I just knock that motherfucker out and then and so that shift in his mentality changed and then also need mercs Donald Cerrone mercs Darren till mercs Ben Askren beats of fuck at a Nate Diaz like he's a different person now and now he's what he could have been he is potential realized like he's our rebirth he's had a hundred percent he is that 100% right then you get in the cage with that guy he's everything about boxing maconel oh yes I'll make crazy Yasmine come on he's got em all I mean his thought is like hey man I can do more than Conor McGregor did and I'm not gonna fade yeah yeah you can and I think because I watched the fight again it's different we can watch it live when other words in their life I saw tears coming back and he was in the third round and I was swinging towards Diaz I thought maybe he won that round but I watched it back and I'm like he had all three yeah you know and Diaz was like I said he was coming back put on the scorecards yeah I think he already had it and a couple of those rounds you could make an argument for ten eighths yeah he beat the fuck out of Diaz round thing he hit him in the gut and Diaz tactical move in move just dropped down mm-hmm just drop down say hi coming my god cuz you know you probably got hurt to party yeah I heard one of them honey I understand that right right body kick yeah it's like Diaz trying to block it on and he just went right underneath and the thing I hate as well as sparring is when you kick the elbow you have cracked it elbows so hard and yeah top of your foot is so soft it's a real skill like Darren told Hanson as well where they can sneak you mm-hmm so is it as a different angle Eugene taught me how to do it so yeah I love it I love it's one of my moves I hit up to VARs with it as well before I swept them mm-hm yeah you have to learn how to sweep just right underneath you got your eyes now still now you know like interesting guy I saw him last year but on the press conference leading up to the Bronson fight no I haven't said look I can't wait to do it man I know one day will clash and it's just because of the styles yeah like styles make fights yeah you know and he's got a style that I like very basic but when I say basic I don't mean that would do respect would right I say he's got strong basics of stout he's a southpaw he nice straight left nice body kick curves the left he knows how to change it up and in the clinch as well when he gets close I like what he did with them Gastelum yeah he played the distance game well you know I learnt it in the third round I kind of learned it in the fight but gasolin was doing some what happened a third round and I in the third round I knew where is like right after the fight me even worse if I would like fuck that's what he did that's how he got so close and we knew already but it was hard to call it in the fight because we were too focused on other things but I think automatically through muscle memory I was able to take that distance away from him in the fight and then from the third round but first I think for the first round and some of the second round he was able to like use it's a little hop step everyone knows you know it's a little much they hit jab me jab me put it in my face it's like a little to do so you're calculating his movement yeah I'm not doing it this way I'm doing it like internal muscle memory which is your memory of fights and sparring and knowing what you can do versus knowing what you see him doing yeah and just like it's like a dance so you're hard to explain to people you don't know why you look at a guy and you're like listen to me that guy's gonna fuck that guy up and people go what are you talking about listen to me that guy's gonna like when Anderson Silva first fought Chris Leben yeah I remember the odds were like real close and I pulled a friend of mine I said bet the house house on Anderson he goes e-series I go bet the house I go bet the house yeah I go this guy's an assassin this is a different thing you've seen a different thing I'm telling you this is of this is one of the rare the fucking sky has to fall for him to lose no one knew that's the thing no one knew who it was until that happened I had watched all those caged warriors fire when he was standing in front of Jorge Rivera letting him punch him in the face he just rollin was as well as well people don't understand this they said ah fuckin casuals yes I like it a lot of experts as well have casual brains cuz they're like you know Israel has no knockout power cuz he hit hand this is silver in the face clean I'm like you don't understand miss Anderson is playing the game where me and him are playing this game so when I hit him I didn't hit him clean I'm not trying to hit him where he is I'm trying to hit him where he's gonna be hmm then he knows that as well so he'd anticipate that and then pause the distance is just right so it just makes him there's a time I kicked him in the face and I slowed it down to my histogram doesn't want I'm just like my toad you see my toes and Mowgli as forth like the top lip and I went that felt it yeah nigga knew it we're playing this game but I literally I was trying to hit him where he's gonna be but then he paused and then the punch was just so it looked cool yeah look like I didn't hit him clean right I did like he just whipped playing this game and people don't understand people who've never fought they don't understand that game you're playing yeah it was beautiful me I love that fine people try to who's boring nose I fucked on iconic men that was this I wish he had left after that fight man cuz I wanted to be the one the people that was a great fight yeah but this is people that don't have an appreciation for movement and like what it takes what it takes people don't know shit about MMA no most people don't know shit about everything exactly yeah I mean there's a lot of people out there that are experts yeah don't know shit about what they're talking about the thing about Anderson and you is goddamn I would have loved to see that fight when Anderson was ten years younger yeah you are a warrior out right now I'll tell you how it goes how's it going same way I went you know why why he's never had someone do to him what he's done to people hmm cuz then what I was doing to him making him jump making him do whenever he did this mm-hmm that's all for gays e that's all you may not be crazy is I I've used it a few times me you know it means it's an interesting term it was there was a limousine company in New York and I started writing bad checks and so those checks became Fugazi checks it's fake so with Italian yeah yeah it was it was a limousine company called Fugazi limousine so it's not a real word now well is it is it just because pression Fugazi yeah yeah so this company started writing bad checks so anytime that something's fake it's Fugazi uh-huh yeah there's something new every day like home oh yeah yeah so whatever I'd like faint him or make him jump American react you know like I got you hit like right trapping it's come fifty two blocks right what it was there's no he didn't through his career fighting really good fighters great fighters but never an elite kickboxer yeah never an elite world-class kickboxer like a world championship caliber file of yourself not a well not a kickboxer but definitely something like you said good fighters but the guys all the guys that he beat of that error they couldn't last in this air it's a different time now the game has changed the game keeps evolving and it like I say that's not disrespect but it's just it's it's if you had me in my prime right now with my mom even in my prime kind of in it how many now 27 do you thirty I try likewise likewise likewise but um yeah it's just pretty much the game of inches a game of fake in the game of ha gotcha right now do that better than him yeah I feel that and dude this is a guy I've loved and I've you know fucking Gaghan and G is about him the whole fucking career like he's a fucking I use wrong words yes I know he's literally like a fanboy Dover the guy as all Korean I've studied him I knew what he was gonna do before he do it like when he tripped me I was getting up and in my head I was like okay here come they're flying me and they whoop I did like literally I pressed eject I was like get the fuck out of Dodge I said the way honestly I was I'm not and he just have the case like at one point even I hit him in the tummy I did I hit him in the tummy and he touched me in the coming and I was like he goes let me try I was like no even when at one point as well would he put his hands down and not like we're playing that game in this rain I wouldn't stop doing that I threw my hands up while I stopped doing that there's no one on this fucking planet if you put your hands down and chin up there I'll tell you stop doing that but no hands down shutting up keep doing that but whatever reason I said stop doing that and I said that and that's why that's a question I have to answer like after I retire and see because people were like oh did you hold back on and I'm like fuck no I was I rocked him in the first round and if I had dead in him I was trying to I was trying to win but yeah I still have love for the guy and I respect the guy he might not feel the same but he's some he's a gun yeah konishi told me like i'ma get like he would beat let me know what to do he told me like I said don't lose focus and that's why even right now like I said form oh I'm like you know all the shit is cool this victory tour you know rating this shit around it's nice but I want to work yeah to the mix champion on the percent man was it weird being across the cage from him knowing him like only one more one moment there was one moment and it was in the third round and he went to that he's like come on it puts us back against the fence is what he's it's a Bisping mm-hmm any fart kicked him in the face like come on okay and then like kinda set there and I won't pause I was just stood outside I'm gonna wait to and it was maybe like seven seconds but just a split second in there dowsers like holy shit I'm fighting innocent silver this is my time my back wasn't nice right here then he came to the center of the cage and then we kept it going boy yeah done fighting oh my god it's for moments like this fuck the bill its iconic moments that you know like ollie over I'm Sonny Liston yes yeah I just left it at home framed signed by Muhammad Ali Wow yeah shit like the outsiders for someone sometime and that's gonna be framed almost smells so beautiful man and I this is Rock Lee even something like this some synchronicities that happen so this is from this anime the first fight I watched in this King Google this pull it up Jamie what is it Rock Lee vs. Gaara GA ara this is episode 46 of Naruto and I was the first fight I ever watch that got me into the series and what is this anime series Naruto I've only seen it online it takes too long it's a 720 episode fucking's yeah 720 episodes yeah so he said this bit right here he takes the the weights off he takes the weight off or you can watch the highlights and then literally there's some heavy-ass weights but he fucks up Gaara but I did the stance Rock Lee normally does I did the stance that he normally does in the weigh-ins and Anacin stood there like Gaara he probably doesn't even know what that is well he just stood there like this and shit like that it's a tied you to fight it just like when life imitates art without even trying you know what I mean and I edited it I got some guys you know shots to call Crafton Blackburn effects they edited it for me to make it look the same as this but literally yeah shit like this Jazz's me oh man I'm geeking out right now fucking nerd ha ha shots of John Jones aye sir do you call you nerd yeah I know my feelings there is not negative man of course yeah I'm not sure skills bow hunting skills all that there's nothing wrong with being a nerd man I mean nerds run the world fuck you alone yeah kids man like don't peak in high school men especially the Nerds huh I told them I've spoken to some schools now and I just tell it might look and New Zealand's got the highest you suicide rate in the world and it's cuz a lot of these kids literally the air they paint hey you think this is gonna be forever like whatever they feeling the depression being believe me fuck would and it's different now because of all this shit yeah like Scott you know in impression what people attacking you and I just tell them like look it's gonna be fine this isn't forever at the end of the day they will peek now like when I go back to where I grew up in Rotorua when I see some of the kids I used to fuck with me I'm like I was scared of you right I literally even when I close my eyes now cuz I was I I had a lake growth spurt I can see them I visualize them and East I still see them as bigger than me but when I go back they're like short and dumpy and go like five different kids to three different baby mamas and working at the same job for the last 12 years and I'm just like man you were in the first 15 rugby team you were the man I thought you was the man but now I'm the man well I never feel any kind of world that I don't feel only two of them ever apologize but I don't feel like cuz I'm petty you know I got chips and dips on my shoulder I'm that guy but I don't feel the type of way where I have to like shit on them cuz I understand kids are cruel kids are dumb and I see it this day and age I see it like they don't even know what they're doing while they're doing they just fucking angry little chimps from hormones and know what's happening ocean I would have told myself don't think with your penis that's advice I'll give young man no one tells them that no one yeah jerk off first then think 1% that's right no what's this no nothing available sure that's nonsense what that's a good way to my lost on the first day three times Nelson mantric shit let it go try to keep it inside their body that's a nonsense cuz then it's age jizz I give you know if you haven't just after a while we just look at it yeah it's like whiskey yeah I know I'm feeling bad about drinking it now it's alright yeah what is that no nut November get out of here that's stay confused yeah you're gonna make a lot of bad choices there yes yeah how many times have guys made bad choices I was trying to explain this to a woman she was saying that men are assholes and they pretend to be someone so just so they can fuck a girl and then after they fuck girl then you see who they really are listen they don't even know who the fuck they are when the guys telling you they're in love with you they mean that in that moment and then they come and then they're like oh widening what did I do I gotta get out of here yeah like they're not it's not that they're being deceptive to you they're being deceived as well yeah I had a whole bit about it that when you have a boner that you're bit you you are like in the back seat of a very long bus there's another dude driving the bus like where the fuck is he going like this you're watching your life take place through a windshield 50 feet away from you that's what it's like from that don't do it man yeah if you might come you jerk off first and you go out with a girl if you really we won this thing by the way the sober October Rd we didn't have a championship this year all we did just for friends yeah we could thing we had to do ten classes and read 500 pages of any books okay we just decided med school see that's something you can get me on yeah last year was too crazy with between Tommy and I'm old machine yeah yeah he was doing some crazy shit to trying to move away yeah they were all trying to lose weight Bert I told him if he gets down 205 he could have the solar October belt saying but uh what's he right now he's about 300 we're about 235 we go to there's guys who fight in the 205 pound division that weigh 235 on Tuesday then they fight on Saturday and they wait they weigh in on Friday at 2:05 oh you can do it you can do it but you know this work on the Burt parts going to Burt you know it's a discipline issue so I think he's coming to New Zealand as well he's already is in the Burt American birdie boy tour yeah she no kidding I need to get a gig out there my man Tony Angelo said if you want to come through he can suss it out okay yeah he's looking forward to everybody said like get in contact with him I was like I don't know what I'm doing now do a gig and then take a few days and go hunting bro you would love it man even if you take your kids and just like there's a lot out there yeah it's really expensive but I'm sure for you they'll they'll cut you out there okay yeah easy as it's nice spot and they'll take you to one of these ranches where you know you can get you either like my advice go with you gene I don't even come my goat ujin he knows like some shit and he knows the skills as well or you can go to these ranches where they have it for you where you can get one of those like a big red yeah my first time my short one dead was a big red and I remember like for downwind with track that took ages and he's surprised how the guy who owns the land old man but he was fucking kicking our ass men like me but he's just like a mountain goat just trekking tracking device to hiking it's nothing to it every day yeah and then I get there and then we like takes about maybe 10 minutes because they're all there and I heard yeah this thing and then we like flanked it properly we're not it was a down one we're upwind away from it that's the one I want them to smell it you want to be downwind so the only ones coming to you yeah so they can smell oh yeah yeah and then I remember like hit it boom right there you hit with a rifle Yeah right yeah yeah I don't know how to use a bow yet yeah then yeah yeah yeah Cameron said he won't ever yell yeah he said well I'll wait inside meantime any time I want to fight first only oh man but then she dropped right there Darren dead and then I went up there and me and my boy rod as well my tattooist he shows me how to like section it up and then there's a slinky in there like that's to call that on the baby so you take that out slinky yeah it's like the baby that an infant that's in there oh you've shot a female female yeah so she dropped there come on literally yeah right there and I call this link because of the way it moves I'm assuming so yeah so he disposed of that because the pig is gonna eat it it's going to go back to the earth all that kind of stuff that was the first day and that was my big read in the next day we're going we're on the fucking already called the ATV and then I don't know where we see two fallows the smaller ones and they're up on the ridge and then my coach Doug Doug Devine he's a k1 champion as well from Vegas right now and then I shot it and I didn't hit this one that's clean so then like we have to Trek all the way up mmm like you know all this kind of shit you know what do you call them on sting a needle yeah annoying and then get up to it you see it trying to like the vegans gonna hate me for this but then I was like oh shit okay and then yeah finish it off yeah have to you know do the right thing so I get the rifle right I'm there I'm looking at it and then and then Doug's like this is up after about 30 seconds he alright I was like yeah hold up just have to like you know scared I am like nah but then I realized the shit's fucking two feet in front of me I'm using the scope oh yeah yeah and that was it she was done you couldn't find this and then yeah weird yeah too close you're all fucked I was gonna like a brain fart moment cuz I was I was just used to using the scope so I'm like a fucker using the scope when the thing about that in front of you so I just hit it boom point-blank dead I had to do the same thing in the 50 rashad stop suffering but then one thing I really enjoyed was afterwards when you have the section or right there and this is the thing man if you can't my personal philosophy is if you can't hunt if you can't kill what you eat don't eat meat don't touch it because you don't understand where it comes from and eventually one day kind of like you what you have now you have your own operation I want to have my own operation I want to have my own like land my own property run just like bang bang bang yeah stock it up pigs Organa yeah and it's different man it's a lot different especially won't you have to section it yourself mm-hm the fallow I sectioned myself the big one I gave to my butcher friend to make like garlic sausages and salami all that kind of stuff beautiful and then yeah rod taught me how to section the you know what you use your hands wet you put it through the skin and acts like a knife and it's very tough too it's actually a good technique and yeah it was fun but it's been about two years now since I've been back in the bush cuz you know trician know so much stronger it's so good for athletes for someone like yourself oh my god that fallow deer and stag that nutrition is as good as it gets yeah wild animals no I think even everything was before the Bronson fight because long story but like after my debut I'll go back to this but like pretty much the the Bronson fight before it was when I realized how you eat affects how you think and how you feel your mental health no sure cuz beforehand before the fight before I couldn't wait I was eating like shit like literally just cuz you know I cut way easy so I'm just eating everything whatnot and then throughout that camp I was getting like I hurt myself as well remember I mentioned I have to push my press conference and then I had to take a whole week off training this is like five weeks out and I had to make the call like fuck we're gonna pull from this fight so we don't leave it to lace that I can find a replacement or take a whole week off come back Monday and then see how we feel and then doing that hey write a proper you know I was a little bit like the president shit like that because well even already but that week transitioned everything just cuz the way I was eating and the way I looked after my body and then when I got back to camp boom and I realized through that camp and also reading Charlemagne's book as well the shook ones oh yeah it kind of helped me I listened to it yeah I listened to it too so yeah yeah well that's a good one to listen to - because it's read by him yeah he's such a sunny interesting Orion and the way reads they because I listen to brilliant it's as well honest yeah he's on I mean like for a guy like him to talk about being fucked up with anxieties like people like what you talks about crazy shit nah people don't understand man like even my boy chance he's with me right now you know like for me I like to cuz I'm on this journey now I like to take those I came up with me I bring them on this journey like I went to Dubai I brought my brother with me so I can inspire him I went to Nigeria I brought a B with me you know cuz he's a Nigerian I told him after this trip like be careful cuz you're gonna you know holiday blues you know like when you come back from a holiday you feel and you every one all these Instagram hosts post take me back you know with the bikini shots and whatnot that's holding my wing get back home you're gonna feel it and I know because I've experienced it as well after my UFC debut I literally my half the party was three hours of just hi nice to meet you hi now what I literally went to go hide somewhere and some guy found me he's like bro you alright what are you doing I'm like I'm good I'm just chilling he's taking five minutes alone oh yeah now yeah I understand a and just sat next to me I'm just like fuck alone means you yeah motherfucker and then after I go home like you know go to bonus got a nice check from the UFC and then got depressed and on the site the feeling yeah like I'm home alone with my own thoughts knows like what the fuck I didn't get that you understand this well even just because of everything that was happening I thought I seen a therapist straight away just cuz I felt like no one teaches you how to be famous there's no fucking Pokemon and I've seen a lot of people at leats movies singers rappers and rise and fall and I'm not gonna be one of those people but then I went to a therapist from October from February to October just kind of like learn some tools to help me with this and then so after my first fight I happened my second fighter happened my third fight Brad survived right main event fucking all the stimulus it's like coffee you drink coffee and then you get all the stimulus you're hype and he come off it and crashed yeah I quit I quit it to the same thing and then those tools that I got from my therapist really helped me just kind of like navigate back so New York was the first fight I got back to my house and I was is that right boom I know how to attack this I know what's gonna happen and I was anticipating because beforehand I didn't anticipate the hype that's gonna happen the wave after the fight like after this fight I already know what's happened like I knew was gonna be like more than everything I've done in the UFC already so I braced for it and I prepared myself and I had the right people and the right tools to help me ease back into my regular routine so I went back home and was just easy what was the feeling of depression because obviously you had this spectacular result you won yeah and then but what what was it what was the feeling like what was bothering you if I think about it my debut when I got back home sit down um it was just like I don't know and I hate trust me I love fucking the Herc's fuck fame i don't like me in famous but I love the perks a lot of perks but like when you get back home and I'm with that's why I like hanging out my dogs on my cat cuz they don't say anything I can just be I can just exist with them I don't have to entertain them when I have to talk right contrary to popular belief I'm not always extroverted I'm a Coast baby I'm a crab lion cancer Leo a crab lion I can go you know both ways you know God's all right like a semi chop but you know but like yes so I can when I'm home by myself I'm just very reserved I like to be my own thoughts I like to be in my own space you know I'm like well horny had to do in Panama or wherever he works yeah and the feeling was just not it's almost I've heard of impostor syndrome mm-hmm I I'm not sure if I'm saying it if I'm using her right but I don't know I want I don't want to say that's what I had but like you almost feel like you don't you don't belong yeah like I don't know I don't deserve this everybody has yeah so why not so I had to go through that for my first flight my second fire my third fight and like I said I wasn't until the Bronson fire I just decided to fucking own it because in New York yeah there's this clip on YouTube of this guy he's walking around Times Square normal just chillin nor pays attention to him and then he goes to he goes comes back at nighttime and then he's hired like security camera crew he dresses the part and he's walking around trying square he's just a regular do like a YouTube content creator and then everyone's done - like who's this guy oh can I take a photo yeah cool take a photo yeah cool and then like the camera guy goes up to random people and goes like so how do you know his name's Brian how do you know Brian how do you in there like ah I saw him in spider-man you know yeah I think is pretty good you know and then let the guy go to another guy you know so what do you think about his last album and I uh I mean I didn't hear the whole thing about heard a single on the radio and people just lying through their teeth lying through their teeth about who the fuck this guy is when they don't even know who he was I experienced that at deja vu fucking crazy in Times Square in New York Madison Square Garden I experienced that in Times Square like literally shooting from our brand engaged shooting some shots for them so is embedded cool around me Mike and I'm not even trying and at one point I kind of just cuz I I'm always noticing everything around me and I see people like some people recognize where I was and then I saw people like I can hear them like who is he in the same person come Amen big fan you're can i grab a pick I'm just like alright take a pic and the next person like eggs and hi can I get a picture and just take a picture and they don't know who the fuck I'm somebody likes you exactly this is all he's famous no and they just want to get that shine so shit like that kind of humbles you and lets you know you can get caught up in all that shit man talk about hype a lot and I'm like fuck it just own it New York was when I decided like I'm not gonna feel like I don't belong just own it this is my life now well I think what you're doing is you're taking the mentality of a high level striker and you're applying it to Fame because you don't want to get caught in traps you underst the pitfalls like if your your chins up you drop your hand if you you have a tendency that someone can exploit you gotta go home make sure I mix this up make it show them different moves you you you don't wanna get caught in traps yeah I don't want to get caught never yeah that's but that is also what happens with Fame you get caught in your own traps you set your own trap yeah I know I make my own mistakes I won't crash into a pregnant lady Barbic my own mistakes sorry I'm taking all the shots come get it well when you and him started going after it you and John John started going after an Instagram I was like oh no let it be known he started it yes he started it why had he started it was I thinks I'm the freshman I'm the guy that he wishes he was and he's a fan trust me he's a fan he's my biggest fan and I think he sees himself you know like man I could've been that cool you know fighting fuck all this up and he sees me like the new freshmen getting all the shine getting all the hype he's still the champ yes and he's still undefeated normally normally girls fuck that's how much it was bullshit man I'm not talking I'm tryin he was just trying he was just trying you know I don't mean Matt Hamels probably broke yeah you know I'm saying he hasn't fought forever yeah he's undefeated he's the guy I think yeah I first watched him fight because I was a fan it was UFC 94 Penn vs. GSP too and he fought Stefan yeah and just hit him with some stuff hidden with that spinning elbow hidden was that a double over hood lateral draw shit who fucks this guy you know and you know the comparisons were always gonna be there like with him and this is silver wit wrestling and when I came on the scene AUSA's Jones a better striking I'm like and I said it from the get-go I would outgrow those those comparisons I was like oh they're gonna forget about this so now they're not comparing us they're saying ooh let's watch them fight yeah I like the fight I said this is July um after the I think it was the MMA awards I was in my hotel room and allegedly I might have been stoned but I looked allegedly I was fucking stoned and I was looking across and I could see where the stadium being built and I was like for whatever reason just decided that's where it's gonna happen it's such a fucking crazy fight the way it's gonna happen it's just boom letting go to heavy weight I'll drag him back down I'll drag him back down and I said like 20 21 is the time cuz I don't want to disrespect the game I'm not gonna hold up the division the division be held up long enough by Robert fucking means sick and being injured and you know romera not making weight and all this shit I'm like let me do what silver did which was honored the fucking code and actually be a champion and defend the bill so I'm gonna do that I've done it once against Robert Whittaker the winterim champ so I'm gonna do it again his killers out the Ivysaur cannoneer in the weekend and he's the fucking beautiful dude man such a nice guy he's a brother I was a killer exactly he's the dark horse he's the darkness everyone thinks Romero is everyone things cost there's the one not he is the god like I'm stalking him I've been watching the men he's another guy that's made a shift mmm over the last year and a half or so Jarrod's made his shift where he's just become more and more serious more and more dangerous and you watch him when he took out Anderson so when he fucked his leg up Jesus like yeah he's on an audition it's not a mission I see a man almost slipping they'll never catch me slippin unless I slit them in a ribbon he's got fantastic genetics too and there's a tank see I saw when he was fighting this guy a heavyweight he was heavyweight yeah you walked him down with his hands down yeah happy wait yeah I'm gonna shred it yeah back go all the way from heavyweight to 185 that's fuckin phenomenal I think Nelson should have done it to be what do you think about that kid Edmund Shabazz Ian I saw his fire I didn't know who he was till um it was Tim I'm saying his last name right right yeah till um what's his name um Tim told me like oh shit then I rewatched the fightingest is he alive I can't remember dude he's 21 any health rights of ours with the head kick and I kind of got my attention like oh shit who's this kid he starched him with that right hand and you know that's what I mean like he's at 185 he's 21 yeah he's on the come up and just beat I played with Brad for five rounds he starts him in one round you know I'm not taking that likely yeah I look at that kid eventually when it when he comes up you know I'm sure I'll see him at some point but that's what I may not need to get back to work don't get me wrong I understand working yeah but like I wanna you know you know more oh yeah well that country is well if I don't train that is the thing of pressure that is the thing of pressure of being a champion you know I'll never forget when BJ Penn choked out Matt Hughes to win the title 170 and I was interviewing Matt in the in the Octagon he was real honest about it was I'm gonna be honest with you this is a relief it was the pressure the pressure of all these guys coming after me for so long he was I'm glad it's off my show they're not used to it and that's why I said that about Robert um I said on record like I said he's not used to this pressure is an acquired taste it's an acquired taste not everyone likes it it's like caviar hey goosey oh yes some asked exactly people don't understand it and for me before the UFC there's a hike you know I jump in the UFC do my work hype hype hype all the way through yeah and I said I've been chopping this pressure for breakfast lunch and dinner it's easy to me the guy's been away the whole time I've been running through the fucking division the time I've been clean you know like staking my claim as a fucking champ and he's not used to this pressure and you'll come back fight you want to come up in the biggest show against me hmm I wouldn't even if I was a coach 16 months is too long to put a guy against me and I said he's not gonna be used to and he said oh you know I don't care you know this is it I fell as not as good as he thinks he is I was I'm alright watch this well the thing about the UFC is you don't get to now fights now they don't exist that's why I said I'm gonna come here ready cuz I know they're gonna put me in the deep end gonna put me against the guy so that's why I mean usually had the plan like we got to be ready for everyone yeah to be honest I'm glad it happened the way it happened I'm glad I didn't rush and people were like oh my goodness the boogie oogie strip and you have history I didn't want to be cousin because if I not like I'm glad all this shit happened to me no when I was 23 or 24 cuz I would have fucked up don'twe were shit you know but I'm happy that I've matured I had my metamorphosis when I was 28 and that's when a shift happened for me that's when I became trying to help a lot as well like being away from my comfort zone being in the mainland and hey my man Oh like trying to help me get ready for this cuz being a big black man in the mainland they don't really see people like us all the time fighting in my first Stadium show in China in front of 40,000 people being mobbed in China all that stuff I just use this rep so I was like okay this is all preparing me for this this is all preparing me for the big time so when this time comes I gotta be ready and I gotta roll out do you have a very wise way of looking at the future and I think that's what led you to getting therapy when you started feeling a little weird after universe 5 I mean that's a very intelligent to seek help to try to figure out okay there's got to be a good way to handle this and I need tools yeah there's a stigma around it as well everyone I mentioned I think I put it up I put my own on my Instagram story after um my wooden against Robert Whittaker I went to a therapist that Monday the session was supposed to last maybe an hour and a half we finished in 30 minutes because I saw her two weeks beforehand the week of the fight and then I saw her after the fight and literally was like cool I think we got what we needed all right I'll see you if I need you again but then people were like all so brave you know you come out and you know if people with mental illness and oh my god hashtag I'm like I'm not a is it not everyone is mentally ill but everyone has to look after the mental health yeah and you will get sick if I start eating shit drinking all day I'll get physically sick so if you don't look after your mental health then you're gonna get mentally he'll then they're gonna put you in a straitjacket yes and all that you know yeah you don't want that so for me I just have to look after myself I don't want to end up like 2007 Britney you know crazy we had shaved though I think she looked alright that's also where you're dealing with a young person and when you said about that you're not the youngest-ever champ I don't think it's good I don't think it's good to have that kind of an unqualified success at an unqualified you don't deserve it but yeah unprecedented Tyson like Mike Tyson you talk openly about it man I mean now you hung out with Mike no I was supposed to this week but he's busy so another time well a little core to it dude was do the hotbox together he's a nice guy man and he's he's so philosophical about his past yeah and the way he's very garbage yeah garbage yeah he doesn't like to even think about who he doesn't like to work out yeah because he doesn't want to bring that ego but I think seeing my friends as a gana when he's ripping yeah but apparently he's gonna train Francis they said yeah that would be interest really Gypsy Kings gonna do MMA I'd love to see it man if Vicki actually like once he gets that first leg boy fuck have I done but now you better get it before you get in the cage I'll say that you ever see Shannon the cannon Briggs talked about when he uh when he fought in k1 I listened to that oh my god I was like take this amount he fought Tom Erikson big cat yeah motherfucker I'm a natural 290-pound dude that's wrong oh he's gigantic Erickson was all Berg like beautiful like built motherfucker he kicks cuz he's someone as well I think yeah for some more eager looks and then you don't want the whole patch if you have to hold vo2max kickboxing for him he can break arms men and or he used to be a boxer he only just learn how to kick and now I've been watching him he's turning his hip over he's also a former King of the Ring champ as well current King and ring chain like literally he yeah bones oh yeah every muscles yeah I'm also and you don't you don't want that I was at Beverly Hills you just to way back in the day in the 90s and I watch Pedro his Oh kick the back hey hey check Pedro has those legs are both of my legs glued together that's so big his phone that even now even now still thick but he was in my opinion the best heavyweight in in the history of MMA the best heavyweight leg kicker Wow he would throw leg kicks and my one is everybody hard donk oh yeah Oh swing back oh yeah that's a different style good stuff yes well I still I do mind there's many types of leg kicks people don't know mm-hmm I guess many times these levels to this and he had this one where he'd like swivel his hip like he'd almost just like a Barbie like take his leg and juice mm-hmm yeah almost like a low brazilian kick yes like a sec yeah yeah but low faito so did he did the question mark kick better than anybody who's that remind Wahby Feitosa fought in k1 okay he go to Robin blacks Twitter page from today he posted a glaube Feitosa KO glaube i mean everybody knew the question mark kick right you go up the middle and then you go around this way to a head kick butt glaube will go up and down this crazy way like his hips swiveled he had it he had the dexterity of that down in just this crazy way that very few because like you would have your hands up in a good position he would come over your hands and drop down on your face yeah at an angle I've done that before it's fine just like this is years ago I'd the dad would say to who do you see in Robins page he retweeted it earlier today he retweeted his own shit which is hilarious it's like when people at you your own comment I'm like yeah that's my page why you gotta at me I don't know it doesn't mean anything but just fucking Pepe's a hundred percent giving up on reading my hat I don't read a goddamn thing that comes my way you just just spitting into the wind if ya come out once in a while like if fight week is when I have time the best fall was New York New York I get there early and this guy was already me fool cuz you see like in the notifications when you scroll up I'm on this guy again so I was I got time today boom I went out of man and I was some fan some fan and he was like I would say you know hey Israel I like winning this dance and I started going back and forth with him and I scream recorded the the interaction and then eventually after the fight I think maybe about two weeks after I roasted and posted him he changes his scrammed name shit got reported I was like oh the fuck wit like Dana sometimes if I have if I if I got time today I got time to like John John the same thing one day I just went at him cuz he was just going back and forth on Twitter knock-back he was going to forum I just kind of ignored him I was living my life and like sometimes two weeks ago I was just like you know what hold my beer well he's not coming he's not coming after you unless you're at threat yeah exactly see watch the video play the video Feitosa there it goes no no watch this left cake man oh and they does the fusion I've seen that before and okay one ultimate knockout highlights so watch the the motion of the kick when Robin Burt breaks it down sweat this look at this watch this the final part watch this shit right here watch this son come on who the fuck does the whole glob a is the master the question mark kick to the point where they call it the Brazilian kick man I mean but he almost did it different than a question mark kick because essentially he was making it look like he was throwing a body roundhouse kick he wasn't like the real question mark kick is like a front kick that you turn into a round kick yeah but he globby was throwing it like he was throwing it to the body and then last secondly this shit well right here is my favorite part I mean this is like a wet background kyoka shit yeah kill you shit look at this come on went over the guard over the garden just like better than anybody on it better than anybody and then finish off my baby had I mean he had a weird way of moving his hips that you go man oh no how many people can fucking move their hips like that Kara yeah yeah that was a I mean sometimes someone that just develops a way of doing a kick that's like different than everybody else yeah you know even now like usually likes to make fun of me he's like you're getting old my why he's like it takes me about a week for my hips to warm up before the Kickstarter like happen the way they're only should I'm like fucker so he goes back and forth with me on that but I'm getting inside been doing yoga for a while I kind of slacked off a little bit this camp bought offseason I'm gonna get back into it just cuz I'm 30 now I mean I don't really feel older that's the thing like it's supposed to magically suddenly sneeze and blow your back out and all this shit 40 yeah okay is that before you should start wearing only thing I've notice is just a hangovers take a whole day no that's all that's the only thing cuz I get some liquid IV yeah Oh Vegas boy I had to ask first cuz you know you saw that you can oh no like what IV is a drink liquid IV they just pour it pour it in the water okay we hydrates you much quicker is it like a brand yeah it's a sponsor of the podcast I guess what is it like it hydrates you two to three times faster than water alone it's like drinking three bottles of water yeah yeah please thank you yeah it's very smart scientific concoction I will take that'll help you yeah I mean there's a lot of little tricks you can do to get rid of the hangovers glutathione is another one glutathione is uh it's for the name yeah it's I don't know what the exact term what kind of molecule it is specifically but it's included me is it a but it's glutathione exactly glutathione but what it does is it helps your body break down alcohol and accelerated rate mmm yeah and a lot of times people take it while they're drinking or take like homes over yeah just drink some more yeah cuz their hangover that is alcohol but I don't drink that crazy though I'm not like an alcoholic oh nothing well doctor Carl Hart explained that to me yeah yeah he said that's what a hangover actually is is your body's withdrawals from alcohol that's why people say you know what's that expression uh something the dog that bit you was what is it uh right there the dog yes by the hair of the dog that bit you yes like so when you're hungover you have an extra like a Bloody Mary that's what Bloody Mary's are for it's like the hair of the dog the hair of the dog not bite the hair of the dog the bone but the hair of the dog that bit you so you don't want the whole dog you just want a little bit I guess over that hump over and that's what blood it enters out yeah Bloody Mary's are like just a little drink in the morning yeah just a little bit with tomato juice in there somewhere to pretend that you're fucking healthy but most of the brunch I don't know how dudes live in Vegas and training walk on that last time I was there holy shit so I was there in July for eight days the first three days I didn't my testing at the PI I was training you know no drinking nothing like that and then the MMA was happened the next five nights fuck me I was just want ice wanted to leave man well you can't help it cuz just you're in there and then it's just oh yeah cool wanna come to this club yeah we got the IP dance now that's where Jorge said he saw me at there shirtless it wasn't inside it was outside it was little women around me it was literally just people in the next booth boy it just looks that way and he kind of had a little flavor you know of what I said but I can't say all I said was like I know you know your boy but I want to see him cuz he's a bad motherfucker and I said I want to fight all the bad more focus of this of this error he's one of them so I mean I say you've respected that so respect to that but I didn't say nothing about you know legacy in life I don't find him I want to fight him I've called him out and when he put that out the video like you know why are you hiding am i I'm not hiding I want to fucking fight you I want that follow you I feel like that's the fight right now I mean I'll see anybody other mean a rebound rematch with Whitaker is hard to sell right now he starched him yes he's got to come back and do something the that is the fight the waiting so I think you owe Romero's the fire Coast has got an injury he just had his biceps repaired think you faked a surgery T no but um I just don't believe anything after Icarus man like after see I believe knowing that documentary fucked my painting man out there with the Diaz brothers dost Brock yeah those I met him he's crazy do like how he takes all his pictures and dad over his I did one as well I put the bandana on that sucka - I see you did you see but um yeah I don't know like he can heal up or whatever but give me your tomato yeah I said it I've said it I'll say it again I'm not ducking no one I ain't fucking docking nobody give me the fight yeah I don't understand the idea that he's lost all those fights so you can't have that's why your dinner you talked to Damon please Dana listen to me that you can make that fight everybody wants to see it on a percent a hundred percent of the hardcore fans want to see it all you have to do show a Yoel Romero heart I will do a countdown for that I don't do those anymore I will do it for that fight yeah I swear to God I look forward to the challenge man that's mine that fight I want to see it I want to see it because he's gotta find this man he's he unites those traps brain mysha mysha sir sir Knopf uh-huh I'm telling you my Peruvian necktie is tight now oh but I knew what it was I thought I had it before guys to get it like maybe 30% of the time yeah my man showed me some shit and he also showed me Khaleesi the Gaston fight do you know where that came from prove you next time no it's going to Sousa oh yeah yeah de souza invented it I think he invented it because well if he didn't invent it he fucking nailed it yeah and so we can to prove your neck time damn it beast is one of the lost beasts yeah my guys are loved watch that guy fight fucking prove your motherfucker with a big thick beard fought like a savage toughest shit more toughest shit Tony de souza people forgot about they sleep on there's so many great fighters from the old days that get slept on but Tony de Souza is the one sort of like you know like the Devon flew choke is Jason Flom flew but I think you gotta rename that though I want to rename the I want I want to rename the Peruvian once I do what osp's been doing because even like he invented the Peruvian necktie I think de Souza invented it he is credited as the modified guillotine choke yeah yeah I think he invented it that what it is is for people don't know what we're talking about it's kind of like a sideways guillotine we throw the leg over the head in the back isn't it looks cool man well it hurts like I was doing it like this with this grip and then homeboy me just showed you that again deep hmm and then hold it from here Marcelo I see a style though the legs over Tony Tony de Souza old-school yeah he figured it out man and it's all about that leg over the head man once you got that leg over the head like an electricity wait some more heavy weight so when you put that up on the back of someone's head and you go straight away it's a nice one bunch of people got at CPD always got it before a few other guys have got it I saw CB Dollaway one Doberman I saw that one but Islam like and the gasoline fighting the last by 20 seconds I had a front headlock on him and I thought about going for a - choke but I knew Eugene might yell at me so I didn't why would he yell at you just wanna just cuz I have the guillotine I had the triangle but it was slippery and also already winning the striking I don't want to end up like Frank Mir when he fought no geta well that was an interesting thing when you did go to your back you were throwing up triangles I was dangerous off his back this isn't isn't nothing this is a defensive guard but I was like he's attacking but I kind of knew I mean even though I hadn't seen it I know who you are like you're not gonna be a guy who doesn't have anything off your back like you're not gonna have a hole like that and I'm still like I'm still learning man I'm still a wipe it took me five years to get my blue belt you know hun think of all give me my blue belt oh yeah gently yeah i was like i'm still a wiped up with girl violence yeah haven't trained there but he's come over and he we are affiliated with the school and they have a program they don't just give it out but like they have to like fit them and they have a really good relationship with my coach Adam Johnson my jujitsu coach and analyst and also using Biermann so when he saw me rolling and stuff like that thing he's like oh wow that's great bluebell so yeah and then I bought fuck yeah I was just surprised that even get my blue belt that day I didn't mind I was like fuck yeah that's a nice wonderful life get from - you know it's what a beautiful yeah and I was even looking forward to train with them going to Ryan and then when I was in New York but fucking this thing will let me yeah skills yeah rolling with it maybe later on but like yeah like I just wanted to swap skills cuz you know he had they know some shit buy some shit about grappling man we don't know well Danaher is cheeky wee guy as well and he saw some shit you talked to that guy you look in his eyes there's a darkness in that guy's soul I saw on the podcast when he's talking to you yes he's intense he's like Professor X say that he's like the real live professor Eck's he's spooky smart 2spooky smart I was gonna swap some skills yeah I'm going to Ryan and what's his name Gary Burrell I branched off he's got his own gym now but he's another master yeah you know those guys are that whole it's really interesting what happened out of that whole gym that gym really that was that the epicenter of the revolution they sort of started this whole leg lock revolution and enlisted say why would you ignore 50% of the human body boom and then Danaher was laughter that's a switch why would you ask to see no was it was it really was cuz Dean Lister was tapping people with leg locks and heel hooks back when you would get booed you know I remember I saw Dean Lister competing Abu Dhabi in Sao Paulo Brazil in 2003 you know and those dudes we were there yeah yeah he's here cuz Eddie Bravo fought Hoyer grace that's right you said he said I flew over with Eddie and um I'm not crazy dude I've never been so happy and all my life even the last one yeah with um was it which Gracie was it the last fight Eddie foiler again well yes right in that spoiler didn't wouldn't tap he had him in what's called the what does he call the tenth planet nation so much but yes he had his legs like this and I could see his groin like about to tear well his knee was fucking I forget it's some nuclear word I forget the word vaporize vaporize dude he was ripping boilers neat apart and as a person who's had three knee surgeries I was watching him please just tap just tap it ain't worth it what's the pride but he wouldn't tap it with anything remember when he fought Sakuraba Sakuraba had a minute deep Kimura way behind his back all up like this where look like his his joints were ripping apart he wouldn't tap and have to fight yeah they stopped the fight I have to well they didn't have to let him get a shit maybe like some shinny mirror did that to Nogueira Oh bro is like yeah is that moment where it's just like fuck it is it yeah I mean his arms never the same again I mean that's that's a when you get that upper arm snapped like god damn that's a bad guy the guy he fights like a zombie he's the original yeah here it is you don't go this is Eddy is tearing his fucking knee apart I mean if you if you don't if you've never experienced what this feels like I've only experienced it a couple times it's a terrible feeling man it's a terrible feeling it's hard to explain what's going on here but oh wow yeah his knees yeah it's sideways and being mangled he's just look and Eddie said it kept popping and Hoyle is just dealing with the pain like right there that's the oh my god that his lawn Terrance mental fortitude man you know meant that whole family yes savages I mean there's never been a family that's revolutionized martial arts the way the Gracie family did inhaler was the most successful of all the Gracie's when it came to competition he was a multiple time world champion of course he has look at his fucking man Eddie Bravo's mangling his knee and he won't tap and Eddie's telling him just tap man he's like it's fine it's normal he's like dude your leg just popped five times he's like it's normal like he's happening again Eddie's got him wrapped up nasty and this is some shit Eddie invented yeah that's crazy about all of this I mean who lured to his credit just rather did his knee torn apart than lose was the last time the Indian came out Eddie probably we were just talking on the phone the other day and I was driving to this area with the cellphone was about to cut out he was telling me some crazy conspiracy and I was like bruh bruh I love you I gotta go I love you too man I'm sorry Shuji you're off I love to Filan he's so crazy oh my god he loves conspiracies he loves conspiracies like it's like his family number one jiu-jitsu number two conspiracies a new one maybe his friends number three and that conspiracies hope everybody can do it everybody see I don't know too deep about it but even fucking a chimp could tell you dog Marshall continues look man that guy Bill Clinton flew with that guy 26 confirmed times 26 it might be 28 but 26 confirmed times I read that on my bro I didn't follow with my mother 26 times now how's this guy fly with Bill Bill Clinton flew with a pedophile 26 times over the period of some Island years fuck Island the old fuck Island that's what everybody else called it or how to defend against suicide I'm loving these B's read yeah they snapped that guy's fucking neck man is that Eddie they said his neck was fractured he said how do you do that only hanging yourself can how do you how do you hang yourself in jail dude they come out eventually the even Michael Shermer who's like a professional skeptic he's the editor of skeptics magazine okay he says probably conspiracy even him yeah he said what the cameras are down the cameras weren't working they killed that dude no one's talking about it mmm no everybody knows I mean there's that leak where that ABC reporter was saying that ABC squashed the story three years ago that was just so Hillary was on forever no and he kind of accent hey joked around with her yeah but she laughed about it yeah I thought it was one of those um what do you call the thing that deep fakes mm but it was real well here's what's crazy she knew that guy yeah she knew that guy and that guy was most likely murdered in jail mm-hm and she was laughing about it yeah like cuz Trevor Noah said how did you kill Jeffrey Epps with a like hahaha but that's like imagine if you knew someone like in your husband was flying around with that guy and this is like a someone you know you got to know pretty well like you've hung out with him at cocktail parties like you know like maybe you've known him for years and then that guy gets murdered and then somebody asks you how's your murder I mean you start laughing you gotta be weird you gotta be a cruel heartless person to think that's funny that's weird about it weird she did that same thing with one good Qaddafi stuff that was even like that was different though because that wasn't a joke yeah did she said we came we saw he died ha ha but I was someone that wasn't her friend someone who wasn't a friend right this was someone who she knew and you know Trevor no and listen the way the daily show works for sure they told they told her beforehand yeah she couldn't sprung that on no way oh wait you don't spring shit on every goddamn Clinton question so yeah that's a shoe and they're like oh ha ha ha she's got to know you respect her she's got I mean there's no way she's coming on that show unless she knows everything's gonna be ok so when they they brought that up and she starts laughs and she knew that shit was coming guarantee you guarantee you guarantee you they they're not free-balling on that show come on later on I'm sure to come out later on some people know too much man yeah way too much it probably will be one of those decades later things we find out you know that's some some guy on his deathbed says he killed Epstein yeah cuz Clinton paid him off you know who the fuck knows who knows who that guy who knows what that guy knew I mean that guy that that guy was a professional blackmailer you know I don't know who he worked for I've no idea is more like fuck I might just be the tip of the iceberg shitload of things we have no idea yes yeah yeah surprise all that kind of stuff gets into politics as well with like um sex trafficking you know what no it's like right well I think we're billionaires you can get a guy like that like here's a lot of these guys this is my thoughts a lot of these guys are freaks and then they're in the public eye so they have to maintain proper puss we know Bill Clinton during the 90s in particular there's no internet fuck he was fuckin like just fuckin up a storm he's a wild man and you know and there's a few alleged rapes you know yeah as alleged sexual mean I don't know I wasn't there but there's women that are accusing him of sexual assault and rape so you got the Monica Lewinsky thinks you know he's a free get his dick sucked by 20 girls and the wife relations that woman you would and then when they bust him he's like well as to what I thought sexual relations were but you got to think there's a lot of those dudes out there yeah that's why they get into politics in the first place well in their 60s so they got into politics in the fucking 80s and the 70s they got into politics as they wanted to fuck they wanted to be the king they wanted to be the guy with all the power they wanted to be the Alpha and so then all the sudden the rules change because of the Internet so then they got to figure out Jesus I can't do anything anymore what's up fuck that's the only line yeah so what they do is they find a guy who's gonna take him to an island where there's no rules I am Geoffrey Epstein's got this place he brings in these girls from Czechoslovakia and they suck your dick into your head explodes let's do it Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada you're on the fucking the boat head is the island with Clinton you know no one knows ever know you buy an island you don't the fucking intelligence agencies give you money they give you an ion they set it up yeah someone from some agency whether it's Mossad or CIA or whoever the fuck it was they had a concerted effort most likely to try to bring these creepers and bring them over there attempting them and he know how to do it I think they probably do it as well as like having shit over them yeah that way they can have like they can get them to do things for them exactly decisions bills that need to be passed you know fucking example the the marijuana reform I'm like look we all agree now like you know everyone smokes everybody you know like Apple like everyone's doing it so they're gonna legalize it can't they just have like a group chat or something and you're like okay all opposed say nay all for it say I why does it have to take so long well the concern is pharmaceutical companies have a mass of concern about loss of income that's big one even in New Zealand right now it's taking so long to get pushed and I think they're at the tail end of it they can't hold back anymore it's gonna fucking burst that's what it is those people have to set up their own businesses and whatnot so when it comes to boom they're first in line sir - in the most egregious example that is what happened in his home state of Ohio Ohio tum story but they did logon well I've actually been since we brought that up last couple of days I've been reading and that was like some misinformation and that's not exactly how it even hurts so I don't know oh we're not there so I don't know but the the bill was making it so that only if you come to one that didn't pass a few years ago and the one that passed right oh no no yeah but the one that was proposed for a crack the most egregious example they proposed a bill to legalize marijuana but no one could grow it only a couple companies could grow and they would make all the profits why exactly so there's no one can grow well it's just a horseshit and by the way this is forever like they were like for life bitch really my life yeah they're their idea was that they were gonna monopolize the state a market so everybody was like fuck you you know we'll wait when I went to MusclePharm I was and um this is in Denver where we call it um most of farm that was the name of the team like Dillashaw elevate elevate yeah like right next door this big hangar and I'm not a scientist but the smell in the air where they growing skunks literally all just like they growing weed like literally could smell I was like there are now minty man yeah I love the smell that's a beautiful smile Warren and weird thing as well as like as a kid because of what I was told and when I was perpetrated whenever I'd smell either beer because I didn't drink till I was like so I found bourbon I don't like beer at long story but then I didn't drink or did anything I was a goodie boy you know still a good boy but once I smell weed or be right they reminded me of homeless people because of what I was taught as a kid but no this is dot now I'm like with a party yet ya wanna relax make difference yo bro yeah wheat is a great one man because it makes people more like more comfortable with each other it makes people friendlier it's sort of how we smoke around certain people like I don't know that's just for me personally because I if I don't feel comfortable like if you know you can get into a situation I'm just like why is that guy on this phone cuz sometimes you see people like this is the worst one man now these days people just like this and then they just you see their phone just right you know they're filming you yeah my why is your latex in this way you gotta take this way so cosmic weird man I'm sure you get it all inside you all the time I would love to do deep bong hits around Donald Trump yeah you don't have to smoke just hang out in the room and see what's up just take a beat about these kids in cages but even just talking to him high as fuck would be weird like bro do you why don't you just quit no mom man just get it he's one of those guys he likes the game he likes the game I'm sure he's my favorite comedian of this year man I follow him on Twitter just cuz of the shit he says like it's fucking hilarious man you can't not respect it he says some funny shit yeah sure one of the funniest things he ever said was when he put when he was thinking about buying Greenland yeah picture of Trump Tower I promise not to do this Trump cow in the middle of his footie Donald Trump is reportedly discussed making The Apprentice White House holy shit rating do you imagine this turns the White House into a set for a reality show shit holy shit who's that dude producer Mark Burnett oh that's Mark Burnett he's buddies with him see I knew him from The Apprentice I watched the first two seasons when I was a kid you're fired yeah I remember that that's his that's his move yeah I've heard some other things I guess you said you were gonna do that but you didn't do it well they offered it to me when I was hosting Fear Factor the second time around was like 2011 but I talked with my family but I didn't want to live in New York for three months and all that nastiness I was like yeah I'm not interested not interested you know and I want to pull my kids born and raised here yeah it just didn't seem like a smart thing to do it just seems like something I'm gonna be annoyed with yeah I didn't want to be angry at anybody I'm just not that guy I can't feel it always know miss months and months of your time for me it's like I want to get fighting know like after my fight I kind of like cuz we're Marvel Stadium I kind of systems about Marvel like you know I'll see you guys to know whatever I said yeah but after fighting I right now like I said they're coming from me so I gotta make sure I don't want to end up like some others in this game where they get that you know distracted yeah look at you know Hollywood in the shot so I get some offers coming on my table right now and I'm just like yeah those cautionary tales are there they're so readily available for you to consume look at Ronda Rousey yeah Ronda Rousey's the best example she's on top of the fucking the way they all came coming and she said yes to everything she was doing everything man she was doing movies she's doing interviews she's writing books she's doing and you know one thing you got to give it to Conor McGregor I mean Conor McGregor said no to all that shit when he was on top he said no to all that shit I've learned from her from him yeah John Silver everyone Mike I've seen the highs and the lows of this game in and like I said I'll make my own mistakes but guess what I'll bounce right back I always will but it's better to make mistakes you make less they way you're approaching things yeah you will I know me that's Eugene he sees me every day like as far as sometimes I'm like like the same rhetoric I'm your biggest fan or you inspire me or this and I'm like I appreciate that if you can take inspiration from the story that you've seen through TV through media fuck you and you know go hard I'm sure is it weird still seeing your face on people's stomachs just very strange yeah yeah like there's a guy um I was in Dillon shout to Dylan he's got my face on his thigh I met him in a club in Oakland and yeah I flew him plus one to my last fight just cuz I was like yeah I got a have to tattoo his face on my thigh now I don't know if you get a style better tattoo get a free ticket to your put it out how many people you think would do that it's crazy motherfuckers will do it just for the law it's like no just for the free tickets Israelite asagna the last stop and incorporated I do not agree with the sentiments of jørgen in the last speech yeah we would have to do it at your own risk how about this we'd have to prove that you got a tattoo style better before as long before this day yeah so this is like you can't do it on it is only to the other guy's name that's what you know you only know about two I see three there's one chick from somewhere in South America the Brazilians remember her name she's gonna stop being on arm so she look she's I see so if you were fucking a girl your name tattooed moves that's dangerous that's Russian roulette son or Evert if a chick has like maybe your face on her back or something and some guys hitting her from the back like this that's the third eye looking there girl with your name on it though if you met up with a fan who had your name tattooed or your face tattooed on her whoo that's risky that's rushing we met with portable and make sure people are around for that one yeah everybody allegedly I don't want cash no bill calls so I have my hands me take a picture you just like do the Keanu Reeves float the floating hand yeah yeah catch no bill I know they coming man I know because I've already foreseen everything that's kind of happening and I know this kind of shits coming so I just have to make sure you know like Edison says stay focused you know don't cross my T's they'll make sure they don't catch me slippin well you're looking at it the right way because you realize that right now you're at the this it's like a funnel right you're at the opening of the funnel where it's gonna go the options cuz you're you know you're newly crowned as the champion yeah and as you defend the title and start Merkin motherfuckers and become bigger and bigger and bigger and then the UFC puts you in more and more promos your pay-per-view sell more and more you become an international star then it gets crazy then you can't go anywhere and people are screaming when they see you walking to a restaurant even after my press conference in Melbourne before the fight after the press conference the one that the guy with the megaphone was fucking fucking with me on after that that night what was he doing yeah just some I'm sure someone planted I could even ax Robert after all I did you paint that guy he's like no I was like you should have cuz he had a megaphone and the whole time he just kept on interrupting me on one that I was going back and forth with him but I liked it because guess what if he wasn't there ought to be the boring press conference Robert saying he's not gonna say shit backtracked already but after that press conference I lit up in the alleyway spoked up and I walked around Melbourne with my air pods in and I just walked around the city and at one point I just sat at the tram stop because I didn't so I can just sit there and people just going back and forth like I just sit there I look normal and just like soak it all in because I know eventually I won't be able to do shit like this I gave you an in Perth did the same thing after breakfast the next day just walked around just enjoying the view and joined us being me cuz I'm not saying I'm gonna blow up I know I'm gonna blow up yeah you're gonna blow up Isis yeah you got it you just gotta understand what it is and it's gonna get it Oh listening and what you said earlier about Fame is very very smart then you said no one really tells you how to prepare for that and what about you how to deal with it when you were young I got a slow drip I got the fame a slow drip yeah I got a tolerance for it because I became I was on television in 1994 and nobody knew who the fuck I was I was one of eight people on a not so successful sitcom it was a great sitcom it was not so successful and then I had a couple little television gigs on stand-up comedy shows but nothing big and so I would I could like kind of sell a weekend at a club but I had to do morning radio I wasn't famous but I was a little bit known and then Fear Factor came along that was a big jump that was the woman oh yeah that was a big jump that was a big jump because then I was on a giant hit television show that was iconic was on for six years 148 episodes it was absolutely telling that was a big jump but then there was the podcast which came after all that and the podcast was like a slow run it was like it was slow you were famous before the podcast yeah yeah I was famous but then the podcast changed everything so how did you deal with it from the big jump from you know just a comedy in a comedian to fair fact the guy how do you like I used to I just got used to it and I'm also like you in the sense that I don't I don't want to get caught up doing stupid shit I don't want to think about things the wrong way yeah you gotta get what's going on she's your girls in the window who dad five more minutes that was she saying five oh do you have something hard we're working in New York literally they're marking you yeah off the chain like a runaway so I don't like publicist being yeah yes five minutes fuck fame is is a trick that works on other people but shouldn't work on you hmm you gotta know who you are on the percent that's the thing if it works on you you're fucked because it's like if you're a magician you really think you pull the rabbit out of the Hat I think one thing that helps is martial arts you do to help its strangled all the time that word man this is so be using I've said it but I'm like and I'm like what's humble especially in New Zealand this is culture of like people even like Bay they don't like me because it's all he's notice he's not humble like a true Kiwis no you know like the All Blacks you know humble and what they mean and I've actually put this what does humble mean and someone said oh you know you just don't brag I'm like they just mean downplaying your success yes you know so if anyone like me rocks up and just I'm owning it I'm like you're owning it yeah a champ I'm the champ your hand they say or not he's not humble but I tell you what humble is when I have Dan hooker on my fucking neck hangman yeah humble is when I have Stephen Moore be cracking me with the uppercut humble is when I have Carlos kicking me in the body and making my liver go that's true humility yeah but mean like trying to act or dull my shine just to make someone else feel comfortable that's not homeboy and I see that there's a problem with that like crabs in a bucket thing when tomorrow was about to win the title a reporter asked me like you know oh there's a part of your whole hope that uh komaru loses so you can be the first Nigerian middleweight champion I was like fucking what what report in the press conference they actually I was like I don't think like that that day then I but that doesn't work yeah he was hoping I'd say something like that he was trying to I see them I've been someone already like I don't do any interviews with them if they talk to me I just next I you know I that but the episode of Black Mirror we blocked someone I blocked him don't report with that and you know they try they take a cheap shot they don't understand like that's you man now you're that guy that takes those cheap shot yeah and everybody's gonna remember that yeah you think you're just trying to get make some noise make a little pop but you're creating bad energy and also the reasons not you're trying to get something from now you're not thinking along jeopardy yeah because in the future I'm not gonna talk to you now what is it about Nigerians that why are nigerian so clever all these internet scams like when you hear about internet scams it's Nigerians right Nigerians come to America there's one of the most successful groups of immigrants in all you all the fucking countries hundred plus whatever countries Nigerians murder it when they come to America there's something about there's a work ethic but there's also what cleverness yeah to Nigerians like what I've said it before I'm the runt of my people brain wise and body wise cuz when I went back recently honestly man you see people who are just bricklaying and they're jacked they're ripped some of them and they don't maybe have the best nutrition right now but they there's something about the genetics of our people is a warrior race and not us I don't say that likely I'm just being honest right it's different you know and I think also the culture cuz I was doing algebra in school when I was like seven and then I went to number one I when I first moved to New Zealand form one I had to do form one in three different countries so I started form one what you guys have your form once a like first grade I don't know how it is but pretty much I was 10 years old and I moved to Ghana for a little bit not gonna eat it again then I'll move to New Zealand not to repeat it again cuz they said not he's too young he can't be doing that but thing is I was in the smart I was the bottom three in my class so I wasn't the smarter the smartest of the bunch in Nigeria in Nigeria so when I came to New Zealand form one remember my first thing in school they had a test like you know early workout or something on one of the first weeks of school and we have to do times table and I knew the song in my head so I just like finish miss and all the kids like oh and I'm just like the fuck and then like they all thought I was this fucking savant this genius and then like this guy asking me questions like you know do you brush your teeth yes I do do like back home do you ride on lions at home and outside mommy's fucking kids are dumb my kids are stupid like I didn't know I didn't understand I just felt like you know I got you regular shit like I but they didn't understand me so yeah my people are different man honestly and I'm like you've seen it and I'm telling you man especially right now the what I want to do in Nigeria I really I want to introduce them like take the football soccer ball out of their hands and show them some gloves mmm we have some great boxes we have this thing called dumb B which is Nigerian wrestling kind of like the Senegalese type restaurants okay some beasts but dumb B you know they wrap rope around the one hand just one hand and they just pull with the other hand and they wrestle and they throw strikes but also they have like some juju some black magic you know all that kind of stuff but they sprinkle that anything I got my own as well 3m you know literally I can't wait to like show them like cuz when I went back I also want to just chill low-key sneak into the country boy dad said it can't happen they're watching you everyone knows who you are from the airport all the area boys is right there so yeah oh my god can I take a photo police officers showing what's up showing love crooked police officers some of them show up and like I didn't realize like they they stay up to 4:00 a.m. to watch me and come on fight Wow they staying up and I've always said I wanted to be the guy like what Pacquiao was to the Philippines yeah you know the way when he fights the whole country shuts down crime drops everything I want it to be like I feel like after this now it's gonna keep blowing up and I'm gonna go back next year I'm gonna go back next year I'm gonna I hope I hope they see the possibilities because I'm telling you man the country I mean it was um Brazil at first in the early stages of MMA then Japan then America then you know like it always goes back and forth and then nor the Oceania people right now we're doing some work I'm telling you once not just my gentleness the Africans once they start stepping in it's gonna be like my 50 cent dropped in the club and it killed the whole game for a while honestly I'm telling you like they're gonna run the game for a long time for a long time and I'm I'm happy to be a guy that's kind of like paving the way it's crazy though what was it like going back there being the champ going back there it was beautiful like just seeing my people it's different when you're in Vegas and I go dude I'm gonna be straight on my was different when you see like a kid just in shock that you're even standing there like just in shock that you're in his presence and for me I don't see myself as a stockman I'm Israel I disown you at the end of the day but when they're looking at you and just like you know in this kid I remember like he's on my Instagram he was kicking her back and I just showed you I tweaked them I just told him there's a pivot on the foot stand on the toes and turn the hip literally within a minute he improved this kick like that and I got it on my Instagram so many but man I was really impressed and that was just a little snippet of the of the the creativity of our people that way oh man it's gonna make me cry it's this is my old primary school man like going back here I was looking at I used to hide it for hide and seek and everything seems so small cuz when you're a kid everything's so big this is MIA I think Leckie Beach just chillin with the people man I was immersed in the culture seeing all those kids their uniforms on grabbing at your belt that is honestly man it was like it reminded me of goosebumps again and my name is John here this is just um the stadium I went there to go watch and then the guy that the trainer was like hey you're not training I'm like what do you mean he's like you are training get up okay I had my fucking nice Jordans on and I just had to like work he made any I think he was trying to flex he was trying to show me like you're gonna work you right let me put us to work and that's me on holiday as well it's open state videos people watch this yeah go go on omg omg um what are called AMG axis it says Israel the last style bender at asagna information EMG YouTube engage media group that's beautiful yeah but there's some more we're doing the documentary right now cuz and they've like Jeff's been following me around since 2015 and I wanted like this is the I want to say this is the end of the first documentary but the beginning of the next one I want to show what I can do in Nigeria what I can do in Africa because even though komaru went to Ma Coco probably almost as well not almost died their words and there were some killers you see how that play go back Jamie go back see how that place go back for it it's like a maze go for it yeah see how that's like a maze yeah the first day we went there I went there just trying to like show love to the hood say what's up and all this area boys like oh god what you to do here like what are you doing here I'm like I'm just looking around either I kind of you most set to loss but you gotta sell them you gotta make sure they all right as I don't worry we'll look to you guys but then within the first five minutes meant I'd be all about my friend who came with me he's like we gotta go because he's very smart he's very wrong so we're like I and I had a guy with the egghead with me a security guard and the guys the gangsters they were kind of flex and I was like fuck you guys then so the next day since that asshole in me I went there shirtless all my chains on the fucking vest and I got like more security with me with more a case and we went deep wouldn't have to go deep to get that sky shot and Jeff hates me for it cuz he fucking panicked the whole time and I went deep and there's all these killers men like literally I'm talking like you see scars and then like marks cuz that's the bodies the body counts and shit like that and this one dude look like Kimbo Slice and he's like the head honcho and he was arguing with this other guy because they were saying like no I'm giving them the Torah what they give us is my money I'll sell it to you and he's like no I'm you know I'm the big dog you reported me and they were kind of having an argument about it and it wasn't real heated and if they wanted to fuck us up right there and say fuck you guys that's a fucking maze they know that shit like the back of their hand right I have no idea you know we're fucked and you were walking through exactly and you're walking on planks and the water you saw the water park and dirty like disgusting you know but that's like one of the slums in Nigeria but then you see the before the shot that was Victoria I love that so that's like the contrast of my Jeremy you have dirt poor and you have well-off like Lamborghinis like people living nicely those are all this side and people yeah but its smartest for us and that's the email shit is so old now that's why I don't know not your uncle don't check your emails I mean I hear em Prince don't worry you'll get your money just waiting it's just the the fees the fees gotta like the way the bank account set up all that kind of stuff yeah it's amazing that they figured it out to the point where that is synonymous with scams it's like you saw the Aryan scams yeah yeah you hear about and that's a thing like whisk amiable a lot of them is because of the opportunity they're so smart but the opportunity isn't there so they can't go to school they can't do that so they'll hear about the guy who sold a fucking airport that didn't exist to Japan really remember that one a Nigerian dude sold a fucking airport when wasn't a Airport where wouldn't ya I know many people do that with like buildings or Airbnb but that's a fucking Airport Airport okay bro he's sold an airport fuck the Japanese responsive and that's the thing yeah we talked about it like a couple of weeks ago yeah it's bonkers yeah they they spent a fuckload of money was like in the 80s or something oh really yeah they gotta make a movie about that they should here it is 242 million fuck off sold a fake airport for 242 how do you do that like I'm saying this is like this is not the best representative by people but let's see how smart well if you're stuck and you got nowhere out and you live in that maze that's the way out exactly you got to do what you got to do why when I was in Dubai I should say the story I was like ah ha ha fuck it no one's listening we're on the boat for someone's birthday party and I'm seeing all these kids like 17 16 18 with like I stout Rolexes you know I'm gonna yacht partying for some guy's birthday and they just out there flexing and I'm just lying what do you do so I invested in Bitcoin earlier uh nah yo boy Yahoo boys cuz you know why I knew already but thing is they're so smart they know how to work they know how to like and they all over the world like I said we're like a virus weird my germs everywhere wherever you live in the world where everywhere and we have our claim but I can't wait till this documentary man like I really want to like show people over there like what we can do I want to show first of all the story like it's not gonna be like you know McGregor's documentary was dope well it was more catered to the MMA fans and anyone can watch it but I want this to be more like the soccer mom can watch it you know so on from the burbs so from Alaska can watch it I still relate I wanna it is different there's different levels to this but I'm looking forward to really putting that out are you thinking about opening gyms over there in Nigeria yeah yeah yeah eventually I want to kid out some of the gyms like the one I went to the the stadium sports stadium oh is that I want to help them out with some stuff that's later on when I go through it right and normally I do things like this like when I went there I did some stuff but I don't do it for like it's real we're on this platform and I see people trying to do shit for the likes yeah I mean I cringe because I can't do that but well you have a platform like this and you can bring attention to certain causes and certain people then I don't mind using my platform for shit like that so I really want to bring some attention to my people because I feel like they deserve it but also they can earn it they can earn it and I know they can man I can't wait to show that I'm the first man or kymaro's the first I'm the second you see guys like Sadiq first time I was invited live have you seen my life yes Adelaide I was watching him skate cage side and he was hitting this guy with body shots you could hear them like the pounding I was just like wow in his last fight he showed some like what he call it on some fortitude as well cuz he got hit he got cracked and then he cracked the guy dropped him I'm telling you man he's a few more coming I can't it'll be fantastic if you open up a gym there instead of being a proving ground a train of gym I really want to open the chain of gyms even maybe they'll have the UFC gym but you know they can get involved yeah they can get a cut oh well you see I'm sure it'd be excited to be on that now you know me BAC was reeling yeah I'd be a great thing for them to just say UFC I don't know if it's gonna be nigh durable UFC Africa either Nigeria Morocco South Africa but cuz even I have good places to watch over there do they have it's a hundred percent yeah what thing is the red tapes you got across I'm sure they can get through those I had that and do you see had that in China as well right now one of the shows I can remember which one this is one of the early ones that were threatening to cut the power after a certain time so you know they had to settle some people mmm to keep it up keep the lights on exactly and that's easy for them you know the you see they got much yeah I see they got a couple bucks a couple a little bit yeah listen man you gotta get the fuck out of here thanks for coming now dare they you're lying it's 230 men fuck off yeah flies in this room this is a time zone it is like the woody hyperbolic time chamber yeah brother I'm happy with what's happening beautiful love man my pleasure it's it's great to see that you're doing everything the right way man it's a it's it's an honor it's an honor to
