three-two-one yes hello Boyan hi there welcome thank you thanks for doing this I really appreciate it and I love what you're doing I've seen your TED talk I've seen many in numerous conferences that you've appeared at and discussions you've given on this and for people to jump into this right now what you've done is think long and hard and devise a method to try to clean up some of the plastic that we have floating around in the ocean famously the Pacific Garbage Patch is this enormous patch of garbage that's between California and Hawaii how did you get involved in this and what what you're a young guy hole do you 23 already 23 already you sound like oh my god oh yeah how old were you started this um I think I started thinking about this when I was 16 and founded this organization when is 18 that's crazy all you lazy fucks out there they're 16 years old that aren't doing shit with your life just think about this kid that's amazing I'm so happy there's people like you in the world no thank you yeah so you started thinking about it when you were 16 and you know this is something that is extremely disturbing to anybody that's paid attention especially when you see the birds that have died with all these plastic bottle caps inside their bodies and you know you see their carcasses with these multicolored caps in them and they thought these things were food it was just one of the many many many problems that occur when you have plastic floating around in just enormous numbers in the ocean sure yeah I mean there's really three problems with this plastic first of all obviously the ecosystem damage I think they're right about 800 species that actually could go extinct because of this plastic pollution then there's the economic threat in terms of you know damage to fisheries damage to tourism and things like that I think it's around thirteen billion dollars a year according to the UN and then thirdly there's the health impact or the potential health impact because these tiny plastic pieces they're actually also end up in in the fish we eat that take chemicals with it yeah that ends up on our dinner plate as well so what was it that prompted you to dedicate essentially dedicate your young life to this I sure yeah so I've always been very passionate about technology and just building things I think sort of having an idea in your mind and then seeing that become reality able to touch it and things like that I think there's literally no better feeling in the world than that so if I've been building my own things since it was two years old I think first starting with things like treehouses and zip lines but then going into sort of computers and explosives and rockets and things like that which was a lot of fun but it wasn't very useful I would say so it's kind of looking for something sort of a something that real to to to work on a real problem and that's what I'd been came across when I was 16 years old it was scuba diving in Greece and I came across small plastic bags of fish and I wondered why can't we just clean this up and that question sort of kept circling around in my head and yeah I sort of thought about how could we do this the ocean is pretty big I then eventually came up with this idea to use these net Rosen currents to let us collect the plastic and so how do you have many different prototypes that you started with and you eventually wound up with what you have now and have you started implementing him yet oh yeah I mean so the the the concept that was presented back in 2012 with my my first TEDx talk and if you compare that to where we are right now it's sort of day and night of a difference so yeah through testing and through all these prototyping --zz yeah obviously there has been a lot of development there but the the key idea has stayed the same that instead of going after the plastic with boats and nets which would take around about seventy nine thousand years to to clean up just this Great Pacific Garbage Patch instead of doing that we let the plastic come to us so use basically a network a fleet of very long floating barriers which are oriented in a u-shape and they float around and they kind of act like a massive pac-man so yes like like a funnel brings the towards it the network ocean currents push it against it moves towards the center becomes very concentrated and once it's concentrated well then it's easy to get it out and ship it to land for recycling and has this started yet over the past so we were founded yeah right four years ago in that time once that we did the reconnaissance so we map the patch with 30 boats and an airplane at the same time to really understand how much is out there which turns out to be 1.8 trillion pieces floating in this Great Pacific Garbage Patch and on the other hand we've done all the testing so we've done hundreds of scale model tests we've done prototypes back in Europe on the North Sea and actually right now we're manufacturing the the first real clean up system which is scheduled to be launched from San Francisco to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in around two or three months time so it has anything been used like is there a proof of concept of have you've done like real large-scale testing where you've shown that you can actually do this well I mean we've done a lot of subsystem testing so the the the prototypes in the North Sea for example where there are these 12 meter sections and we we managed though to to keep that in one piece so but then and also the plastic capturing that worked very well on the lab but yeah the real the real proof of course has to come from this one real system in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch collecting plastic and that's what we really hope to achieve this year so this is the big one right the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest yes it was carrot weaned California and Hawaii yeah so there are five areas in the world where plastic concentrates this is by far the largest one there are four others but they are they combined ly contain less plastic than this one in the in the Northeast and why do we know what it is probably because of Asia so Asia has quite a big problem in terms of that they they use a lot of plastic but they don't have a good infrastructure so by far the largest source of plastic flowing into the ocean is also this there's one continent and what's being released their naturally bite because of the currents ends up in this North Pacific patch it's such a strange problem because it wasn't something that was discussed in the 80s or the 90s it was nothing and then all the sudden somewhere in the year 2000 I remember hearing about the massive amount of plastic we have in the ocean and it just it just made sense I was like oh well of course of course it's gonna wind up there but the sheer size of it is staggering yeah and I think that to me the worrying thing is that it's a it's a persistent problem so yeah with many other kinds of pollutions when you sort of turn up the tap its will be solved by itself think about for example the the ozone hole with the CFCs but with this like if you turn off the tap the problem is still there and in a hundred years it will still be there so so I think to truly solve it you need to do two things on one side we have to close the tap on the other hand we also need to clean it out Jamie just pulled up a size comparison where it shows 1.6 million square kilometres an area twice the size of Texas or three times the size of France yeah so this is a study we published a few a few weeks ago so this was the result of the reconnaissance effort it's kind of funny like every other news outlet used a different size comparison so I think with CNN that says it was the size of Mongolia we always use vs. yeah Texas for America yeah we use Texas for everything more times California yeah so yeah it's pretty pretty big area it's insane and and it's getting bigger I'm sure yeah so the I mean the area doesn't really change is more the the concentration concentration when did we realize that this was an issue like collectively scientists geologists yeah so there hasn't been there have been sort of small sampling efforts since the 70s back then it was the first time plastic was described as being something that floats in the ocean but it really only entered the the public consciousness I think in the late 90s there was this this captain charles moore who were sort of sailing through it and he saw this plastic and he was like we need to describe this and then he did a scientific paper on it and yeah and actually i think he was the one that termed that the term Great Pacific Garbage Patch so he was riding his boat through it for long period of time I guess yeah I think it was it was participating in some sailing race and he went through it and then yeah he just saw that's so he was the sort of the canary in the coal mine I guess yeah yeah so what what is it one of those things where it's hard to get different governments to act on this because you know it who is responsible for the ocean yeah I think it's a sort of this tragic tragedy of the Commons right where it's international waters sort of everyone's problem but at the same time legally it's no one's problem so yeah and beside to that what I really felt when I started the ocean cleanup was that I think everyone wanted this problem to be solved but at the same time we didn't really have a way to do it there was simply wasn't any technology to do that and that's why I thought well perhaps this is an opportunity to combine my interests of a solving this program would be also developing technology which is that what we did is there anyone else doing this so there are many organizations working on the on the prevention side right so educating people think about policies those kind of things which is very important I think but unfortunately we're the only ones that sort of do the the hard technology side of it and yeah I wish you know more people will do it if somebody else would clean the ocean that'd be fine with us as well but until somebody else does it yeah we're kind of the ones that have to do that's so fascinating to me that are the seven billion people on the planet sometimes it really does just take one person to act one person do something about something that I mean I'm aware of many people aware of many people listening you've heard about this and and it's sort of one of those things that's in the back of your mind that doesn't affect you in a daily basis so you say well that's a tragedy that's a terrible thing but it's not my problem I have my own problems but you this one person decided to do something about it the fact that you did when you were 16 is so fascinating to me and someone has to do it right but isn't that weird someone has to but nobody was doing shit until you came that's very interesting yeah yeah it's sometimes wonder yeah sometimes people ask me like why why do you do it and like dance my answer would be like why not yeah why isn't everyone doing this my one thing that I was thinking was and this is my same feeling about pollution air pollution is that once they figured out a way to use whatever is in the particulates in air pollution as a resource sure and make it valuable then people are going to be running to extract it out of the skies and I felt the same way about the Pacific Garbage Patch and all the other ocean currents where they have this this issue so is it the currents bring everything together collectively into one area just because of the way the ocean moves exactly so you have these sort of current at the equator and then you have these boundary currents and it's sort of X like the yeah like the the sinking your bathtub right so it's sort of where all the plastic once again now is it possible to take that stuff all of that Pacific all those disgusting particles and use it for something yeah I mean sure actually a few examples with me in my bag but it's not here right now go grab it you wanna grab it no I do it a bit I can describe it okay it's a podcast anyway so so what we do is we take the plastic out and we recycle that we've developed a process for this and we can turn it into new products actually the the pair of sunglasses that finally be able to wear after a dreaded northern European winter they we already made that out of plastic that we took out of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch so you're wearing sunglasses that are recycled from the ocean exactly and and the ideas that we can do anything with this right so you can imagine sort of the part of your next car or in your chair or whatever you can make that out of ocean plastic and what we think is that the material itself isn't valuable enough but it's really the the story behind it so the fact that you can say well it's made out of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch which we think will add value so it's like the difference between a normal pebble and and the piece of a the Berlin Wall it's right one is worth shit and the other is worth something all right so that's what we kind of want to use as a way to to then be able to fund the the operations of the cleaner I think that's a fantastic idea and I think that'll be a huge value for people I mean I think people will really want to buy something that they know has recycled out of something that was choking fish and birds to death yeah and not only that but he does is turning plastic from the ocean into $200 shoes sportswear maker is teaming up with something sell three new shoes made with plastic pulled from the ocean wow that's awesome the kind of stuff you can do so I mean this also adidas actually didn't use plastic from the ocean they I think they just said that for from marketing reasons they then make that from plastic that was sort of they call it ocean bound so oh those lie motherfuckers god damn it they got him yeah that's bullshit so it's on the way to the ocean yeah which I guess any could be anything fuck it was like we were gonna throw it out we decided to make sneakers right that's horrible I mean still they're very cool I like I like them and I like the the people that work on it that's everything but that's a lie yeah well yeah a white like a little bit yeah but yeah so I mean the composition of the plastic that we'll be pulling out of the ocean is it's pretty unique it's it's quite degraded because of the decades of UV light hitting it so so we really had to develop a new process to do this so probably maybe in a year or so we'll be actually be able to launch the first line of products made out of sort of real the real deal the plastic actually coming out of the ocean that's excellent so you're gonna sell like raw plastic and is there an issue of who owns the plastic I mean even cuz it cuz is in the Commons of the the ocean in international waters I think it'd be hilarious if somebody would sort of raise their hand is there others my plastic I put it in there I think that we have another kind of legal issue yeah but if it comes a resource like oil yeah yeah I think there's some there's like this these Salvage laws if you sort of salvage something brought the international ocean you can actually keep it so that doesn't appear to be an issue but yeah definitely it will be yeah sort of closing the circle will be a fun project yeah I mean it sounds it sounds like an amazing thing and I guarantee people would be very very interested to buy things that they know were made out of something that was really a horrible side effect of civilization yeah I think if you have the choice between a normal Molly's let's use this sunglass example you know a normal pair or a pair coming out of the ocean I think 9 out of 10 people would choose that oh for sure I mean I think it would be giant for companies to to advertise that we only use a hundred percent recycled from the ocean plastic I mean yeah that would be gigantic how long do you think it would be before this could be a reality so the first system is currently being assembled so we are renting a former naval base in at the San Francisco Bay where it's currently being put together it's a it's still relatively small system it's 2,000 feet in length so eventually they'll be almost double this size but this is that this one will be launched in late June early July then we'll take it out the first the first deployment will not yet be directly in the patch so we're just deploying it around 300 miles of the coast just to make sure that it works well sort of a final rehearsal if that goes well then by probably around August we should be ready to take it all the way to the patch and hopefully soon after that collect the first plastic and then we hope to have the the first shipment of first plastic backpack import before the end of the year and we think there will be you know such a symbolic moment for for sixty years man has been putting plastic into the ocean and from that moment onwards we're also taking it back out again that's amazing and you you feel like you can get 40 percent of the Garbage Patch in ten years it's actually so with a fleet of 60 of these cleanup systems we should be able to clean up half this Great Pacific Garbage Patch every five years which of course more edible yeah I mean then you can it's faster if you want more sis if you'd put in more systems of course where are you guys getting funding from um so so far we've been very generously supported by by mostly individuals actually so ranging from people that just donate 50 bucks to to people like Marc Benioff he's the founder of Salesforce and a couple of other very high net worth individuals if someone wanted to donate how would they do so yeah just go to the to the website the ocean clean up calm and feel free to get in touch with us so mostly individuals mostly wealthy philanthropists yeah so that has gotten us to around thirty five to forty million dollars right now which has been enough to fund all these years of research and development the whole mapping of the patch as well as the construction of this first system right now so so that should get us to the point where it's a proven technology and then for the scale-up the idea is that basically any company can can go and fund their own system we estimate the cost of every system to be around five million basically you the system will be around a kilometre that's plenty of space for logos the world is watching so it's like this massive Bill brand floating out there so so the idea is that any company can sort of fund or individual even from the right system Nike could be like fuck you adidas we're doing this for real just kidding adidas that would be hello yeah it would be hilarious yeah so what is the process in taking the plastic from the ocean and converting into usable plastic like that you would use in sunglasses so the first thing you do is you kind of you wash it you sort it you scrub it to to get to Suzy's very clean sort of yeah fragments of the plastic then we we do there's a process called compounding where you sort of remount it and add some some additives and make it into what you call pellets so these are sort of these beet sized particles which can be fed into any machine in the world so say an Ikea machine for furniture or Tesla machine for for cars and yeah so that is and that process we we can add to custom develops tailor-made for for our feet stuck because it's such a unique composition that's amazing it's really fascinating because I think that that will be a hugely desirable form of construction like if you can prove that the plastic that you use was made and is actually it's a benefit to get that plastic and and and make things out of it yeah I mean the it's still more expensive obviously than just normal plastic sure we have to collect it from 1,200 miles offshore but on the other hand so so just by selling it as plastic I don't think that would be a good business but making into sort of going further in the value chain up to the the consumer I think that can make sense because again to use the sunglass example it's probably around a hundred grams of material so that would take about maybe a dollar to collect and you know what's a dollar on the hundred and twenty dollar pair of sunglasses right so so I think that really going it all the way up tune in the value chain that's where you can really add the value well you know one of the things that was shocking to me when I was investigating plastic is that I didn't know that plastic you can make plastic out of hemp that hemp plastic is actually biodegradable yeah and sugarcane and there are as many sort of bio-based types of plastic that the thing is though that there's you know this is very very sort of complicated and controversial world of sort of the bio plastics because you have something called bio-based and and if somebody got biodegradable so you can make plastic out of say sugar cane which is chemically exactly the same as plastic that was made from crude oil and it would take the same amount of time for it to degrade so bio-based doesn't necessarily mean that it's biodegradable and and vice versa so hmm so it's it's a very complicated world but even you know sometimes our experts on this on plastic pollution being confused about it so let alone sort of the general population so and you know in short there isn't yet sort of holy grille of this type of plastic that on one hand is very good in terms of performance in its usable life and then when it for example enters the ocean just degrades in a matter of days or months so but I think that would be you know that would be a great innovation is the quality of biodegradable plastic inferior to bio-based but non biodegradable yeah or it's and it's mostly limited in in the terms of applications so you can't really actually plastic does it feel different to the touch of you yeah so it's it usually makes more noise it's more sort of crumbly so it's brittle or something right mmm interesting well that makes sense right obviously it's gonna so if you're gonna make water bottles out of biodegradable plastic they're probably gonna leak everywhere yeah yeah that's yeah but that's not possible yet so they're compostable that's another thing you have compostable plastic which which you can use for water bottles but then the only way for it to degrade would be to be in sort of this industrial composter we have a temperature of a hundred degrees and and pressure and things like that and it wouldn't degrade in the ocean so it's a it's a very complicated area yeah and I know that there had Paul Stamets on who's a mycologist and he was talking about all the different fungus that could be potentially engineered to eat plastic yes another thing that they're working on yeah so of course it would be great to have them landfills I think yeah and actually it's it's it's a process that were also investigating for recycling because one thing you could do is you could take that plastic and then using either enzymes or indeed fungi and things like that you could turn it back into biomass so and from a biomass you could make anything else again so you could make bio-based plastic for example so does this change your relationship with plastic I mean when you sit there and you're drinking out of this plastic bottle do you think I'm gonna have to clean this fucking thing up someday yeah yeah but on the other animals are not against plastic because I realized without plastic say modern medicine would be very difficult not plastic a lot more food waste would be produced and without plastic we wouldn't be able to clean the ocean because actually a lot of the components of our cleanup system actually maybe can pull up an image of the thing being built right now yeah please terrorism so that's actually a lot of the parts of that are made out of out of plastic so so it's kind of ironic yeah it's portable is yeah yeah so here it is so fin fire with fire so yes I don't think we can live without plastic and I don't think we should want to I think it's really just about managing the material in a way that it doesn't end up in the ocean which means that an ad comes back to the material being valuable enough at the end of life because if if it's cheaper to recycle then to not recycle well then obviously it would happen mm-hmm and there needs to be good infrastructure for that and then I think as a final of a final safety net we need technologies like this to to sort of intercept it in river mouths as well sort of clean up the legacy of the sixty years that we're having in the middle of the ocean but I don't think we can live with that plastic no I don't think so either not yet and are when you're looking at the water and you see the plastic that is in this Pacific Garbage Patch on the other the other four patches how deep does that plastic go from the surface so so most of the plastic really stays on or near the surface so we've we've done expeditions to that for that too to measure it and that's actually why our system only goes three meters deep because that's so below that there's virtually no plastic anymore interesting so it's only about nine feet so when you're when your trunk when you see the little tiny itty bitty pieces yeah it seems like as the plastic breaks down over decades it becomes like almost like a gelatinous sort of chunky thing yeah it's called micro plastics you've sort of these particles that look a bit almost like grains of sand right which are really small even those we measured are primarily in those top three meters or so and another surprising finding I think from from those expeditions was that still more than 99% of the plastic is larger than a millimeter so larger than those those very tiny pieces which means that on one hand I think that's good news because that means it's it's not too late because obviously the smaller to get the more harmful they get they end up in the food chain but they also are harder to clean up right so so it's on one end it's not too late so it's the good the good news I think but on the other hand it also means that there's still 99% of plastic out there that over the next few decades will become micro plastics as well if we don't clean it up so there's sort of this ticking time bomb out there that if we just leave it there the amount of micro plastics could increase over a hundred fold over the next few decades and then we would be in a much worse situation than we are today so have marine biologists done Studies on the impact in that particular area in terms of populations of fish and marine life yes so so there's many species that that are being affected from one side due to ingestion on the on the other side through entanglement so actually another finding over study was that almost half of the plastic by mass is things like ropes and and fishing net mm-hmm which of course disastrous well first of all four propellers four four boats that go out there oh look at that photo indeed so aerial photo of a turtle that mean it looks like it's caught in a bush it's just this massive net that this thing is swimming around with this thing attached to his body that's one of the things that I was going to ask you about is cleaning up the nets because we had talked to someone that was explaining that every time they fish a lot of times they'll cut the Nets loose yeah so it's pretty combination of accidental loss and in and intentional loss but yeah I mean this this the amount of nets really was quite quite staggering and did you do you remember who was bringing that up Jamie somebody somebody brought that up that they just released the nets and that it's commonplace and it was stunning cuz we were like what every time they do that yeah the nets get caught and you know they get damaged so they just cut the nets loose yeah and the nets are plastic too so but that's insane that that's legal that they do that that they don't have yeah it's not legal but it's not illegal no but so they're lost for this but obviously how do you know that people do this right very hard to to monitor yeah I mean I guess you should probably have some sort of a GPS tracking on your net yeah I mean that could be one thing or you could think about need market-based solutions where there would be a financial incentive know if they bring their their nets to shore yeah then some sort of a penalization if they don't what is this Jamie the impact and abandoned ocean fishing nets on marine life I've been Kris Reiner Duncan okay that makes sense Google says oh man that is just so it's so sad that it's such a wasteful dismissive sort of thing to do just cut it loose and huh it's gone yes in the ocean no worries sure so that's I mean that's a very obvious kind of impact and then another thing that was also study done by us recently so we looked at the the concentrations of plastic versus naturally-occurring marine life in this Garbage Patch and then what we saw was that there is a hundred and eighty times more plastic at the surface than sort of natural food for for birds and for turtles and things like that so you can imagine if you are a turtle at the surface of this Garbage Patch and you sort of take a bite to eat there's 180 times larger chance that you eat plastic rather than a piece of plankton right right and what we found was that this this concentration is so high that it can actually have this this chemical impact where where these chemicals have a potential health impact on these organisms as well as species further up the food food web including us humans so have we noticed that have people been tested and shown to I've ingested plastic that they've gotten through eating tuna or something like that so the plastic itself isn't the thing that chemicals yes chemicals that attach to the plastic and for example you see is that for example in Greenland like the the Native communities that really rely on fish they have much higher cancer rates they have much higher concentrations of mercury so other heavy metals as well as these persistent organic pollutants these things that attach to the press to the plastic in Greenland yeah like the like these sort of these Native communities that rely on fish and another sea life so they're to eat this is a recent trend that they have higher rates of cancer yeah I don't know how recent it is but probably past few decades I can imagine but yeah that's really linked to their their marine their consumption of marine sources but you know obviously it's hard to say well how many percent of that is just heavy metals yeah versus for what's coming by plastic but sure if you yeah if you look at the kind of chemicals and you look at the lab tests that they've done with that those chemicals yeah they are not very good for you now I've heard that if you leave a water bottle like this in your car and it gets hot out that the water will plastic will leach into the waters are correct yeah so I think it depends on the kind of plastic but you have I think with this you pray the liner would contain like salads and things like that so yeah I wouldn't do that so there's you know when you look at those chemicals you have if two kinds of things you should I think worry but one is the chemicals that are actually in the plastic and secondly there's these chemicals that just float around in the ocean and then can attach to the plastic when they yeah because they sort of act like this chemical sponge the plastic wants to repel water and those chemicals too so they kind of act like a magnet towards each other especially the latter one is it's well studied and we see that a lot on the on the on the plastic but the the the former one yeah I mean it's even an issue here if your car for them it's an issue in your car like how so yeah well if you leave it like in a hot car and write right now a question was is even if you're scooping out all that plastic out of the ocean is it still leaving chemicals that will we'll never be able to get out so I think the chemicals mostly actually it collects more chemicals than it sort of leeches at so because of those those sort of legacy chemicals like the PCBs and DDT sort of things that were used for insulators and pesticides back into maybe the 40s to 60s so these these actually the plastic attracts those chemicals so in a way you can have also remove a bit of those chemicals and we actually have to wash them out before we do the recycling because you don't want those in your your products so there's actually some sort of a benefit to having those plastics in the water I mean not yet you would encourage people to put water but there is some some natural benefit um yeah I mean it's sort of yeah I mean I I cannot really say how many percent of those legacy chemicals we would be pulling out with the plastic but yeah I mean you could say you could argue it's sort of an added benefit to removing it not to having plastic in right now have you extended this line of thinking to some of the other problems in the ocean like these heavy metals well so what I really hope is that the area cleanup can sort of become a symbol of how we should use how we should use technology to solve problems of our time so when you and I think a lot of it comes down to that we shouldn't sort of protest what we shouldn't agree with but we should build the things we should build a future that we do agree with so when you look at the past few hundred years of modernity in our civilization what we see is dramatic positive trends in terms of health wealth education violence and we get Steven Pinker on your show so I think that's really positive trends and we've done a good job in that and that all comes down to our ability to sort of imagine things that don't exist yet so sort of technology and innovation and being able to work work together in an effective way which is think about the corporation so I think those have been a sort of very good trends and I think what we should do is we should also think about how to apply those to the area outside of our own species and to the rest of the environment because when you look at all those positive trends over the past few hundred years and then you know that that's so good but there's one very big exception which is the impact to the environment it's almost like we've had all the success at the cost of the environment and but I think that instead of there are some people that have sort of a more reactionary feel to this and they say well look at all these problems it was created by businesses and by technology so we should stay as far away from those things as possible and I think that's sort of you know that's sort of stupid I think that it really just shows that these are very powerful ways of getting things done and I think a much more effective way was to apply that what has worked in other areas and then also apply that to the area of the environment so so I don't think you know I for example think that the car problem is not going to be solved by banning cars I think it's going to be solved by electric cars and I don't think the the meat pollution problem is going to be solved by everyone becoming vegan I think it's going to be solved by things like lab-grown meat and and other kind of alternatives so and that's why I also think that yeah the urgent cleanup or the plastic pollution problem is not going to be solved by sort of people trying to do their own little bit and you know trying to live without plastic or things like that I think is going to be solved by you know things like plastics that do not harm to the environment as well as technologies like the OSHA clean up to sort of clean up after ourselves yeah and I hope that the airship can be sort of as some a symbol of that approach I like what you just said there because I've always thought that technology will most likely sort out most of these issues if we apply enough attention to it and that one of the real issues is when someone creates some sort of a new technology they really don't have the ability to see 50 years down the line what's going to happen with the side effects the residual effects and I think that's that's a big part of what happened with plastic and I don't think the solution is you know making an axe out of a piece of rock and living in the woods breasts I think that the solution is trying to have a long-term comprehensive approach to how we use various technologies and also various resources so that we don't have another Pacific Garbage Patch in some new technology 50 hundred two hundred years from now I mean if you went to the ocean 200 years ago you would see none of this now this is a very very very recent issue that's compounding at a staggering rate sure yeah so I agree with what you say there and you know it's yeah it's really just about so I don't think I think there's a lot of people that think that technology is inherently neutral like it's not good or bad but I think that's not true if you like compare I know some bio terrorist weapon which you could event or you could invent a machine to clean the ocean I would say I would argue those are not equally good things to develop so when technology isn't inherently neutral it means it's sort of deterministic so the inventor kind of puts a certain direction in the product already and I think that can be used in our advantage or to phrase it differently I think there is a responsibility at with inventors and entrepreneurs to to build things that are more good than than bad and actually plastic I would still argue that plastic is a net positive technology and it was once invented as a solution it saves a lot of weights a lot of people got hurt when when people use glass bottles and things like that back in the day this was invented as a as a solution but it has this negative side effects and then I think we should now think about well what technologies can we develop to manage that negative side effect and probably those have again a small negative side effect but you can think about it like a compounding sort of staircase of of net positive technologies I think eventually that's how we can actually solve these problems so in this country there's a tremendous amount of recycling but how effective is that recycling yeah I think the amount of recycling is actually pretty lonely in the u.s. compared to to other countries we always do everything better over here yeah what countries the best at it huh I think like Germany or Switzerland that's kind of country they're really one and what do they do differently they just I think they just put more money in it and I think most of the waste in the u.s. is actually being land filled so and what used to be recycled like she was sent to China but now like I think this year last year China said well no we don't want your waste anymore so so now I think there will be a lot of investments in new recycling facilities in the US now how does that get recycle okay if you use this water bottle and you empty and then you throw it in the recycle container what happens so yeah I mean very much depends on the location but to just use an example of where I live in back in Holland so they yeah they you actually they collect the plastic separately then it goes to a facility where they sort the different kinds of plastic they get out all the contaminants and make them into two new pellets and the problem there is really the lack of demand for recycled plastic because I think a lot of companies that build products because basically virgins a new plastic is so cheap they'd rather just do what they're used to and not they don't want to see any risks with their materials so they just choose for the safe option the the new kind of plastic so I think if you want to do if you want to promote recycling I would actually say well promote the use of recycled material because as long if there's a demand then you know the price will go up and then automatically more recycling would happen yeah there's very little demand for recycled plastic like it's not something that you hear about on a regular basis like people that are clamoring to get only recycled plastic yeah and I think that I think maybe that's that could be another nice side effect of what we do because yeah we can kind of make this sort of recycled plastic a bit more sexy yeah perfect yeah I think that's exactly what it is have you extended this line of thinking to other environmental concerns like you know pollution in terms of like chemical spills and pollution in the air and things along those lines yeah I have quite a few more ideas I would say but yeah I would really really wouldn't be good for the ocean cleanup if I would get distracted saying well I want you to farm those ideas off to other people because I think guys like you are insanely valuable like that one person really did sort of germinate this seed and get this project moving it's it's very unusual outliers like yourself you very humble guy I'm sure you don't think of yourself in an outlier but you most certainly are it's one of the most valuable things about civilizations the occasional person who steps out amongst the masses and does something pretty radical that almost everybody around them was aware was an issue and that's what you're doing yeah I think there could be much more people that do things like that yeah I think I would think so but I don't see it that's what it's so fascinating about guys like you is that this is not a very common thing to do yeah but it's a very common problem yeah well maybe that's because when you hear about people doing cool cool shit it's usually when they're already sort of doing those things and it's not when they kind of started thinking about this so then I guess people could be intimidated like how I don't know how to run a company of 100 people I don't know how to I don't had to get these things done but you know when I look back at myself four or five years ago I I I really didn't have a bloody clue of what I was doing well you were a baby yeah five years ago you know 18 yeah yeah that's a baby I wasn't even born yet no so so but that really doesn't matter I mean it's it's about just getting started Sean and being willing to learn and just you know being open to feedback and just trying many different things and seeing what works and what doesn't work if especially the beginning of done like hundreds of things that didn't work yeah the first time I tried fundraising I send a cold email to three hundred companies and asked to ask for sponsorship and I think one replied and said this is a horrible idea you should go back to school so so that wasn't right that one yeah put that one on your wall I will do that it's a good idea so so that was very successful and then you know I tried crowdfunding and raised a few million bucks and allowed us to get started so yeah so it's just about sort of doing this trial and error it so just like we developed a technology in a very iterative session it's also about just developing yourself I think in an iterative fashion and and sort of just just get started well what my point being is that when someone like you does make something happen and once you get the ball rolling you can be a catalyst for so many other projects getting launched because if you're attached to you like you're a person like you've got the fire yeah you've got the fire so you put the fire over here now this fire will start here let me bring an ember to this this project this can start and it seems to me that getting that fire getting that initial ember is one of those difficult aspects in creating any sort of technology in turn especially in terms of something so complex where you're extracting things that are potentially dangerous from the environment and creating a net positive effect and then using that plastic to recycle there's so much good car lack of a better word attached to something like that and and for a person like me when I hear that your sunglasses are made from the Pacific Garbage Patch I get excited I'm like ooh where can i buy these fucking sunglasses next year yeah well I'll buy them that that that does get exciting to people so it seems to me that this excitement that you're bringing is contagious and you could potentially use it to spread other ideas that could also be environmentally positive yeah well I certainly hope that other people will think about sort of what kind of the ocean cleanup can I build which isn't cleaning plastic from the ocean so so I hope people sort of already do that but yeah I mean it's a good good point I should sort of think about sort of what to do with these other ideas like yeah few of them are sort of so excited about that I kind of want to do them myself eventually which would ya not be in the next few years but pretty yeah do you have like a long-term plan for all this stuff what are you gonna do if you the oceans are all beautiful and blue you like it I do and the goal is really to help ourselves out of business right so one day we hope we're done I don't want to be the garbage man of the ocean forever so so the to be the target that we set for the ocean cleanup was to really get to a 90% reduction by by 2040 which is that's incredible I think is achievable both on the influx side and the Dastak side but yeah so but I think that already before that I think it and if maybe yeah five years from now it will just be sort of steady operation and then for me it wouldn't be very exciting anymore it's I would be involved until really the end but maybe yeah maybe at some point in time I would be able to just sort of brought on my time of a multiple project but that's yeah that's at least years away because yeah of course there's still a lot of things that need to happen we need to first prove the technology is first and foremost shir then we have to scale up raise hundreds of millions to to build this entire fleet out then there for more patches in the world we need to make it into a self sustainable business and then we also need to think about what can we do on the source side so so there's quite a few pieces of the puzzle still there to be to be found and put together yeah so I won't be bored for the next few years for sure you certainly won't be one of the reasons why I'm asking this about you and what your ideas are with cleaning up other problems in the world that's because there's millions of people listening to this and there might be another Boyan out there who's a young kid who says well why don't we do this yeah how come this hasn't been done or why why isn't someone tried this and next thing you know because someone who's figuring out how to extract heavy metals out of the bottom of the ocean sure I think the thing that would be will be great and yeah I definitely welcome people to sort of just just start and yeah what kind of other thoughts well I think another thing that's important then when people try and solve problems is that they actually think about how to solve the problem I think there's a lot of people that are very very well-meaning and they don't want to get involved but then what happens is that they sort of think about so at least I can kind of make a dent and then hopefully that dent sort of grows and but I think what's what a lot of people forget to do is that when they sort of start tackling a problem they forget to sort of look at the whole problem first and see well sort of what's required to actually solve the whole problem and then sort of reason your way back to well what's the first step that I need to take because if you don't do that well then I think it will be very hard to kind of get the scale you need to actually sort of solve solve the problem so and it's yeah I can imagine can be quite intimidating to to think about that but yeah I think that would get us to much more sort of effective solutions to sort of this sort of top-down problem-solving as I would call it instead of sort of this bottom-up sub protocell so when have you talked to anybody that also had an idea of how to clean up the Pacific Garbage Patch now I've read about other proposals from the past for sure but no one is really actively pursued anything I don't know well I mean the thing is of course all those other ideas were based on sort of boats and nets that would go fishing that's like taking 79 thousand years for fridges one patch there was one that I saw that looked like some gigantic floating thing it looked like a spaceship and it was kind of like moving across the surface sort of skimming it is that one of those kids see actually the some artists impression of what I refer to earlier concept yeah I think that's probably silver yeah that was yeah so what other I mean if you don't mind talking about them what other ideas have you had in terms of like cleaning things up yeah I've kind of ever been to to talk about them but I mean there's there's things you have other problems out there so if you just think about so what other big problems are out there so how about water pollution yeah I usually so what I do is actually I try and actively force the ideas out of my head just because sort of once you have an idea it sort of starts to grow and then sometimes you know with any project you're doing there are these weeks that things don't go very well and sort of everything seems to be against you and in those weeks as oh it's very tempting to started thinking about well there's other idea and you know and sort of starts to grow and you should be careful that doesn't take over your entire mind feeling too scattered and spread out yeah so I think it's of paramount importance for the this for the og claim to happen is that I stay a hundred percent focused on what we do if there's one mission rid the areas of plastic and that's what we're doing so what I usually do is I sort of write them down in my notebook to keep it next to my bed and that's where it stays until you know a few years from now so probably when you were to ask me like so what's the top three ideas other ideas you have I wouldn't be able to wouldn't even be able to say them because yeah they're sort of out of my head and then I really try to keep it there but I mean what's what I can say is that they're all sort of technology-based so they're all things that aren't possible now but I want to make possible in the future and I sort of all think connected in terms of negative side effects of yeah of civilization and trying to sort of yeah make sure that that doesn't backfire to us what I was like to do is I tried to think like if we sort of try to imagine a future in 10,000 years from now how do we make sure that well civilization is there but zooming out humanity's still there zooming further out just you know general life can can prosper and yeah when I look at if I try to extrapolate the current situation to the next 10,000 years I don't think we're at that point yet but I think it's yeah it's a challenge that we'll have to see so well it's certainly a challenge that we're gonna have to solve and a challenge that I would hope more people like you tackle and start approaching these issues with the sort of 10,000 year mindset a big one of course with the ocean is overfishing yeah for sure yeah I mean one thing so right now you have cuddle of excitement and those startups in the area of of artificial meat right yeah why not artificial fish fish meat right because there seems to be this natural evolution from wild hunting to farming to this more lab-grown stuff that doesn't involve you know killing or all these resources being wasted and on land where kind of is stage 2 now so going to stage 3 protein next few decades and but if you look at fishing it's still just hunting right he's still just wildcard most most most fish there's some farm raised yeah it's also maybe not as valuable or is healthy yeah and I think they also use a lot of wild caught fish as a feedstock for these farmed fish that's kind of odd but yeah but that seems to be served as mentor evolution so I think that would be a way to to kind of solve that and but isn't there a potential I mean if we're looking at this in terms of long term of what we've done with plastic and the downside there's potential downsides to even this lab-grown stuff like we don't know really the health consequences of consuming it yet we don't know what the side effects are we don't know what sort of byproducts are created in manufacturing this stuff yeah possibly and we need to look carefully at this but I think Andy's on paper does I have a lot of potential of being able to do more with less yeah I'm gonna wait for a while yeah I just I don't know it just seems to me like boy this could be one of those early adopter things it could be a disaster yeah well yeah I'm right yeah I sure that did good testing there I'm sure they do too I mean I'm sure I'm just ignorant but I'm still paranoid oh just go what are you doing what's going on how'd you make that you made that in a lab okay good luck eating it I'll be over here I mean it's funny I think sort of if some things just take a lot of time to sort of get used to and other things sort of once it's it's there you kind of used to it in a second it's the example like earlier this week I was driving a Tesla on autopilot and it's driving it for five minutes and then already you're kind of doing your emails and and then when you take it off it just feels like you're you're back in the Stone Age it's when you're just ya gotta have to drive this yourself it's so weird so so you you do your email while you're driving you're not even paying attention to the Machine and make sure that doesn't hit some homeless lady who steps out off the median now yeah like she one day this thing that did happen yeah with the uber car yeah yeah it's I think this thing's like this will come up more rapidly than people think and I think I think very very quickly that we used to it but aren't you're supposed to like look at the road right not supposed to be staring down at your laptop yeah okay just erase everything that minute have you ever seen the video of the guys falling asleep in San Francisco traffic no he's completely asleep he's behind the wheel - Tesla like this and the car is like slowing and going with the pace of traffic it's really fascinating because this happened so quickly I remember a buddy of mine got a Tesla a couple years ago and he's like dude I let my hands off the wheel on the highway I'm like really like that's happening already but it's not just happening like people plug into their navigate here this guy look at them this guy is stone dead asleep in his Tesla in bumper-to-bumper San Francisco traffic in the car is performing flawlessly and this is this Dutch guy who actually just went to the back of his like on the backseat and started changing his clothes and oh god yeah and then apparently that did they now included a safety feature that you can I have to touch the wheel every minute or so oh that's a new thing yeah yeah and BMW I believe has a similar system but you have to have your hand on the wheel at all times yeah pretty better until it's yeah yeah yeah I would imagine yeah people probably doing all kinds of freaky shit in their cars while this thing is on autopilot it's really don't right now yeah it's quite amazing how I mean there's you're just about to show a video of Tesla autopilot crash compilations hey it's saving people from crashes I'm sure it does what's unbelievable is how few crashes there are and they said they've been two fatalities so far okay how many fatalities per capita versus non auto pilot cars yeah I mean I would imagine it's far less yeah obviously these cars are also just safer in general so they're not there's much safer than that in a 1990s Toyota Corolla or something so in terms of the way the construction yeah just safer when they crash so right I don't know how they compared the syste statistics but yeah I'm I'm very impressed too it was fun trying it out yeah I'm impressed and I'm very hopeful the only my only concern I had my friend Matt Farah was on last week and he's a car expert and they've actually started an organization to save human driving there they're literally going to be like lobbyists - yeah stop law doesn't get bent yeah well that's the concern is that one day they're gonna say you cannot drive your own car and they're really worried that that was the name of his organization do you remember okay but the the you know they're very serious he's like it's going to happen quicker than you think you're going it's going to be very difficult to drive your own car and then it's going to be illegal yeah maybe they should keep area it's like the highway one or thing like that it's just something some freaky Road people can get crazy look at hey man I'm steering yeah I'm hitting my own brakes oh yeah I mean again these are things that it's most likely inevitable I mean this this technology the way it's progressing it's going to be safer it's going to be healthier lower emissions all these variables they're gonna come into play where people are going to say no this just there's the benefit of driving your own cars not worth the detriment to society yeah and next to that just if you think about the the normal rate of converting the entire car fleet to electric it would be around 20 years because that's sort of how long cars last and right you only produce a few hundred million cars a year and there's billions of cars so said you know if you don't want that to take twenty years well I think autonomy then really has to come into play because if you have autonomous cars you need much less cars out there and then you would if they you would have to drive themselves because obviously cars are just driving maybe 3% of their time there this time there they're just being parked so they can drive themselves I think the utilization of the number of cars would be much higher and I think that all transition to electric cars would happen much faster it's a human driving Association a human driving Association is what it is here pull it pull it back up again so you can look at it yeah the war on driving is here a little paranoid there a little paranoid but you got to remember Matt Farah is an automotive journalist so his livelihood depends on talking about cars and he's a real legitimate car nut what is this wrong answer what is that pick the electric car oh you clicked it oh I get it that's just a joke but why would it be the wrong answer it's just an an answer do you drive I do you do you drive an electric car a regular car actually I don't have a car don't know in Holland you don't run any cars you just have a bike but it's fucking freezing there yeah okay hardcore listen I'm a big fan of Holland because I kick box so alright you guys have some of the greatest kick boxers of all time yeah came from this one small place yeah it's very unusual yeah you know why is that I have no idea yeah we just have to punch people I guess when you they cut you off with the cars oh oh but Hollin is a very unique place isn't it I mean it's a it's a very unusual country um I mean yeah sometimes we wonder why do you think this the issue camp is based on hollander okay my department and for us it makes a lot of sense in that we live below sea level so we're like we have pre pre capital and the highest number of hydraulic engineers and maritime engineers so it's it's just very good access to human capital and yeah so so it really makes sense for us to be there is a lot of offshore engineering companies that that support us and are involved with us contractors so so for us it's not pretty very strange but I don't know about the other things there's it's got a lot of innovation coming from such a small country yeah a lot of innovation and really unique intelligent people I've met a lot of people from Holland and they're just really fascinating people wim hof do you know when yeah I've never met him but fuck you know guys the best is so lovely this is such an amazing person every time you're around him you like feel better like somebody like me some coffee like whoo I know he's just he's very contagious and I mean I have I have quite a few friends from Holland you can check your watch you gotta take off soon right no it's so funny you okay it's just I am fascinated how how variable people are and how these cultures like Holland sort of arise and I just find so many people from Holland to be I'm waiting to meet assholes from Holland I'm sure you must have them but they get fifth sure they do but the people that I've met from hall and they're friendly and happy it's it's a very unusual place yeah yeah sure yeah I mean I I kind of feel the same way about the u.s. west coast as well it's just yeah I mean I'd definitely be able to live in a place like San Francisco maybe just because of the yeah the high the high percentage of engineers and entrepreneurs that that kind of makes me feel at home but no but I mean us in general I feel like yeah people are very friendly I could tell you some some spots that suck ok there's a few spots yeah you're in a good spot right here and San Francisco is a fantastic spot and for in terms of innovation how well has it's been received in in America and particularly in California I mean obviously you're here to do some business and talk to some people yeah is this something that people are very excited about and you feel like there's a lot of momentum behind it actually us is the yeah the number one group of support is for us because we know we fucked up a lot with the ocean and it's right maybe I mean that's but no just I think people are very very supportive maybe it's also because the geography of the patch it's right between two US states yeah it's like Canada but different so yeah so it's yeah I think we receive a lot of support from the US I think that yeah our biggest support group is from here and like everyone I talked to here they they really want to get a vote so yeah I I think the yeah we're kind of lucky that it's next to the US I guess so you've raised all this money is this going to be a profitable business I should wear it so we're an um for-profit entity so we're not even allowed to make profit but eventually yeah the idea is that this sort of this plastic business would be sort of a separate thing and that would then create the funding for the cleanup so everything would be reinvested in the cleaner oh that's fantastic so do you have a name for the plastic business ah no right now it's just under the ocean cleanup still well we're actually thinking about some kind of Brent name but see you next year yeah please let me know I mean we'll promote the hell out of that I think that's a fantastic idea and I'll try to buy as many things out of plastic as they can sell do I think yeah I mean think the more things you can buy maybe plasti sell get this guy you know that phone where are you buddy yeah it makes these he's this guy carves all these himself and then makes these molds and then hand paints all these well yeah he's a little wizard yeah I don't know he's a little just he's a wizard maybe the big was a sexual sighs there's me now I'm a little taller than art but my head's not that big either but yeah these things are I mean to have a line made out completely out of ocean plastic would be amazing maybe he'll do a Boyan version that'd be creepy I would have bad repeat could be looking at me over there yeah yeah they could face you yeah that's a weird face too but yeah I mean there's there's really the sky's limit in terms of applications if your plastic and and again I just think it'd be so attractive to people I mean especially out here California at least posing you know as being environmentally conscious there's a lot of environmentally conscious losers out here for sure I mean they would like to just be able to say that you know like oh my dog's leashes may not have environmentally conscious plastic that we put from the ocean I was actually a part of the expedition Isles there no that's a good idea yeah I mean really it's just I just think the sky's the limit in terms of just the attractiveness of that kind of plastic ya know on one hand it's a problem that everything is made out of plastic but it does give a huge potential for alternative materials like like there's ocean paths yeah what do you feel you're gonna be doing when this is done like say if you get to this point where most of the stuffs pulled out of the ocean and what do you what do you plan for the future you're 23 years old I mean you can't really basically do anything you want sure um maybe going a holiday for once and yeah and then I'll probably just be working on the next one you know I think I think this is what I love doing and yeah I hope I'll get the opportunity to work on many more problems like this in the future so you feel like you will be a problem-solver like that's your thing that'd be I should put that on my business card problem solver yeah why not yeah I mean that's essentially what you are right I yeah I think there's just nothing more fun than sort of solving the problem is and when you think about project like the ocean cleanup you're sure you're solving or you're solving part of a massive problem but just the whole road to it it's just like one little problem after another little problem and yeah I just you know I think it's just very sort of intellectual intellectually satisfying to be sort of confronted with this there's new weird problem and then you can have to think how to solve them and as you know as the CEO you're sort of the accumulation zone the the Garbage Patch as it were for problems within your own organization so everything that other people cannot solve sort of end up with with you yeah I kind of I kind like that it's it's just fun thinking about things so for example just this week we had like I think it was Mercer last week so on Monday was so we have this assembly yard and there was a fence that was seven meters too far to the left and there was just this this email from from the government saying oh if you don't move it within ten days you have to stop your operation and I go shit yeah I mean it's a little problem and you just have to do a few calls and think about well how can we now arrange the assembly yard in a way that it's still big enough so we can assemble this two thousand feet thing and then the next day turned out there was a sort of a slight misalignment of one of the connection strips on one of the the floatation elements of the system and you can have to figure out how can we still attach it well I'm sort of working with this and you know they're sort of just details but there are details on a daily basis and yeah that kind of what makes it fun for me if it would all go flawlessly it would yeah be pretty boring well that's what's fascinating about a guy like you is that your personality perfectly aligns with this kind of problem I mean and that's a very unusual thing did you do you a puzzle solver when you were a kid were you into like mysteries like what is um number there's just billion so actually so one of the things that I that funny anecdote is when it was I think it was about 13 years old I had this idea of doing getting into the Guinness Book of Records with launching model rockets so it's really into those kind of things and I build them myself and they shoot up like three and a feet in the sky and what I didn't do I was sort of organized this whole thing with like there was media we had sponsors and we at the University collaborating and we just had this sports field with 300 people who would all at the same time they would all launch the rocket and actually I think we launched 213 of them at the same time and actually gun the Guinness Book of Records says I always have my projects let's put it that way have you thought about potentially working with companies that produce environmental waste like maybe a company brings you on as a problem solver for some sort of an issue that they have a residual issue of something that they produce yeah I mean I don't think it would be very interesting to be a consultant or anything but yeah I mean definitely sort of after this I want to do sort of solve more work on more big challenges like this yeah like oil spills things along those lines yeah I mean you can keep guessing but yeah yeah you'll see I'm sure we will see well listen man I'm so happy that you exist I'm so happy that there's someone out there that's actually doing something about this and I've seen like I said I've seen many of your talks I think it's a comprehensive approach I think it's amazing and I really hope that something comes out of this and it really works thanks so much thank you my pleasure and thanks for doing this please and tell people one more time how they can get to your website yes it's the ocean cleanup dot-com were also social media just at the ocean clean up to follow us as we launch the first system this summer and your social media accounts are Boyan slat so less l80 yes bo why n SL 80 that's Twitter Instagram everything all the above yes thank you boy this was real a lot of fun I really appreciate it thank you
