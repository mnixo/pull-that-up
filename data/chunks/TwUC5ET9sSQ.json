the Joe Rogan experience do you watch those movies and shake your head I like him yeah I like science fiction you know so yeah and it's it there I grew up with Star Wars that was my when I was nine years old us and finally yeah I'm not having this I did an arguing with Neil deGrasse Titan on argument but debate with him about lightsabers ones because I claimed that they're physically part that in principle they're possible and and he was trying to say that they aren't but they are would they'd have to loop back around cuz the lights not continuing it like the fact that it goes to a certain distance and pauses well yet have a mirror or something I guess yes something that's pretty the end of it that's true so it wouldn't it be a different kind of light saying that the only point I was making is that photons particles of light can bounce off each other hmm so we see that in really high energy experiments in particle accelerators we can collide photons together so my point was a bit of a pedantic physicist one but he's because he it is true that light can bounce off it it can hit light right but very very high-energy but when they press their body to a certain distance I wasn't that's engineering right I agree with you I agree with you the distance things I pass to it right so as you're swinging it around you wouldn't have the leverage of a long thing so why not make it really long because it wouldn't be difficult to swing around like you could stab someone with a lightsaber a mile away that's true well that's just a laser and yes like why make it so short yes you have to swing you have to be close to any person with it yes silly silly design you are picking holes correctly in the engineering part of my haha oh the only point I was making is the physics is that which i think is quite interesting his light can bounce off light yes that's the fun so but it would have to there would have to be something that causes it to stop at the very end yeah yeah yeah which would be your right it haven't merit but he wouldn't look cool with it if there was a no kind of thing with him what drives me crazy about Star Wars is not the lightsabers it's the lasers when they're shooting the I'm like why can I see that well I can't see bullets yeah this is we're supposed to be way faster than a bullet yeah why is it easy to see this because it's like you could duck they really sly wrong yeah how so angry I feel like this is so dumb I could go warp speed in this Millennium Falcon and travel the speed of light but for whatever reason these lasers are so slow that you could duck out of the way of them that's so dumb and it's not only Star Wars it's everything the epigenome is quite difficult different the epigenome is that the structure of how the DNA is looped around if you look at the chromosome you're not seeing the genome you'll really basically seeing epigenome and what what I think is causing aging is not that you're losing the DNA structure you're not having mutations you're actually changing the epigenome which is the the reader of the genes so put another way compact disk okay for the young audience compact discs are little things we used to put music on but anyway these are these are digital information of course and the reason we switch to digital in the first place is that it's very copyable and it doesn't wear out whereas a cassette tape you know people our age know that if you try to copy that a thousand times there's not much left at the end so the the compact disc information is the genome the epigenome is the reader of the CD that little laser that goes around and what I think is causing aging is not the loss of the digital information but it's the reader at the analog part and that's like a cassette tape that eventually runs out what we what's going on really is that your cells are losing the ability to read the right genes the way they did when you were 20 and that's basically noise informational noise that gathers over time and so what we end up with when we're 80 is a compact disc or DVD that's scratched so the reader cannot read the right genes at right time and the cells become dysfunctional now what we're working on is how do you polish that CD or that DVD to get that information back again and if you can do that I think that's really the best way to reset your age and I we haven't polished it yet but we're working on ways to actually reset that genome and actually get back the information that we once had when we were 20 so what is happening to the epigenome when you're going through those scanners well so what we found is the biggest disruptor of the epigenome is a a broken chromosome DNA break and I don't know about scanners that's just a abundance of caution but an x-ray will damage your DNA no question even going out in the Sun will do a bit of that and we think that the cells reaction to that break having to unwrap the DNA from its chromatin we call it and up and then rewrap it is what eventually disrupts the ability to read the right gene at the right place so DNA damage is essentially a little scratch on on the DVD and that accumulates over time a lot of people are not willing to learn how to do that because they want the fast track out yeah so that is the thing right they just want to pill yeah it's very unfortunate that those things exist in that that that sort of thinking is you know it's reinforced yeah yeah it's encouraged in fact you know you all these ads and all these doctors and different people well if you have a hard time sleeping I'll just write your prescription yeah and actually you know and I mean you look at the animal world like they self-medicate they'll use clay for parasites and you know dogs will eat grass for stomach issues and you know that I guess birds now are putting like nicotine and cigarettes and their nests because there's some kind of benefit to that and you see animals self-medicating you see our ancestors using everything from you know cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to you know all sorts of different derivatives for thousands of years so it's not like supplementation or self medication or the whole creation of pharmaceuticals is something that's unnatural or not acceptable human activity but once you start to use it as a crutch I think that's where you run into issues like once once you deny the human body's ability to be able to heal itself or to be able to decrease stress on its own you begin to rely on these exogenous chemicals I think that's where you start playing with fire the idea that you're going to be this balanced chilled out person and still be a fucking world smash sure good luck with that I'm the farthest thing from relaxed and chill right now but yeah but when you're training and when you look you there's a mindset that's required to beat the best guys and it's not the same mindset that's required to get good to get you could get good and be a chilled out relaxed person let's say you want to be a black belt in jujitsu that's totally possible yeah you can be really good people can go hey look at Mike man Mike has got great triangle watch him roll wow he's really good but if mike wants to be the motherfucker of motherfuckers you better be crazy you know you better be goddamn crazy you better be like Mike Tyson when he was young yeah Beto's Michael Jordan's you talking about they're always thinking about it Roy Jones jr. yes all those guys you got to be a fucking crazy person absolutely everyone's Roy Jones jr. played a professional basketball game the day of his fight played a guy in a basketball game that night you can probably of dude and he's just an athlete yeah yeah I mean I just don't think there's any other way I mean I think if you're gonna win a race you're gonna have redline the engine is I just don't see how you're gonna beat the best guy everybody is trying their best yeah this is the thing there's so much going on there I mean you could have like a really good coach so you have an advantage technically you could have a really good group of guys you train with so you have an advantage in the environment that you're training in and there's a lot of inspiration but if you're not a fucking psychopath hmm good luck yeah I know my friend sam harris was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump he was saying if they follow your Terms of Service I just did a podcast with him they should come out today or tomorrow he's he's a fascinating guy Sam Harris I love him to death but what he was trying to do was like saying hey he's threatening nuclear war like he's saying hey Korea my bombs are bigger than your bombs like what else does the guy have to do to get you to remove him from the platform when you guys saw that what was your reaction to that and was there an internal discussion about actually banning the president United States well so the so two things are one it was a context that presidents of this country have used similar language in different mediums they use it on radio they use it on television it's not just through Twitter and even if you were looking you were to look at the presidency of Obama there wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language but there were threats around the same country and we have to take that context into consideration so the second thing is that we need the most controversial aspect of our rules and our Terms of Service is probably this clause around public interest in newsworthiness we're powerful figures or public figures might be in violation of our Terms of Service but the tweet itself is of public interest yes there should be a conversation around it and that is probably the thing that people disagree with the most and where we have a lot of internal debate but we also have some pretty hard lines if we had a global leader including the president United States make a violent threat against a private individual we would take action we we always have to balance that with like is this a is this something that the public has interest in and I believe generally the answer is yes it's not going to be in every case but generally the answer is yes because we should see how our leaders think and how they act [Applause]
