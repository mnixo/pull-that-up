did you tweet it yeah that's was we're live but live in front of three Tony knows pizzas if you're in Woodland Hills California I highly recommend to Nino's get a smell off of that bitch get a smell off I said mother when I came in there legit as fuck no affiliation no sponsorship - just good pizza all right folks this today's day - if you didn't tune into day one Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer made a bet the bet is whoever can lose the most weight over was gonna be over a three-day challenge it's been reduced to a two-day challenge fucking God yeah and Tom got down from 267 to 219 which is fucking staggering so how about a nice round of applause for Tom I think yesterday and how about a round applause Wartburg 221 pretty fucking close and staggering as well both you guys amazing job so today is day two I know you're burnt out you're dehydrating elderly man so let's just cut the shit and get right to the way we're going right to the fucking way yeah right I should weigh him first cuz I have a feeling that by the way we did the height tests because Ari Shaffir who was supposed to pay if they got below 227 are we supposed to pay for their trip the loser has to shave their beard and the loser has to pay for the winners trip of their choice unless they can get down to 227 in which Ari Shaffir agreed that he was gonna pay but now Ari is balking and he's saying that they have to be there their height has to be measured because the body mass index would indicate that they have to be a certain height or they're obese it was really weird so we we tested the heights okay tom is just under six feet tall and for all you assholes at saying 5 foot 2 we tested me - I'm 5/8 and a cunt hair and Bert is taller than Tom so Bert's good you're about six-one so the body mass index I think dude you look good get on here get on here all right so was at 2:21 yesterday you look significantly thinner today okay he's hurting let's see he's getting on the scale to 20 to 24 Bert 400 pounds one pound less one fucking pound I think Tommy's got it here let's see here fuck say goodbye to my beard you fucking do sixteen Tom gets it running away ladies and gentlemen we have a winner in the hash tag who is fat contest the winner is Tom Segura down to 216 fucking pounds outrageous outrageous coconut water c2o coconut waters must be consumed now get those electrolytes in your system boys well done well done amazing effort it's not easy to lose weight it's really not easy to lose it the way you guys did it two days in a row man crazy shit that was the move that yet today was the hardest workout I've ever had I ran eight miles lost one fucking pound that's crazy isn't it I think my body was like in shock that's what happens that's what happens of Fighters it shuts down so have a seat hmm I've been thinking about that drink this entire fucking day over there charging up should probably shave your beard after you have some pizza yeah I mean have a little hard time eating pizza with this fat fucking face it's not gonna look good yeah you look pretty fucking skinny today man you did you do look significantly skinny too skinnier today I don't know man I think you a little distended yesterday with that pulled pork in your stomach from the night before the night before the weigh-ins [Laughter] you know what I want though seriously what it's that long strand DNA I have that Mickey Mantle gene you showed a little Mickey Mantle today how did you get down to six different you know it's so funny you three he said something in passing and that's what I did what but I just didn't acknowledge it he goes uh she would have Burke Williams just sweat it out in the spa that's what I've been doing for two days Nick I put alba lien all over my body oh that's good and then I just sat in the steam room yesterday and today mm-hmm good move yeah Wow run in fucking ten miles so you didn't you didn't drink any water nothing no I did hot bath last night I did a two and a half mile track last night I built up a sweat doing that then I recovered no water then hot bath Alba lean everywhere no water at all not even a little sip I took a sip before bed I said after the hot bath Jesus Christ yeah but I've also had nothing but distilled water for about six days what's the benefits of distilled water there's no yeah it goes right through your body it's easier to sweat out your body doesn't like to retain it apparently a lot of fighters do that before they say so cut weird to laugh my ass off at seeing Burt walk into the spots the point I was proposed waiting for a reserved spot I'm at Burke Williams at in Sherman Oaks huh both days I was like you know what it's better for me to work it out like I was like I'll be healthy I'll work it out and I'll sweat it out and then like mile five I stopped sweating well here's the thing about this whole working it out stuff you're not losing any fat over the next day you know like it's it's really just dehydration and you might be might have been better off just sweating it out then Ryan oh I hit my baseline I mean I wasn't doing this week leading up to it I just did night before weigh-ins right so or morning before you know yeah that's the way to do it what did you get what did you did you weigh yourself when you got before you when you got to Burke Williams No didn't have a scale there oh fuck no but I weighed myself when I think not a scale of wow I don't know I would have definitely weighed myself there and then I knew what I knew what like I knew what I weighed when I woke up yesterday and then I knew what I weighed here and I knew that what I had done to cut that way there was no way well I'll tell you right now there's I feel I feel like I was bested all around because there's no way I could have gotten to - I would have had to gotten to 214 to win yeah I'm not gonna have done that you would have to go below that yeah because you had out of lose by more than two pounds you had to lose more than two pounds because he beat you by two pounds yesterday so would have to be like more than that well it's clear now because you want both there's no mercy I feeling bro I feel great I want to give a shout out to God without him and nothing's done this as possible and then Jake Smith Thank You Jake who's Jake he's a fighter who gave me all this insight on [Laughter] shout-out to anybody oh my god can you do this do you wanna your brownie or do you want pepperoni and mushrooms all right get in there boys get in there Jesus Christ Tom you think you'd have meat in two days both you guys aren't eating that well Tommy has been eating clean for a long-ass fucking time not just two days get us some yeah there you go young Jamie on the paper towels this is some legit pizza too by the way oh fuck [Music] there's one of the rare times I think it's okay to eat pizza into the microphone mmm because people need to appreciate the sacrifice that you two went through as I eat pizza through the the last few hours were really the fucking worse than them really look I mean from waking up I got that first of all I woke up with cramps at 3:30 bad well I'd like like behind the knee here on the outside and then it little calf cramp that kept me up to like 40 minutes I considered like you know you start thinking about maybe I should drink some water and yeah it's a dehydration clamp yeah do you think you know you could drank a whole one of these you still would have won by three pounds four of them and still won I was just like fuck and then you go then I was just counting down the hours so I spent the you know I get my son with Christina we spend time with them do breakfast I'd look and it'd be like 7:30 I was like fuck 8:30 9:30 just counting it down man and then that's in that spa sweating out doing like 10 minutes in five minutes out of ten minutes in five minutes out every time and then I'm in there alone and the attendant comes in with a big glass of cold he says I thought you might want a glass of water and he hated me a cold glass of water psycho pouring it all out oh well I waited for him to leave and I threw it away like angrily just pissed I can't drink it you you really get to the place like today on the treadmill I was literally chewing ice and spitting it out into a shirt and I thought I know what those people feel like when they dive deeper in the ocean to get bigger there's fresh water ten feet below in those people that lose their minds out to sea you ever heard of those people know what they think there's fresh water balloons you have people who are stranded at sea there's you always hit a guy that's like he's like jumps in and he's like guys there's fresh water ten feet below and they dive down below and drink watch sea water and die go crazy I know that feeling like I don't know it to that extent but man I can I could empathize with it on that treadmill today I was like I was like I just want I just want to cheat I want water I want water so fucking bad he imagined the mindfuck of being surrounded by water as far as the eye can see and you're dying of thirst I remember that member I survived that series yeah man those phenomenal Ziff people haven't seen it they did a series where people who are in like extreme life-threatening near-death situations and made it like sometimes they were you know kidnapped assaulted sometimes they're an accident sometimes they're stranded at sea and there was one with this guy they were stranded off some somewhere in the coast some Gulf of Mexico and boat overturns and it's just this guy and his buddy and he said like you know he's telling the story and as it progresses he's seeing his friend kind of slip away and the friend eventually drinks ocean water and he's telling him not to do it but he's so far gone and then it just accelerates the friend's death and the friend died what happens when you drink ocean water you do you go crazy your body craves more water it's just I think magic salt makes you actually go crazy oh I've seen it what garden growing up in Florida there's you always hear the opposite affect you you doesn't hydrate you so crazy yeah just salt anybody want more pizza you know you do bitch you're not lost a lot of weight bird yeah plus you're an inch taller really is phenomenal so how do we shame Ari if he decides to Welch out on this bet he will he's going he's going to I think so yeah mom I'm just gonna state right now that I'm paying for it whatever whatever the cost is for the trip come on man I will take care of it well you guys were on my podcast I feel like oh and Ari yeah he doesn't owe me anything fuck it he'll give me some weed you called me yesterday after the podcast in an Ari rage you're bringing in the ruler tomorrow we did we measured him we already did we filmed it we measured it will he's just under six you're still you're still blow over wait yeah yeah Ari's crazy I got to be honest when we started this I was concerned about height because I was like I don't know if we're like I don't know what I am at the end of the day I don't know when we're gonna measure me I know that I'm six woman I go to the doctor but like I don't know what you know I don't you just get scared then and then that difference an overweight versus obese is like six pounds from 6 1 to 6 foot it's to 27 to 220 I know it's dyes the baby nervous that's a big difference maybe the way our is wrong either way even at just under six feet tom is uh a little bit over five five 11 and 3/4 right yes so just under six feet yeah just under six feet that's uh I think your body I think you'd have to be like 220 to be considered over right no what does the find out young Jamie the thing is if you put in 511 that's that's leaning the other way you know I mean yeah it doesn't do it that's not fair okay here it goes does it do it to 16 right yeah you were to 16 so 20.3 is overweight but 511 you'll say obese oh yeah i'm 5 y OU 11 yeah 511 obese wow you're like on the cusp yeah wait if you're 511 you still be obese yeah 216 but it's all bullshit right cuz I'm obese but my point is don't get overtaken if you if he was being a stickler about this you'd have to find out what it is at 5 11.8 to be fair took can you type in 5 11.8 now can you part can you point in can you put in what are you at sick would you at 6 feet you're not obese at 6 feet that's crazy that 1 inch or be obese and one me 25:11 you're normal at 611 you'd be normal Tom there you go whatever but again obviously that body mass index doesn't count you you do have a lot of muscle we do do a lot of weight lifter and check I watched a little bit of our podcast yesterday that's where I'm going muscle yeah I'm losing toenails on this run and shit well if you put muscle on the other thing is you lose fat your body starts burning it off your body has more calorie requirements you have more body mass or more muscle mass so if you actually put more muscle on you'll burn off more and you can eat more I think I'm gonna start doing crossfit pretty aggressively I'm really looking for this fresh face look to inspire me to work out - do you ever watch that face look with no beard no beard yeah mmm okay here we go for the information you entered five feet eleven point five inches weight 216 pounds your body mass is twenty nine point seven indicating you're overweight so even with an extra one quarter of an inch against you mm-hmm so you're 1/4 inch taller yeah than that you win so Ari's wrong again so Ari if you want to be a cheap fuck I'm paying for the trip you fucking twat so don't they'll pay for it I'm gonna let him pay for why not come on especially for soccer I wouldn't go to Paris for a UFC fight [Laughter] [Laughter] travel to Italy three times forth back and forth I was like are you still you still doing TV you're still done I'm not I'm never done I'm never done I mean like I my relationship with travels always open I like them that dig them they're cool to me they've always been cool to me and always work for them if it's a project that we both collaborate on and one and we're into what I'm done doing right now is is the kind of stuff where they call it they're like we need you in Hawaii tomorrow so because I was like cuz that was really messing up my touring and I couldn't really commit to any dates because they'd be like it cuz you didn't want to turn it down you'd be in New Zealand and they'd be like hey would you go to Fiji for the for this weekend a party with this chef and you'd be like yeah and I was into that like but Hartford they're expecting yeah Hartford come on Jackie's got La Crosse lined up in Hartford by the way oh Jesus Christ there's some places that I just gonna Hartford by the way that's the one thing I should listen to Tom Segura Tom Segura at the very moment when Tom Tom and I like it well I say were at the same level in our career probably tom was uh Tommy told me there was a bunch of places you should say to go fuck themselves and he would name them and I'd be like oh come on man that's not a bad place and he be like no fuck that place they suck their GM sucks their manager socks their staff sucks to cut the crowd suck the press sucks and I go and I was this company man like I remember talking to your wife about it I was such a company man yeah man I should have listened yeah I'm not a big fan of going to Connecticut I like people in Connecticut but I just feel like Connecticut has a feeling and I'm so sorry if you listen from Connecticut and my one of my best friends Tommy jr. lives in Connecticut I love Connecticut people yeah cool player from yeah but the bottom line is Connecticut is filled with despair yeah it's not a real state it's a highway between New York and Boston you know it's a highway you guys put houses on a highway this is what it is it's a highway and then along the highway it's a bunch of fucking tax sheltering cunts that uh that live in Manhattan and then have these palatial estates in the intro young Jamie digging in on that Pizza can't help themselves look it's so good we only crack the top pizza - we got two more below them shrooms let's do that yeah there's ice we got glasses yeah we got the whole deal and bring out the Jack Daniels - young Jamie we got that that's that type of vodka isn't it that you liked Oh what is it Cheetos Tito's hey why are you what is it about you that is so confident to tell people to go fuck themselves well I don't think I tell people to go fuck themselves nothing like you know Mia you know you know the conversation we've had a million times yeah what is it about you that makes you go fuck them like do you remember and you remember uh and that one place in Ohio that you went to and you're just like fuck them I'll never go there again oh yeah yeah yeah I'm not that guy I'm so the guy that you can step all over and then I go go oh you know what why do you think that is though about me yeah as I've said I've talked shit about people like that and it always comes back to bite me in the ass it always comes back like I see them next time and they're like hey man it's so good to see you and I'm like boch wait so that's that's why that's why it stops like having firm views about things about story about clubs sounds like it was a bad weekend but maybe it was me me you know like I always take the blame on me I don't I don't ever go like like you're you've always been accurate at doing that to going fuck that Club fuck that guy fuck him I'll never work with it but I think I think I'm just reasonable so I feel like you know if I if I give like I feel like something sucks I feel like I have a pretty good take on it okay the same way you know yeah I'm not gonna be there's we know in comedy there's a lot of irrational people and there's a lot of you know comedians that are that you know bullshit about everything you know including how the show went and I feel like I'm a realist and I have a pretty good myself you always tell me like in you have bad sets yeah like what was that thing in Canada the thing that went down to Canada so good my Winnipeg bombing and you played that video yeah on your podcast that line was the what did the owner say to you when you got done got offstage and he goes [Laughter] yeah buddy they blew me off stage I think your your take on it was accurate though that it's you're a very reasonable person so if you like that's I would say that too that if I don't like you you're most likely a cunt duh cuz I'm really nice yeah I'm really nice and I give people a chance and I get along with them every but almost everybody yeah do you have any coke Jamie or diet coke brother either way I'll take regular coke yeah I mean yeah if you're if you're if I'm like fuck that guy there's no way he's pretty cool yeah no way and the club like if I go fuck that club I'm telling you man I don't do that lightly yeah there's got to be some real egregious shit on their part to earn them maybe that's it maybe that I'm a little bit of a internal dick no you know what it is you're more of but like between the three of us yeah you're definitely more of a people pleaser and harmony more and and and that's just like a thing about you and it's why people like of the three of us you know more people would say like what a fun time it was hanging with you guys [Laughter] got a purple bracelet on he's got a bandana those ones that people put on their dog yeah well you know you're a real nice guy Burt you know and that's why I mean you and I've had some conversations before we you've called me up and told me that someone was a dick to you or something that went wrong and I get angry because I know what a nice guy you are yeah so when that happens I know all that guy is piece of shit you know we know the one that we were talking about recently I was like well fuck that guy cut that guy off and I haven't talked to that guy since that conversation to Mike hey cuz it's just if you're a mean person for no reason some one thing if you fucked up something and you did something bad but there's a lot of people in this in this business and in comedy in particular that you don't get you don't get the true wire from them you don't get the it's hard to figure out what exactly went on they'll tell you something and then you got to throw it through a filter yeah that's the worst right like this guy this guy was a piece of shit and the show was going great and then then you talk to the guy like no no no he was bombing and he was yeah shit on the stage there's nothing like this the the fibbing that goes on in standup I mean to get an accurate thing that's you have to know that you have to trust the source yes it's very that's why I've always been like how'd this your show go okay yeah I've never I killed probably have told anyone I murdered you've told me you went great if it went great yeah you know there's nothing wrong with saying you had a great show if it actually was yeah yeah but for me but my mind would might actually say they're all cheers gentlemen cheers sort of fat shaming me I wouldn't be healthier today Cheers and if I wasn't scared that it was gonna backfire horribly I wouldn't have done some work shit makes you work harder yeah you you really were forced into a position where everybody I love you I love you too Tommy I love both you guys love you Joe love you too buddy no I feel same way though anyone I feel like if anyone is a dick to Burt yeah a particularly special cunt exactly because he is such a nice guy and I know people are like but didn't you just fat shame him like an asshole but that's I love him and it was the best thing kind of what we talked about yesterday where so many people who are like like yeah fuck Burt no no you're missing the whole thing yeah some particularly mean comments sure I don't even read Instagram anymore yeah really oh yeah because the comments are seems so much more active than anywhere else well if you go to Instagram you'll see so many people with blocked accounts that's one thing that yes it does that I think I really firmly believe that if you have a block to counter privacy you shouldn't be able to comment on other people's accounts yeah because all these people have blocked accounts and then they talk mag shit on other people's accounts and it's just an anonymity thing because you can't lash back at them so they believe how many chips are just pussies well someone told me to do that very early on they're like a make your account private that way people you'll get more people wanting to follow you I was like that's a dummy's idea the the whole thing what they're doing is there's a look there's a lot of people that don't want you looking at pictures of them which is fine yeah but if those same people will go on other people's accounts and start shitting on them yeah oh just wood a lot yeah then you get a lot of faith accounts where you go they have no posts no pictures but they're commenting left and running all these other people and how many like borderline and even obviously fat guys comment about how like they're like you're fat fuck and you go to like their profile like you're fatter than shit man oh and so is your mother that's in photo with you like you're both fat Brendan Schaub was talking about the other day that he had some guy just post some really nasty shit about him and he and he went to the guys page the guy has a kid and the guys like holding his baby up and he's like hey dude like you're a dad like yeah baby like you keep what are you doing like what kind of example of shit what kind of vibes you putting out there in the universe it might eventually bounce back down unto your daughter I've always wondered what comics and I mean I like I could probably guess some have set up troll accounts to fuck with other comics Oh Brendon Walsh's whole everything it's half as fun yeah but there was a comic that got busted recently commenting on his own stuff about yeah saying how funny he was and he fucked up on Facebook and he forgot he logged in under the his right account instead of his troll account that's and Jamie was talking about a ESPN guy that got busted or a fox sports guy that got busted anyway because I saw him he was commenting about fighting some MMA thing I was like is something about when guys comment on MMA and they don't know what they're talking about it's like me commenting on hockey yeah I can't even ice skate well yeah anime is a weird thing because it specifically the UFC is that I feel like I can say certifiably I was in the zeitgeist when it blew up I was I was there when it started blowing up yeah and I said and even more importantly I was doing your podcast when I started blowing up look at this skip you are the man exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point love the new show on fs1 three exclamation points and then the first comment is w80 what I love that what mean have you seen that what means no no lady it looks like you don't talking about and it just says I think it says W eighty or w UT I'd like you to use I use you to that one is my this is my like one of my favorite internet for what by the way I can't watch hunting shows anymore because you because the glasses every glass glass on this rich I just start laughing I'm alone in my house what do you laugh do you know what his podcast is done this is very specific but you ever have like [Laughter] just look up w88 E or W UT and it's like a woman I think kind of fucking horrible ones they're doing Ronda Rousey in ten years does have you seen the Ronda Rousey in ten years ones is where she's getting hit no no there's a bunch of like really obese trashy women and wonderful screaming it's some kid to get her a lemonade gimme a fuckin lemonade did you see the Ronda Rousey Radiohead cover no here she is right here is that real no no that seems fake right yeah it seems fake there's a picture of Ronda Rousey getting knocked out and then the Radiohead cover and they look identical can you pull it up Jamie rough times yeah rough times in the house of Rousey I've never been that down in my life I don't know how down that she feels but I've didn't down salad days man well it's a thing when you're fighting is a different thing like losing a basketball game wow wow but that seems like she's winning there that's that's the Radiohead one it's sort of winning there's one of her getting knocked out it's the same there's right there the head kick one okay what's really crazy is how just a year and a couple months ago she was on top of the world yeah it's that kind of an adjustment that's almost impossible for a regular person to comprehend other than death or a loss like that there's very few events in your life well your life will completely shift upside down but even in death like if you if someone you close you're close to that you care about dies other people are sympathetic and they care about you and they don't treat you like you're a piece of shit because someone died right so in a lot of ways fighting is its own completely unique kind of excuse me kind of loss because it's this the only time where people openly mock you for your loss like I never I've never seen people who openly mocked someone as much as they seems like they're mocking Ronda in their defense in the people that are mocking first of all she had she did a lot of things that invited this like the if you ever watched The Ultimate Fighter with her and Miesha Tate like you know she was ridiculous and like stick it in the finger at Miesha Tate and after the fight she wouldn't shake Misha Tate's hand and there was like a lot of non sport anti sportsmanship like she did it on the home fight also not touch gloves wasn't that hurt didn't it yes yes she touched gloves in this fight she touch gloves at the beginning in the but she didn't touch gloves before the fight actually started she touched gloves at the staredown mm-hmm which I thought was like wow that's interesting maybe her heads in a good place and then she didn't touch gloves afterwards but do you think that the world will turn on Conor McGregor when he loses for the if they did the world turned on him when he did but but the world respected him in a massive way because he jumped right back into the fray and then he won and he also was fighting that way at a way different weight right he was he was fighting in a different way but everybody keeps chiming in on this including the UFC or they say that you know Nate's a 170 bullshit Nate Diaz fought 170 twice in the UFC against dumb young Kim and against Rory MacDonald in both times he was too small and got rag-dolled he's not a 170 the reason why he's not on one is he's been fighting at 1:55 successfully his whole career and his fight before the Conor McGregor fight he fought Michael Johnson had 155 and looked fantastic Nate is a 155-pound fighter that's what he that's what's weight class Connors right now the champ at 155 but they're different in size in that Conor can make 145 Nate can't make 145 so Connor can dehydrate himself down another 10 pounds Nate cam that's insane you probably can't anymore because Connors put on a little bit of bulk and now he's fighting on 155 I'm sure he feels much more comfortable and healthy there he doesn't want to go down to 145 again but Nate is almost physically incapable I mean he would have to look like he's on death's door shit is brutal by the way man I can't emphasize how horrible the last couple days have been and I mean this is obviously a modified version like we're not pros we don't really need you look way better both of you do then a lot of guys do when they weigh in so whatever you drained out of your body that was so hard is nothing that's what I'm saying yeah that's what I'm saying I peed in the shower and it was like motor oil yeah dude it was orange it was orange and there was just like like it was like my dick spit chewing tobacco was like a meme right there this morning this morning and I went I cannot wait to get fluid in my body and not my dick goes I really fantasize about it to your mind really starts playing tricks on you yeah that's the fucking crazy thing can i watch that Cris cyborg weight-loss thing again yeah that was a horrible one and that one ESPN covered pretty extensively by the wayside the lawns back to the Skip Bayless nonsense mm-hmm about yeah that's one of the things I think about like one time I asked you like how do you fucking know so much about this MMA stuff and you go see only thing occupying that space in my head it's only sport I follow right that's I think the great flaw of being the all sport commenter guys are is that they're trying to keep up with experts experts in all the sports and they just don't have that like he might have a great take on maybe and the NBA or something mm-hmm but then it starts to dilute somewhere you're not also going to be the best at commenting on horse racing baseball foot college ball college basketball tennis got like people so then you're gonna something's gonna get lazy about the way you comment on it's not just even something's gonna get lazy there's no room like here here's a perfect example I'm an expert in MMA but in MMA I defer to other people about certain aspects of a man right like if I want to talk about jujitsu I talked to Eddie I talked to Eddie Bravo I say okay well like we had a conversation in the day about the Anderson Silva Chael Sonnen Fight Night incorrectly remembered it and Eddie corrected me and we watched the submission I'm like you're right you're right I remembered it wrong yeah I mean I understand setups and I understand technique and I'm a black belt in jujitsu under him and under John Jacques Machado key and noogie and still my knowledge is nothing compared to Eddie broccoli yeah and his his is like almost just like a gift too right no I mean he said well he's studied it his whole fucking life and he's a wizard at it and he's a true Jiu Jitsu genius he's not just really good at techniques he's invented a bunch of setups and a bunch of different pathways to techniques that world-class professionals use and when he's I mean when he watches it he definitely sees something he might see a hair or two past what I see which is gigantic in fighting right and so then when it comes to Muay Thai I I know a lot about Muay Thai but I defer to like guys like Marc telegram or Duke Rufus I'll ask them and they'll give me a certain take on things that may be different than then then my perspective it's like there's no way one person can understand everything better than anybody else there's too much to know there's too much even if you've got a guy who's an overall like Mighty Mouse Dmitry's Johnson who I think is the best fighter ever I mean I think if you look at his technique I think he's the best fighter ever there's guys that are better at more Thai than him there's guys that are better - just yeah he's just the best at putting it together in his weight class and dominating his division but still there's there's it's too big of a notion well that's what I was saying that very beginning of this conversation was I feel like both of us were probably here in this podcast doing this podcast when when UFC signed the deal with Fox which was I think the big blowup where it was like now all the sudden Fox was gonna brand it with with sports talent hosts and it was not just you and Goldberg it was it was it was it was it was like I remember hearing about big fucking Fox events where they had all their Jim Rome was gonna comment on it or not I'm not just saying right and that's what kind of sucks cuz I was like I was like I feel like you know I feel like the mainstream media was so against it for so long that finally when it pushed through to watch the mainstream media do this like almost like fucking arms right open like yeah that we've always been like just skip give us your insight about yeah it's just UFC skip give us your insight also it's such a complex it's not just putting a ball through hoop it's so lame what a gig that is though cuz the gig that he has is this thing that's where it's like what's your hot take on this and then those guys have to say something almost that is somewhat controversial yeah super drive yeah it's very contrived it's like it's like you know what Joe I disagree Nate is a better one 70 I've seen it and that that's just what I think and then that's like the take yes that he disagrees with everyone it seems like that's everyone like I'm not like I'm not I'm obviously I'm not putting Amy Schumer on blast but I feel like these days Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham I don't even know if they have anything to say other than the most aggressive thing that everyone will react to and then that keeps them famous interesting it's almost like blowing air under a feather it's hot air it's like it's like kicking the guy out of her show for for buying tickets and liking Trump you know and then you go well she didn't kick him out of the show she just told him get off the stage no she told him on leave on stage she bought the guy on stage but she said if you're not voting for Hillary leave my show I think she was saying if you boo people are booing her yeah because she was talking shit about Trump I'm not trying to put Amy on black stop I'm just saying like Lena Dunham I wish I had been had it had had an abortion she said that she goes I wish I'd had an abortion so I could be with all the girls of that had abortions I'll be on your side whatever well you know but just overweight it's probably affecting her brain people say things when they're not healthy it's a business it's a it's like that's the world she's in and whether or not it's conscious or not you're you're sort of playing to those people and I understand what she's saying like if she's trying look if they're trying to take away the right for a woman to have an abortion and she's trying to align herself with those people and she hasn't had an abortion that's a reasonable thing to say it sounds not disagreeing with what she's saying I'm just pointing out that it seems to me that the way I was just coupling on what he said the way to be in the media these days is to say the most outrageous things to get the most activity on social media so that you're still in the public eye I think these guys are scrubs that's what I think it is I think that guy's a mental scrub and I think this kind of way of talking about sports I think it's antiquated and I think it's gonna go away and I think that people just they gravitate towards it because it's like you know it's just gossip news bullshit so awesome that he wrote to himself such a dummy way to go exclamation point I just start doing that every day good job Joe I should do you know what I should do I should do like like really subtle insults you know backhanded compliments yeah yeah it's just the eye that's that same mentality though the mentality that makes you write a tweet like that to yourself is the same in town it's the backhanded compliment you got from an exec we were talking about you remember that yeah oh it was like we want guys that are like not like you know really good-looking that super super funny but like kind of like middle the road like we'd want to talk to you man yeah we don't want your talent to be threatening we want you to be the guy that I feel like me whatever regular guy I am at a regular job was better than you stars we don't want stars we want guys are accessible not too good-looking yeah I like we don't we don't want like a hosts toast we want a guy that it seems like watching a TV go oh I could do that and they could like a guy that's like talent you have not a lot of talent like all over the place knowing that good-looking overweight and I'm like okay like you know I mean like nothing shiny and I was like focus takes off during contract negotiations we could just kick you out he'll notice yeah it's like remember when they replaced the fucking husband on bewitched and nobody gave a shit yeah that's right and they both had the name Darren right no no no no they both had the name that both their names were very similar in real life different attitude got cocky and they fucking outed him remember when they did that on Roseanne they're replaced at one of the kids replace the kid no viv the older daughter got replaced they just got a little bit daughter and they made it like little subtle jokes about her look at different really and then they switched her back again yeah what were the two dad's dad's names in Roseanne Barr doesn't get be with Dickon okay here we go well babe which ditch debuted in the summer of 1964 was a rating smash from the word go the very attractive Elizabeth Montgomery was a cast was cast in the lead Samantha the witch and a skittish young actor named dick York was cast as her mild-mannered but hapless husband Darrin okay so where's the fuckin dick sergeant dick Sargent so they had the same name there so what does the division dick New York and dick Sargent where they look like let's go bewitched husband's dick Sargent what a gay awesome steam room named dick Sargent there you go oh yeah the second guy was like a weaker chin version of the first guy didn't stand up for himself speaking of my chin when do we do this shave we'll do it afterwards we'll do at the end of the show ding photos what about Aunt Viv wasn't that traumatized in you who's aunt viv Fresh Prince I never watch that show there was two of them and I'm talking about bewitch - no no Aunt Viv by the way I had a surreal moment with Will Smith when I first moved out to LA yeah we're in his car and an Uncle Phil was in the car in front of him and we were in who's Uncle Phil he was the dad and the younger guy that he lived with his uncle yeah enemies a fan and please will through his car and park and was like I'm gonna scare the shit out of go fill or he said his real name yeah and he got out and ran up and then laugh and then you watch this big man in this fucking Range Rover go like in the front seat and then they got out and they hugged and they talked for like five minutes stop like weird very weird apparently that guy travels like everywhere he flies Will Smith brings like a giant box of books there's a voracious reader apparently what do you what do you a give you this skeptical hippo look I know you don't believe it no I don't believe anything why cuz I believe everyone fucking concoct their own fucking horseshit reality so that they sell it to the fan he's never even been to Russia why do you why do you say no no I mean like you're feeling Cinna cause you lost today no no that's not why I'm feeling so bad have more coconut water I tell you it you wanted to win so badly he won yeah I really did I really wanted to beat so beat you in this I mean like more so than and then I think you know it reminded me of I was never super competitive like you know like I played on sports teams my whole adolescence and and through high school and I would you know play and compete and everything but I was more competitive with family you know in stupid shit right like there's a new video game me and my sisters are playing it then I was like fucking laser-focused and this kind of reminded me of that of being like I think it's because we're close that it reminded me of like a sibling thing like I got a beep fucking Bert at this what's our next competition oh my god Bert wants a rematch yeah it doesn't involve fucking water I'll tell you who are the water champ is it weird to not have water while you're the water champ man like my hydration there's no explanation there's no explanation for my there's no explanation for my hydration and it's like cuttin the water was like a vacation are you Muhammad Ali worse a lot of frustration with my hesitation on my hydration yeah all that shit man yeah I mean it really was all about a vacation and I did I followed that what I was told pretty much to a tee like jake Smith yeah what a dick where's Jake fight let me look it up yeah look Jake up how important was it to you Bert it seems like you were kind of like throwing in the towel this morning well you came here you're in place fucking certain well you did it differently than him he did he did the long haul you need you did the long strap I did the Sprint yeah a long strand I did a long strand DNA March do you look back on like the last few months there's fucking I could have tightened this bitch up there's a couple of mistakes I made five and one jake smith no photo of them he fights in prime prime fighting eight and so he's fighting in some smaller organizations but looks like he's got a good record hallo hallo Jake but there's a lot of guys out there that are good at cutting weight man I've seen some dudes eliminate ridiculous amounts of their body weight there's nobody better than this guy named glassing Tebow who got popped by you sada he got caught what a gang of shit yeah I think two or three different banned substances we got tagged in a bunch of tweets yesterday that we should we should be helping some big-name guy to do it they're like why don't you help fucking what's-his-name do it he must have not cut weight recently which guy by the way I can totally see that training for the fight not cutting weight does happen but you lose a shitload of money we got we got a bunch of them yesterday I can't remember is the gray Borg lost 30 Percy won this weekend he washed 30% of his purse because he was more than three pounds over so he has to give 30% of his purse to his opponent which is perennial yeah yeah when it which is crazy look fantastic Ray Bourque super talented guy but that's a that's a big amount of money to give to your opponent but three pounds at flyweight in particular that's a lot well they're fighting at 125 and Ray weighed 128 point something there's a lot of missteps I mean 129 actually they gave him a pound over they give you a pound to fuck with because it's not a championship fight during a championship fight you have to wait on the Nugget I give it's 170 F to a 1/7 you can't exactly you have a once a team is actually exactly exactly okay but in a non championship fight you get a pound play with how often does it because I've been at a number of weigh-ins with you that they have to just lose the underwear to make weight because I've seen that it happens so that's wet underwear on is that like you ain't yeah who or something it could weigh very little but that's enough it's the tipping amount because a lot of it it's one of those balance scales just it's just a hair an ounce whatever it is and then sometimes if they if they're still over what you have an hour yeah if it depends on the Commission depends on how much it really depends it depends on where you're at they do different weigh-ins now they do early weigh-ins the weigh-ins to take place early in the morning now the day of the fight yeah the day before the fight the day to record in that after duck Koo Kim ray Mancini and duck Koo Kim had this crazy fight they changed a few things after that fight one thing they changed is they stopped doing 15 round fights and they brought them down to twelve rounds and another thing is they started I think that's when they started doing weigh-ins the day before but I could be mistaken because of dehydration watch with your brain yeah at Fox do you bring pretty hardcore oh yeah it fucks with your ability to move it fucks with the wood literally the way your nervous system like your body works sort of I mean obviously I'm gonna fuck this up but there's a electrical current through your body that relies on water to function at its best I felt stumbly today oh yeah like I definitely felt stumbly on the treadmill I was out for sure your body's not functioning correctly you know shoot boys need some marijuana in your system oh my god how about that drinking not enough marijuana you haven't Yvette Pete's already visions going this will be good well it's a good anti-inflammatory frogs okay plus it's legal oh yeah very true yeah that's writing sound Connor ye oh I go for the green I'm tin cup what's tin cup he went for the green like he just couldn't stop going for the green today's the first day in four days why I haven't felt like I have to shit myself so I'm super psyched about that I had a stomach bug for the last four or four or five since Thursday I noticed it on Thursday really yeah gonna get another drink I don't think so hi four fucking eight hours after I had a drag that's a crazy just 24 hours in the day but were you worried about what is that thing probably UFO the present to me I see it stealth-bomber yesterday no flying over the valley yeah I was b-52 stealth bomber flying over the valley really something it's an office I got into I got into I got into a b-52 into the turret gunner is that right b11 I don't know which one it is you know the one that had a little ball underneath that you I'm not sure holy shit you wanna talk about panic yeah do you ever flying one of those no I flew in an f-18 once with the Blue Angels I had a bit about it I did in my act fucking amazing so great yeah we went seven and a half G's oh my god he's saying yeah there was some actor before me who did 5 G's and I'm like fuck that pussy I'm gonna beat that guy let's wrap it up and so we went we went pretty deep like I feel like insane like an elevator door is closing in on your brain like you see the darkness coming in from the left and the right like literally you can see it you could see your consciousness closing really yeah and you you do a thing called hooking we hold on to his straps like you're all strapped in and you hold on to your straps or the pilot would hold on to the handle and you go like this you're literally forcing blood into your brain to stay conscious and does the pilot do that too he has to yeah yeah that's crazy that there's something that the pilot could do that could pass him out Noah that's one of the things that I'd have to find another woman fucking we were flying maybe I don't know how how far off the ground but pretty low in this Canyon range that somewhere between San Diego and Arizona is that what it is San Diego in Nevada what's there Arizona right Nevada is up yeah yeah so it's this really crazy area where it's all this Blue Angel test flight it's like where they they practice is this Air Force Base out there and it's where they do their our test runs and they drop things like if they laid a test like where they would like drop bombs I guess and you're flying through this like small mountain range let's not go nuts man and while we're doing it my I see the darkness on the left and the right closing in and I'm trying to stay awake I'm going can I hear the guy in front of me doing it oh is this a guy yeah what is this Jamie a bunch of people this is like hilarious g-force training but oh yeah this is gelasa lives in 50 years this is a g-force training though this is not a actually being in the plane being in the boy training long gold g-force training is about the g-force training those you know you're in a simulator you know I mean it might be crazy you're spinning but you're not flying like you're not you can't look down and a hundred yards below use a mountain range now there's nuts man this guy was a bad motherfucker this pilot he took me through this wild ride through these canyons and I heard him doing it too he's going to hook so I'm like he's experiencing it too fuck man dude when they hit turns that's when it's nuts man it's like there's like there's banking turns that they make where there's so much panic just watching it do the bun around a circle they fly in tandem a fucking fly what you're moving still yeah do these guys fly in war like this yeah he's hooking right now that guy's doing that shit right now it's nuts bro I'm telling you it is like nothing I've ever experienced physically and it just makes you understand like the weird demands that you over because your body has like a very narrow window that it can operate in as far as like atmosphere as far as temperature as far as pressure all those things are very narrow like you're very we're very vulnerable it's one of the reasons why fighting is so interesting like you take apart like this Ronda Rousey fight for example you take a person it's obviously very physically strong right like a female cage fighting champion and you see your muscles and you see what she can do throwing people around but you realize that even a person that looks like that is super vulnerable all you have to do is get hit bang so he hits you badly hit you again also and you're in trouble bang they hit you again you can't respond and then you get knocked out like it's tough as a person might think they are as like in shape as a person might think they are if you get in one of those goddamn jets and you fly at seven and a half G's you take one some crazy turns and your body is literally like giving you got you're gonna go unconscious from the pressure it's it makes you realize like wow I'm so frail oh so frail dude I was I may have told you someone about this I'm sure I don't know my body is starting to recoup back to over right now with all this once more coconut water no no no I mean this vodka and that was perfect I feel really good right now I'm skinny and baked when when I went hello skiing in Switzerland we went up to I think we went to like 10,000 feet maybe 7,000 feet and it was in the mountains they took us up helis game drops us off and my dad was like you're gonna you can get really hurt but you're so confident like you live in this bubble where nothing happens to you but up there I couldn't even navigate like I couldn't even traverse the mountain a little bit to get within the line that we needed to disky down like I couldn't even walk through it it was like four foot powder so you're literally like like I mean it's up to your waist like you're stepping and it's up to your waist and you're like holy shit then I find even get my board on finally they helped me get my board on we start snowboarding and they're telling us there's crevasses to the right he's like okay stay within five feet from me to the right to the left and then I'm not good with accent [Laughter] this beacon on you and then when you got good okay here we go and so we start going and I for some reason I can't turn left like is no word perfectly fine but I can't turn off there's so much powder and and I notice that I'm just floating to the right away from his little fucking marks Oh towards where there could be avalanches or crevasses and I'm like shit and I'm thinking to myself this is like real vulnerability like going like I can't I can't go like can i count for some reason too much power for me to turn left so finally I just fucking cut it and I start cutting harder laughs I go okay time to go back right now I can't turn right and I fucking I'm facing face forward down the mountain cutting left and I see them in front of me am i catching nose and I fucking land face first into the snow four feet and I'm under the snow I'm gone and so I go to push up and as I put my arms forward they just disappears there's just nothing they don't touch anything they just go into this snow it is snow and I'm like and I immediately realized my vulnerability I'm like oh my god man this is it I'm on I am 10 down I'm guessing I remember the exact height 900 9,000 feet up a mountain and I'm the last one on this line no one saw me fall when will they start looking for me when what will happen to me within that time like and I start fucking panicking like hardest shit and I'm trying to move and flip myself at least over to my back and I can't I can't get I can't move at all and I hear my dad in my head go told you you're gonna fucking die and I was just like I know and I was like freaked out and then and then this I was sudden fall this hand on the backs we all had like these harnesses on with the beacon this hand pulled my harness up he's like you should see your sound guy and my sound guy is upside down skis literally like he's doing a handstand in the snow gear everywhere and when they pull him up he's like fuck this mountain let's go up this fucking mountain right now it was fucking but you think I'm a great skier I could do this and then you forget you forget you don't you don't realize your vulnerability every time you do an adventure thing you think that's like adventurous and they're like especially like when you you realize how much like nonchalantly you put your life in people's hands and that thing I mean like you go like oh I'm gonna pair a sail or something and they're like no this place does it and then you realize it's just some guy you know who fucking hangs out at that pier he is managing you know he's managing your life there if you get on like a fucking roller coaster I even think about it in cars sometimes I know like a couple comics that go I won't let somebody drive me anywhere like I know a couple guys that are like no one's allowed to drive me and I'm like why they're like I'm not letting just some fucking guy do drive me I'm sorry we'll take what if he's a horrible driver and they just there I almost panicked about it well then sometimes you feel that vulnerable like you realize it when you have a fuck-off guy driving you ya know like he's like what's that and like talking to you that's the worst and they're looking up in the rearview at ya yeah please don't you're going 80 that's Ober X right uber X I got an uber X to go to a podcast and they were like we'll send you of uber and I was like oh I'm just so used to taking the black car because that's what I takes I'm used to that I don't mind having a black car driving because I feel like the gays out of chauffeur license on the side somewhere yeah but like the uber acts it was just this fucking Chinese guy who's like 60 years old in a fucking Civic perfect and I was like oh this is great and he was horrible I was like I don't think he learned how to drive in his country let alone this one and he is literally and I was like how recently had B had been in America he was not speaking very good English they're like horrific English this is what he sound like okay I'm gonna take you up on it sounds like Yakov yeah cough yeah I did an interview with Yakov on my podcast he's a good dude he's a great dude he's a good dude he's at the Comedy Store all the time it's very friendly he's like his own theatre right he has sold in Branson Missouri right I think he got rid of it did he I died when I interviewed him I was probably a year ago by the way Branson Missouri is pretty fuckin badass and he was getting fired from Kansas said I have no clue he's in he's a really nice guy and he's a smart guy and he's a good joke writer yeah just talk to jokes are funny man he's just a guy that you know came up during a really strange time you know ari just texted me what'd he say you said you were 61 you're actually under six feet he's mad oh yeah he's bad yeah I wish we had a phone line to patch him in let's not do it he'll get mad we did it yesterday and it was a disaster he's angry yeah I love he's such an interesting friend to have on the spectrums of friends to have one of those yeah yeah it's just so I feel like I'm gonna step in as his friend and pay for this whole thing because you guys did it on my podcast yeah so I want to you keep saying that yeah just let it go all right so I'm gonna take care of it so Ari you're off the hook dude sorry just I don't want to seem upset just gives you mad well also like it was might have been his idea but honestly I benefited from it more than anybody cuz you guys did it on my podcast it's been good podcasting been fun yesterday never we've never done two in a row like this yeah they've never done something along these lines Tom was like called me when he's like we're doing two in a row Bert you have to carry this I'm not that funny [Laughter] I like doing to preview a podcast let me ask you this before I forget well what what could you have done to get yourself out of that snow nothing a lot of people get trapped in that snow like that is there a thing you're supposed to do he's supposed to move this snow away from your face you have air I'm sure there is I'd I'm sure you probably should start packing snow down and around you I don't know my cameraman Kendall is a professional snowboarder and he um he had a very similar experience we talked about it that night at a bar in Switzerland and he was telling me he was like one time he was flying through that he was going through the tree lines he went for me to do an accent yeah he was going through the tree lines and he hit a tree and all the snow that was in the tree buried him he was and he was upside down upside down he was in I guess it's called like a tree well people who ski no more know more about this than I would but apparently what happens is no snow falls around the tree at all and then it's very very light packed snow so you can get buried in it and he was like he said his back was fucked up but he was trying to get out he couldn't get out and he was like oh shit this is how you die I've had three friends die snowboarding like really friends yeah three friends died snowboarding hitting trees and shit one hit a tree one skied off a mountain and I saw his wife recently and I was like I haven't seen her since he died I was like just so you know I think about him a lot you know like cuz I'd say yeah because I went snowboarding when you go still working in Switzerland above the treeline so like where you have men your death pool is it weird it's not weird that you're allowed to do some shit that kills people and nobody bats an eye yeah everybody looks forward to it you know but if you if we was going skydiving you know like there's a there's a place I went skiing in Aspen and I went to this place and I was like how many people died here yeah this dude who lives there he goes police wanted to every year I get one or two every year I go what usually happens it goes trees to hit trees they float they fall off mountains they break their necks I go really he goes yeah yeah one or two every year I'm like whoa there's a freak everybody out there like I guess skiing so fun they just go fuck it yeah go there you go think about scuba diving yeah they fly gone hitting a tree is at least probably really lights out really fast I was watching a video of my friend Arbor he's a really good skier mm-hmm he can't ski ski look I can survive but he get I've only been skiing for four years but he could ski like he gets on Shh any human being who's using skis these days can really ski look like everyone else everyone my age just snowboarded but if you if you're a grown man and you're on skis you know what the fuck you're doing that's not totally true I learned skiing I never snowboarded oh really yeah I learned skiing four years ago here's Aubree flying down this hill like look see like you could tell when you look at a guy like that move like that's a guys can actually ski ski now that I'm skinny when I'm doing this yeah dude for sure you'll be doing a lot of things it's like taking a weight vest off yeah when I'm looking at him skin like okay well this is a motherfucker that skis so smooth like that's a guy's been skiing like a long time and he really knows he's doing my skis are always further apart I look all goofy I'm not that like he's really good if he's talking fucking poles he's good and he's really good friends with that Bode Miller guy who's that world champion yeah guys an interesting guy fuck yeah yes I mean - I've a good buddy my was on the US Olympic ski team my friend Steve Graham from time we were kids he was he's my friend he's an ophthalmologist and when I was a kid I was like 15 or 16 I'm at the whenever he this guy had at the time maybe ten surgeries on his knees 10 Giants cars up and down his knees where they used to have to open him up like the old days when they's do surgery they would cut you open like a fish and just stitch stuff together and hope it hung on God but like skiing like getting really good like that like how old would you eat when you learned 45 shut That's not me fuckin yeah I'm eating shit hard skiing before well dude when I was a kid man I avoided anything that I thought could possibly hurt my legs because I was doing so much Taekwondo because I was you know so obsessed with martial arts yeah I was like I and it's so dangerous as it is I'm like I'm not taking any extra I'm not gonna break my leg skiing or break my arm on a motorcycle or get fucked up in that way like what I'm already doing this so I avoided all that stuff my dad said that to me and we went to Windy Gap it was like a youth camp with Christian youth camp we had to see Jesus by the end of the week yeah yeah I met it what happened the shower well I had to tell my story to the camp what happened they were like yeah masini Jesus yeah Burt where's Jesus and I was like and I just taken a shower that day and I had like a cool moment the shower going like be it feeling grateful for life I was 18 get ready go to Florida State and they were like 18 in this I so thought you were 11 I could smoke cigarettes what you couldn't smoke there and and they brought me up in front of camp and I was like Jesus I was being real yeah which is I think the predominant times that I'm funny is when I'm trying to be sincere and I said I saw I saw him in the shower today and the fucking place fell apart they're like just sit down I was like I did have a cool moment the shower where I was grateful why can't you find Jesus when you're naked why does it Jesus has to come when you're in your tie with your shoes tied you should be able to be a rousing theme to it why not you should be like about to come yeah and you see Jesus and you clamp down in your dick like you're trying to choke it to death stop the car from coming out dude man so you don't want to be disrespectful right and then you go I love you Jesus and you let it go what if Jesus said it's okay son you can come they'd be a big time believer people are angry listen to us talk about this right why angry because you're not supposed to be talking about Jesus and pleasure yeah what if what if Jesus came to you in the middle of a massage you're lying on your stomach no sexual organs are involved but when someone has like oil on your in their on your back and they're rubbing their elbow across the spine just loosen everything up you know that feeling like arguably there's times where that feels as good as coming right arguably Yeah right there's like but why is that okay because it's not sexual like what what weird rules do we have about touching each other or you can lay down on your stomach and some lady that you don't know rub her back on like rub her elbow brother deep into your back and it feels amazing they're rubbing your feet incredible someone rubs your feet oh that feels so good but as long as it's not that good like dick good yeah long as it's not balls good balls and dick balls and dick hey hey hey can you rub the ass the cheeks yes yeah and a dangerous massage they rub your cheeks dangerous oh they're just getting into the gluteus maximus here Oh as long as it's not my hip flexors like fucking danger zones we're not allowed to yeah why can't they touch our dicks because because we grew up like big babies we had fucking ridiculous Puritans who got on rafts powered by the wind they floated over to someplace they weren't even sure existed they set up a bunch of stupid rules and the echoes of that stupid rules fuck with our dicks and assholes today I think they you know that was the whole product the whole thing about that there was a fucking doctor who was giving women orgasms and that was his thing yeah do you know I'm talking about I do yeah yeah there's been a couple stories like that where doctors to our finger in their patients to like to get him out of hysterectomies like well hysterical the word hysterical comes like that's the word another one the word hysterical or had something to do with like hysterectomy didn't it isn't that that they used to some doctors used to actually manually manipulate women to orgasm yeah back in the day there's a day before people get scared of vaginas there's a doctor in Beverly Hills called dr. squirts whoa that's not a real doctor stop right now don't use your credit card great fucking guy decided to go with dr. squirts but that's what the women call him oh my god so my wife said to me her friend sandy are like they heard about dr. squirts and they were talking to they're like is that cheating if we went to dr. squirts because he apparently gives you a massage and then gives you an orgasm it's like the best orgasm you've ever had it's so crazy that women are but it makes sense like if a woman was a chick with a good job and she's busy working and way up the corporate ladder doesn't have time to date assholes but she wants to get finger ranked yeah why couldn't she just do that yeah that's it's in that new movie yeah there's the fuck it's like the legal thriller that's out and she's the attorney and she has she hires guys to come on yeah she's like busy busy busy what movie is this um fuck what's her name the redhead I have to look it up man miss miss Sloane is that the name of the movie oh yeah I know you're talking about I know it's it's not about it's it's about gun control she's a yeah she's a lobbyist writer or a lawyer for a lobbyist yeah I think and Jessica Chastain so she plays like this really you know high power and she is finger-banged she goat she hires dudes to fuck her in hotel rooms she only has like and she you know hires him for like an hour got in it because she is all she has is like you know very little free time but anyway Liam was talking about that doctor squirts so do you think he's cheating would you let your wife go to doctor squirts I think guys that get paid to be able to bang chicks like that yeah like that is in in society's eyes that's probably way less looked down upon than a girl pays for sex like that guy is actually a stud isn't that odd like the guy if a guy gets paid to go and fuck a girl you don't go all that poor bastards being exploited right he's a stud right but if it was the reverse and it was a male lawyer right with red hair oh yeah get sex Yeah right the beautiful lawyer with red hair oddly enough if it's a woman yeah it's extra attractive and if it's met if it's a man it's open season on jokes right i ginger jokes I don't get it I don't want the fuck's going on with that red hair discrimination we have in this country it's prevalent here yeah it's pretty strong but if a guy was a male lawyer with red hair decided to get a prostitute we feel bad for the hooker right this poor girl yeah she's just gone down the pat road dude yeah with a leather belt around his dick you know that's yeah strolling into town he's just like yeah he's like a dick he's just a dick slinger yeah and no weird and getting paid paid how many of those are there remember that was like American Gigolo Richard Gere Magic Mike out of here yeah Mike about gigolos - yeah they were there were strippers I don't know if they were fucking girls but I'm sure they were and there was that gigolo show it was a gigolo show followed around real ones oh it's amazing you've never seen gigolos no I did learn about awesome things from you that's all he fucking does last night I was like you know I never heard a die Antwoord and before him are there the best oh but he was talking about die Antwoord when isla was born like you were talking about it in 2006 climate less die Antwoord you don't even remember them oh yeah those guys the shit I love that yeah and you were like what is this and then I watched it then became obsessed with your Landy foster they're both amazing bag on the far right the guy in the fire writes a rapper who you know in back know you know you know their names oh my god Tommy buns I mean there's brace he's like the the paternal horror of the group and the students covered in tattoos yeah he's like a really like sweats himself hard does he yeah the guy in the left is like he connects with them like energy he's Hawaiian half black half white the guy next to him okay can he can like he can give you like that brother dick I sense it he would have the hog of the group okay you know the biggest oh he's got a hammer on him for sure who's the Silver Fox on the gray one how old's brace brace is like like as I say he's the he's kind of like that's actually their Booker the guide to his left he runs the the hooker studio and then that's a new hoe on the right he's a southern hoe he's like from Nashville or something so the older gentleman is he hoeing as well yeah he's how the brace has been doing it the longest he's been like he's been at it like 2530 years he's just he's just been fucking and then got paid cause he was realized Rob Lowe a little bit what looks like Rob Lowe the eyes in the eyes and the eyes you definitely should work for what those police this guy's a good he's been on our podcast a couple times when I was trying to promote especially you guys in that but you had brace on we have a bump for bracelets two years ago oh okay but we haven't had a guest in Jesus birth doesn't have to be about you buddy yeah he is but isn't it fascinating though that like a person who does that he was like he always goes out of his way to be like look dude I'm not a fucking $2.00 meet me button in the alleyway ho I'm like I know but it's just fun to call a guy awho yeah he's kind of accept the fact you know um what I was thinking that we were talking about earlier about this Ronda Rousey thing and why people are so mean and I think there's a certain there's always gonna be like a certain backlash from someone who tries to be extraordinary because it makes us feel like weak and and and lazy in comparison and like not as ambitious like if someone wants to be the best right at anything if so true Williams are the best whether it's Conor McGregor or whether it's Ronda Rousey like that that also rush to make it to number one scares a lot of us yeah because it makes you look at what you're what extent you're willing to go do for what you want to achieve and then it makes you go am I actually doing things like fulfilling my own potential that's what those moments do and you can become jealous if it goes wrong like way more than you want to punish anyone else for anything else that goes so then let's let's put this in perspective because I just that by the way I'm dumb talking about friends of mine I'm not calling people out at all but like I saw Kevin Hart today on CNN and I wasn't about comedy he was talking about how his job is now to inspire people to be better and I was like I was like that's odd that I would hear Kevin talk like that because he is funny as shit and that's what he's really good at is being fucking hilarious but apparently is like a fitness guru and like he's like it's he's on a different level now and I went Wow is that the level where people start to fucking like what they did with Amy or what that you know like or what they did with Dane is like you see a comic get bigger than that and then all of a sudden everyone's like slip up once and will fucking eat your lunch for sure there's a lot of that and you know it's like you want to celebrate the people that take the risk to climb to the highest mountains but you want to mock them if they may fall but it's oftentimes not the same people that are mocking them like we're all experiencing like obviously I have zero animosity towards Ronda Rousey and a hundred percent admiration for what she stands for as a competitor like what she tried to do and what you accomplished and the coming back thing so I don't experience it on the negative side but the on the the people that do though the people that feel like they have a free shot to go at theirs there's enough of them that it makes a difference so even if all the same people appreciate you whether you win or lose the perspective shifts because so many more people that maybe you wouldn't normally be in contact with who are negative or mocking it and and and you know and really like being like absolutely vicious about the criticism and the way like trying to knock you down yeah when you're already down it's not just a matter of it being accurate or funny which you're gonna always have that you're gonna always have people that crack jokes and make fun it's always gonna exist yeah but it's there's this there's this viciousness of attacking someone who's in there and some of it there's some Veneman everything and that's part of my me wonders like I go is that like I've never been cool with self-promotion as well as made me uncomfortable but I've seen people in our business that are very cool with it well you know Kevin Hart is a master at it you know but he knows what he's doing and he's a very very smart guy yeah he's very smart on many levels but at the ED I wonder I think Kevin would I don't know Kevin would not say he's he's aspiring to be a mogul he's aspiring to surpass not just being an entertainer but but to being a culture culture culture influencer he is he already was that hard to say cold answer but he is article about him and he's on the cover of a Fast Company and yeah I saw that I was reading the article and it's just it's incredible the amount of things he's gonna buy a studio like a big warehouse actually not far from here and wants to produce you know TV shows movies like online content all within there continue to do movies obviously he has the stand-up he has you know has endorsements from like an athlete would all these different shoe deal Judy is an app I think he like a wizard yeah it's like it's all these different everybody I mean if you want to be that guy should follows footsteps and by the way he's that guy that's the other thing about Kevin or at least I'd that I don't I only know him from when we were kids like when we were young starting from that time I don't know him I haven't talked to him and probably probably ten years that did it Beatty show with him did you he's his greatest guy in the world he's the greatest fucking guy in the world but he met him once he's very nice guy but he's uh he I have a funny story about him I bought a pair of Jordans one time it at the mall I was gonna play basketball and I bought Jordans I didn't know you didn't play basketball in Jordans yeah they put don't know you know that's the bit it's the light life lesson here what are you talking about it's this when you're when you're black are you but no no but this is the rule you know when the Jordans are not meant for white guys so so when you're when you're black you play basketball in basketball shoes like shitty shoes but your and Jordans are meant for like going out Jordans are like nice shoes you don't wear him on the basketball court that's the rule I didn't know that I bought a pair of Jordans thinking I'd go play basketball they're the best basketball shoes that's not the rule so when you buy Jordans they come in a jordan bag then I'll just come in like a footlocker bag they come in to Jordan bag Kevin Hart was in the mall and he saw me and my buddy Kroy walking through the mall and I had a Jordan bag and Kevin came up and he grabbed my Jordan bag from behind my back and he was Jordans and I turn around and all I saw was his skin color I didn't see Kevin and I went help and I screamed and Kevin saw the racism in my eyes I'm like oh bird but is that racism or you being robbed but anyway I wasn't trying to say give me them Jordan Jordan he grabbed the bag is shook it now I freaked dude I jumped it like a shark in the water that was a Chinese guy you'd be shitting your pants yeah if somebody else if they had been roll reverse did he had done that to somebody there's a good chance you got punched somebody if they don't expect it like yeah you know sometimes you just catch someone and they're already on seven what's going on my fuckin wife just fucking and we've all been like you know have you ever been in a road rage situation where someone cuts you off and you just get so much more mad than you normally would yeah yeah I gotta know what you like you fucking cunt and you're like how is it where did this come from like I had to react obviously this person is an idiot this is a bad move but what is it that gets you to seven so quickly do you get that lesson where you live versus Hollywood now you can get it everywhere man when I Drive out where you live or where I live or where Tommy lives like this area mm it's a little chiller like it's not Hollywood is fucking too much aggressive just outside of Hollywood Hollywood adjacent well they can't quite live in Hollywood but they right next to it they work there and they getting higher yeah Studio City ish you know it's Sherman Oaks ish a lot of fucking crazy drivers out there yeah tech critters you ever arrived somewhere out of seven like yourself you know like check in at a hotel yeah yeah I've done that where I've you know it's a bunch of shit led to me getting there and then I have like an exchange with somebody and then later I'll go back and be like I just want to tell you earlier I got here I felt like I was a little yeah short with you and they're like no problem they're always very much downplaying it but I'll feel bad about it you know I had a fight with the with a with a car driver guy who drove me from the airport in front of my house like not a fistfight but verbal fucking because he was late he was like thirty minutes late to pick me up and then when he did show up he was at the wrong terminal and then when he did get me he blamed it on me yeah for not telling him where I was landing and I was like that's not my job yeah and then he got when I dropped when he dropped me off he got mad at me cuz I didn't speak to him the whole ride home at headsets in and I fucking told you he actually said I said to him I got out and I go I gotta be honest you the man that's not the best service I've ever had and he goes well it was a little disrespectful you're not speaking to me and I was like what and he goes you didn't talk to me the whole ride that's that's disrespectful I went it's not my fucking job to entertain you I go your job is to drive do you think I hired you to have a conversation but I realized I'm having this fight with this guy in front of my house I don't know anything about him and I was like and then I was like and I had by the way I was gonna tip him in the middle like I had 20 bucks in my hand and he goes I go just so you know that wasn't the best experience I've had or whatever and then I had the 20 bucks my hand he was like I was respectful and then we started going back and forth and then I said I was like fuck you I'm not giving this to you and then in a weird way I went Burt give it to him or he's gonna come back and murder your family yeah and so I was like all right you know what take it we're even and then I had to come back and go I apologize I should and this is the weird part about my brain that is what I started this whole fucking talk about is is that I start going hey Burt how important in this fucking spectrum of life is it that this guy is 30 how often have you been thirty minutes late helps me be 30 minutes late and then maybe got an attitude because you were defensive I don't know maybe this guy was a cuckold I don't know that's what I thought about today when you were late I was at least two minutes I ran here yeah it's a no fucking avail it was closed I should have my uber driver dropped me off in front of place you know Amman I mean I think the reality of people talking to each other is we combat exchanges sometimes and things get started like right away like something goes wrong with him and he shows up late and so your interaction with him is already unbalanced because you expect him to be apologetic but how could he really apologize you know yeah fucked up you did so now I know who you are you're that guy who doesn't take his job that seriously and you gonna drive me I'm just gonna put my head FET sets in and he's mad at you that you do that like there's a lot of things going on there man and maybe if he showed up on time the same guy and you would have had a great old time maybe there was a moment where he's driving and my headsets are in and they're really good noise reduction headsets there molds to your ear maybe he was driving he's like hey man I'm really sorry I'm going through a lot of shit just like this mm-hmm I mean I don't know there's a lot of scenarios that could happen for sure I'm always things out of assumptions you know you know assumptions always like yeah well he looked like this and then the way that he looked I know that guy's an asshole you know are you ready for the difference of what you look like mmm Tommy looks different I mean I'm being serious when I said physically yes from the weight loss you look do you look there was a there's an on assuming this to you like when I wash your last special mostly stories and mostly as I say mostly stories yeah like that Kansas City and promise weekend yeah but like there is like a real fucking coolness to you like like a Carmel coolness to you but now you look like a fucking like like and so when you meet people do you see people perceiving you differently mmm not really not I mean there's so most people that you know would come to my show or those people that I'm talking about Starbucks holy shit look at the difference in between you and then holy turn turn turn straight oh shit Tom Wow fucking neck is bigger your heads bigger shoulder face is so much bigger so much bigger yeah everything's bigger your fingers yeah is your ring looser yes do you feel like God's telling us we should cheat yeah pull up pull up Bert's was it called sometimes no I'm not only 15 pounds lighter for the special the special was last wait for the special do you guys know you want to see a good one pull up Ari Shaffir dildos good that one right there that's not as good as flying dildos go to flying dildos is when I was he's right he's right she fears flying dildos it's get on YouTube yes he is

it's like a fun little experience to go really yes in Hong Kong yeah that's the only thing that's changed is this little fold right here what size are you there like what weight are you probably 250 Wow yeah dude you look really different well you dude you still lost 30 fucking pounds I mean you're kind of down on yourself a little bit in this thing that's a giant accomplishment you know a few people have the willpower to lose 30 pounds like that in that quick of amount of time and that was a Herculean effort you guys understood I don't even know if you understand the impact that it has on people when someone does that you see people do it you know so many people out there right now they didn't think that they had the ability inside them to do it yeah but they love you guys and they listen to your podcast and they hang out with you guys and you you know you do shows in their town they do they come to the show they know that you did it you just you did it and you there's nothing like I know you're a person you did it I'm 30 pounds overweight I want to lose the weight I know Burt did it I can do it too now yeah that's real those are the cool sweets we get I know there's been a lot of really cool ones where you go like hey man and I like when they're they do it there's a joke attached to but like they go hey man this has been the coolest thing I've ever seen come on Bell did you see his tweet yes come on that was like I didn't think this would be as fun as it is this is awesome I want to be a part of it yeah you want to lose some weight I thought that was really cool come on such a fucking great he's a really nice guy I've had a mom before he's a super nice guy super sweet sir yeah Ronnie talking about doing another one that'll be great if you wanted to do that who does he want to do it with take someone you hate fun and it's encouraging you know and then people could do it too it could become like your own personal roast battle yeah there were shots fired back and forth from between me and Tom yeah that was a fan I would go I would have been like I like these guys this is what I'm fucking talking about Tommy drink your vodka soda I responded on the end of his podcast he released today inviting me over to your place the bet took place and what I didn't first of all there's no way in my mind I expected to lose that bet one of them to be below a beast was fuckin beyond incomprehensible both of them it was a sure thing for me it was a sure thing I mean it turns a bag of bats like we do on punch-drunk this one such a sporting event fucking gold I got it in the bag of course they're not both gonna be under obese and I guess they are I mean my I hope I'm hoping that the tomorrow they're gonna weigh in and they're gonna be a little bigger and maybe maybe Segura only be six feet tall if he's six feet tall he's right on the border right now face or not bees it's at six one thing that gets him under six feet he gains about a point and a half on his BMI that's that's one my only hopes that tape measure if he's 511 then I'm good but I doesn't seem like people are believing that but Segura said he was 511 and now I got these people fucking threatening me from a social media I've got people threatening me and telling me like to call me well sure we haven't even have the two weigh-ins yet we're supposed up three weigh-ins but fine we're good the first one the first I assume they would do that one at home that rogen second third two days in a row they got a time I haven't officially lost sure I got people threatening me I don't feel safe my friends are coming at me off chance I lose we all go to a Dodger game Bobby fine you lost some weight I don't have a Dodger dog don't have the extra large/1x barbecue fucking seven times a week fifteen pounds fifteen thirty that happen and then I got my friend set it hit me up for fucking they want first-class tickets to Europe I'm flustered I'm flustered for sure I'm I'm afraid I can't be here with this I can't be here with them coming after me like this they haven't even weighed in the second day but it's gonna happen I know it's gonna happen tomorrow so if they each lose a pound unless sighs unless Thomas 5:11 I mean that's it that's a chance yeah if Tom's 511 I got a chance that I mean he'd win the bet for most lost weight but they wouldn't both be under obese so fucking Bert would have to you guys you you haven't dealt with this kind of like backlash until you've dealt with it you haven't dealt with it that guy you killed that the the the lion in Zimbabwe or Zaire one of those places disease in Africa for killing chutney until you find out all there's 80 80 80 get Lions get killed every year they got to keep the population down and they start killing babies human babies but nobody cares about that so this fucking dentist in Rhode Island has to face death threats all the time you don't know what it's like to get a fucking ear age against you and these people are coming at me and my phone calls my texts it's you know first of all I can't text thread with the flip phone so every text comes in new they ask question like what does that mean either a while because [Laughter] that is under height barring that I I don't know I can't be here for this I can't I can't be here with them coming after me I got to get out of here I got to get the fuck out of here and I got to get away from this hmm until I could figure out what to do oh my god that's what I got to do that's what I got to do I gotta get the fuck away from this yeah yeah that's my answer yeah that's okay anybody wants to listen to the rest of it or all of it Ari Shaffir skeptic tanks one of my favorite podcasts Oh still all the time it's awesome I recommend the Henry Rollins one which Burt's golf dad I didn't sky different it's extremely dismissive of them fuck it was insulting he's got a gang of them Dave Smith is a great one no no the best one the best ones Running of the Bulls oh that's a great fucking great one's got a lot of great one sorry has a really really good pocket he's gonna run off he's gonna run off the map right now for a while he's this bit yeah good he needs to I mean if he thinks he needs to he needs to but what I love about what our he's doing is he's living his life 100% on his terms he's not doing it by anybody else's standards and he does he's doing the exact what I think the best thing a comic can do if he makes it like once you make it like relax and just just have fun and be yourself and only do the things you want to do and don't let him suck in in nonsense but you've been on both sides of that fence yeah for sure the Fear Factor was like post I'm talking about only pre family yeah that too oh yeah that's a different thing I mean if you had a family it would be a totally different thing but he or even if even considered having one or even a girlfriend it'd be a different thing but he's been tied down the past and right now what are he's enjoying is like creating stand-up doing stand-up doing his podcast and just enjoying life and enhancing his perspective and taking it all in and and these trips that he goes on he's like orchestrating them he wants to see things he wants to he wants to absorb experiences from other parts of the world and it's all enhancing his stand-up - that is very that's very accurate and I say this is I've said this from my perspective as probably an expert in world travel I would tell you or he does it better than anybody and I'm not even fucking around I've done it for seven years straight but Ari went to Switzerland and and had a different life experience than I did and I went one now mine was under production but like he really does it great I wanted to pitch his show so bad that we're you know it's always disappearing right now I wanted to be a show go can I find Ari like can I find him well you'll be able to find him it's social media so no he's going on the grid he's going off the fucking grid as I mean know he's who wants to go where there's you know he's not bringing any laptop or anything like that no disappearing for real other people have phones they'll say Oh Ari's in Sweden I don't know I think he's lonely Micronesia or some shit he's trying to go off path to get malaria yeah the pills I told him to take dude do not take the pills malaria pills he talked about I thought I'd fucking the injections though I had a horrific switch did you do vaccinations vaccinations yeah we'll just don't take him doll ship I'm not gonna get malaria what I thought a lot of people get malaria no no I'm talking about - about this on your podcast I took malaria pills ohms I was fucking right I would remember the charts for a while my friend Justin wren got malaria three times though three times fuck molero the dengue fever is one you'd only get well malaria has killed half the people that have ever lived yeah yeah yeah in the basket people that have ever died half the people that have ever died have died from malaria yeah but that's what before they had malaria but they don't light that up one more time Tommy let's get let's see how fucked up we can get what come on Tommy come on sorry text pretend you're big Tommy barge yeah arse trooper happy that his rich friend decided to step in and foot the bill fuck yeah Hey Joe did you ever hear the Ballad of big Tommy buns that's pretty fun the song I wrote I'm not gonna let you play it here but like I wrote a song about Tom and that was the greatest part of this whole thing is I really made a song oh yeah the baton played and sang I wrote played and sang a song called The Ballad of big tummy buns oh how dare you and I was and I might but my the one cool thing about this and this is esoteric I might as well hit this I don't think I've ever said anything's esoteric but please continue you never said it for you to join I never said this is esoteric this is so fucking I don't even think I exactly know what esoteric means I don't either Joe but it sounds good in a sentence like would it give me the exact definition of esoteric yeah pull that up with you okay what do you think esoteric means it's out there yeah right bizarre what does it mean here intended likely to be understood by a small number of people with specialized knowledge this is Nessa Tara Tara this is esoteric so this what i'ma say is esoterica intended or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest or an enlightened inner circle Joe Rogan this is esoteric what I'm about to say and you will get this more than anyone that's a lot of pressure to hit that and then listen I think you'll get it do you now sometimes when you work for a corporation and your paycheck is dependent on that corporations approval not right now I'm in the middle of an esoteric statement yes okay and and then you get out from under that corporation and all of a sudden you're the one that kind of you get you almost like feel your creativity again like you go like oh fuck I forgot I'm a really great stand-up I forgot that I'm passionate about making video or like you know you know and you go oh I can be my own voice I'm it's my own ship now I forgot that when I started this business what the goal wasn't to get under the umbrella the goal was to be out there in the fucking ocean by myself and sailing my own ship right and get saying go take a left fuck it right um this weight loss battle coincided with my decision to stop being under contract for a Travel Channel and I was I was really lost I was really lost and I was like I didn't know where I'd where I didn't know if I should just take another television deal and or just do another deal will try I didn't know what I was to do I really didn't know what to do and this weight loss battle happened around that time and it can and like Bill burr says Pro ethically I started taking on water and I felt fucking crazy about it and then one morning I woke up and I went oh Tom is having a lot of fun with this like he's having fun him and Bush are having a lot of fun and I was like I'm gonna write a song and I wrote a song and I wrote this stupid song I looked I was like I was but it was like I felt very creative and I didn't feel like there was any parameters on me anymore and I was like oh this is what my career is about my career is about doing everything I like and everything I like and if you like what I like come see me do stand-up but if you don't like what I like like fuck it this is what I like to do this is my this is my walk this is my walk through the woods and it was like and I know the I don't think Tommy can attest to that as much as you can because being under Fear Factor I don't think you ever were like under anyone's control there's definitely a a corporate umbrella that you're under where you're like I can't you know how long not smoke pot on camera again you know like long time yeah and so as soon as that fucking happened all that happened I wrote that song and it was like it's one of those moments where she's like oh I get to do whatever the fuck I want to do anymore like yeah I'm just a dude that likes for comedy the same way ari is where he goes I'm getting off the grid that freedom that freedom man being untethered Ari night had a long podcast about being untethered but being untethered is so cool as an artist you just get to do what you want to do you know that's why we loved that's why we probably loved guys like Ron White Jim Jeffries these guys that are that are Bill burr they're just untethered sorry Joey I get inspired by the way our he's living I really do sure I really I get it gives me enthusiasm he's having fun he's creating x' doing stand-up he's just he's making rational choices regardless of like how much money it'll cost him he's like this is what I want to do for my art is what I want to do for my standup I'm taking time off I'm just gonna go experience life and write and you know people like what what are you doing where are you going and he's like this is what I'm doing stop I know what I'm doing yeah he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing it's like and for me haven't known him since he was an open mic er yeah it's a lot you've really seen them you've you've known him in a way that I don't know him like humor we were talking about you one time in front of his apartment those are the best you know that we've had him to when you go to take someone home you drop them off from their house beat you sit and talk for 10 more minutes you got one with Bill burr that I I wish I had yeah it's great um but Ari dropped me off news like we were talking about we were just talking about intimacy levels like this is gonna sound silly and I'm not gonna call Ari out but I'll say this is what we're talking about we were talking about like how much the we were talking about you and then and I said something like oh I texted me I said I feel bad texting him again and our he goes well I don't want to text him too much either and I said yeah he's our friend we should be able to text him the way we

balls get in my pocket it's not quit so what a ball tikka that's their local beer in Saint Peter's bro you a beer in your back yeah that's is that purple or is that like a bluish it's a purple Kelsie fanny pack that was the best if I could go back I can find that fanny pack I wear it every day of my life it was the best man I've ever had because the way they made it was that it the top part was flat you know so it went out like a solid three inches so you rest your beer on that no no no so that when you opened it you were looking at like a portfolio of your stuff it wasn't slid in like another pocket that was the great if anyone can find me that purple Kelty fanny pack so you see if see if young Jamie Savage you can find all the pictures of the Russian mafia what is this from it's like an article about your last Showtime special I knew your nose by the way you want to hear what a dummy I am I posed for that picture having no clue it was the fucking cover of an Walter oh that's hilarious I had no fucking clue really yeah he was like and I was like so they asked you dressed like that you didn't know why they brought the shit did a photo shoot no no Valerius I had no fucking clue that's weird did you do the tea party did you ever see Van Wilder no ever see it no I don't remember I really don't remember I may have it's hard to tell what sorry whether or not I've seen it it's one of those movies like hmm I've never seen it I watched a Christmas vacation the other day so far dude that is a goddamn funny movie still dinner's fall that's a good movie man it's a great fucking movie yeah it's yeah I mean it is a great movie the way I'm saying it I'm like it's like I really enjoyed it who should like that one more time yeah yeah come on Tommy drink finish that bag of Tommy Tommy come on burgers going D I love this feeling mmm this could be a if I yeah ice I've never seen been Wilder and I took a meeting with their production company they brought me in whoa to do a sitcom and they're like you know dad my book in front of me they go do you know Maya we are on I was like no and like we produce my Walter day for any work one do a sitcom and I was like okay and then I could never seen it and they're like no and this is what they said they said well we should get Ryan Reynolds to come on your podcast and watch it live with you I was like shit because it's his production company's black horse I think production company oh man what I taste like barbecue what that last hit tasted like no Tommy it's yours Tommy Tommy it's yours do you need me to hold you down tickle you Tommy's good I'm totally reasonable and his approach we just cut off a fucking bender bro do you feel like you can release the hounds now and dive back into the fold with a vengeance simply with drugs and alcohol for a little bit would yeah but like it but not not food I know it's really crazy is that I had that I don't know I'm sure you felt it too because I watched you eat it but like that second piece of pizza didn't work well with me like my body was it was up in my throat and I was like wolf and I was like I was too much of everything at one time did you feel the same way yeah I don't feel like good yeah yeah but the vodka is flowing I have a business meeting I'm gonna do great that's plenty of time yeah be slightly buzzed I used to hear stories of Chapelle going into auditions highest fuck yeah my score I wish I had that confidence you know part of me goes that's why he's so successful is he even didn't give a fuck yeah oh for sure yeah well dave was another example of a guy just does things the way he wants to do him and he knows it's he realized after a while I guess when your guy like ham or a guy like re that it doesn't benefit you to have people influence you and tell you what to do just doesn't and all three of us are a great example of that like the best stuff I think that we've done is stuff that we've done online where you just you're yourself yeah you know like your podcast with your wife that that podcast is you guys know super fucking silly together like you always are and this is all this genes mommy talk and it's fucking great and that would have never happened if somebody through you know had the the reins to it if there was a bunch of people that were executive producers and Comedy Central had like ten people behind this I'm not getting this genes what's high and tight what's high and tight and what do you mean when you're Glasson when there's no reason for you to do it other than it's funny to you that's it that's it that's the only I try to tell people I could I'm sure you get asked a lot I get like don't you get them from people ago how should what should I do what to start remember you're developing a sitcom yeah did that ever happen or they go away it went away oh can you please tell everyone what the premise what Walmart like fucking Richmond Virginia and Tom calls me we're talking about sitcom talk and he goes yeah I'm developing like real serious really what's your character and he goes me I'm a doctor you know make a doctor yeah I know but there was a doctor they graduated last a medicine so he's like essentially a dumb doctor Tom going scalpel doctor was the best premise I've ever heard of a sitcom ever my fucking doctor I could be a strake but the look on your face I think I've ever how long did I laugh on the phone really long and really hard where I was like I didn't know what I'd done yeah oh you probably made me laugh harder than any one person that I know hmm really a hundred percent I do feel like everything has to be a contest well I feel yeah I feel like she's number one you know when we do even the bird stuff we do it to make you laugh I feel like there's a part of me that wants to make you laugh all the time seriously there's parts I wish I could share them on this podcast but there's part x times the my favorite parts of tom is when he is like he's like this the side liner that says the thing like or is affected by something like the only one I can think of that that's very very applicable is me and Tom did did when I shaved his tits we were in Honolulu doing Pearl Harbor and the two things they the two things they said to us that were recollected would like that we remember don't make fun of the wine people and if it's brown and it moves kill it yeah that was what they said these the the fits brown and it moves kill it and don't make fun of Hawaiian people so Tom goes up his first joke was hey man I'm in life here slow that's what they told me I didn't know they were talking about the Hawaiians metabolisms holy shit fucking huge laugh but immediately it's off the like you can't is not you're not allowed to say that gets on the set kills comes back to me Russell Peters goes on stage and you can hear the murmur in the crowd and Tom does this like snidely whiplash like giggling about killing it and Russell Peters doesn't set mediocre I would say at best and rustled murderers but but it's because he's brown and at that time they're saying it but Bratz as Miss Brown and they moved kill it it's true and then we had the never the the show organizer was like you guys fucked this up bad remember oh and then he was like he was like I told you not to fucking make fun of the local people I told you not to I tell you pg-13 you know that means I was not pg-13 I told you he's like there's children and there's wives of Admiral's here oh no everything yeah Peter's the coolest fucking guy yeah to Testament he like like whatever to have a fucking his gas tank no that's also completely empty he really just whatever he wants for sure yeah he's awesome he's the best I would be the guy would be like I need to have some fucks in my gas tank do you remember you don't though I think you've been connected to this idea that you need to for so long if I didn't have folks my gas tank do you remember the girl that was on the tour of Pearl Harbor that wasn't like with us necessarily you're talking about yeah and so we were talking about dipper Lee yes Russell Peters was dating the dumbest human being I've ever met I'll call him right now he knows definitely not he knows it that he no I he knows that we've talked me and Russell talked about this on my podcast yeah okay okay so it's fine trust me okay first thing before we even go on the tour I say to Russell in front of his it's me Tommy and push Leanne and me and Russell and Kimberly tymberlee and I say I said and then Russell's brother Clayton who might be my favorite being the world amazing I love his brother comes in and sits down and I go oh hey have you guys ever seen that Indian porn star I don't what's her name what's her name and all of a sudden everyone's face is shut and she's like are you talking about Syria no they it was a shot and then you're like she's so fucking hot she's the fucking I kept talking about how great this well I've never been attracted any woman this is a woman I switch my button and then Russell and Clayton are going like this like they're laughing so hard and then she goes he dated her and Sierra Leone is her name you're right yeah and then then the next day we went on the cruise to Pearl Harbor go ahead Tom we're on this cruise and it's very kind of somber serious and then he goes but now he's giving us the tour it's an admiral rear admiral he's like we're on the approach here where I guess it's the Arizona isn't that right that's underneath yeah and he goes the Arizona is up here on the right and then dim Billy goes are we gonna go under and we're in an open boat like on the tour it's a boat yeah shit the boat like where you can see the sky and stuff she thought it might turn into a submarine yes just like an open air like we're just gonna get under right now right so I'm gonna try to press the button the best group of people to witness that statement with is Russell Peters who says his arm around her and you watch his eyes go like leave it off and then push are sitting right next to her and pushes like stomping her feet going and then tumbling imagine someone thinking that technology has reached a point when you could be in a boat and all sudden they press a button on the roof comes over the boat and you dive underwater look out the window that far off yeah that you think you're under submarine because they're all boats or submarines right they all go why wouldn't you just go under the water if you could wait does our first boat fucking submarine how about a better one no oh dude in Disneyland panic there's such close quarters fucking is sanicball man talk to me dude first of all Suzie close the door what everything where was it went down a hundred and nine no nice to par but must bend a hundred feet Hawaii went down what was it for I was just floating in a submarine for TV you getting a submarine what kind of submarine was it just I don't know man I'm not good at details it was like yeah yeah you get war submarines no I'm sure it was touristy like oh really yeah yeah but once you get in was it a boat that turned into it or was a submarine oh shit but getting in there is very claustrophobic same I'd imagine being into a like an f-14 or something to be claustrophobic same shit and you start going down then you realize like oh fuck if something goes wrong everyone dies immediately there's no there's no like there's no like exits there's no egg they don't give you a speech at the beginning they just go everyone sit down let's hope we do this you know it would be the craziest community in the world well if you could build an underwater under Ocean City they got one I think like like a submarine city where you literally build it into like you take a train through the ocean yeah to the center of the ocean where you have a city where you know you can't survive if anything goes wrong and you all live in this little thing where you have to keep that train path open because that's where the food and air comes from that's the only way other than that here any do you know how supercharged life would be yeah you know how much people would be this could fuck up so this constant checks on all the tolerances of all the joints in and you're just sitting there just being nice to each other having martinis hey hey I'm gonna go to sleep you think you can sleep every day is like that no and there's always enough air there's always enough air there's always enough food as long as you keep that train open but if anybody is unhappy they just put a suicide vest on and go running in the middle of that fucking train oh that would happen how quickly to be no dues would close off the blockage big guys like fucking you would just close off the boxes you know all right there's a tariff being paid that's how it work yeah yeah dude but would that work today would that work today because he used to work but it used to work without communication like the kind of communication that everybody has today with a smartphone you know I don't know if it would work the same way I don't think you'd be able to do that the way you can a hundred years ago or 200 years ago you would have to have like a super supportive community there's yelling and everybody would have to be like treated equally otherwise if there's any disparity whatsoever also one I have to do is if I can point a gun at the wall yeah and it wouldn't last guy with a wife beater on and a fucking Clint Eastwood bag the joke I saw in my head that I could never get out is we were on Catalina one night and with my sister's we're all smoking pot and they said and there's Buffalo that roam around there and so I said why is there Buffalo here and then my buddy Chris Gillan goes Oh back in the 30s the 20s the owner of the Cubs owned them owned this island so he used to have spring training out here so he brought the Buffalo out and my sister goes for a scrimmage and I saw the owner coming out in a seersucker chute seeing Buffalo on one side and the Cubs working out he goes I'm at the fucking team like and I could not stop with a cigar like but like that when you can visualize it is the best Oh Tommy let's kill this vodka come on let's kill this vodka you're going I'm going hard for Tommy congratulations buddy Thanks listen listen I gotta be honest with you I I feel personally I can't enter a bet no I didn't go home I didn't go soft today I went hard today I went really hard on the treadmill I didn't go hard not to shave your beard yeah really I mean is here it's like I was like I was like that's the moment that's the moment I don't know I can't leave here without a beard I feel very guilty I feel like I feel like everyone that tuned in everyone the watch goes like goes like I meant done really matter to me but then part of me goes I don't know I'll leave it up to you guys oh you're switching that now no no no I'm putting in your hands I don't you mean that you're not owning it you're not saying no you can shave my beard I'll give a fuck no but you just said I'm putting in your hands now in that and then like I feel guilty I my my book is I got shaved this beard in your book but I'm saying goes I wouldn't say I would have definitely shave yours okay I Bobby wouldn't I wouldn't have let you out okay Tommy how do you feel about this no it's just interesting that he just had a feels like a change of the way he feels about it all together because about an hour ago what'd I say oh you don't you remember [Laughter] how fucked up are we thank you for saying we I mean I'm loaded I'm Tommy let's kill this drink let's just get a big set come on thank you the only one that's fucked up Tommy is not oh yeah you know about the extreme change that just happened right I don't know well I told you a while ago that you would let me keep my beard I said if you want and you go oh absolutely not Nick I'm definitely losing it but then now you brought it up as if to say I won't decide you decide no doubts about that what if we give you one of them crazy fu-manchu's type motherfuckers all the way down to the jowls will still get rid of the beard well let's give you some crazy let's give him some wyatt earp type shit what about like a hoarder rican beard like a male fan almost be worse than shaving it all oh it's far worse reviewing that on the way to shave you a prince you know this kid this kid Carter yeah we have read season RAM Carter Carter Carter Carter Carter no Carter bruising I should say 510 he's kid I was talking about hangovers with the other day okay so he bet me some stupid fucking bet and it was like if he if I if he won who I had to give him 200 bucks but if I want I got to cut his hair and so he was like oh I'll take it done cuz he thought he was gonna was my think was about the RAM Seattle game and I won and so I got to cut his hair and I was like I'm fucking your hair up and this is part of man shit he's 10 years old so I immediately I cut it to like fucking Dumb and Dumber bangs right everyone starts laughing and his dad starts going you look like simple jack man but then in a weird way he changes like he goes he starts getting embarrassed and then the mom start coming in this is all boys out right now and then the mom said hey don't worry it looks good it looks good and they go that's not the fucking bet the bet isn't that looks good the bet is it looks horrible that's why I didn't cut his hair I'm not gonna cut his hair to give him a free haircut but then the part of the human part of me goes I'm not gonna fuck up a kid I don't want to fucking burn him at 10 I wouldn't do the Puerto Rican comedy beard when I do comedy I wear this here beard shit's funny oh the Prince is beautiful that's what people just listening have no idea what we're laughing at man this is fucking if Google what is that give me the black and white one Jaime that profile one it's from the cover of what out it's super sculpted and it's got like this like almost like a racetrack curve to it it's really weird it's the weirdest I'd rather you can we do like the Puerto Rican guy dude just a live Porto Rican guy beard it's a tiger he has a tiger print yeah this dude has his hair bleach blonde dyed black in the shape of leopard skin that was the closest I came to blacking out that like might have been hardest that's pretty close but I want to give you that matter might have been the hardest physically of ever lately yeah MTV tattoo on his neck that is bonus who is that he was in the Backstreet Boys that guy that guy riffraff was really good on hot wings did you see that Jamie he was a hot wings show where they eat wings Joey Diaz is coming up on it thank you you want to do it yeah do it yeah okay I'll talk to Sean Sean Evans the guy that does it so you just go on get fucked up by hot wings interview yeah they ask you questions progressively more interesting questions like one of the questions asked me the hottest wing was have you ever talked shit about comics and I was so fucking out of it I was like yeah I talk shit about TJ Miller and Pete Holmes you're sweating they're like really I was like yeah next question cuz you your body goes into like it's a really great show Joey Diaz is coming up so how much worse is dehydrating than eating the hot open hot wings are for me are a little bit euphoric I get it I get into a place right I my brain shuts down and you start becoming primal about it and I fucking love it you started posting do what do you mean really you're the reason I put jalapenos with every meal no jalapenos is one thing though but I consider jalapenos to be fairly mild dude honestly like there's there's some stuff that I needs to be placed in Burbank not in Burbank Encino called chili my soul you ever go there no no baby I did Ari and I've talked about it we it's one of those things we over always made plans to go there but we didn't go and then by the time we wanted to go the guy had died and it was a specialty chili shop where they only saw chili and they sold extreme temperature to chili like insanity chili where you would have like a very mild chili which was really enjoyable a little spicy and there was a whole taste grid from like 1 to 10 and I had tried like a seven and it was insane how hot it was really and they they would give you these little scoops like like a you know like if you would get like a personal sized little paper cup and you pump the fucking ketchup in it at the burger shop you know those little paper cup things they gave you one of those with the chili and a tiny baby spoon and you put it in your mouth and the fucking temperature for like a nine yeah would make you immediately start hiccuping snots flying out of your nose I mean flying but imagine right imagine people talking to you during that and you having to answer questions oh that's why this shows brilliant it's because that you that you are the most vulnerable you're like I don't know fuck man whatever uh yeah so good why don't you do it fuck that come on no great on Joe you don't we sure you don't wanna go to Paris with us definitely don't want to go to Paris with you definitely no what if we change the location of Paris wait where you want to go that's some sound righto and we'll get a cabin for a weekend go hunting Oh something weird no no gone II I've always wanted to kill something for real yeah dude I've talked about that I want to know the crime wouldn't the Time Traveler's Wife but yeah what yeah really I think I would like when you talk I heard the podcast we talked about this kill know that probably more like that one that was the first one no no it's the one that didn't have the scruff off his hair oh that one died like that yeah and but no but no it's not that but if that he didn't have the scruff of his hair yet I'm really upset well scruff off his hair they grow new antlers every year I know but regardless I heard that as a newbie and I heard you guys talked about I thought it was like a baby yeah and my baby I got really emotional it's like I was like oh no that's a big-ass deer yeah I didn't know they groom new every year I actually bought that the most giant of giant deer they their antlers fall off every year even if it's like a nine year old deer what's like an impossibly old deer every year their antlers fall off and those antlers are actually bone which is really crazy I do too I didn't know until like really recently recited all these facts on random people they they grow new bone every year and then it falls off and they grow that stuff in their head just so that they can fight to the death over pussie yeah that's real yeah that's really why they grow it they they kill each other all the time we stumbled across an elk that had been killed my friend cam stumbled across one this year and another friend of mine stumbled across one last year in California they've been killed by another one they just stab each other in the body and like puncture each other's lungs and shimmy they go to war like I'm a fuck now that's what they know that's exactly what happened that's why they grow those things that's why the biggest ones always dominate because they can stab you from a further distance like it's a benefit of having these gigantic alright some are enormous so what's the benefit of like when people grow I got a 10-point deer does that mean is that late in the season no no no it means it's an old mature smart dominant male that's probably been dominating the area if you get a big deer with a lot of antler those are the ones that are the bigger deers and those are the ones that are the most dominant in terms of like spreading their genes yeah let's go hunting Tom let's go ahead a lot of times the the the idea behind the conservation the angle is that if you hunt an animal like that you're hunting an animal that's already long spread it's genetics so it's there's no danger of losing its genetics yeah its genetics have been spread and it's actually better for the biodiversity of the environment if you let the younger buck start breeding now as well that's super hotly debated though because some conservationists feel like you're better off leaving them in there as long as they survive it's it's really it's a very controversial subtend to think that the idea is that if you can get them out of the food chain the younger bucks will have a chance to rise up become dominant I don't want to do it I don't want to go what is it tents so much I don't want to do something you'd enjoy I want to do something that furthest in Cameron Haines's ultramarathon that's what you want to try me you and Ari oh my god he's got knee surgery he's not gonna do that he's not stupid okay what's our next contest we have to another cannot work out but always intense on this contest because we step watching what a marathon being out is what makes it the funniest yeah if it was real spinning out I would agree with you obviously for comedic effect I don't worry very well yeah yeah and honestly in terms of like the fairness of the competition I benefited from this thing more than anybody I didn't have to lose anyway I had two awesome podcast with you guys by all rights I should pay for it this has been a fun so let's figure out what to do what do you guys want to each they want to go to Paris I could do whatever I could do something else whatever you want to do let's figure out what you want to do so yeah what you want to do and let's do it okay know that we need to get on this right now and put it in stone right now why not a lot of girls say they want to go home with me and I'm gonna go stand by the door they're not there anymore okay I gotta do this me me Joann or he's not gonna make you take him on a trip who re I mean we're I mean I'm saying anybody like you know I'm saying like what why do you why do you think do you have to modify so I wanna I want to continue this bet continue like talk to another point take it to a next level oh I see oh so this is there gonna be no not even a day off bro right back what are you afraid because you know what man it gives you it gives you focus you're right it does it does gives you focus in it I enjoy it gives you something to look forward to like take the girls to London like I was really bummed out about Christmas and then Christmas Eve I went I'll buy us all trip great like we're too comfortable with a lack of competition aren't we yeah yeah you guys get sharpened by this experience didn't I think so I'm a better bird that the name of my tours I never named the fucking tour no talk to old no teeth no fucking access by the way by the way the yang goes last night I did a Joey was a knows you owe for the podcast yeah I was hoping he would kind of put some weight on you Joey I saw him I saw him I saw him on his boggers and he was so high that you know he don't tell me when you know when Joey high when he starts doing stuff like this he's not making it seem with you and I feel was it was a great podcast Joey's podcast was great laughs fine yeah but I watched it live and I was like he's not coming over so I was like Leon let's do a buck you did so I did a podcast to lean left fight and halfway through she goes I petted it out she goes oh is this is this good and I was like I don't know podcast with guys and girls like a comedian and his wife is aren't never funny and then she was what about Tommy Boy I go it's fuckin different and then she goes oh it's fucking different huh like wow but she's pushed comic yeah it's different powerful bird prices throwing his wife under the bus hey y'all what it sounds like a totally enter the bus one two three three waters oh my god two of those no three bottles of water two of those gigantic stew Oh coconut cans I've had half this I've had man I'd say what it really would kind of made me appreciate water I know I really appreciate water like I'm eating laughs like I was like you know you used to say that water champ shit and I was like I've never got it really I was like I was like oh yeah water gym like I was like I didn't father's a good competition for us no but now I just let's do the vodka champ and that's not fair yeah giant Lego yeah for what I love you [Laughter] [Laughter] this could be a car show that's a contest between you two every month could be the greatest show the world has ever known I would be a puppy do you should someone has to develop it for online that's it should be yeah it should be online because newest yeah forget all this nonsense trying to explain to people that give you money and put cameras on it you don't have to do that anymore and not nothing you've ever had bad relationships any of those people but you won't be able to smoke pot you won't be able to be honest you won't be able to talk you won't be able to swear you online you could just be you that's what podcasts are so fucking good but it is why podcasts are so good and that's why people really know who you are you know I mean people know you from the Travel Channel and they love you from stand-up but till you see you do you you you know the shots the thing was join in having fun like new you to kind of dial back a little bit the best part the best part of this is that like and this was the defining me where I'm at today was like all my friends you I'll just say obviously specifically you bill burr and Tommy we're all like Travis it was great but like you're better at stand-up and you're better at podcasting you're better at like being you and it was like one of those things where you go oh yeah maybe I am a better like maybe it that's the cool thing about the Internet is that I don't want to be like hi guys welcome I am Bert Kreischer like I don't mind doing that for money but like well I'll tell you from someone who did it in four five years and so I did it alongside while you were doing it too and I know it's a really great job and your jobs better than mine in terms of like the fun of it like the places you got to go rather than fear factor which is you know most of it was local occasionally we travel it's gotta be fun it was fun crazy show no no doubt about it was definitely a fun gig but the difference between that and stand-up is giant and if you don't if you don't give stand-up the fuckin respect it deserves it becomes dogshit it just does this is it's it's just too hard to not it's too hard to not happen yeah yeah you got all the time all the time you got to do it all the time if you're doing a gang or other shit on top of it works where you can't do stand-up for months at a time like you were doing your go right wrong 18 weeks straight on the road yeah that's where we have a name the tour technically because I don't I've never named a tour but it about that I have never named a tour I'm never named tour Bert Kreischer I have never named a tour perfect that's a great you do one every year I've never named a tour to name two or three I really like em how the first one I ever saw that someone named one was Jen Kirkman yes she named a tour and I was like I'll fucking bad-ass I saw that no it's like the first one you ever saw one stay offline did you have a head injury [Laughter] was the punishment or Carlos Mencia punished or was the first one I heard that everyone liked was talking about their like to the monitor well Griffin named his tours back in the fucking 92 what's up with Eddie Griffin I don't know I think he's doing that tour with who is it Griffith Cedric and who else does fit a few sets that I've seen where you know there's people that catch genius in a bottle man they just catch genius and it might be only for a short amount of time in their life it might be for a moment oh it Charlie Murphy's on it too deal Huey Cedric entertainer so JB Smoove no man this Charlie Charlie Murphy's pitch so the comedy get down but they catch they catch lightning in a bottle now they nail it and for Eddie Griffin there was a what was that HBO suppose a def Comedy Jam yes it was a def Comedy Jam special yeah that Eddie Griffin did and I'm pretty sure he was wearing shorts you're right he was you're talking about he came out he was so explosive with the way he just every punchline he was semi shirtless to picture Jamie he was sold it was like the way he was moving there was so much energy this is not it no no it's another one who is our special yeah is that what it was so that might have been I think you're right I think you're right it was an HBO I think he did this and then he did that yeah well anyway when he did that special whatever that special was and I watched parts of it I don't even know if I had I think I'd started doing stand-up I was just like I'd open my current I'm just kind of just getting going and I remember thinking holy shit like that guy just tapped into that weird rare spot well you could never imagine yourself doing it I don't I don't know if that's it either man is that what it says it is yeah it might be it the colors look off but maybe it's just my memory he did voodoo child too that was before this no no I'm pretty sure that was a later one he's someone I wish I'd seen live he's an account Williams Eddie so crazy he's a real nice guy though not saying like the daddy I'm just saying like I wish had I've been to the store when they were at the store Eddie Griffin I've always got along with that guy he's a super nice guy about Kat I don't know him I don't know I'm a big fan though kind of a fan of what he does can you do curiosity do you not reach out to them to be on your podcast no if I run into him I would love to would love to see Kat Williams and Eddie Griffin on your podcast but you know what man I would too if they were around like it's it's a matter of like if I don't want to bug anybody you know especially nobody that I like Kat I don't even know and Eddie I've known forever like if he's around he ever wants to do it if I see him at the store or something what about what about Chapelle I was like do it Dave and we've talked about it but we just never did it it's one of those another guy like you don't want to you know we talk yeah but he's a he's a super unusual guy man he's just doing his own thing and if he wanted to do it he would ask me and then he'd come and do it and we never age oh let's do it yeah fuck it come on he's the only person he's he's the per the only person in the world did I consider it the great white shark meaning when he walks in a room as a comic there's a weird energy we're like I should've saved Chappelle like yeah that's for me at me and Tom probably same age but like he walked into the room when I was getting paid in Dayton one night just walked into the room um you know you you check it's like closed and he walks in the room and I just out of micros we put the I was like oh my god and I do not get uncomfortable around famous people but I was fucking shaking and I was like doing like shit you're embarrassed about we were posting up a little bit outside the realm of him going like where's everyone going tonight but he's one of those guys talk I never spoke to him yeah and he lives around there right dates so that's that his workout club where he goes to fuck around not anymore but they said he used to stop and all just stop it all the time anymore I don't think so oh yeah didn't know all these like Cincinnati area places to you know what he does man he'll just fly into a city with no plan yeah like in like when I was in Denver I go why are you here man because I just decided to fly in he's like they were going to the Canelo Alvarez fight hmm who's Canelo Alvarez fighting the life skill what Mexican dude who'd he fight recently out of the fight was it was some fight in Vegas hey Dave I'll be at the Wilbur theater January 21st flying I'll fuckin party with usual and beyond and I'd love to party with Chappelle my point was he just showed up out of nowhere he just flew into Denver I saw that picture that got like fucking something like two hundred and forty nine thousand likes what was this the the the video was hilarious that's right what's that Aamir Khan fight is that what it is hmm could be does he roll solo my name's Smith who knows what fight was then maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe mr. Manny Pacquiao fight Pacquiao fight recently yeah he did right he's gone to see him fight a few times was it wasn't that long ago when I was in Denver he goes to watch fights yeah just flies in watches some boxing matches he loves boxing Dave Chappelle loves boxing really yeah got a buddy business like a boxer and does like boxing training and shit Jesse Vargas and November 5th weekend I think that was it oh maybe that was it yeah that's probably yet but uh he just again he's like a version of Ari does whatever the fuck he wants definitely flies into places yeah comes and hangs out that's rad I know he's done the that club that's like his favorite place in Denver yeah and they said he's just been by landed been like hey is anyone booked tonight I do show and then we'll just add nights if he feels like saying that's so crazy it's so awesome no yeah what's the most important I'll say it from the other side of you too and Chappelle is that I can't imagine what it's like for him to go there like in and be like how our ticket sales like you know I mean like there's no such thing yeah like I'm saying that at a club you think he says it no never never really I mean not in ten plus years up for sure when was last time you were like our ticket sales fella club for anything I had no I have counts sent to me when things are sold out or not sold out so I can decide whether or not I should tweet it again or put it up on Instagram or something yeah I just look at like I wonder what it's like to be Chappelle and just go I'll do this in four minutes everyone that said he would want to come to see me Daniel Tosh put up a tweet and in a tweet he sold out like a whole tour in the day yeah within like less than an hour the whole tour was sold out unreal man you told you did a show with him right yeah it was so fun I've worked with him it's a fucking best he's a dude slaughter in it yeah he's crushing and doesn't give a fuck does one do anything stupid like I don't care yeah fuck a hundred percent I'm like now with them soak it in he Daniel Tosh a smart dude he's untethered also like how so he's I mean it's very easy to go I'm not doing any press when you have the number one show on Comedy Central for one right it's very easy I tended me yeah not controlled yeah like I bet you if it was like whatever top three or something you know like not the leading thing you'd still see of him being very much oh he's still yeah I remember we did a show together in Miami and there's a heckler in the front row like I was featuring form and I came off this is the two weeks after Georgia was born there almost 1213 years ago and I said I think he goes that's one way to do it like hell I go what would you have done and he goes I would have kicked him out you'll see he was go watch and I ran around to the back of the club in Miami the old Miami improv and Daniel Tosh literally folded his fucking arms and goes I will not start the show until he's LA he's kicked out he didn't no one knew him no one knew any of his jokes yeah fold his arms goes I will not start the show until he gets kicked out and I was like in my head I was like I was like can't you can't believe you're gonna fucking throw this show for one dude in my head and by the way you know you knew me at the time yeah and everyone starts billing and he's like no he goes no kick him out kick him out right now arms folded kick him out right now was the people booing at Daniel Tosh at the whole idea because I'd worked through it like I'd worked through it and that's why and shows the original heckle like what happened guy was a dick he was a redneck with a mullet branding with a mullet was Patrick Swayze in my head the guy was shirtless I'm sure he wasn't but I remember him the guy was like okay here's how it goes no so uh so I'm in the back and I'm watching this and then toss gets into it with the guy and the guy starts go fuck you and Tasha goes no fuck you your nights over good night have a good night you know in a very toss way I'm gonna do it right but have a good night have a good night and then the guy goes I hope you die and then Tosh as the guys getting walked out the door goes I hope you get AIDS this is 90 90 90 2004 and everyone groans and then tossed looks at the audience in a moment goes the good kind of a it's like magic Johnson a it's where he stopped opening movie theaters the place goes fucking nuts and his first joke and this is old joke for Tosh so I'll say it his first joke is now it's in by Burberry urban club he was Kobe Bryant's so good at basketball he should be allowed to rape women and the place goes fucking but he goes if I was his attorney I would simply put on a highlight reel and go ladies and gentlemen the jury it's one white chick a year I was like this is my new favorite comic yeah I walked into the agreement and waited for him to come out and I was like dude you're fucking amazing so funny dude man he's a good guy too he's a very good guy like he'd talked to him he's right there he really is there's no weird fake shit going on now Jason either saw him a few weeks ago in Melrose and he said how's the weight thing going did I go tweet-tweet parties fat please sweeper and he goes hey just Hollywood and he at the store of him and Judd Apatow bumped me and I was like it was my fight about first sighted store ever

I'm gonna take okay Bert Kreischer please explain to the people what's about to happen and why my beers getting shaved because I challenged Tommy buns on a beer challenge on who lost most weight and he lost a collective like six pounds more than me I failed go ahead but he did succeed in losing a ton of weight I lost I lost 35 pounds I think so i lo I'm happy that at least I'm not as fat as I am just start what if you look better before we do this it's I will not let it feel better what if you decide like I like the new Bert maybe the new Bert turned out it may be the new Bert doesn't doesn't sabotage things new birth I'm already uncomfortable with this here we go so Tommy bunts insisted in shaving a beautiful pattern in the work so hard with area you worked hard what did you do I just grew it out and I've sculpted it all sculpted area signals vulnerability how's it sculpted what I do is I I went to a black barbershop and I taught them how to teach my cut my beard he taught them I asked him a 7 just where's the microphone on these things I might have had my fucking finger over the microphone on your cellphone is ok i hope i don't know i don't i don't i'll open the podcast and he seems like going really hot no it looks good so you're sculpting it you're not entirely shaving it off Tommy well talking to the microphone please Tommy why he decided to high that's one of the I have a jaw line Tommy why have you decided to sculpt it and not completely shave it I said this is a guy where like I see so much potential and I just want it I want it to maximize like oh you're falling is exploding with text messages while I'm holding this up I could barely look at it on the screen keeps fill it up with time not he's giving you a Hitler son [Laughter] with us we're all adults what the fuck is wrong with us oh my god so you're doing the prince oh my god is this the first time you shave another man's hair my mom see me what about koneko what are we doing you can't drink right now son you in labor you're giving birth to the new birth Tommy you're an artist you know you should do Tommy what's that he should once a year offering to sculpt a fans beard you're a goddamn artist dude there's a good job it looks amazing really this should be the new thing that people do go back to like sculpting beards that could be a show thank you that's all the fluid I have on my body this could be a show you do on the Travel Channel where y'all get fucked up and you get someone and you shave their beard that's honor ability this may be the greatest greatest time I've ever had on a car we go we're pretty alright so for people just listening what tom has done is sculpt Burt's beard and what could best be described as a fencer from the 1600s in France a fencer yeah he looked like he did that or for someone who would lie about being Puerto Rican because they're really from like somewhere that no one's ever heard of when they're tired of people saying where the fuck is that they go it's yeah I'm just Puerto Rican look it looks very Spanish like but New York City fly you might stick with it he's a goddamn artist imagine if it turns out that Tommy buns is the premier beard artist in North America I mean our people are watching this and watch the way really how many people are watching that 24 thousands that's so ridiculous are you gonna keep this or are you gonna turn to me please huh that's actually not bad and I'm not really sure I'm not bullshitting I don't want to be surprised let me see it's not but I'm not bullshitting you look good you know what in here here's the thing man good look at all the hair on me you get an earring on each year a big hoop like a pile like you for sure don't wait to fucking shine hula hoop earrings take your phone buddy oh my god it looks pretty good yeah oh holy shit look can you see yourself performing like that fuck yeah yeah of course you have to for a while right no tonight no no no you should definitely go onstage for the audience the people that are gonna appreciate they want to see you knowing exactly what happened he's gonna fix it it's not done you know that's what's weird we never really determined when he's done so Tom can like step back look at it and decide to do sneezes oh my god he found the rash yeah man sometimes we have rashes ladies and gentlemen it's not your fault I know you feel like you did something naughty that the Lord punished you with a rash but that's just superstitious rashes in fact oh really bacterial infections on the surface of your skin so we're definitely recommend defense soap I'm say I say just a mustache fuck all that squirrelly little bottom here if you want to make him keep it for a while you know keep it for a while I'm a grown man I'll go me shave no no mustache how about this what we get rid of this crazy shit now I know what it looks like give you a goddamn policeman you actually look like I look like a monkey for real let me see you you look like you knocked boulder from Wisconsin your dude is unlike World Series of bowling and everybody fears you like the Bill Murray character grown egos not you yeah remember when we had to have sex with his landlord in order to pay for the rent loosen up a shit remember that he he has the planned like robbery with the guy and then my face in it then he he throws hot coffee in that his face because he has to act like that it wasn't a scam you know like the landlord comes in he's like what you're here and you just take the hot coffee and splashes and I got quick screams for his life Jesus Christ this feels so weird I imagine it feels weird signing on my face will be this close to my bones well dude you guys have you just don't do it like this like this craziness but just keep going healthy style you know I mean we got to figure out a way to get you guys to not you know let's be honest if you know there's no way to do it all right if you if you if you if there is a target weight you're gonna dehydrate yourself right yeah of course you're gonna you never know what very seldom does someone go I'll get down you pose to suggest you keep the mustache I think it's a wonderful accoutrement to your face okay it helps your party man image and again you curling champion Saskatchewan duck hunting guides people how to fly-fish [Laughter] [Laughter] really good yeah you should see it closer do you think there's something to be said for bringing back a mustache there's a few people who do it it's a strong look no it looks good it looks like this up there get my teeth cleaned Jesus this just looks sad yes it looks like a guy who lost a fuck ton of weight just now I'm right to win a competition if you rock this look and you go back up to 256 that would be that would be an aggressive yeah so let me ask you guys this cuz we're probably nearing the end of this experience yeah how you guys gonna go forth like this most of this was healthy for you Tom I think the majority of it was healthy except for the last couple days yeah the actual trying to make the weight and burped at the very least like you curb some of your insanity you know he curbed it to the point where you lost a tremendous amount of weight yeah I mean you got to feel lighter and better right so how do you how do you move forward now do you go back to life as usual or do you start another contest we can start another contest I'm totally comfortable with that it sounds like Bert won't start another contest well start another contest I want nori to be involved too so I like orange ball Tim dun dun dun so we got to get him in like we should do this online but the challenge doesn't have to be wait this I could be so no no oh yeah what could it be um it could be anything man that's the crazy thing about the Internet we could do whatever the fuck we want right whatever we come up with we could just do yeah no sure right you guys can compete and stuff that doesn't even suck right there's not have to be something that sucks like trying to drain your body and personally go around the world for the fastest hmm that sounds like a Bert thing though I'm just trying to think I'm just trying to ballpark you guys but like a bunch of but the idea is like a competition show which means to you guys would be amazing yeah cuz it would be in the best spirits to like here's the thing about competition like this right there was there was never any animosity so after it's over we're all laughing yeah whereas like if you have a fight for instance and two people don't like each other in particular yeah there's always animosity before and after people are pissed oh it's always chaos we should get our wives involved dude yeah I don't know you're trying to give this personal son no our wives that's because that's what the untappd know I think I like this it's not adverse to doing another competition at all and I think it should be something crazy well here we are in January right okay this is the beginning first couple of days January 2017 why don't we knock it around for a few months and we'll figure out how to finance some other competition looks like yeah and so instead of well let's just figure out like what would be a fun thing to do and a difficult thing to do right two things that's a key fact yeah yeah yeah like we'll be a fun thing to do but also a difficult thing to do well you guys could do it as a competition it would be a big deal for you what's the point where winning it would be valuable you'd wanna like really work hard towards it be worth your dedication we can even bring like sponsors involved I guarantee you it'd be like it'd take like five minutes to figure out what sponsors would be interested in whatever kind of competition we figured out we can do something really fun we could do something really fun yeah like what would you guys want to do like what seems like a fun competition like what do you want to do there no no I just want to go there no really yeah I think racing grace' that's fun the first person to get across the United States get the first would you do like a Cannonball Run type thing I wouldn't say that one of you do a lot of CrossFit and you do a lot of exercise one neither one of you has like any immense physical advantages like if you started in a physical competition right now like if you guys wanted to do some great you know those crazy marine things they do where they climb over fucking holes whoo let's go to SEAL training oh listen to me don't do that about some crazy like one of those obstacle courses we have to like swing from the monkey bars and climb on the pole all that jazz and climb up the net the Rope net race each other doing something like that and make a big deal out of that that would be fun you guys would have to get in sick shape fireman training Department training Iceman's on that but the problem is like do you really think you could even complete that I could get halfway through it I moved my body pretty good and I watched that on TV and I go I think I'd probably fall off one of those I'll call Matt Matt Iseman right now he can get us on the course and you tell me but they'll get halfway through and fall down I can definitely this is our bet starts I can definitely get halfway through well what do you think you'll be able to do I've already done the training no no I'm saying him sorry oh definitely more than half but I think I think the the whole thing why we find a course that is like what you're saying wipeout wipeout they don't do anymore unfortunately that would be an easy one to set up because Mack units was one of the executive Bruce's a fear factor no oh really yeah that was his show yeah the people who created wipe out and made wipeout in America they were most of my friends mine but I get like a triathlon like something monk triathlon would be a motherfucker dude if you really wanted to do that that's a serious commitment he wants to drown you in the ocean he wants he wants the possibility that he'll be swimming away and he looks back and a shark takes you man yeah what's the what is the it's like a short race it's fuckin marathon you got to run a hundreth on you get a hundred miles on a bike and you got to swim a couple miles right no don't butter I know the guy Spartan Race what exactly are the parameters like wave anything what is this Jamie battle frog finish on ESPN sometimes it's like team's relay races but they can't do it oh you do battle frog I'll look at this you'd have to run up this thing it's like a Navy SEAL obstacle course basically what's really fascinating about you guys is that you both love each other and you're both interesting combination of impulse and discipline ridiculous fanatical like scramble sprint to catch up versus slow steady marathon pace and it's really funny man yeah and laughing hard the whole way the tip of the spear who made those graphics you don't make the tip of the spear and make it in neon green you fuck that's not scary tip of the spear tarah Travon at the enemy with his cartoon colors is that gonna be our thing then we're gonna find a course know what we should do is turn this TV show into like Ultimate Fighter competition thing yeah but we both have teams of losers like what yeah let's bounce around a bunch of ideas not commit to any of them let's try to figure out like what would be the best idea to have a fun competition between you guys that would benefit you because you guys both benefited in a huge way hard work you both look amazing like dude I showed your video to my wife of you joking around about the work was already done that your work was already done yeah and she was like holy shit they just went holy shit like they look you your skin looks healthy your face looks thinner I was like then you look vibrant you look like your body had more energy to it thanks man I definitely do I mean it's you know it's a lot of weight to then you always think about like man I was walking around with that every day too crazy and we talked about it yesterday and sometimes people think we're insensitive when we talk about this like the subject of fat shaming whether or not fat shaming is a good thing it's never a good thing to be mean to people but it might not be the worst thing in the world to feel uncomfortable about the current state you're in if you know that states unhealthy and attaching all these like magic words to it like fat shaming you deciding that certain actions can never take place so you're certain acknowledgments of someone's issue with their weight can never be discussed because it hurts people's feelings it doesn't necessarily always do that person to service like we'd all be better off if we were healthy it feels great to eat fucking Krispy Kreme Doughnuts you know what feels better see Krispy Kreme Doughnuts after you lost 40 pounds and you know that tomorrow you're gonna get back on the fucking treadmill yeah you know and you're gonna start eating healthy again give yourself reward days but don't let it control your goddamn life and don't wrap it up and wrap that criticism and protect yourself from that criticism and a blanket of these fucking stupid rules like like don't ever talk about someone being fat or don't ever discuss it or don't don't make them feel uncomfortable about you're supposed to be done feel uncomfortable it's something that you can change but if you don't is gonna kill you and if you do is gonna make you feel way better that's encouragement it's all it's the only way to encourage people about certain things that are uncomfortable is to make them uncomfortable it did snow way around it yeah it's no way someone's gonna find out they're overweight and not have it feel bad I think the uncomfortable feeling is probably like the biggest catalyst like that's what makes you do stuff I think so to me I know you know it's an uncomfortable thing it's like someone being brutally honest with you about something that you don't like about yourself and then you act on it yeah dude I I just think that we we definitely could use more nice people in the world we could definitely use each other being kinder in the world for sure but when you when you're dealing with certain situations like at the very least you have to be Stern with people over certain issues like if sometimes a drug problem someone has a weight problem yeah I'm not looking at you Bert you're fine you're doing great if you're a partier there's a difference between someone who's got a problem whose life goes to shit and a guy like you works constantly and also just lost 30 pounds as a matter of fact you might be like the perfect drawing line in the sand like here's a productive guy that's enthusiastic about is partying partying but he's also a great family man a great fucking podcaster a great fucking comedian you're having fun you're being very productive you're doing various TV shows and on top of that you're partying yeah I can this is the line you like when is it bad for you when is it destructive to you well when it's good for your life and you're having a good time as well like you've managed it correctly I think you're the highest functioning party guy yeah hair all over me that's what it is for sure I am the highest functioning party guy probably but also just lost 30 fucking pounds like an animal dude yeah you know there you went hard man you ran 24 fucking miles in a day or 22 miles in a day yeah that's hardcore yeah that's hardcore man that's not something someone who's like oh fuck you told me no one would feel depressed like both of you guys are savages you guys both dug your fucking heels into the ground and actually did it yeah what you did is super hard to do you've lost almost 50 fucking pounds dude yeah it's all aw Tommy it's insane I know you lost like a good solid kettlebell a good one of those big-ass I honestly want to see that picture of mostly stories again cuz that doesn't look like the same human being dude if you if your whole world is gonna be a different thing you're gonna be going through a life lighter you'll have a better ability to move through life like literally like you if I if someone told me hey man forget your cha your jaw it's crazy if someone told me hey man from here on out you're gonna be healthy everything's gonna be great you know you're not gonna have to worry about diseases but you're gonna have to wear a 50-pound vest everywhere you go I'd be like shit and then I started thinking about the pressure that's gonna put on my lower back and on my knees and on my ankles and that's exactly what you see from overweight people it's exactly the issue yeah if you got to live life with all that extra shit it requires too much resources but you guys did one of the hardest things that a person can do you stopped your pattern in its tracks and you fucking turn the battleship you used your will and your discipline you turn the battleship in a competition between friends and you both got healthier because of it maybe temporarily unhealthy in the last couple of days yes does the dehydration the weight loss since we've started like consuming I'll be 227 no no we didn't we already removed Ari from the equation anywhere you have a drink in your hand [Music] [Laughter] its water weight man yes it's bizarre when you want to see what you are water weight is mean each one of these things as we said is a pound how much that's insane now here's the thing how bad you feel have a seat for a second like do you feel bad like you know I feel great right you got to go on a footrace right now do you think you'd be okay dude I'm a monster right now really no I I'm the I'm being dead serious the best I've ever felt physically in my entire life but but even though you just lost all this weight dehydrate yourself they didn't I'm what I'm asking is like how much have you recovered from the way you felt when you came in to weigh in because you felt like shit I feel so much better since I we wait in honor but do you feel like you could go run not right now i voted with pizza and vodka okay but if you weren't like if you were like you feel like physically you feel by just hydrated that that i think i think a lot of times what you're talking about fat shaming is that people don't understand what it feels like to be on the other side of that big in more vodka couldn't find stores you can get online where'd you get it online its stevia flavored soda but it's got zero sugar and it's just in stevia is like a natural plant-based sweetener so it doesn't fuck with your blood sugar levels yeah tastes good I still don't have to pee that's water to is amazing you guys are awesome well you are the water champ though I'm gonna take a picture of that before we leave could it is quite preposterous cuz you've got a drink - yeah so Tommy - these big-ass hands just kill it like a grown-up no that's a sip like oh those 16-ounce cans how many Ounces are in those cans of c2o coconut water these are 17.5 Jesus Christ he killed two of those and then four 16-ounce waters yeah my number by the way if you're one of those people that's like ooh coconut water to slow toilet water No tastes like jizz and it's delicious hey hey cooking that you're allowed to steal that and put that in an ad if you want to get the right coconut water you got to get it from tight Thai coconuts The Bachelor nuts are very sweet yeah if you ever had the Tiki ones that are mocha that I've caffeine in them those are really good too like those yeah those are good too but those have a lot of sugar in them unfortunately I mean they're really yummy but they do have a lot of sugar in them you know what really is the best like there's a company that has it where it's fresh coconut water is that the one harmless harvest really yeah or coconut water and you drinking it's just like your whole body's can they make a coffee flavored one they have a coffee flavor this one yeah that's a different that's different one but yeah the coconut water is unbelievable people get mad start talking about coconut water or kale well you're the person that introduced me to coconut water really looks good and I'm actually already used to it I'm used to it's all bullshit man all right guys listen man when I was scared shaved my head I was before I shaved my head I was thinking about it for like a couple of days I was like should I do this should I shave my fucking head because it was just getting more and more janky looking up there mine was just giving out way I was I was you in five years and I was like so it's almost over I just got to give in and then when I finally fucking changed it I was like god damn it what was I why did I shave it a long time ago this is way better it's way easier you just look different right like and people are everyone's we're all afraid of looking different for some weird reason yeah but there yeah that's different it's better you know but I do look like I feel like I work at Deadwood but on the south side later this week great here's one that actually the big things about how this has turned out because you've lost so much weight the impact is not like if you have been full 250 something oh my god it would look weird but you lost 30-some pounds so it's actually you know keep it I think that mustache looks good I think the mustache at the very least should stay chin hair but kind of what I'm not really wanting to it I really want to use a razor I'm he's raised on like 12 years yeah they've been going go get a real shave ooh yeah go to a barber and you know sit in the chair already said black barber I went to a black barber but he's just trim my beard well go there again you'll trim your beard get a free okay yeah do you guys feel better after this is all over or do you feel physically drained today I'm really tired man Ryan I'm but we also stood dehydration right like that was right I like that what the drugs and alcohol yeah that's your favorite part but I mean like up until then you rehydrated a little bit before you start boozing right didn't you a lot but I feel fantastic right now I feel really good because I feel like I've earned a lot of stuff like they add two pieces of pizza this is where my brain is working right now but I already know that I've burned all my Fitbit like I said no it's not I've burned 32 hundred calories already damn dude this more now that's amazing so um I'm I I'm excited for like to make I get these these styrofoam cups he started to and I'm just having to make a big ice water and said why don't you guys have a jiu-jitsu match why don't you guys train for three months and have a jiu-jitsu match yeah oh yeah that's what I'm talking about but we need coaches though oh we can get you those okay that's good wait but but I like 150 grand on the line we might be able to get that we might be able to get that okay is there a second place second place yeah was the loser get nothing does the winner the winner get something - loser gets dog shit they get nothing zero I don't know usually how it works it seems exploitative oh really yeah I think the winner should get more the loser should get less but the losers the loser should be compensated just for competing yeah I got you what if the loser gets loser gets to go on the trip in this yeah well this case like it's not like you guys are betting $150,000 this is that re is the the he's the one of my friend and I must protect him from his tendencies so I will assume the fiduciary aspects of this negotiation from here on out thank you it's the what was John what was John Travolta in the in that movie he gets shorty he was the big parties the big John Travolta was in shorting he was uh he was a bookie movie at all why I remember the movie came out he's like I want to be a Hollywood producer and he wrote a script goddamn why am I having such a hard time remembering that movie where he already has the script he's like he's like I'm the producer of this there's a few of those movies that you fuckin loved when they came out like a Bronx Tale yeah Fantana and then you watch it on TV like why is this completely gone from my memory dude this is so fuckin funny in this movie I gotta see that movie he's so here's that 90 what was it remember the Gene Hackman scene with the other guy that died who cop the former cop plays that he plays that Miami gangster in this movie and he flies out to get his money from him from Gene Hackman look at how good yeah man I don't remember this fucking movie at all it is a high possibility that I never saw no I saw this movie I remember that violence is equal to various that's the guy Denis for isn't it yeah he's so fucking funny in that oh he's funny and everything yeah he died recently Delroy Lindo is my favorite black yeah oh Jesus Christ I should watch that again yes yeah we should do a fight companion when we watch it yeah let's watch get shorty in tomato too many drinks get baked and watch get Shorty and talk shit I will tell people to sync it up let's do one hey let's fucking do that for real I haven't seen this movie and forever let's do it I barely remember anything in this movie like I might have seen this movie when it came out and completely forgot about it since then I've never seen it since so it'll be a total surprise if Jamie kills these previews Calot caliper yes let's do one with Ryan Reynolds for Walter do you want to do that yeah is that gonna be weird because you haven't seen it have you seen it no I've never seen it you never saw the movie that was based on a story about your life in college that seems crazy to me if we're gonna be honest about it yeah you know I never could I never had the validation that I had now in my life where his company says that that's what it was based on right so I'd say his head on radio and so I didn't want to ever watch it so I felt like I was lying did they pay you no never no that could be fun awkward moment no but I think Ryan rails is into it I mean it's company says he's into it don't keep me into it into watching it live with us we all get baked and have a few drinks I don't know why I'm sure I don't know me there no money to invite him you don't even know I was like definitely who like took your story and brought it over there and profited from it some writer and there's it was never an issue because it wasn't really you is based on you or stories about you that they added a bunch of the option was made by a company by an agency a literary agency and they took it and they sold it with me and the writer of the article attached so the movie had to be about a journalist writing an article about a party animal right that was the caveat so then I got I discovered by Will Smith and that deal fell apart and the olive stone deal fell apart and then one of the producers or one of the writers who had submitted scripts or sent a script in and it was moving forward and they thought that was gonna be the one when it fell apart he just took it and told it to Van Wilder or to National Lampoon and they made a van Walter Wow yeah so I didn't really have any attachment to any of it I never got paid for any of it and I didn't make any of it but at the same time like my best friend in college his name's in the movie and so like like it's so weird yeah but I don't know bitterness towards it I don't care I don't give a fuck oh that's good it's little sidebar tears to your life me don't stop putting on shit I gotta get going man know why we're we got a podcast today yeah what you did one yesterday I'm not doing one what do you have to go where you going I'm just ready to go what what time are we at right now it's we're about three hours in how many minutes 10:17 another 12 minutes at least I will wrap it up to the top of the hour yeah top of the hour okay well how do you get like that well that's just how I am Wow he's like you guys are funny this is like impulsive versus disciplined this is slow steady marathon versus sprint a lot you're dreaming yeah listen it's not

rare group of people that I seek out to watch yeah to stand up yeah and I think there's also like it's a really good thing like just like you guys were talking about the competition of the weight loss and the fun inspiring you there's at least some sort of unconscious competition when you're surrounded by people that are really funny yeah and like we're store yeah man right where we're at right now today in LA in 2017 is a really rare time where it's like we're surrounded by killers you know and guys people even know it goin Smith you ever see Owen Smith The Comedy Store it's been a while

the time I beat here the nights I don't want to do it either right yeah Carlos Valencia you know him yeah super funny super funny yeah like the the 2017 roster like the people that are coming up right now that people are just starting to get to know them yeah they're the most educated and all of like the young group of comics that are coming up there's all of them you know all these young men and women that are getting a stand-up now they've they've experienced the whole internet boom during their adolescence you know like theythey grew up with it but their comedy fans comedy fans and the Internet boom has allowed them to have access to everything I was when we were kids we'd have to go find a Bill Cosby album you know we used to have to find Kinison cassette or a dice cassette we had to go find a Richard Pryor CD you know yeah it was hard easy to go seek it out like now it's instant at the moment you get it in your head that I would like to see some comedy almost everyone has some kind of a computer today dude you know I just remember when you said that when I used to open for Burt and like really early on see how hard he would kill like he kills so much harder than most people can understand and I would try to mimic some version of what he was doing you know I mean because like his energy energy the way he so I would go up there and I do my act like I had a friend who was like hey man you look real crazy up there right now maybe my favorite time in in my friendship with Tommy is when when you bombed in Sacramento I've never enjoyed what like you know I like the real bad bomb - it was like what started it no joke tasteful well it was I wasn't like endorsing it I was making it it was of course it was it was you know member Hurricane Katrina right right and there was stories that that I think that amidst all the chaos people were getting raped right and I opened with something like something like you know there's nothing like a floating corpse to get me in the mood then I would elaborate on the story and have jokes it it would started there and it was the early show Friday and I mean that Nelly did that I get it laughs I don't telling you it's a full house I got no laughs for the next twenty two and a half minutes and I know it was twenty two and a half minutes because I supposed to do 25 by the way Tom and his hair his hair was long at the time it was like a comb-over and what would happen is slowly as he worked it was flattened onto his hat on his head on his face yeah and just be wet and I was sweating a lot man and then when I got offstage the lady goes I thought you were supposed to be funny and I was like oh you know because you're just like so yeah the Booker yeah and if you've landed it and did you do any other sets there that week oh wait there's a ten o'clock show ten o'clock show I open the same way and I bomb just as hard back-to-back 25-minute sets and and then I remember the host goes I've never seen a feature bomb like that like he was he was and he was the emcee and then I really was like hey you know like having to lie to myself at the hotel I was I don't know the fuck I'm doing but I was like no it's definitely you know you're doing unlike it was it was a shaky thing and then the next day Bert goes uh hey guys I just one thing and I go yeah what he goes just open on a different joke just open different joke do exactly everything else just open a different joke and I go okay I go out there I do what he said I have to that point probably the best that I've ever had and then I go to the manager who's behind a curtain in the kitchen and I go well she goes well what did you do you're set and I go you definitely just heard what happened there was like there's 300 people out there and she was like did it go well or was just like last night and then I went back and the same thing I did the same thing the second show just open differently and I was like oh thanks Bert his best advice I ever got Wow so through that it's hard if people don't know who you are if you jump out there and alienate them with a fucked up joke yeah and then they tell me later they're like well you know that first group there was like 90 Mormons that just watch what the fuck is that that's what they used to do these to sell selling up the place to a church and then you didn't know you were performed for over Mormons would be fine if they could drink hmm I like Mormons but I mean at a comedy show like crazy I know they do yeah I know that part of with the button you talk yeah they're loud too yeah pills aren't in their doctrine no pills they can do pillow you can do you do Monster energy drinks too but they can't drink coffee creaking load up on those fucking gigantic yeah no those fucking huge cans of Red Bull that you look at them you go no never never they're awesome if you want to stay away what do you like on coke no but like because I know you partied really much harder than I've ever partied but you'd so even keel even when you get high I go to you're not even wait a fucking minute you really think that Tommy has partied much harder than you've ever party I know that I know he knows that do you think that's true he's making reference to one occasion I've never overdosed yeah that's true I took wait I drank too much GHB and then I I took some ecstasy and then I had like 12 13 screwdrivers oh my god shit freshmen in college Oh still I had my shit in control that's amazing I come to the hospital yeah strapped down tubes down my throat Wow you've told this over for though it's a Tom Segura overdose that story yeah it's um tell me what happened they said what did you take what did you write down they gave me so I'm strapped down they what they do when you go D and they catch it at that stage cuz I passed out is this starts to swell so they thought about giving me a tracheotomy and they put tubes down there they strapped down so that you don't pull the tubes out when you come to when I did like your your hands are really restricted right and then they they're trying to get figure out what's going on that see if you can help them know what's in your system mm-hmm so they gave me I'm left-handed for riding and they gave him the pen in my right hand and strapped so they write like or they asked me what did you take I wrote heroin and they were all like are you serious oh and then I had to like write out what and then they found you know they give you that why didn't you write out I'm left-handed the toxicology report well you know they go you have everything in your system oh my gosh it was like you have you have you know our bitch which you have uppers you have Downers you have you have opiates yeah right because the GHB was spiked with stuff oh my hell I took with spica style yeah that's the thing because and you have so much in you like it would have killed a lot of people like that's amazing that you're alive when I go why am i alive and he goes honestly because you're pretty big boy basically goes like you're fat and that's what saved your life Joey you're 250 pounds at the time Wow yeah did that change the way you partied oh my god dude yeah of course really yeah killed now like even still like we wanted to know you have two glasses of wine I just am NOT it's not from that I just I'm not just I'm just not a big Burt you love jumping up and down no you love the Sprint I do you do you love the we're doing it what if I could do it no best is pretty love sure comes off when there's so many times where I've been at his place and he's like just taking it easy but if I go like all you have to do it's like you just you plant the seed and you go hey you wanna have a beer here's what yeah drink what you're so excited like the level design your house you've done it before I've done yeah your kids birthday party you were like yeah fucking finally yeah do you go with them every time you never go like not right now yeah who I am somebody subjects you're on board that's one of the most fun things you're all about it yeah I like it I like the rush of it like imagine when I have you in a fucking triangle happen can I get E Bravo well what the fuck he knows any Bravo - ok Eddie pick your teams you get Jack Smith hmm how does that work should any have a team you just do it at EBI EBI looking for my fucking teammate we could definitely do to the EBI baby it's not fair since Eddie knows both of you it's not fair that either one of you that's fine Tommy figures I'll take some chalk I'll just take some Brazilian yeah anyone who wants that anyone do the bomb yeah one of those dudes from the gigolo show dick this has been a great fucking podcast yeah what would you do if you did do it you Jitsu match would you do like how long do you think it would be like a five minute match 1012 nobody I don't know no never seen once long time yeah I think we do man I mean it would have to be one round see who can if you guys really want to do it well bounce around it I don't think there's no need to there's no does not need to come up with a definite contest right now you guys are high ball on each other because I'm thinking about cross-country skiing where they have the rifles - we could do that shit like we do that something called the total archery challenge looks like you run around the woods and hit targets and oh no I mean no kill that what listen just we could you guys could do a bunch of shit it really should be a show though yeah we should definitely and if you keep it along the path that it's been on for this sort of competition this is like a super beneficial competition for both you guys yeah yeah - you get lost and it's same amount of weight yeah it really did seriously that's the one that really like freaked out my mom my sisters have never watched this podcast they've heard it before they never watched it they watched it with my wife and my daughters yesterday yeah and I came home and they're like Tommy's lost a lot of weight I was like wait your dad has to and they're like I know when Tommy's lost a lot of weight but they see you David they see me daily but they were like Tommy's lost a lot of weight that is a problem though when people are around you all the time they get used to a certain look and even if it shifts radically over the course of six months you don't notice it this one's gonna take a while yeah before I go home but yes is a little tad bit uneven agree if you want to trim it up that's all fine and dandy but I think the most I should stand I'm very happy made that decision yeah that's good I think the must have freaked the fuck out they're gonna laugh they're gonna be fine just have a business meeting yeah we're gonna be late for that for nope nope nope I'm good I'm good yeah by pushing it is very important what Jamie do we have to leave cuz Tom's moving around like you have to leave but I don't think he has to no I don't have to leave I don't have to be either Tommy one of the things you get on give a waffles date no this one's your waffle date and all the time there's no time no time just made a decision yeah it's a good move yeah the waffles are like pure enjoyment there's no illusion of nutrition especially when the crispy on the inside and you just open all into something mm-hmm I just go fucking hole with butter I just kill that thing with butter to chocolate souffle I talked about the same thing you're just making a decision to indulge yeah just party go deep I've never had caviar yeah Rod Stewart's daughter's party my first weekend drop and I had caviar so much I couldn't dig away they take away they took the caviar away from you eating too much eating so much cuz I'd never have took it away for they actually moved the whole plate of all the seafood and pulled it out of the table oh my god Nicole not Nicole Richie what's her name how drunk Kimberly Stewart not a sober stone so bright she's never had caviar so you were going at it so hard they decided this guy's gonna eat it all in a selfish gluttonous rampage of caviar consumption my buddy Eddie was like if you're right caviar before and I was like no and he's like do you should try it such high they would like a cracker murdering it and they came out and removed the whole plate it was like a I got literally as you're scooping a three people of three foot blade they removed it back to the kitchen and I was like where did that go like they'll put food out but only if you eat a certain amount yeah they see one person is enjoying it too much they will move in

a way to improve things and to always concentrate on the reasons why you can't you got to keep winding up in patterns and sometimes like a little competition like you guys did in fun and fairness and
