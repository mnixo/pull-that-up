boom boom boom boom boom four three two one Oh in the sweet sweet sound of amplified voices and my man Shooter Jennings haha hey man you look like you're supposed to wear sunglasses some dudes wear sunglasses like pitch get those sunglasses off but you you look like you suppose she wearing sunglasses there is a point in time when I lived here I remember well for a while there were a prescription so I had an excuse for a long time but I went back to contacts but there was a point in time when I I remember turning to my friend I was like 21 and I was like I think I'm just gonna keep him on all the time and then it'll just be a thing and that way I can just if I have to close my eyes nobody'll notice or if I'm stoned when people get super famous like jay-z famous they wear them inside everywhere just so people don't catch a glimpse of their eyes and I'm a demo tape you start out like a scribe where no then it's weird if you take them off you know well it's a different thing in the black community - like a real cool black artist is just allowed they just allowed they can just do it right right I mean I'd be disappointed if like I saw a Bob Dylan out somewhere and he wasn't wearing them like Christoph riders him all the time yeah good fade - it's like black brown white gonna yeah he fits right the fucking Conor McGregor he can wear him indoors some dudes can wear them indoors if I warm indoors I'd be a douche bag plus the kind of wear I wear like you know fuckin sport ones I have a couple pairs of those that look cool like a cool ass aviator these proportions my dad used to wear Porsches and like one point I I ran across they're purple ones and I was like I bought like four pairs and I keep breaking them there's my last one those are very dope those are course design yeah they make see dope shit they do I just used to think that they only made cars and then I felt they make phones did you know they make a phone oh yeah I saw it I've never um don't they make uh didn't they make a blackberry for a minute they think I'm being made a blackberry and I think they made another phone recently I would love to get one of those but it's a weird little design chop they have it they have a huawei phone I'm saying it wrong apparently people corrected me hallway Wow Huawei is a Chinese company that actually just got busted because their newest advertisement it shows them taking selfies but there aren't really taking selfies they use only a super high-end DSLR camera that to take the photo and they're passing it off as if these people are just holding it up taking selfies it's on a fuckin tripod the whole deal look at that look guys holding it up as if he's taking a selfie I mean while they're so fucking professional dude a tripod but he's making it look like he took that picture who busted then I think the woman in the photo busted them because I think she took pictures or had someone take pictures of the photoshoot yeah you got a look in her face like that - yeah she's really good come on Huawei but meanwhile here's what's stupid about that they don't have to do that those goddamn things take amazing selfies that's a great phone yeah like the the newest latest smartphones they take incredible selfies I know but people never satisfied with the truth that's why people gorgeous women will put those fucking crazy cartoons those selfie filters on yeah they're beautiful and then they'll turn themselves into a cartoon like you don't get it like you're supposed to have pores right we don't mind pores I don't mind the wrinkles on your skin when you smile I don't mind you know the the bubbles of saliva on your teeth okay when people are getting in this weird state of mind where they think they're so you know they said there's an epidemic of girls like insta models that are actually getting surgery to try to look like they look in their selfies oh my god you know speaking of instant models I just listened to David Spade's audio audio book which I thought was great the I guess what Polaroid guy in a snapchat world or whatever there's a lot of chapters that deal with the instant I don't even real I didn't even realize this is the thing like I'm so dang dude I'm so out of the loop with with do you go to Instagram do you do like pay attention to adjust post pictures occasionally man I I'm not really good paying attention to any of it Twitter from day one I kind of was in and I'll go in and out but it's hard for me to actually keep up and care about it like I hate posting pictures of myself and my manager Adam is here he's always like dude if you're gonna post something on Instagram just make sure you're in it or something cuz I'm always like taking pictures of other people can't listen that dude you're not supposed to be in every picture you take that's crazy no but I'm bad at it and I'm very bad at caring about other people's pictures too and it's like like my wife will be like I just posted its grand so I gotta like it oh that's annoying her pictures are good so I'm sure the great god damn to have to double tap each and every one of them just give you the nod looks good no well you see it's easy to throw that off and see my daughter's now who's ten now has an Instagram account and if I'm not liking him I feel horrible I'm not for my wife's already liked him I'm like God yeah I'm done I think that's a lot of pressure for a kid noting it well herbs are all pictures of these lol dolls that she's obsessed with anyway and surroundings yes lime is a new one huh yeah it's crazy fuck saw that coming up by the ways fidget spinners out yeah it's line oh yeah I mean my son got so obsessed with fidget spinners and my daughter but really my son to the point where like they were spending some time in New York and I'd be gone up there and we walk down the street and like every fucking vendor every newsstand every like pretzel place had like fidget spinners and and and like I'd have to buy it you know I'd be like he'd be like ooh that one has a skull on it and be like okay and it's like 10 bucks and then to spend just drink yeah that guy cents to manufacturer and I was like an 18 year old kid who came up with that and he wanted me an entrepreneur and he made now he's like a billionaire how did he figure that out like I want to talk to that dude go right man you should have on the show yeah don't don't give out the secret but what the fuck is next I didn't see slime coming either my daughters have fucking gallons of glue and and yeah yeah just yesterday my daughter and son were making slime with it and I was saying the same thing I'm like man I mean we had like ectoplasm slime and and Nickelodeon slime when I was a kid and but it was not like this all of a sudden it's like I can't believe it and you watch the commercials for glue they have glow-in-the-dark glue and they're like showing a kid making slime what the hell no no talk about unexpected boost for Elmer's yeah they must have jumped he lost a job they came up timers between Tide Pods and the slime tides like what considered real was it were people really eating detergent I guess that seems like it would be unbelievably bad for your body to eat a detergent used to Huff like scotchguard when we were kids or okay I mean maybe it's nice to smell markers yeah I love the smell of like a good sharpie like a fat one anyone ever do the thing in school for you where they grab you and they they pull you up and then you almost pass out for and then they let you go we used to do that in elementary school yeah what was that how'd that work I think I would get the Chinese you pick her up and then thank you or some shit yeah until you can't basically breathe you're almost suffocating and then let you go and then you're like hi hi hi hmm the kids are always trying to well even monkeys man I mean animals try to change their state you know they think it's just a natural thing the creatures try to change their state try and change their state of consciousness even little kids but I wonder about that slime stuff because I genuinely genuinely worried like people I don't think have been dealing with large volumes of glue and detergent like that with articles - yeah oh yeah yeah that's fucking toxic it gets in your skin is an organ people don't realize that you don't think about that when you're spraying on all the different shit that people put on their bodies like I think about that when I use sunscreen I'm like what is this stuff but hey you're blocking in wars with some goo some good but it's also your skin's absorbing it like like when you go in that isolation tank that's one of the best ways to absorb magnesium because the Epsom salts like when you float around the tank the epsom salts you know your body absorbs magnesium from talking about like altered states yeah yeah yeah have you done that before my stuff done DMT we had a conversation that's right yeah yeah man had a conversation now how the fuck will be only done one other podcast together that's ridiculous man you know we live in the same town I know I know we went we had a great dinner was there that was fun man mom yeah that was really fun yeah I got the great mrs. Rogan out yeah that's right it was fun we had a good time yeah dangerous dude that place is the shit a place like go back in time that is my that is the spot where if they I feel like I've made it in this town that they know me by name there and I can always get a spot at the bar I'm close they know me by name but I don't always have a spot at the bar I mean yeah I don't think anybody always gets a spot the bars width does Oh does he I bet you he's got a giant dick I hear I finally met him there I had the balls to walk up to him one of the recent times I was like hey man yeah you just gotta walk up with a Hillary Clinton joke he's Republican now yeah but he's he's he's he's funny I mean regardless of what side you're on he is just always on fire with that and he likes doing it just to aggravate people yeah well he see it seems like he's done with the whole acting thing yeah I said he invested an apple in the 80s and he's fine with being blacklisted really yeah that's what he said he but made a tweet or something like that Wow the investment in Apple hmm interesting yeah let's I don't where does that he just say I think this company's gonna kick some ass let me by peace yeah you get a piece of a company and then they become the Apple yeah Apple apparently has a more than a trillion dollars now I know that meant insane that's kind of dangerous anybody to have that kind of influence though with these phones and shit it's like that's pretty pretty dangerous yeah I I kind of trust them with data though I feel like even with their China deal yeah well Google has a weird China deal too well I also have secret servers in North Korean oh yeah I mean they just have servers set up in all these other countries it all I can't trust any of them what are they doing in North Korea I don't know it's all dick pics yeah I mean his Rovers full of date I think there's all kinds of networks that have been going on years that are involved in shit I think like I was I'd tell my friends or my drummer specifically I talk to but I was like man I think like I'm not a rich guy but like I think that there's a point of money that I would I would like to know the threshold in which you get past that and then like the Saudis and then all the cut all these people start coming and wanting a part of you and then you start selling your soul like whatever that is if it's five million bucks I just got stay right there that would be get richer than that and once you have influence I think it's it becomes a scary world so I like I think there's a lot of concern early people wonder whether or not someone's bit like I've been accused of being approached like that I'm a CIA acid or that I here's a big I think that's really that flat earth oh the flat earth people they think that I've been approached to talk about the earth being round to be a round earth shell Jamie started selling teas around Earth shield James got round earth shield t-shirts that he sells at young Jamie calm man I mean around or the she'll chill is like saying like you know that the reptilian people went to you to be a human shield Oh someone told me that someone told me that they believe that there's a reptilian simony to earth and that they have carved appear they've carved tunnels through the ground with laser beams and they have like a network of tunnels they use they travel amongst us waiting for their time to expose themselves people believe like you see someone like say if you live in an apartment building and he tried by dudes house got a fat house you go wow that guy's got a fat house I wonder I wonder who he knows what if he's like he's in with the mob or maybe he's deep with the Democrats or maybe he's the bankers or who's Guzzi who does he know because you always think of like someone like being like at a level where you're you're you like they sit you in a room and they give you some communications that you're not supposed to expose to the rest of the world right well I mean there is again what I would I would say about the threshold of money there is a point and you know it's there in which in I mean Google started with a couple dudes right we're like we got this idea there was before that there was a thing called web crawler that was kind of the first experience of me of a search engine that I'd ever experienced well there was Netscape Navigator Gator was a wasn't that first browser yeah there was a mosaic and Netscape Navigator but there was a way to search that was web caller like us well line came later like us what yahoo came later and but yeah there was web crawler then yahoo and like us and then google just over yeah cool thing passed calm still there that's so there yeah still there but uh but like you know you got a look couple dudes in an office hey we got a web search and we're all of a sudden there they've got con I mean amazon has CIA contracts that's that's known because they use their servers to do things you got you got a look Amazon has like super super secure servers but they still been hacked they're as secure as anyone elses yeah they just have once you make that I think it's the maybe it's five hundred million there's got to be a mark yeah there's a know which in which people start approaching you and saying hey man you've got too much influence would you like to join our group and we'll make a billion yeah I was in Italy I just got back and we took a boat from from the Amalfi Coast we took a boat from Amalfi to Capri which is an eye on how gorgeous meant but when you're there you see the crazy yachts like Steve Jobs has a yacht that he had built before he died and now his family owns like Leo DiCaprio and Bella Hadid in his yacht looks like an apple store it's the craziest thing I mean we drove right by it yachts are weird too because they're worth like a hundred million bucks but you could basically like drive up and smack it like no one cares it's weird I mean that's how pirates work right you could just hop on tightly throw a grappling hook up and then climb on top of your yacht but driving by he's maket he's kind of there it is that's it Wow it's a floating Apple school I don't want that I don't want to have to deal with that and the maintenance and everything I'm fine I really just just first-class it and I and go to you know gone a trip and maybe rent that yacht for like if I had the money even renting that yacht would be like half a million dollars a week fuck that I'll just get a boat and go up to it and right right yeah the difference between the experience in a boat that big and an experience at a boat that's like a fraction that size it's not that different like that's pretty fucking awesome but ultimately it's like a how like that's there you get a good impression of what it's like it's it does it doesn't really do it justice in an image because it's so so modern right like when you when you get near and it's so strange looking yeah I mean again it'd be awesome to party on that for like a week guys boat rest of it would suck look at that boat they just pulled right up hey man yo Steve my fucking iPad just broke I mean I don't know man he ever ride it no he shit the bed before you wrote it you know it's really fascinating I read something about he died of pancreatic cancer and one of the things he did was he drank fruit juice every day and we used to think the fruit juice is really good for you right you drink it fruit now they say no no fruit is really good for you but drinking fruit juice is kind of an unnatural state there's no fiber in that so you're just drinking straight sugar and now they say that drinking like a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice has the same sugar as drinking a can of soda so you really your body doesn't differentiate much I mean between chemicals and soda though I mean right chemicals are not good right some chemicals but some of them they're innocuous like you could drink like I was reading something about like Diet Coke like someone's saying like Diet Coke give you brain cancer and they're saying it prevents cancer well there was an article I read recently they were saying that they thought that diet colas actually helped they flipped their script on that do they have a little fast talk at the end of it about dark oh come here first of all that fast talk shit should be illegal I don't know why that's not illegal remember these to do that the end they hire somebody who talks like Clara brought a whole commercial like that yeah make it all ineffective here what is that could die coke help curb colon cancers return what wine diet coke who fucking see new study shows that Coen can here's a problem man fucking studies dude studies are a problem because you can get like there was a study posted recently it was a questionnaire that showed that people who eat higher carb diets live longer but it's it's basically a questionnaire that over 20-something years of like what you eat and then the people who died like there was all sorts of problems with it like they did an exercise as much they were fatter than the people who ate more carbs and also you're asking people to remember what they ate which is like very very ineffective and then the same cup the same place put out a study really recently that showed the exact opposite effect and so it's like well what the fuck if I'm just a regular guy who barely has time to read the paper and I read a study every now and then it's basically what you catch now you can catch some second analysis found that about half of the benefit appeared to be due to people switching from regular to diet sodas oh so the colon cancer was really just you stopped drinking coke coke was giving you colon cancer so now diet coke prevents colon cancer it's really no coke gives you fucking colon cancer right it's so hard to know it's so hard to know man I try to keep up I cannot yeah I try now that's the problem with the internet and everything back in the day when we just didn't know shit it seems like things move smoother you know yeah but you remember like people thought all kinds of goofy shit like thought most your diet should be bread remember that Marilyn Aaron took his rib out sex on dick no but that was that was a rumor bad day that's it II know I'm Adam do you might actually do that yeah yeah that was one how about here's the granddaddy of all rumors Richard Gere and that chirping the gerbil in his ass everybody knew that how is that possible I want to know it's possible how my buddy Steve did his residency in Miami he's an ophthalmologist and he told me that they pulled all kinds of things out of dudes butts you know those kind of thick lightning those thick light bulbs that look like a like a tree like a Christmas tree right yeah yes some dude shoved one of those uh possess all and it broke watch who is America I love that show by the way I'll do you know there was a lot of there was a lot of talk about it and I think it was great what he did I mean all he did was set up people to show the ugly animal if they had it but I did not see that episode he's a genius man man I went a real quick story I was like there's a banco hellbound glory that i've loved for years and the lead singer and Leroy Virgil or they live in Reno and so he took me to Reno on the I been in Reno before but he took me on the hellbound glory tour of Reno which was him going to different bars and shit and he took me to this guy's house and it was it was a friend of his lived down the street and it was like their garage was open a bunch of people hanging out playing vinyls in this dude and drinking you know and at some point this guy was like hey I got to show you something and he reached into his ceiling like he had like one of these but not what the the clouds on it was just a regular like light you pull out and he up in there he had an x-ray that he pulled out and it was an x-ray of a woman's vagina with a Flying V guitar neck the headstock in in it it was an x-ray of that so it got stuck I mean I don't know how I mean with the fucking tuning pegs and everything it was yeah so you know you know coming out yeah I mean how could going in but a woman's vagina is a remarkably flexible thing they make babies babies come out of their bodies yeah but I mean that's a whole hormonal thing their body sets up for nine months to let happen I mean just sticking maybe she really loves music oh maybe she really really really loves hair metal and yeah there maybe it's just a giant fan of Slayer I just wanted that once that guitar in her body whoo but my friend Steve said he pulled all kinds of things out of people's bodies and he said he said he was in Miami and he said that it was during the cocaine days I'm entering the cocaine days like they ended oh yeah that's over bro that's like so 1980 but he was there during the 80s 70s in the 80s that's when I met him okay I was in high school when I met him so I think I was 15 or 16 where'd you guys go Newton South High in Newton Massachusetts a suburb of Boston how'd you meet him Taekwondo he was uh he was doing his residency for ophthalmology and I was a young high school kid who was competing and says I was over there every day so if you came there he saw me and he so he was doing his residency in Boston he was he was finishing up and bought some but he had done some of his work before that in Miami so this was I graduated in 85 so he was probably Miami like 80 81 somewhere around then he just cut back he showed me all kinds of pictures dude wow this is back before the internet I got to see brains people's brains hanging out he showed me some photos of I mean what bullet hole was it with a Polaroid or something to question I don't know what do you guys I don't remember dubious there well people were dead you know the brains they were dead I didn't get to see like the light bulb up the asshole you know hey man stay still while you screaming yeah yeah yeah distract him yes but he did have some photos of some atrocious things no he said it was just to go from being a medical school school student to doing your residency in Miami and just seeing just crazy amounts of violence he said it was just insane like have you seen cocaine Cowboys I have not oh my god Billy Corbin who's been on the last four made two of the most amazing documentaries ever that's about the blow Aaron cocaine I mean the movie yes oh and all that George - George hung Orange wellnot was out about Griselda Griselda Blanco who is this badass bitch from Colombia was she from Colombia Bogota yes so that was my am I think I saw part of that documentary but I always wanted to watch it oh it's so good it's so he just got two of them so if you do it you got a fucking gets the other dose and cocaine Cowboys too why fuck around with a crazy hard to remember a sequel name but cocaine Cowboys 1 & 2 oh my god it's that there was one year where everyone who graduated from the police academy either was murdered or went to jail every single graduate was either killed because their they had a part a part of the cocaine business or they went to jail for being corrupt Wow all of them there's more a pattern of this is true please Google this there there were at least at the time more banks per capita in Miami than anywhere else in the country because it was all used to launder cocaine money Wow yeah no bullshit man again man you get that level of money and as you start getting banks and stuff I'm just saying those two men documentaries I can't say enough good things about them they're so good sounds exhausting not the documentaries but the actual business of doing it well that's why you need coke on your own supply man that's the only way to keep up with the young kids I mean if you Rick Ross which one the real one or the real one no no the rapper Freeway Ricky no yeah yeah the real Rick Ross I know I know is the freeway Ricky yeah that's the one you want to ask you don't to ask the rapper the rapper was a prison guard do you know yes yes well you know Freeway Ricky who's been on the show a couple times sued to get his name back and to keep his dude from using his name because he was actually Rick Ross that's his actual funny story I didn't know he's on your show dude he's not on twice Rick Ross Freeway Ricky was the guy who was selling all the cocaine that paid for the Contras when the Contras are fighting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua not whole oliver north shit chorus Freeway Ricky was the one who was selling all the coke to these people he didn't know how he's getting these coke he didn't know he was actually getting out of people we're deep deep state deep state we're not telling you I'm telling you two men find the threshold he learned how to read it's a great style Ricky learned how to read in jail and then learn how to become a lawyer in jail and then realize they tried him for they did they hit him with three strikes but they hit him with two charges at the same time which is not how three strikes work so he went to jail for life and then got released for time for time served because they tried him incorrectly the right strikes was in exactly one of his strike they were there at the same time you can't do that it has to be like you go to jail you come out you go to jail again you come out you go to jail again they go alright you're a criminal I'm gonna keep you in jail that was a high idea which is fucked up okay what's it like sitting across the table from him he's a very nice guy very smart guy he was a tennis player man played tennis in Compton yeah couldn't fucking read man couldn't read play tennis in Compton and was just seeing all these people around him that were making crazy amounts of money Wow and is a real calm nice guy and that's one of the reasons why he did so well said he wasn't this crazy buck wild dude driving Rolls Royces throwing money out the window he wasn't that guy he was like the cool calm collected John wick sort of character that kept his shit together you know and everybody respected him because of that he just was like you mean the same reason why he learned how to be a lawyer while he's in prison he's a systematic you know intelligent dude who just had a shit education you know just grew up in a very bad scary dangerous environment and you know didn't even learn to read in jail in Lincoln the history of the iran-contra figured out all the shit and Wow I had it was selling coke and didn't even know who he was selling it for didn't know that the people he was selling it for like the the contacts that he had were directly supplied by the Oliver North Bush and yeah Wow interesting man yeah Matt Wow I just have Oliver North for president t-shirt I wore it just to piss people off I didn't know what it meant I was like 17 is not shit man yeah man it's the whole thing's crazy that this Rick Ross guy the rapper was actually a prison guard there's a photo of him was fuckin prison guard uniform on well I mean I like him a lot I reckon cross the way I do I like that that was a lie I'm with the big Saint I don't know the big single I don't know I do that one big one that I've sang before what's the record with devil is a lie on it that was a record that I loved what's his big hit me a man said hang out a lot and we'd listen to Rick Ross all the time that's like really yeah you guys get together I mean the Knights right no but I like the Rick Ross guy that was gonna come in but he wouldn't do it on camera was weird like he wouldn't do it after he wanted that he'll do it at a certain time at night but here's the thing man some of that shit is publicist cuz I'll tell you the same thing happened with Liz Phair who I'm a giant fan of 100% I've been a fan of Liz Phair for nephew man exile and guy bill was fucking fantastic and evil empire at the same time at the record store in Nashville Tennessee the Reg it's machine in exile guy oh wow totally my wife also misty who we went there with it was listening she loved Liz Phair too at the time she she came and we got high together she's like you can get high here I'm like yeah I don't have a boss Alex Jones got high fuckin all right that was fucking awesome he's trying to come back on I just don't know if I could do it oh come on let him come on they're fuckin they are shutting down but the problem is he's still on trial this this whole trial that's going on with Sandy Hook I know that shit has to be resolved first but it doesn't mean like Bill Maher respect to Bill Maher I love respect to him for saying he gets to speak to ya he was on his show and people are clapping and cheering that he was pulled off of these networks and pulled off of everything's like look this guy said crazy lies about me is what Bill Maher said he said the guy said crazy lies about me he goes but he still gets to talk like this is what America is about free speech means all speech but see like here's what I don't understand like Alex had me on many times and he supported my record black rivets became it really yeah you've been on the Alex Jones Show many times I've been I've been on it three times were you ever sober yeah every time yeah yeah I've never it was never a situation well the first time I was that we had the black ribbons record that I did as Stephen King ah and stuff like so when that record came out nobody would support the record so how much demons on your record yeah old record from what do plays he plays that DJ the radio talk show host that comes in and out of the record that's Stephen King yeah as Stephen King so like and I did that record Alex Jones the only person that would support the record he put it he debuted the whole record on his show and then I went it was on for two hours by phone and then I went in and it was on his show in person about just the music business that's all we were talking about and like kind of how things were and then later I was on for Bitcoin discussion kind of by Skype or something but I will say this in his defense in all of this I just think that like dude that guy has been saying things conspiracy theories about all kinds of things what do you want calling that or not but like forever and like now the the situation is like so volatile that like they're gonna you know the Sandy Hook thing all right so like they definitely caught fucking Anderson Cooper having the green screen and it's probably because they had another person there talking to the mom and then what happened was there's there's a video of Anderson Cooper interviewing one of the moms from Sandy Hook mm-hmm and he he walked he leans a little too far forward and his nose disappears and it's probably because they had a stand-in reporter talking to the mom and once Anderson Cooper was then like put in via you know whatever green screen and like I need it's there I mean I know this is where we're propelling but my point is is like and I'm not I mean Sandy Hook I remember where I was when I heard about Sandy Hook and it was horrific and I don't believe for a second that there's like it's all fake or any time but like Alex's thing has always been that I remember watching him go to Bohemian Grove and when we did the fucking record on this is back when nobody was paying it to him it just certain small group but I remember we did the black ribbons record and we took a clip of the laughing he went he snuck into Bohemian Grove and film the ceremony and there's like a scene where they were not a scene I guess seen in his film but there's a part of that where they're doing the ceremony and they have this like it's like Disneyland when you go won't lift our God yeah yeah but it's like it's done in a way where it's like Disneyland when you watch like the the fairies fly around the castle like there was a whole thing where there was like a laugh that happens at the end of the Molokai or whatever mm-hmm the big owl and the in the the funeral guys dressed like druids right so like I used a part of that but I remember watching that documentary and he you know his deal has always been so over the top where like you go he's like where are the see like go to local people aren't near Bohemian Grove he's like we're looking for where the Satanists go to go do that you know and it's obviously at this point it's not like people who are knowingly Satanists it's like really old fat rich guys that go there and there's probably hookers and all kinds of shit because that's what happens at big rich things defleshing the 90s I mean so get away with it right and so like now with all this and they're crucifying him especially pointing especially the megyn kelly thing and I just feel bad for what I mean especially the magnet because that was clearly hit piece with Alex because like she buddied up to him and then then focused that piece on the Sandy Hook thing you know they had their talk in her defense how could she not of course she's got us if you're gonna come you know Jones if I was gonna come but if I came here with it with the intention of like just talking to you and then all of a sudden you were like hey on this day on this thing when you did this thing like you focused on this one thing now and be like ah man like this is a hit piece like yeah but that you're a musician and he's this is what he does I know house is my friend he's a he's my friend since 1999 I get more shit from being friends with Alex Jones and anything else in my life because I chose you know what I'm just saying like I'm sure I'll get hit for this but the point is is you don't check your Twitter I'm ready for it I don't want you know what time to check it maybe next year but like but the reality is is I just think that and I'm not even here from like the the side of the the political point of view is this it let's watch this video this is the video it says the quality Anderson Cooper's disappearing nose Greenstein clip debunked I see that hold on do you see what it says it says debunked which means I think bad quality video right here it'll play about 3 seconds and there's a it there's a weird part on us knows that happens but to say it's a green screen I would I would well these same the same people that are looking for conspiracies and everything they used this to say that the space station didn't exist right but hold on super quick it looks like it was just like a digital glitch that's it no that's not it and this is what that's not the beating I couldn't find it you've seen the other piece yeah I mean he leans for it his nose look here's what I think I think that they had a stand-in because he couldn't be there but hold on you might be wrong right I could be this is we're talking about several years ago you might have a fucked up memory this let's try to find the video they said he was there all week shooting from the exact okay okay maybe was maybe I'm wrong but I mean it got you that got to you Shooter Jennings they didn't get to me the carnage is like I would say the same thing you know more than a hundred thousand dollars a year dude knocks on your door and starts talking to buckets no way well if you're making $34,000 a year you look at people to make a hundred thousand like damn yeah all my fucking bills honey get high thousand dollar level well you got a sellout son yeah but that's how people look at it man but there is a threshold there is a threshold I mean when I was broke I had an a suburban I wasn't broke but I was I was doing alright but I had suburban and some guy and I got into a fucking road rage situation on the highway and he goes you fucking rich asshole I go rich Mike I'm driving a fucking suburban man [Laughter] like what is rich to you rich is driving a suburban way fine ma'am I have that like I already had the rich thing because people thought that I was rich cuz my dad which I never really I never was I mean he was supportive of me but once I got here it was I was kind of on my own I like that but then then once I talked about Bitcoin with you like fucking five years ago or whatever it was I was here or three years ago never is like oh you got to be rich now cuz that like fucking that red coin yeah but I mean look what's the point up to like seven no yeah went up to 19 now second you're going down sit and drop very much below six grand but I mean when I was here with you it was like less than a grand but um you know what I'm trying to say about this is not like I'm not validating his this Anderson Cooper thing but that dude has always been fishing for things like that it's always been his gig and it's been his gig from Columbine it's been his gig from all of this and I understand that the passion and the emotion involved with the children that that died in Sandy Hook and I have no I'm not defending him on that deal but at the same time that's always been this guy's gig I feel like that is where he legitimately fucked up I don't think if you take does he take away I got a defend him fucking fuck up yeah but this is a silly fuck up he's saying that for sure it was a fake but did he say for sure people sent me the clip they sent me the clip of him saying that it was a hundred percent fake he thought it was fake so he said it but he thought it was fake yeah he thought it was a he thought it was a false flag so he said it I mean but that's our thinking that's a part of the conspiratorial thinking that's a real problem he's like saying you know he said some shit about me he said said him said about mean it's a hundred percent not true he said that pre-post you're interviewing them remember I think it's post it was post he said that the government threatened my family to stop talking about conspiracy theories no no nobody threatened my family no.10 never happened did not happen it is fake it is a lie someone told it to him I guess or he says someone told to him it didn't happen listen so that's me I understand but he do you understand like how frustrating that is this is a minor thing someone him lying not lying okay someone he said someone told him I believe he's telling the truth but it's not true he could have fucking called me he's got my number man calling me we even bother calling me Joe about to go live from Austin Texas I need to know did someone threaten your family stop talking about the moon-landing a Bigfoot fucking imagine they gonna threaten you do you got to stop talking about Bigfoot man like well no I found I did a show this is a well documented I've talked about it a hundred times in the podcast I did a show called Joe Rogan questions everything and during that show over a period of six months I fucking questioned a lot of shit legitimately but I did it with researchers we had a staff we had producers we went and we actually went to like these places where these people are claiming to see UFOs we went to these places where people are claiming to be able to what does that shit they do remote viewing remote yeah we talked to those guy we talked to all these people and I found a real clear thread through all of it that are documented in my 2014 Comedy Central special where I said here's what you don't find when you go looking for Bigfoot black people what you do find is unfuckable white dudes you are more likely to find Bigfoot than you are black people out looking for Bigfoot also alien abductions probably it's dudes who can't get laid and they go looking for hidden mysteries this is a real big part of it I know I know my point is from doing that show it soured me off conspiracy theories conspiracy theories were fun for me and me and my Eddie Bravo me and Eddie Bravo would get high and we'd watch documentaries on flying rods and all these UFO documentaries and all the fucking zecharia sitchin 2011 oh I love that I love that stuff but here's that I used to watch a chariot to the gods all the time together all falls apart under scrutiny and all of it all me does oh it's a fun but it falls apart if you're being a serious person and if you're really being honest about what you actually know this is the problem it's like the saint in the parallels like that comparison comparing to Alex Jones saying that my family is threatened it's the same thing my family was never threatened no one ever threatened me so but he's saying this on the radio why is he saying it because someone told them and he maybe he believes it and he also thinks it's fun to say it's the thing to say if you're really any conspiracies but this is the problem with these fucking conspiracies they say things they don't know are true and they say them like they're true now this is fine if you just took that it's fine if it's not an issue if you're talking about the Illuminati if you're talking about your kid getting shot right your kids dead and someone says hey man this is Tom Smith on the radio saying you're full of shit you're a crisis actor and your kids not dead I mean you're crying every night you wake up the middle like crying because something is right to be Alex Jones yes for being David Alko one time I wouldn't even code well I played a show with David out code one this is not any play let's get Sandy Hook out of this because I'm not trying to trick depending the right of people to be who they are and I love David all cows music and all that but I played a show with David on Co one time and my dad always would tell me these things about him you know he really liked David and everything but there was always kind of a little distance of like there was a showmanship part of him and there like a good example of this again distancing from Sandy Hook but a good part of it was that when when David Alko we did a show with him one time my mom was over on the side of the stage with me I was opening for him this is many years ago before I even had a first record out or anything and David Allan Coe did you know we did our saw of our set and then he played and he was on stage and he performed a song my mom I wrote called storms never last so my mom's over on the side of the stage and you're talking me mama and he's singing it with his wife and stuff the next night I'm opening up for him and he goes onstage and he goes last night Jessi Colter was right in the front row when I sang this song with my wife and she was crying and like I'm sitting there going I was here and she was not crying she was staying cold she was not on the front row right right my mom just killed her read this song storms never last easing and and that's his character that's who he is all I'm saying here with like I'm as forgiving about him lying to the audience because that is what he's doing at the moment it's his I could sit there and go you know what you're lying I'm gonna take you in the back we're gonna talk I'm gonna tell this audience tomorrow night he's a liar he's a piece of shit fuck him I'm not gonna do that because it's David I'll go he's don't you just did it on the show which is I'm not much larger audience I'm just saying I character but why would I do that to him because it's like you know and trashed it I just feel like look man the times that I met Alex the times I've been around him yeah man his gig is this and he got called out for a specific thing yes it involved the lives of children everything that I understand that I'm not I'm not at all sympathizing for the those family or for him versus those families but I'm just saying I just think that like at the moment everything is so hot with this and it's it's kind of exhausting and it's the Internet is the reason for it and in my opinion because I think that like all the years that have come along the mass amount of people that have migrated to social media the way that the integrated conversations happened the way that that stuff ends up on the news now like AOL chat rooms and fuck in 1998 that shit did not end up on CNN people were not listening to those things the the best closest you could get to fucking TV was to catch a predator when you were on that right at that time you know and I feel like at this point in time people need again not those families they're lawsuit that's fine that's that's their thing but but I just feel like people need to lighten up a little bit in the sense of I just think that the social media thing is very hazardous and I think that people's faith in all of it it doesn't have to do with with fake news and it doesn't have to do with Russian BOTS and all this shit I just think that like Alex Jones is a casualty because he's always been what do you what do you mean by it doesn't have to do with fake news and Russian bah I mean that lady there's always excuses for all the reasons why do you understand that's real right I believe that of course fake news is real but none of Russian Russians are real that means one there's like this there's an NPR document no no no radio Lab podcast about Russian troll farms it's fucking fascinating it's really interesting I mean these people show up at work and they're their basic job is to put propaganda out on Instagram and social media and Twitter and comments and I agree on that stuff I agree but but let's let's get out of the let me let me tell you an example what I what I have seen of this I run a bulletin board system called bit sunrise which is like old technology they used to be modems used to dial into Baltimore systems you can tell that Intuit telnet is a port port 23 is the telnet port well DVR is also share port 23 so TV arts like two yards like your your DirecTV we connected storing your not all not all yeah well you we like if you if you record a show on a weekly basis it is not there is an open port it's not always 23 on the units but it's shared with with the telnet port so during the election during the months up to the election in the months after the election I would say four months five months leading up five months after on my bulletin this kind of technical one when I'm trying to explain this to you but when when you tell that into a computer you you per mind you would tell them it in and it would give you a login as a picture or this drawn and you put your name and your your address or your password in you log in well during the five months leading up to the election in the five months afterwards I was getting every day probably all day long 10 or 20 connections that were coming in and they were just wouldn't say a bot they were like they were scripts that were trying to log into DVRs and trying to log in to like IP cameras that you can control and everything like that so I was watching for that about a year period so let me pause here so you're saying that these bots were trying to control DVRs and cameras that people have on their televisions just testing and 90% of them were coming for China 10% of them were coming from maybe Russia and other places but 90% China Korea because you can look at the IP addresses so what are they testing for the test all their flaws and they're trying to do is they would try to they would be looking for a linux login which would be like you know login I can like if you were to tell net or SSH into a device like that the first thing we get was a login and usually its route is the controller and so they were just trying to fight they were just just blindly masse blindly going to IP addresses in trying to hack into them route and then they try password then they try like this they try that they try the black you know so the Russian bad thing I understand that but I don't think it was a coordinated effort I think that like all during that whole time I was watching my computer like I have it's kind of I'm getting real nerdy here but it's like I have these games that like in the people play and like once you get past the 13th 14th 15th node which essentially means like once there's 15 people playing at the same time then the game stopped working so I would be having to deal with these Chinese and Russia thing Russian and all these all of them just masse trying to just break in and it was because of the DVRs and because the IP cameras like they were really literally trying to hack your system to just do whatever I don't know what the purpose was but I like I watched it and it was it was China mostly I mean Russia was a small amount and I think that all those countries all the time or have people that are constantly trying to hack and interact with these with our shit I mean it's just a thing you know there's that as well there's that as well yeah but I think there's that as well but there's also people that are absolutely trying to in selections they're absolutely trying to influence our system and they're trying to manipulate political parties and they're trying to start descent and this is one of the things that's really fascinating about this radio lab podcast where they talk about how these Russian troll farms literally set up protests they hired people to pretend to be Donald Trump and they hired people to pretend to be Hillary and put her in a cage and have people chant la cour up like this is all the manufactured dissent and manufactured outrage that they're they're strategically promoting that's that fascinating to me but here you got a thing pause for a second you guys think Russia is weed you're talking about a giant place okay so to pretend that what's happening with these people hacking into DVRs and web cameras is all that's happening no this is so not what you're saying what you're do that you witnessed a small example of what happens when people are exploiting vulnerabilities and systems but that doesn't mean that's the only thing that's going on no I'm not saying that at all no you're not but I want to clarify it there's a lot of things that are going on there's a lot of things that are going on because people are dealing with these new technology what do you these gives us tears like when were you a well with the the Russian hacking election thing like and I don't like to get political because that really fuck you don't have to be political look at it objectively look at like a system like look look at it like this look at it lucky of a body okay and your body has an immune system right and your body's immune system is constantly under threat of all sorts of different things you you fucking touch a doorknob you wipe your nose there's a lot of shit going on right now this is very similar if you just looked at it objectively to what happens whenever you have a server on the Internet when you hear about the Republican Party getting hacked into or you know different people's emails getting exploited by you know someone from outside that's a hacker what is that well that's they're trying to find a way through the system it's just natural thing if you put up a wall people go home how do I get past that wall you know if you make thirty four thousand dollars a year and a guy makes a million dollars uh what does that guy know there's a natural thing yeah that's but how is this any different like well I guess when I'm trying to ask about this it's like when I was watching that happen with my system it's like how is this any different than what has gone on for the last hundred years because it comes okay because it's new because no one has been able to know it's new no one has been able to get into your folders before no one's been able to get know no one kid sitting in Czechoslovakia who has a computer has been able to figure out how to turn your webcam on and watch your beat off this is a new thing but we didn't have a webcam to beat off it doesn't matter for but you understand what I'm saying yes a new thing this is a new thing so because I feel like for some reason it is imagine thing it is human nature but I don't understand what your point is well I guess what I'm asking here is is is in in the way of the I just feel like the Russian bot thing is was all of that I feel like the Russian BOTS is is a is a term for people who don't understand computers in a way and they've they've just kind of thrown that out there as a political device sometimes I think I think that Russia China Korea like every other fucking country that is enabled in a way in which they're so far ahead technologically was involved in all kinds of fucking fuckery and they're still involved and we'll still do that during the election it was fucking a hundred times for sure but you know I'm just I just it's hard for me with you know back circling around to the Alex Jones thing all of this new technology all of the the people who are awake woke Facebook you wake they know your name yeah you're woke on face I'm so weak you know it's like I felt bad for fucking childish gambino they had a song that had stay woke in it because immediately that's not that that was what an amazing song and and it was it was that that term became dumb immediately but but I just feel like all of this that's happening all of this talk all of the him getting banned all this stuff it's all this kind of like effect of the world instead of being out in the world everyone has has gone to this point where it's you know these groups these really rich cribs Google and Facebook and Twitter and all this and everyone has has gone to this central point and other lynching people whether or not you agree with actions whether or not you like him whether or not I think there's being lost right there a lot right there so I get I get that there's all these people that are doing all these different nefarious things this has been going on for ever and now they're using new systems to do that they're using the internet and all these open pipes and these connections they can make to is that the public is there they've gotten them to go to this one arena that is my problem with it is it's like it's much of a nerd and a technology person I am I like I hate that people have instead of really I mean I mean I'm sure they have their own lives but like the fact that we have become so centralized to these small groups of Internet companies like social media and things and then now look it's on both sides man I mean Alex Jones getting Lynch a harvey weinstein whatever I know he's very different things but everyone that's a very very very very very different not defending him [Music] the connection is those connections people are just attacking in defining the minute it look those people could have suits against Harvey once then Steen we can know about it of course we knew about it because the Wall Street Journal or what whoever our New York Times you were in that thing well in New Yorker mmm yeah you guys The New Yorker yeah but my point is leave me alone you know I mean I I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion but I just feel like that the centralization of society into social media is resulting in a lot of things that are very ugly and I think that the Russian bot thing the Chinese hackers thing the alex jones issue the me to movement all that stuff which i'm behind all the people that that were hurt I'm not I'm behind the Sandy hooks people I'm behind the people who had the bad experiences Hollywood all that so what are you proposing what do you say I'm just saying that I think that that it's unhealthy I think the social media thing has become too centralized their needs centralized decentralized houses centralize because there's only groups like Facebook and litter their Instagram I mean it's 100% centralized I mean it's owned by a group it's several groups it's several you know everyone's kind of going to McDonald's to have these conversations as opposed to it being something that is a little more healthy I just find I just think that that people I think Alex Jones should have always been able to be crazy in his world and and he was always nice to me and you like you said he's your friend like like you know what's the problem of the Alex's he needs someone sitting right next to him someone like me someone who when he talks and he says some crazy go wait a minute how do you know that and he was well we have the documents we're showing the documents well the documents don't say that well you know the problem is jela they are definitely trying to influence and you go yeah they probably are but if you leave him alone if you leave him alone and just let him rant by the way he's doing six hours eight hours of radio a fucking day and he's definitely likes to drink so he's doing six hours of radio a day at least three of them are drunk and he's fucking filling time and screaming and no one can say anything to him and he's the fucking man over there that's also part of the problem he's got a bunch of these other people that around him all the time and their conspiracy theorists as well but they're 28 you know and then you know they're hanging out with alex jones and it's rants and no one interrupts um yeah it's a broad argument with all of it because I agree but he was always he was always transmitting he was always like hey show me where the Satanists are going to worship took place John that's fine but I get I think what happened is now the idea is that he's influencing people politically like the whole you know the whole Podesta pizza gate that all that stuff was scared the shit out of people and that guy showed up at that pizza place and fire off around and you know and then they want up arrested him and they really thought there was a dungeon in the basement again kids centralizing in social media is the cause for a lot of these reality is that centralizing in social media or is that people exciting people to go and take action against something that may or may not even be real if you are you allowed to yell out fire in a crowded theater right this is ultimately the problem right it's not whether or not he believes in Bohemian Grove which is real and proved it on video back when they had VHS tapes and I watched it I mean I've known Alex since 99 or 98 I think maybe I've known for a long-ass time and this is a very big difference between then and what's happening now as far as the reach and influence and I think people are sort of panicking about reaching influence and what it means and how to mitigate it how to change people how to stop people from going into pizza places and shooting them up because they think that's something that they heard online is true there's a lot of stuff that people hear online that isn't just not true you know the lizards underground or the right and earth land flat there's a lot of stuff that's just nonsense so it's it's hard to separate here's what I think I think we are going through an adolescent stage as as a being as an evolving being and I think our bodies and our minds and our consciousness are becoming synchronised with technology and along the way like right now we are in this chaotic screaming sweating crying pissing shitting state of chaos and we are looking to figure out how to stop the bleeding we're looking to shove thumbs into dykes dykes meaning like dams and we are looking to try to figure out a way to stop the bleeding we're trying to put patches and band-aids on things we're trying to manage the chaos we're trying to figure out what and this is a stage that we're going through because this is a new thing this is a new thing for human beings the ability to communicate widespread over millions and millions of people instantaneously is a new thing so people have say that never had say before they have influence and never had influence before they have their ability to contribute and they might not have thought these things through and these things catch fire and they run through dry forests like a goddamn tornado of flames that you see on CNN when the Mendocino fire up in Northern California this is this is what happens with ideas because there's no way to contain them and they don't know what's right or what's wrong I think that what we're going through from the period of 1994 the peer of 2018 is like a crazy fire in the middle of a hurricane it's like everything is nuts and no one knows how to stop it and no one knows what to do and what do we do we get together in shelters and we fucking give people water and we try to stop the fire and take away everyone's lighters and that's what we're doing right now we're trying to take away lighters we're trying to stop people who start fires and this is what's happening with Alex and it's it's not that alex is a bad guy is that he has he's by himself you're okay it's irresponsible to say that you know for sure a fact that these parents from Sandy Hook or crisis actors and their kids never died it's irresponsible and he didn't think he was he responsible when he was doing it because he's probably caught up in what he does and he's caught up in the wave of ad-libbing just like you and I are ad-libbing we didn't even talk about what the fuck we're gonna talk about right we just turned on and we had a couple that's very right you're what you're saying there is very red I don't mean to cut you off it's okay but but what you're saying there is very smart because to me you know it's your right he has always been doing this in a just one time his reach has grown right he's now there's a wind behind him right he used to be you know in Seattle it was raining every day and he had a little patch of dry newspaper like that shit on fire and everybody go Alex is crazy yeah no I agree I think I think I think what I'm trying to articulate and I'm not doing as well as I wanted to but I think what my problem is is the synchronization of consciousness is what I'm not into I think that I think you know just like you have a rut of people who believe that you know now believe that the Sandy Hook thing is fake and they're calling the families because of this conversation this is where that lawsuit is really coming yeah because the other people but then you also have another side of it and it could be as such you know back in the day when they said that Paul McCartney was dead but and they got harassed but it was on such a small level because there was no way to just email Paul McCartney and Sarah email and say you're not the real part McCartney you're fucking dead not just that occur there was no way to exchange these ideas among among constantly so you real-time on Facebook all day long which is the centralization that creates these rivers and in these ruts that people who don't know what to do and they fall into one rut or another kind of become this this this kind of streamline thing so I think the way you just describe it is is very articulate this is a new thing man it's a new thing when we we are in a really exciting time but I say that because they used to say that about the printing press they used to worry about that with the written word they used to worry about that with everything the distribution of information is not it's not whether or not it's healthy it's just a part of what the this being does with this being does is constantly search for innovation and novelty that's what that's what the human being does but like the I guess right I guess yes but what's letting your phone over there man you got a fucking iPhone don't you think you could go to the people making iPhones and go hey bro we're good yeah this is it this is stop right there it's not we're not good these motherfuckers are ready to come out with the iPhone 11 they'd like they're not gonna stop the guy who's been at the web was been in hyperlinks and the idea was that if someone was your heart dude this is just oh I'm in I'm in so like the guy invented the web gore motherfucker right that's funny you think he lies so this chat this cat all he wanted to do was make it basically we're like medical documents where you would where you would say like you know this guy had a brain transplant and then brain transplant will be underlined and you clicked on that and it would take you to a link that explained brain transplants and that would be worldwide so the Internet is decentralized and the web is decentralized to some degree okay now Google coming in with search engines like that's focusing points what scares me is those people being like Facebook being the Avenue in which ever be talks like I scare you is that weed I just handed you holy shit I took two hits and I'm not even here anymore yeah I am very high that's a blunt that's legit I took two hits I like the luminaries I'm gonna fuck around here in California son but you know what I mean like I just have a problem with the centralization of the company zoning i avenues in which I'm right I'm right with you on that I think we need more youtubes I think we need more venues for people to distribute it distribute information but I also think we need more love and this isn't this is more compassion there's so much hate and anger towards each other I mean I feel like I'm gonna get arc nailed here on this because I'm not I am NOT well it's part of the nervousness about doing a live show right yeah but for your time then I would say this well I mean I'm not very nervous I have a half a fucking drink but I would say that yes tobacco tobacco and and some shit that was growing on Mars you know Armstrong grew this weed man see I again again it was just like there was a point where you trying to make sense right now this is part of the problem right I knows what I wanted us together and we're getting we're getting super serious about topics that are very that mean a lot to people and and we don't really know enough about right I I just I just feel like I just wish that there weren't like again I just I feel like there's ruts that half people have to fall in to communicate and then there's are ruts that are owned by these companies that that are very fucking rich and well here's the thing to these companies didn't see this coming like I'm libertarian I'm not either way and just in the sense I'm not really that I don't even fucking know what that is all I know is I don't believe in trusting anybody who who says hey I'll take care of you come this way just don't worry about a thing and they're the ones making all the money and it's like that's how the Internet has become it used to be a Wild West of information emails are fucking information that is that's me communicating with you and no one else seeing it that's beautiful and I think the idea of Twitter and Facebook and all that it's fantastic when it first started but at this point in time it's gotten so big if it doesn't break up into something where people figure out that they are in control the internet not these other people that's what it bothers me okay so what bothers you is that someone comes along says the people aren't in control the internet so it's not like a free market so it was a free market it's a free market a guy like alex jones you say this guy's preposterous I'm not listening to him anymore when it's not a free market is when YouTube collab I don't know if they collaborate if they just old news I don't know if they all agree but they just all decide everyone's gonna take them off Facebook's gonna suspend them for 30 days Twitter's gonna suspend it for a period of time YouTube's gonna remove them all these people are gonna take Vimeo jumped on ship and they pulled them off too so this this becomes an issue like what is it that causes you to get removed what is it and should we be really clear on that or is this just a whim because this is a really important thing if we really are fuckin with free speech we have to be very careful on what we decide is is a valid reason to pull people off of our Airways because if you have stuff on your Airways that's far more vile and you let that stay up because it doesn't have the same reach like what is your criteria it doesn't have the same influence it doesn't have the same political ties to it like what is the reason why you're pulling one thing off and not another thing is it because of a popularity issue have you searched your trillions of fucking hours of footage for offensive speech content ideas disinformation what have you what have you really done to mitigate this issue or are you acting on this because it's a social hotspot issue right now which it most certainly is and most certainly should be I really think that Alex needs a guy right next to him he really like Alex and I did a show about Howard Stern man no not the same comparison as Howard's but this is a man let's do them every day sometimes I want to be like dude are you kidding me that's also part of his charm partners charm as she creates dissent and arguments and you want to get mad and you want to either he's opinionated well but Howard Stern's very responsible he's a different guy it's not it's not the same thing I'm not trying to compare Alex to him I'm just saying that sometimes I feel the same way about about him and people feel that way about us right now oh yeah people this is quit cutting fucking Giorgio Moroder trip records into a country record you know and I do a country record right now and they're like that's kind of corny no no I got a record coming by the way I'm sure you do dude I told you I wake up the triskaidekaphobia every morning of the e that's the Stephen King watch I will I'm gonna fucking set it so people know I'm not bullshitting I'm gonna set my alarm what time is it right now it's 2:05 I'm gonna send 205 205 perfect you know I also just just along with what you're saying is it's like you know no it is 205 done it is it has to be free all the whole thing oh your cathode ray light things bullshit oh it just turned 206 come on bitch why are you going hmm try it stinks I'm sorry let's go with 208 p.m. that's fact there you go a little buffer no I just feel like you know and I know we're not we're not qualified to have this conversation but no one is yeah it's just as long as we're honest about how we feel about things look I just go along you guys are off I believe I believe in protecting children's and a sense in a certain way that I agree with YouTube not allowing porn and stuff like that you know because like my kid right look at YouTube all the time but what about Twitter Twitter allows a certain amount of porn no sometimes I'm flipping through my phone down I go yo Kendra la slow it down yeah he's call out yeah I mean you know it may as well have it like I believe if Isis if Alex Jones and if the unboxing of the lol's can exist what does that mean like it wasn't my daughter these toys lol shop that were they they show videos of them are the slime videos of do like YouTube and those kind of things I just think that there is a certain level of like just ignore it if you don't like it well it's not your thing the lawsuit thing totally that's out of this contact there's a big difference between something that you might find gross and something that changes culture so I think what they're worried about is do you mind when Jim Acosta did that he went to that Trump rally and they went crazy on him do you remember that shit I don't know there's a recent thing couple weeks ago he's a CNN anchor who is reasonably self righteous but he's in a difficult situation he has to challenge the President of the United States who is also a famous celebrity billionaire guy was his name on buildings I mean this literally is rosebud this is this is the tale of Citizen Kane I mean this is someone with ungodly power and influence and this Jim I'm not standing up for Jim Acosta I'm just gonna say just put yourself in that guy's position what a crazy spot you're yelling out questions at the president knighted States who also happens to be Donald Trump you think like you're on acid you should the world the world has gone into a vortex of crazy and you're the guy by some fucking freak of chance whether you're Jim Acosta or Don Lemon or or fill in the blank everyone if you're one of those fucking people hold it was the weed thought oh shit I gotta go if you're one of those fucking people and that's your job and we expect them to handle that that's probably like being Beyonce and the rock on steroids in a negative way it wouldn't be those two because those are like very beloved celebrities like very few people are as beloved as the rock or Beyonce they're pretty much universally beloved person uniquely so they're so loved and so deserving of that love but if you're a guy like who's a real net like Takashi six nine that kid like you imagine the hate that guy gets all day now imagine what is that he said six he's a rapper listen brother every morning I wake up see I've read this I hope this doesn't get us pulled off at YouTube Alex we've got a little thing on the air shoot it Jenny bitch recognize oh you brought an album oh we are delivered we can plant on foot oh that's yours Oh beautiful [Music] dude you got some badass fucking music ah thanks you really do I love your music and you know one of the things I love about your music it's like it's all different man you got some straight-up country put the Oh back in country you gotta let you've got that at that whole album man it's like a badass country album you know but like with this twist like a respectful country album that also has a lot of like modern wickedness to it I know I appreciate that was the point like when we were like we were doing the first record it was me and Ted Russell camp who still plays with me and Leroy Powell who doesn't play with me anymore but he played on that record he played guitar Brian Keeling was a drummer we started doing our shit like our idea was we were living here you know I just I 2003 we started recording the first ring and I admitted three years ago and we were like our whole thing was like we like rock music because it sounds cool and we like Dylan and we like you know even I wasn't even smart enough to like Dylan then we were like into fucking you know Bowie and I was I can't came from the nine snails side kidney that's how I got into music we kind of talked about that near the show but like by that time the idea was like can we make country music we like the old stuff but have it sound cool and why can't we bring in like the stuff that rot that's cool about rock and why can't you go psychedelic and why can't you kind of push the limits that way and we were just dumb and trying to do it that way and Dave Cobb who produced this record we met - we met back then and he produced the first record and he was the same way we were like more Beatles stones Bowie kids musically in the amount records we listen to and you know obsessed over Pink Floyd and stuff you know then we were a country so we were kind of trying to blend those two back then I you know but we were just just trying and starting and doing weird shit and and then after a while just evolving my next album was totally different like you don't give a fuck dude it's about you like a guy who invested in Apple in the 80s you just do you just do your music man you do your music and whatever you're into right now is like what you do it's really interesting like I appreciate I mean I've listened to I've listened to every one of your CDs and there's only a few of them that are even similar you know similar to each other they're all there are all your albums I guess you can say albums again nice to me because it became CD for a while but who the fuck gets to see me oh man and then it's like I can't say online playlist you newest online playlist like what do I say about your newest albums are playlist man it's like newest audio release yeah man no you know I what's black ribbons happen man I did the first record and that was kind of my take on country and our take as a band and Dave Cobb and then but before that record came out we started recording the second record and I was like the first song I wrote was a song electric rodeo and we and I was like I wanted to go heavy I wanted to like just really show up and and like do this kind of hard rocky sounding and what I mean by that is like you know fucking we're in a Zeppelin and shit we were like 90s music it was like you know 70 shit but it was like hard rock crazy effects and I saw kind of going crazy but with the song the country songs there and I always felt if electric rodeo got considered a country record when it came out and charted then I felt we like we had done our thing but it did come out and it did chart but once we came out with that we had Universal who had been behind us and they had basically been the the people that were to Universal had been kind of in my opinion in their opinion duped because Tony Brown Tim Dubois who believed in me and we had done this record without a deal and I sent it to Tony Brown because I knew I just as a kid had met him and him and my dad had done business and I liked him and there was he had made me feel like he liked me so I sent him this record after being the ban and Dave did the record and they believed in me and they signed it and he kind of like remixed our first song so they would play it on radio and Tony was a big producer still is I mean he produced like the first bunch Steve Earle records and he played piano for Elvis like he and he was our label ad so we kind of remixed it so again our radio so I'm thinking they like me because we have like kind of a 20 number 20 for it so I'm like I'm gonna hit it with some good shit now and then I hit him with what I thought was a good shit and they said this is not what we signed up for we are out you're out and I never got playing a radio again so you know that's on them dude I know it's the reason why your music is so in mean I like I like a lot of great music and your music is great but it's also that you you're clearly coming at this from an artists perspective you're not a marketing genius by any stretch of the imagination your dad's fucking Waylon Jennings dude I mean you have the inn of all ends you know what your dad is like a super legend you know I mean he's a super super legend but you choose to legitimately carve your own path in this the wildest aways it's really interesting how you do that and I think that thoughtfulness that allows you to be free like that is also what allows you to explore these like complex issues like censorship or Bitcoin or any of these things that are like whoa this is like this is some heavy stuff like you've you're you're you have a you're of a curious approach to these things and in an ability to express who you really are right which is like what comes out in your music it's not like your image you're just doing what you really feel when you're writing it I think that's that's a big part of of community that's a big part of being a person like let some person uniquely be themselves and I think there's this is one of the real issue with social media as if people are so terrified of expressing themselves because they're terrified of the hate they get back but then they get addicted to attacking other people that are failing or other people that are making mistakes and that I get I think this again goes with this whole fucking chaos thing that we're talking about before I mean I think we're in the middle of a storm right now yeah and I think that your your take on Alex Jones and Bill Maher's take on Alex Jones and what we're saying here about them it doesn't it like it doesn't in any way negate arguments that you shouldn't say some of the things he's saying we agree with you but we also say human beings we have to figure this out together and if you start conflict and one great way to start conflict is to ban and to take people down hope you'll call people in Nazi that aren't really in Nazi like decide that someone's an all right white supremacist when they're really not at all they're a liberal and a Democrat and you know they are you're saying crazy things because you're trying to demonize people and slot them into groups we have to reject that with every fiber of our being because this is tyranny this is a type of group tyranny that although it's not connected to a network like the fucking you know the KKK or the Democrats or the Republicans it's still this chaotic groupthink thing that happens when we decided to go after people and stop being compassionate stop being just a human being who recognizes that other human beings are flawed and they make mistakes they do stupid shit but as soon as you oppose them so vehemently for something that really should be treated with curiosity and compassion and maybe a little bit of understanding and mockery instead of that there's this anger and this vitriol that we just have to put a curb on shitty thinking I agree it's kind of like New Roman Colosseum social media it is in a way but it's also it's lighting the court hearing it on the court of public discourse is massive now it just opened up a gate it was a little trickle it was like that fucking Border Patrol station in Mexico it's hard to get in the country bro if you want to be that guy who risked his life in the middle of August and take your family through the fucking desert with a couple of jugs of water and you're gonna walk and hope you find a job you know that's what he used to be like this is like as the walls came down and they changed the law and everybody said go ahead in and everybody's in ah and in and down to people going down to up and down just open it up that's getting crazy see this is what everybody's afraid of and this is what this is what's happening right now with information this is what's happening for the very first time ever between this period of you know 1994 and 2018 it's been this inevitable change in the way people are able to express information and who gets to express information you know they'll question the legitimacy of someone who becomes famous through the internet but not famous through NBC he made it he's on NBC meanwhile this guy is just talking to his webcam he has 30 times as many people paying attention to him why is he wrong why is he incorrect because he didn't go through your established channels that have existed with who is your gatekeepers oh guys like Harvey Weinstein were your gate keepers bitch get the fuck out of here you don't get to dictate what's interesting or what's creative or what sounds good what kind of music people like it used to be that if you like rock you didn't like country when I was a kid you were a loser if you like kiss right dude you you like you would get like categorize I had to hide some music that I liked and kiss was one of them I I took I took Paul Stanley didn't seem to appreciate that I told gene Simmons once too I was like dude I'm sorry but it was true I was loyal back when it was uncool to like kiss and then it turned around and became Super Lawyer Eddie Bravo has the same story we both were like embarrassed to be kiss fans but meanwhile now I fucking love kiss yeah I love kiss but I you know I also I also love Willie Nelson right you know I love listening to all kinds of different shit you don't it doesn't kind of mutually exclusive like for me I didn't I grew up with my dad that country came along like one time I started living life and I started appreciating the songs you know I mean look like when you start actually kind of understanding the words and all that and like you it just it hits you you know like oh shit this this shit is like the heavy shit yeah it's like there's some deep deep fucking emotions to country songs I mean Johnny Cash just his lyrics alone like some of his song are fucking phenomenal man yeah they're phenomenal yeah no you know what one always blows me away on cash is the man in black still to this game the lines like you know the what is it the thousands that died thinking that the Lord were on their side and there's the hundreds if there are tens of thousands that died thinking that we were all on their side like that verse and everything I was looking at I forgot to look it up hey would you mind looking up who wrote the man in black sorry to ask you that but I've been dying to know that because I wanted to know if shel silverstein was involved or it was just Johnny Cash I wrote it but that's such a beautiful song dude how about well false president blues all right of course that's nasty but how about God's gonna cut you down oh that's Misty's favorite good lord that's a song I love that song that's a song they like chills you to your bones yeah because he was an old old man you like that oh my god is that right the big guy yeah yeah Jesus Christ that's good that one in the man comes around those two were really smokin and even like a boy nurses year oh yeah predict that shel silverstein that's what I was wondering yeah shell wrote that shells like the forgot he's the guy that brought like the New York sense of humor and and really cultured writing style like the kind of Hunter has Thompson world he's the link between that and country music for sure chef so this Dean I got to be around him a couple times when I was young he wrote it he though casually the signature song man in black he's playing it that's cuz social conscience behind his wardrobe choices just so were reminded of the ones who are held back in fact he took two black simply because it was easier to keep clean on long tours yeah look at that early in his career fellow acts teased him about it calling him the Undertaker oh shit he was the Undertaker for the Undertaker yeah these lyrics could really I mean they're this time right now they're so seriously he was a monster man trying to catch the monster yeah he was cool as fuck he's a monster he just had this energy about him yeah there are xevious that's uh it's a likes doctor stevia flavored beverage so it doesn't have any calories it's guilt free guilt free mouth pleasure mouth pleasure yeah man he had a he had songs that were there's so many of them that were just if you think about the time that he was writing him and to come up to this unseen and illness and all that that was a weird thing he came to Memphis yeah he was a beast man no question and seemed like he kind of died on his own terms died like a man he died after June died it was like right after June 9 it was also the way he was handling it too you know yeah wouldn't do that Nine Inch Nails song yeah hurt yeah yeah it was awesome that was intense intense how washrooms the first time I saw that video I was in my room here in LA and in the star gun house that was the pink house over by the Tomcat Theater on Santa Monica Boulevard you know I'm talking about and know Harris nude the place we can go in there uh heard you where's it at pictures of women it's a Santa Monica and Gardner okay anyway this little pink house we had over there and I was watching that video on mushrooms and I was like fucking goddamn like you find it when did you when did Johnny die I think 2005 was late no it was like three I wasn't I was living in this apartment on Beverly by the Beverly Center and it was like I remember that when that happened se3 Jaime yeah I saw him there I I got to be around him a lot when I was on the road when I was like the first highwayman record came out I was six five and we all went on the road and so like Willie's daughters Amy and Paula were out no actually maybe they were out I think there are the Christopherson they had the Christopherson said their family and then we went again for high women too but the one we were like five-year-olds I wish we could play music on this show I'll play that highwayman song I fuckin love when Johnny went that man I fly a starship I flew across the divide yeah and when I reached the other side man man that was that was a great fucking album it was a great song have those guys all together yeah I was cool man Purdue yeah it was phenomenal shit I fly a starship that's Jimmy Webb wrote that who wrote you know by the time I get to Phoenix Galveston he wrote MacArthur Park but he wrote all that motherfucker of a songwriter and that song about reincarnation it's like his original song is about one person who lived through these different lives and then the end yeah that's simple drop Iranian starship and there's a highwayman rock it's amazing that's what we're scared of we're scared of being a single drop of rain again I'm scared it'd be so much fun I don't know dude I'm having a good time I know but we just I thought you were sure absolutely and on the next forever how about that how about for billions of years how about you go back to being a single-celled organism you start from scratch go through evolution you're like no way so you did it it doesn't matter what matters is the moment and that's a impossible concept to grasp for people who collect stamps shit you're holing up in your house because you're trying to put like some sort of rigidity to this if a cereal world that we live in you're trying to put some structure to this never gets to enjoy it yeah and I think that's part of the point earlier too is it's just like man everybody it gets wrapped up you said you were talking about when you were just afterwards but you were talking about everybody get sucked up into all these different you know fucking yeah confrontations yeah all the time and it's like and it takes all of your attention like I think they're Jews I really do aren't listened to like they used to be because we used to have so much time man used to say and that's all you had and now there's this constant focus yeah it's like there's a way and I think the only answer is there's gonna have to be some established decentralization of the internet that returns it to the form in which all can exist digitally as they do physically just like we do now and we're gonna have to figure it out as I think that's coming dude I don't think anyone's going to be able to stop it one of the things that's interesting is the people at the very top of the heap we always thought were the proponents of free speech we we always thought that the the repressive people were the right-wing conservative people they wanted to stop progress and stop nudity and people smoking pot and you know and Tipper Gore wants to ban rap music remember on that that's what he always thought the Ashleigh Tipper Gore was doing that's a very bad analogy tipper gore was Al Gore's wife the tipper gore put this but she had to speak she had the sticker stickers yeah explicit lyrics some fucking old-school eistein blew her wig but we always that's a bad example because she was a democratic sample but it is an example of like forget about Democrats or Republicans it's basically people in power trying to control other folks yeah this has been going on forever right it's just what people do but we always thought of it as being the conservative ones that were like the most the the most into suppression of free speech you know stop you know he's swearing stop the nudity stop the pornography it was always thought of as being a conservative thing but I would argue like today it's almost like your behavior is more restricted on the left than it is even on the right the right is seem to be more relaxed in terms of like what they're willing to let people do but the left it's like putting up all these boundaries for like what people can and can't say doing don't do like Tom sent me this Tom Segura sent me this photograph of some sort of a sketch comedy group where they were trying to figure out what you can and can't do today and like what what is okay to do in a sketch and it was a lot of it was about gay people and trans people and can you be a what a straight sis man playing a trans person all caps absolutely not can you be a sis purse or can you be a trans person playing a syst person yes all caps you could do whatever you want if you're a trans person right who's a woman you can play a man and that's totally cool but if you're Shooter Jennings and you go you know what man I just think it would be cool to do a movie where I play a check no chance buddy you're not allowed to make believe in that way you can't make believe in a certain way they're basically saying your thoughts are not allowed to go down these roads there's no way you could manage this respectfully and with with enough who's 82 the people who are crazy but this is my point these people exist like and they're on the left now they're like super inclusive you know super worried about diversity super worried about you know people of color and there's all these like gaint weird words you know they're throwing around game words I wish George Carlin was alive he would say what's similar to what you're saying what I'm saying things but probably better he would just tell he'd be so yeah I just want to know I just would die to know what do you think this is I mean to fucking to use the title of my tour these are strange times yeah legitimately strange times for them we've ever experienced before as a human race I think yeah oh I think so I think we're on the beginning of it that's the fucked up things I think that like the the chain the Internet is the thing the linchpin to change society in such a way like you said the adolescent phase is the storm do animation it's a goddamn hailstorm you ever seen those hail storms when they hit those Ohio backyards and fuck up the pool and other legends got screaming and you're hearing the house like it's getting attacked by rocks that's what it is it's one of those hail storms of information you know yeah man there's never been anything like it yes good that's good but we just got to be nice to each other we're all together in this thing together that's the thing too man people are nice other people ain't nice back this is the thing we've got to realize that if you're nice other people would be nice too we got to be nice to each other and that includes online you know and and then we got to be nice about all the other things in the world there's just so much that has to be thought of someone has to be so much that has to be thought of not with this idea that you're gonna live forever because a lot of like the way we behave is almost like we think we're gonna live forever instead of having this short trip where you should just like kind of be like is friendly with people's pot and with this at all also something that should be projected right I should projected you should project it we should all get that idea out so that we all agree like yeah yeah yeah it's just fucking we could do this like even competition it doesn't have to be that kind of conflict even if you're you know neighboring businesses you can be friends and everybody will do well together there's a lot of people man this is not a time if we have to control everything and everyone and nor should you want to it's like a big giant summer camp life is just way up your piece of it that's a good way to strap in we're gonna have their own summer camp that's gonna happen you know are on their way at the beginning of yeah these counselors ain't controlling shit people are finger bang a bunch of 14 year-olds run around the for every four years fuck every four years the head counselor changes some guy it's like last time I was like oh we love that kind this guy's like no nobody from the other neighboring camps are coming in you're okay we vaguely knew when I was in Boy Scouts we vaguely knew that there was a potential that one of these camp counselors might molest you like people knew you don't know whatever no one ever did but there was that thought when we were like I guess I was 13 or something town when I was in the Boy Scouts there was that thought like hey man this could go fucking sideways anytime we're in the woods with some dudes they want to be in the woods with kids like how well did they vet these people look at this right me that yeah are these people like legit Boy Scout you know instructors or whatever they would be who really want to show everybody the way the woods yes most likely there it's amazing amazing experience for young men but just as human beings anytime you get human beings anytime you get a certain group of human beings and you leave them alone large groups of kids yo you gotta be super careful with what their motives are and how they handle pressure and how they deal with conflict and how they deal with sex you know like what do you you know you ever molested tell me when you were molested what happened right so weird issues when you're talking about dealing with children dealing with the youngest ones are eight and ten yeah see mine seventy-two yeah man it's just it's a weird time when you're watching little human beings evolve and develop and you know let it go too you know yeah for me and I know for but would the analogy you just had was perfect it is really like summer camp yeah but it's funny how it like you know from the the day you're born the day after somebody else's summer camp starts that it kind of kind of generationally goes on forever and you kind of like realize that you're stuck in this like movie yeah in which that you have to try and do the best you know like for me it's like do the best with like your family yeah people you love and then like have the most fun and do like do the most damage in a good way like by the way all these people out there the summer camp counselors that are mad at me right now there's no I'm not saying is the vast majority of you are awesome we're just talking about just in general human beings is the sheer numbers of human beings if you get a certain number of people there's a certain percentage of those people that are gonna be a problem you know this is the problem with cops it's not it's not that cops are bad people so when you say fuck cops you're crazy you're gonna need cops okay if something goes wrong at four o'clock in the morning you want the man who has the courage to stand there with a bulletproof vest and shoot at the bad guys it's the it's the you know Sam Sam what's his name from three billboards you know it was such a good role you know tell me that movie three um I did Sam whose damn God he's so great he the actors did not see this guy from the Galea Oh Sam L you know we love knots a million good one oh sorry to you no trades he was in Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy it was a great movie called Joshua mm he was he fought Beeblebrox or whatever and what is it Jim three billboards Sam well he's that role is amazing and he the moon oh yeah no his kid did if he met Bowie's kid no yeah the Duncan Jones I've never met him but he's he's awesome that movie was awesome is that what it's called the moon just just moon yeah that was great I met him because he was dating leslie bibb yeah they're amazing yeah they're married now they were eating back then when I worked with her in a movie I did Kevin James movie zookeeper with her I was her ex-boyfriend who's a douchebag movie she's super cool man you want to talk about someone that's funny that girl that makes sense she's super fucking cool really smart too yeah well there and now that was the thing that really got to me like a dude that movie it's fucking amazing that movie moon it is so a movie this is this is how unusual this movie is there are no other actors I know yeah Sam Brown go through the whole movie and it's a Martian and didn't didn't Martian feel so emotions and feel like kind of like a diet moon when you saw it well I felt that way I didn't because it was different because it was more about the the hazards of colonization and without this thing anything away with this movie I can't give anything away because it's this movie's a mindfuck at the end it's my fuck the whole way it's a mind fuck but Martian I thought the Martian was diamond maybe I thought it was just another well listen man there's nothing wrong with like doing a take on colonizing another planet we have to be real careful about that it was a book and everybody just for me in mine my eight-year-old may be going seeing in person I was like man it's it's good but it wouldn't like moon I know there's a problem with people are scared to do those fucking space movies do some more goddamn space movies you know what I want to the plane over here i watch alien covenant again loved it five times I'm actually every plane flight I take I already have them downloaded on this fucking iPhone and I watch Prometheus and that back and forth you should go to jail it was not alien covenant I know but you know what I got it it's there I don't have to have the internet right and I have to pay for it if it's on thing I'll watch it but like you ever use that Apple TV we stream of the phone that's the brunt of work what a lot of work takes two swipes I know I know I but look I feel like that alien covenant was such a fucking zone good and I can and they they like canceled or something I heard that he was had another one alien awakening which is was the deal with the time before / after Prometheus and into alien came supposed to be the ship ride or whatever and I'm like in that day we're gonna shut it down they're crazy here's what happens man when you get to a certain level of money when you're investing in those kind of films threshold yeah there's a threshold and though because they're so expensive to make there's so much CGI and so much chaos and special effects and an alien covenant had a great fucking plot to I mean everything was great that there's so many choices and turns and that the aliens were terrifying they explained them I mean there was so much to it it was read a fucking good the finger problem is Prometheus for a lot of people was less than than what they wanted that's all it wasn't there was a bad movie I really liked it I thought it was fantastic some shit up and it didn't do that well and we're spending I don't know how about the fuck they spent on those movies but they're super super expensive it's at one of them I mean aliens to is James Cameron's like Blade Runner level shit in my opinion in the sense where like at first it doesn't seem like it's a massive yeah thing but it's just like for life it's that Prometheus is fantastic in the question that it opens and the second piece where I got a shout out to Blake Judd cuz he said hey man you're gonna see it but you're gonna leave and you're gonna be mad cuz you can have way more questions and before and then I told the same thing to Sturgill he was like I'm about to go see covenant I was like dude you're gonna be mad I wasn't mad oh no I'm just saying cuz I want to see the next one I want to know more you still don't know the engineer thing they seated that was just one of their planets like our planet and they seeded and they went there so you're like the next one should are or at least like the finishing story they said they want to make a world or the world's kind of thing where it was like all of a sudden these people descend and it's the two opposing kind of parties which is the David side and then maybe us ascending on to the engineers planet like finally and it's all of a sudden these two a buzzing fortunes you know so like I think that's brilliant writing it's fucking Fanta well what you got to realize is that movie the original alien goes back to 1979 Sigourney Weaver when she was as hot as the surface of the Sun they got that she was running she's the original feminist superhero Sigourney Weaver is mocking original badass woman in movies fucking up monsters she's the original all these are the movies that came afterwards the weather they're fun you love them resident evil type shit or who's that Kate Beckinsale check was a vampire underworld all those super badass chicks in movies they all Oh Sigourney Weaver she was believable man she's a scientist a scientist or whatever the fuck her job was on that spaceship and she was the only one who lived that movie spoiler alert it's 1979 trigger a scene it yeah but in that movie they were worried about artificial intelligence that's amazing HR Giger designed all that shed this space rocky would you stop and think about they were worried about artificial intelligence back in 1979 and that's like when you talk to Elon Musk it's like one of his primary concerns no he's supposed to the podcast I was in his physical presence at the UFC but I didn't get a chance to communicate with him he was with his lady but we had been going back and forth through email so it was extra weird but I think I'm working you know when I'm doing the commentary man I'm trying to be I don't want to suck people get mad at me I try to do my best so try to focus I can't go yo either these fights are crazy bro there's no really real room for that but he's worried about artificial intelligence more than anything and I mean this you're talking about a super genius it has an electric car company a rocket ship companies drilling holes under the fucking ground he sells flamethrowers I mean get the fuck out of here this is the guy that's worried about artificial intelligence we should be paying attention and if you go back to by the way there was a article I want to say was the LA Times that compared Elan musk to Donald Trump it was like one of the most click Beatty articles they're fighting for their lives out there man these fucking journalists they're fighting for their lives good for them they've gotta get those clicks you chained man I I love guys who are crazy and ambitious and make shit like Elon Musk whatever is happening with them the fact that he's like whatever I'll figure it out later just let yourself out that's what's amazing as soon as you let it go that's how high you are I thought you were tangled you dangle no I just like guys you know what I'll talk about schedule for a minute I have to shout out at to my the block tronic screw my antsy artist I was talking about computers and BBS's and black Tronics or a fancy artists group they're great but Sturgill it's so cool to watch him come up and he's like got this kind of angle it like it makes me I just love watching him on your show and I just have to say us hanging out and everything all these years later he just has a sense where I feel like wow there was a rocket ship in this universe and we kind of speak the same language and it's like a cool vibe kind of having another dude out there who who has the same sensibilities and like when we hang out you and me and him and and everything I feel like it's you know what I mean like I know what you mean motherfucker ya know I'm honored to be his friend - yeah yeah I'm honored to be your friend - man for real I'm honored to be your friend you took me I came because he playing you took and then dave chappelle played right after you're like oh yeah hey my friend Dave's gonna do a thing and they're not killed it and then he killed it and that was crazy man but it was awesome we're all lucky to know each other like it's fun you know it's funny no cool people but Sturgill has got some new shit coming out man he shared some stuff for me sent me some some images and explained what what he's doing I can't wait to hear it it sounds fantastic I'm on fucking shooter I accidentally leaked the title of his last album accidentally he sent it to me in advance and I put it up on Instagram and I said this new Sturgill Simpson shit it's off the charts and he's like dude you fucked up no and he was laughing he thought it was funny like he just let people know something awesome early but I was listening to it in the gym and whiles listen toes in the middle of sets and I was like god damn this is good and then I just I got to Instagram this shit and they Instagram that I didn't know hey that's cool dude you did the same thing with my old record like you put a you put a picture of it up of your you just like screen grabs yeah no I'd like to do that man I was associated oh hey man I appreciate your music for real thanks I was in Italy and I was about to workout and you know how you just you know you have those iPhones without that little the cord with a button you can press the button you start playing whatever you got on your iPhone yeah it just goes right to kool Moe Dee I go to work I go to work like a boxer you know it's like it's a great like I go to work song so I'm about to workout and this fucking song comes on almost like the universe is letting you know look dude just just don't try to think this through too much just press that button the songs there I don't know why it's there you don't know why it's there either stop thinking about it but it's there right when you needed it that songs there but I go to work and then you go to work like it's weird there's a this is theatre this whole thing is theater and some sort of strange whatever can yeah there's some there's some part of life that's seriously theater right man I mean it it to me the older I get I just feel like the more appreciative for like my dumb herself for having gotten through it without more damage being done like I'm so at this I concur I'm you know like I just really appreciate everybody who puts an effort into the city into life you know I mean so you're like you feel like somebody's doing good it's like you you just I don't know it's like you in this show and how like you've had this awesome career and then I only met you the first time when I came on this show and I like smoke pot in the parking lot and I was like kind of out of it and I was like oh and I came here I didn't bring a record that's why this time I was like I had my records called shooter it's out now I have to say something I didn't talk about it all my John Hensley my manager back then he called me and said you didn't even talk about the record once and I was like shit I don't know man we just got talking and it was I mean that's how it is with you you know but I love doing that with you cuz it's like I'll go down the rabbit hole man and I think people are scared to do that yeah I think don't use anything wrong with having thoughts and I think we got to stop yelling at people gotta stop Yellin you got it yeah I think this this the anger that we expressed towards each other forces anger and return when it's not always necessary sometimes it's necessary sometimes you see Nazis in Charlottesville and you go to go hey you dumb fucks like are you out of your fucking mind you really want to categorize people by race this is 2018 you got to stop this is some stupid shit I think the positive look at all of that is the numbers of those kind of insane people have dwindled oh yeah because I remember when I was a kid and there would be like still Klan people and stuff and then which is the argument for free speech the argument for free speech is ultimately it's it'll figured out if Annapolis is out yeah and it does I think it does and it doesn't totally because let's just be completely honest some people do a terrible job raising children and these children go out into the world and they're just causing damage everywhere they go they're on fire and they're just running through dry bushes their entire life right they're creating chaos and it's from the what set them off when they were young how they evolved it to expect everyone to have like the the same starting point and be judged on your emotional behavior your your impulsiveness your your your you know dishonesty or your discipline to be judged on those as if you all started from the same spot on the board is just crazy right it's just crazy this is part of what we do we judge based on results only and when we see someone too fucked up we don't go okay what happened to this person that made them so fucking crazy right like is it really their fault or zeros a series of events that lead to you being who you are right now and maybe we should remap it maybe we should remap it and just look at it in a different way and say look we definitely don't want that result again ever right but we got to figure out why you got to that result what made you break into the bank and put a gun in someone's face I mean how did you get there that's true that's like Manson said in the Bowling for Columbine he said they said what would you say to the Columbine killers he said I would ask that I would ask him their opinion because it seems like nobody asked them they're young you know I mean so like yeah ask them what the fuck happened yeah are they both dead they're both dead right yeah they think was tough to ask them their opinion have it I mean it's like you know make a lot of fun you know how someone who broke like what made you break we've all broken in little ways in our lives sure I'll live through it and we all appreciate other people who have done the same thing and when you get to a point when you get old enough where you realize you can watch when someone is having a moment that they can't make it through that you've kind of been through in ways you gotta find it you know those are the kind of people that I like that that we'll go and talk to that person yeah and see that and I think that you're absolutely one of those kind of people because I've actually had conversations with you when we were backstage at the fucking comedy store wherever we were that night happened we had a conversation I don't quite remember the whole thing but it was about music and about listening music and it's like you're a compassionate dude and people who that's that's all it's about compassion it's about compassion and stability it's about recognizing the best times come when we're nice to each other if you go to a bar and there's a bunch of strange dudes you never met in your life and an hour later you guys are high-five and laugh and hugging each other and you're buying Browns that's a great time or you can go to a bar and someone wants to get in a dick waving competition next thing you know you got hit in the back of the head by a chair that's possible to write you know both things are possible you know what one feels way better the one that feels way better is the one where you meet a bunch of new friends and these guys who you never met before and now you're buddies and then you realize like I just ran into a fucking bunch of awesome dudes who are now some of my favorite people ever and if I didn't go out that night who knows what would have happened just randomly ran into a group of amazing people and changed the course of your whole life right that's possible two men but we got to be that friend at the bar we got to be that new friend at the bar and the more people with it's possible to do that man and I think a lot of it is just the way we think of each other there's a problem in our operating system well we have a ultra-competitive operating system and things we shouldn't be competitive in there should be then I think part of the reason is we've lost a lot of competitiveness in life I think people were competitive in life in ways where they were fighting for their survival right there fighting neighboring tribes the most brutal and primitive of days after media yeah and then as things changed and move forward that that got less and less physical and more and more mental and the body got frustrated I think this is part of what's happening along the way and then people started looking for competition in business you ever hear like weirdo business guys talk we're gonna fucking stuff their contract right up there fucking get all crazy like they're starting to warm ass you know like super hyper hyped up business guys yeah my competition has always been disparaging me with lobster it's about my past you know they get fucking so that they want to kill the competition those people are weird bad they're weird they're focusing on it the wrong way there's some some dinosaur shit yeah yeah that's that's the money thing that's like if you're in the money game yeah but you don't have to do that to be in them even in the money game you don't have to do that anymore like yeah you're right but I mean but if you do you know I mean like you can get and you love you pursue angles like you chose to pursue lots of like similar to me we're similar in this way like you chose to pursue all these little different angles of the universe that are in the entertainment business but they are also like things you love like the UFC and then then you know all the different little I mean you've had so many different little angles that you've occupied to land up here where you get to just talk about all this shit that you love yeah but - it doesn't make sense even to me I wake up in the morning look today I wake up I go and workout I'm sitting there going what am i doing I know this place shopping looking awesome it's crazy like wake up in the morning like that's the same way you have an archery thing I would have old computers in that wall and I would have like a pinball machine old arcade games I have my own tastes but like you got honestly it's it's a it you have found your path and and it's awesome and you're compassionate and you're here and you you weren't in it if you were in it for the money you'd be somewhere else you're in it for what you liked I don't even know what I'm doing I don't know what a minute you're talking for me right now morning you're gonna be a great dad and then you're gonna go do what you love to do and come home and and that's awesome I just do what the great magnet compels me to do I'm merely metal filings moving through the universe you're headed towards the great magnet metaphysical and then great magnet last time for sure I made I've decided one of the thing I've been thinking about recently especially over the last like maybe 10 years of my life I've decided way less things that I did like seems to be things just sort of happened so universe the Bob Seger thing yeah I just try to make some news yeah Mike yeah my kids excel past me already all the time just yesterday I mean they trick me and they do things and they're smarter and they're you know okay nothing I could do could impress them more than what they can do by watching what I can do and doing it better well how about when they do they fucking grab electronics they figure it out give me that you know know how to do this you got to go into settings and you're like what you're eight yeah that's what can you do this my daughter programs they log off and I'm after you can program these yeah yeah shout out to my heresy people oh yeah IRC you still yeah I'm still AM there's a do you have a ham radio in your backyard is ABC are my record label that I own with Adam there's a BCR IRC what is this VCR VCRs black country rockets the label dot without this records on Electra through LCS and Dave Cobb is label yep there we go I'm looking at the cameras that are not this place yeah it's too freaky we used to have the cameras on while we were on was too weird yeah myself I think they were on actually last time yeah it was too weird to freak Dib for the question we'd start getting high you're like what this is not right but we ever know the BCR bizarre combi crba CAA are calm and it's like a place we're like fans come and they talk and we have an IRC server so there's one all day and I'm on it all day and I talked about that it's so ridiculous you just gave people that out now people gonna go they're good I hope welcome I said my quake days oh yeah great way to communicate like teams would communicate you like server addresses that she was free as fuck the inner the government didn't even know how to fucking trace a phone literally like listening on IRC back then like they had to pick up from the hackers like how to do it that was a very very different thing really it when those all those message boards and all those things came up like especially like the ability to we play games and talk to people in real time to do to I'm one of the ways I learned how to type was from learning how to type in game yeah quick cuz you gotta type quick quake one or like quick well with noted what was started with quake 2 we had quake multiplayer option yeah quake 1 I mean I was in doomed so like when quake 1 came out and I was nine inch nails my favorite band ever and when went back then and still was the influence for me like he did the soundtrack I was a mold shit it's funny that nasty all these years later she's like I didn't have a computer but I went and bought that sound right cuz Trent Reznor did it cuz she was into nitrous nails and whoa so hot she has the the CD of it in in our house still that anyway man I love that and I used to do that too and once the internet came on I had a friend in Nashville me and my buddy James and Greg Greg this guy ran a BBS and he he bought a doom 2 server back then where you had fit for phone lines and modems in it and I Lin that's K days son totally and we would play doom to enlist I was listening to like white zombie Astra creep mm I was probably 14 13 just jamming this shit out man I was such a nerd still a man if you saw my house you got to come over sometime but I've got like my office is like 1993 we watched laser discs we have like old computers and like old shit everywhere so it's like I kind of its kind of frozen in a weird technological phase that I love that's hilarious that's awesome man yeah you've always been like really into like weird internet type shit like you really into crypto currencies I'm in there's a thing called peep peep it's like peep ETH it's on Twitter or whatever but it's it's a Twitter alternative it's like it's it's just just starting but it's which is called beep ETH well peep ETH what does that mean dot-com is the thing it's it's like kind of like Twitter but it's built on the back of a theorem and so every tweet or I'm calling them tweets I should call it what every message that you send on it kind of like Twitter is embedded in the block chain of aetherium well just explain what this site says it says the values platform hold on what did you do so we just if they're a blockchain powered social network for our best selves yeah well it because you can't delete anything because it's permanently embedded and it's like I think up to ten of your messages can be logged in one block of the etherium chain so you have to pay like a cent of it but they give you some to begin with and then when somebody messages you it's kind of a mitral micro transaction to you so you have this kind of balance that's going on wait a minute so do you have to open up an account there something you get a cent you can do it without any involvement but the way it works is because it's in transactions on a blockchain in aetherium it's it's permanently lodged in this permanent digital ledger in which that these transactions are what's making it happen so like if you you log in and verify yourself they give you like 30 cents cuz that starts you out to be able to just kind of permanently do this in so you don't have to do any it sounds complicated but it's cool I'm not saying I don't I don't know if it'll become like the next rage but it's technologically it's a really fucking fun you might be launching it right now go back to that page again and expand on the right-hand side what it shows you all the different categories and the different values look at this let's make that a larger look at rethinking social media bring out our best with opinionated features and mu immutability hmm yeah how often you hear that word its purpose I mean not the ability to not mute I believe immutability so you can't mute people okay we'll need to google that in a moment contact is openly and forever accessible on the etherium blockchain and ipfs whatever that is thoughtful says permanence and creative constraints encourage mindful and self-aware peeps okay that was like a haiku that's like a fucking poem listen this is fucking thing under listen to this again permanence and creative constraints encourage mindful and self-aware peeps that's what is I just stumbled across it but I love it I love the technology and yeah I do too but I mean that was I don't understand what they just said charity better sponsible charity badges prevent suffering and inspire others 1178 mosquito nets purchased so far oh that's amazing so they're making their purchasing mosquito nets know that that has to do with the the actual platform I think oh so it's not a real mosquito net oh I thought response to this website no okay no they are they're buying mosquito badges to prevent a little area I'm getting paged cuz they had good oh it's over I know I don't talk I don't want to be over either shooter we got to do this again yeah come on man and yeah I'm glad you started off that controversial subject of the Alex Jones thing and I'm really glad that Bill Maher went out on a Ledge and said you did even if you don't agree with someone you're not supposed to silence their speech you know I just don't think people are supposed to be alone yelling into the wilderness the mob mentality you know has a problem even him I don't think you're supposed to do that I think he's supposed to be alone yelling off into the abyss my wife is calling me now she's telling everyone's freaking out this deal everyone's freaking the fuck out there's just time ladies and gentlemen it's a way of measuring distance thank you for having Jennings I love you too brother shooter it's out now here Jenny's calm this the shit's vinyl old-school son respect all right
