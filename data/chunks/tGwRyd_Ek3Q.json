the Joe Rogan experience and I just give one interesting UFC memory for me please I watched the very first UFC one with I had a troop at the time and we invited Scout troop it wasn't it was a comedy troop Boys Scouts but we invited Neil Patrick Harris over it was twenty years old at the time we was in town we just met him and he came over and soon as the sumo wrestler got his face kicked in and there's spit a tooth out I believe he was like I'm out of here I gotta get out and we made him stay and watch though good and that's what made him gay that was thanking the story I don't know if that's true I don't know if nothing happened yeah maybe someone dropped him on his head yeah I don't think he knows he looked like he was already as a kid something them wrong or right mm-hm patting on if you're his boyfriend yeah imagine depends if he's a good boyfriend yeah yeah well I guess but I mean if the Braz Mini is I must've been the husband yeah that guy's really into him thank God you watch that fight that time yeah thank God in other words can I never found no chick yeah look at me and shit Oh God and these are places which have levels of violence which are like way worse than medieval Europe a lot place in medieval Europe I mean look at the figures per hundred thousand because some of them have over a hundred four hundred thousand one hundred fifty five hundred thousand and medieval Europe lot these cities were like twenty four hundred thousand so they're way worse now way worse in the Wild West than like now there are some place in the United States the de la Owen idea I've done some research recently in Baltimore Maryland and I was kind of it's interesting to compare that to Latin America and that's high level that's forty four hundred thousands that's that's not as the same level but it's significant still more than medieval Europe yeah Wow Baltimore's worse than medieval Europe yeah I mean I think this you have to have to some professors them they were might in a like you get like no there might be they might say well Jerusalem in this time or in a line I like he got triumph we nice hard to know it really dig down exactly there outbreaks of violence and killing answer yes but the overall average yeah of what average yeah it's a significant leap a hundred percent leap yeah yeah absolutely Baltimore what about South Side of Chicago it's not that I mean like the level I think in Chicago comes out around 20 or something so it's not now the America of the whole city now these again and one of things about the violence in the United States compared to Latin America when Baltimore is is significant bits of fairly what the city of Baltimore is a very small place what they're talking about so in Mexico you have entire states that are like really violent or entire countries in Latin America whereas in the US it tends to be neighborhoods which are violent so if you really focus on the southside of Chicago it's probably similar levels to Baltimore I think you know it sir but if you look at the whole city got neighbors did a pretty safe in Chicago as well yeah I grew up with a alcoholic father and it was a pretty violent home and and he was a really bad alcoholic and I know having grown up in that you wind up with what I call a damaged personal truth and you feel second-class and the problem that kids make and because I know I did it and and I see others do it is you compare your personal truth what you know about yourself you know how you really live and what's really going on you compare your personal truth to everybody else's social mask because you go to school and you know well I know that last night the windows got kicked out of my house I know that the utilities got turned off and I know there was a big fight in my kitchen last night and the kids sitting next to me he's got on a shirt that's all ironed and his face is all bright and clean and you know he looks like he's just got it all together and you compare yourself to that person that kid and you feel like you're second class and the problem with that is we generate the results in life we think we deserve so if you think you're damaged do you think you're second class you will generate results that you think a second class person deserves hmm so if you don't fix your personal truth then you'll spend the rest of your life saying well you know those really good results those belong for somebody else that's not for me that's for somebody else and you'll settle for second best and you won't get what you might otherwise generate for yourself if you don't fix your personal truth and so I think a lot of people are struggling looking for a way to kind of get out of feeling not good about themselves and damage self-esteem damage self-worth and they really don't know where to go so and that's why I do the show I don't look I'm not under the misapprehension that we're doing eight minute cures if they're mean come on yeah we're not doing that but I think if you can point people in the right direction if you can raise their awareness you can get them thinking about it you can create a narrative where they at least say you know how do I feel about myself I mean is there stuff I need to resolve I mean what am I saying to myself if you can get them thinking about that and you know maybe you've done something yeah you know Tony Robbins once said once that it's incremental changes over the long haul and the way you have to look at it is if these two boats are going in a parallel direction and one of them just shifts five degrees over the course of time this boat is gonna be in a far different place than the other boat that's going the same way it was always going yeah and the important thing to realize as well is the next year is going to go by whether you're doing something about your life or not I mean we're sitting here right now at the end of February and the next 10 months are going to go by whether somebody is working to make change or whether they're not and they may think you know oh my god I'm so far overweight I'll never get it under control or I'm so behind in my bills or I'm so you know just depressed or my everything is so out of control well you know what you make those incremental changes and then you know pretty soon in December you go hey I'm way better off and I was at the end of February so you made little changes and they all added up and if you don't by the end of the year you're just getting deeper so every little bit matters and there's a it's a seems to be like a universal struggle for figuring out what people are and how we should behave and who gets to decide that and there's certain universal truths that are ignored and there's certain ones that are emphasized over emphasized and there's certain ones that are you know that are in the Goldilocks pot and we're working it out I think that's part of what's going on with human beings but we have to be really really careful of is that by silencing some people and never giving them any path to retribution we create eternal enemies and this is this is what easily could be happening right now when someone doesn't have ability to express themselves because an evil force wants conflict and what you say is probably know if it's an evil force but it's a art title force they're there listening to all those around them and there's a hive hive mind sort of thinking to a lot of this there's not a lot of debate about some let's just say this Joe and and 210th plan everybody else you didn't give in to the pressuring of the threat it was more than nagging like a siren like a bitching woman not against women so that's why you didn't have me on but then you realize I was just a symbol of you just trying to live the life and put out good ideas and talk to people but folks are gonna make you choose a side and that's what's happening in this quickening edge I don't want you to side that's why Ryan Seacrest has got it nailed nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest for like political advice he's got an alt he hosts a bunch of shows the real nice guys got a great smile he's figured it out but you understand Joe get in that sweet spot man I look at you gone dummy we're talking about anything every to yourself my god entropy is stagnant water oh it's still nothing's going on it's all clear you know dead and rotting what's alive oh it's a big crashing waves yes seriously I've seen me on everybody has but I've seen way beyond guys you want to be in the conflict you want to be in the fight you want to take all your you're not successful Joe because you played along the system you're successful because you did it organically and real doesn't mean it's perfect doesn't mean it's bad it was real that's why your success and then they come in you think oh I'm not saying you're bad I'm the same way Oh all these people are telling me how great I am I play ball with them because I've got you know this thing but they want you because they're soulless and so all I'm saying is you've made the right decision and I don't just think having me on because I'm not perfect is deciding no America is still America the world still the world we're allowed to talk about real things and hear old things because they want to shut other voices down so they can lie about those voices and and any idea that fears exposure or fears debate is a failed idea yeah when you guys wrote songs how did you how did you put the lyrics to the music what was the process like how did you guys sort that out so you would you come to them with an idea would they come to you with a riff like how would it work it'll work a number of ways but a mistake that a lot of young writers in my department the lyrics make is that they think of it as secondary hmm they wait for the music or the track first and then you'll walk into a studio and hope that the hand of God will descend and grace you with amazing epiphanies I can't even spell amazing all right and called upon to do it right away you know you'll work out a beat and go Dave you got some lyrics if I go walk into that room and try to create it right there nine times out of ten it's gonna be moon in June right moon in June really when sometime soon mmm what time of day I'm thinking noon literally I'm gonna put my hands in the air why well because I just don't care you wind up there unless you're banking think like debate if you're gonna debate somebody you're banking your ideas right all right and whatever the subject is you can ghosts don't even have to have a subject it's okay I like what he just said I might even write that phrase I like what you just said yeah it could be a Drake lyric any expressions ideas slogans anything that comes from other tunes in terms of their lyric and is everybody contributing no that's just me just have volumes of that and those kinds of ideas ideas for songs storylines etc you would never go into a fight without doing that collecting moves from every other film of every other fighter that you possibly can so that when somebody goes like this you go oh I know what to do someone suffers and then I'm gonna finish it like this and somebody says it's a song about they play a song I go well it sounds kind of like cowboy music let's write about cowboys mm going through the banking giddyup that's a cool title I heard a cowboy say it on the TV set and I wrote it down literally okay and you start back you could I see the lights come and you start banking [Applause]
