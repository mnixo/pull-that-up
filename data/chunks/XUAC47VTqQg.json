join my gang Joe Rogan podcast my night all day man let's go to the Amanda Nunez Ronda Rousey fight if you got to put some money down what do you what do you think man who the fuck knows I love saying who the fuck knows because you we haven't seen run to fight in over a year we don't know her head looking at her body she's an insane shape there's some pictures of her online throwing punches and you look at her back yeah leash and seen him fuck she's down she's down to fight wake wait already apparently you know I think losing to someone like Holly Holm the way she did and to be tired and get beat up and the whole deal like look at her back there where she's punching the speed bag Jesus the goodness that's redonkulous god damn so if you think about the way she lost that fight and how she looked physically she didn't look nothing like this like not even close like she's got all these videos of her running uphill and all those different stuff she looks like way more fit she got tired in the fight with Holly and that was a big factor is also getting hit was a big factor getting stunned right away and but really solid conditioning will allow you to recover better than not being in such good shape especially when you get hit in the head that's a big factor with the guys that are super super fit is how they bounce back you know like Neil Magny is a good example we've stunned that guy in the first round but he's so fit he bounces back for her to that that Holly fight she the one thing about wrong she always comes to fight she's always in shape she takes that you know personal takes it kind of upon herself John have the same sort of dedication towards that fight with Holly that she's got towards this fight he's physically doesn't I don't think we know physically you can say that but we don't know you've been shooting movies she won't do press count right you know I'm saying so we don't know she could take her down use her judo and not try to strike with her just clench up do that judo trip take her down anybody's in danger of that armbar that's what she's going so god damn she's gonna Amanda Nunez could easily get caught in that armbar wouldn't shock here's a question for you she's got a driver here's a question for you guys do you think she has the coaching to make changes where she just doesn't pull forward on a man and Nunez and get punched in the core she's gonna become she's gonna take her time of course she's not gonna go out there reckless she's gonna take her time that's how she came around around shit anyways and it seems like common sense don't fucking get crazy get in there just fucking get the blood going that's not hurt that's not her Eddie she don't go there that's like a Mike Tyson can sound outside and jab and she might try to overwhelm her but she's not stupid she's gonna learn from mistakes they just fight a cleaner fight more movement more head movement I think she's go to a surgery she's had knee surgery since then she could take Amanda down I think 1% yeah she could take out cat cats come on dude cat Zingano had a real hard first round in the first round in Manon Nunez is beating the shit out of her cat Nunez art cat Nunez yeah cat came back and stopped new leaders that and that's nuna betraying you gotta run the back who knows you're known for a cardio like that if Rhonda okay it's tough because what makes Ronda great is there's this flurry there's exchange next thing you know you're she fucking hip toss you in you're an armbar right that's the thing she's not really gonna sit on outside be patient that's not her but if she can like if it's a dogfight I think Rhonda ends up catching a fourth fifth round cuz Amanda she starts off like a tidal wave and we've seen in her losses she kind of slows down she just does yeah well it's gonna be interesting to see if American top teams been able to do something to mitigate that if they've who knows what kind of strength conditioning program she's under now the only problem is she on the class quick is if if Ronda takes her down and ends up on top she might have a hard time passing the man in nuna's guard and we'll see like Rhonda's not she's not known for her guard passing so that could be a problem maybe she could create scrambles at it yes that's her thing but it's a letter attempt to get up if she can get her on her back how will she she deal with passing the guard she really doesn't she goes to it and then she's going transitioned from there you got to deal with it with a black belt in jujitsu you're gonna have to deal with the guard pass it's nine - really doesn't submit anybody it's not a right Ronnie could get on top over that bull she's a black male hey she submitted me she tape he's a black belt in jujitsu interests mated sure officer McMahon - she battered both of them and some people she she what both their asses and a different machine did she submit Sara McMann she submitted definition - submitted Misha no no that beat her up no not Kat I'm sorry she submitted me yeah yeah she submitted make sure that whole thing she did the same thing to Sara McMann I think she cracked her and then then put her away with a choke the one ready sure the one thing she has over round in this fight is power she is vicious power striking yeah and I say that's it I'd say that if Rhonda does come out or a full clip like that it's a very risky proposition she can crack so fucking hard but if Rhonda feels like she can get closer to that here we go he's not the man she's mission yeah we're um hunch right she's not scary oh yeah sure no she no no I'm talking about him Avenue no mana Nunez so she's working girls I'm shot she's dropping him and Shayna blazer look at that oh yeah okay no she's Merkin girls yeah she need a man did disaster punch is Martha she's only fucking woman in that division she might be the hardest women puncher in the 135 she's the hardest woman puncher outside of cyborg well cyborgs not 135 no I'm just saying females are gentle she's a whore aspyn yeah outside boards are different yeah okay yeah yeah okay I know that you want to see her watch this and why mine stays the same do you see the flesh Anisha I agree did you see her fight with Mischa Amanda Nunez yeah Mischa I guess but I forgot all about visual Amanda Nunez stopping Mischa she beat us last night it was last hour she went about yeah yeah okay what about the Sara McMann fight I don't know this is GOC 200 go before that because before that is when she's full you'll meet her up on the feet yeah I was there she's got a nasty jab - man she steps in a good distance - boom boom it's good scramble the question is like is she gonna there's a big difference between dealing with Ronda and dealing with Mischa look this is a mauling man she put breaks off of her Amanda's just putting it to Miesha Tate and you just she just has long-ass punches too and then she gets her back this I sounds route if Ron is in the right frame of mind I think she does rush in like she usually does probably each as it eats a shot but then she gets inside gets around the hook takes her for a ride and submits in the first round I hope nobody tests positive for anything there's so many people to get popular about cyborg yeah a game oh no matter what it's for game fucking over man now ruins goes told you Tuscan toldja my face when I watch a UFC promo these days I see you're skeptical and raise you a super skeptical snake that's exact where for every but it room that's because they're not showing a man the newness it is kind of fucked up but it's also you know like someone pointed out like when you're watching these promos they're movies now it's like this little film it's not like training footage people talking about it like this realm where slickly produced a movie thing her story's fucking great oh man denoon has the story is great first openly gay world champion freaking Brazilian I mean knocked out a highlight reel highlight reels yes master fucking work yeah like she's the devil and then and then we don't show any Ronda chaos it's like that just it's like men in black with a swan use ink and erase that from your memory there wasn't any of that planning of that video going around on its own everybody knows what happened it's not something need to discuss I think they could have done it in that video and then show them the work out to the return and it might be even more dramatic showing or crying showing our building back up picking up the pieces again I mean that I mean if you wanted to go deep you could that's gonna be in the movie right if you have a Ronda Rousey life story movie that's gotta be in the moving course I never sense if she comes back and wins I mean that's exactly you're gonna see you're gonna see all the machine Ronda Rousey today right now I mean she is who she is right now what's going on right now is because what happened with Holly Holm you know this is her comeback this is it can she pull off the comeback I mean but the only regime come back against who like I said the average fans gonna come back against who she's been the favorite in every fight she's ever been they they had a complete blackout of Amanda Nunez like I haven't showed shit at all -
