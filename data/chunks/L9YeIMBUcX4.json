the Joe Rogan experience with them at three o'clock had to go home and change into white clothes for a year not allowed for a year and address some white for a year a year so for my cause I would just have to wear those white socks and white t-shirt cuz I was a kid I can't keep wearing fucking white every damn I'm ripping shit right so that your hair has to grow back so when I walk into I don't there's a ton of Santeria in LA really I don't deal with it at all because it's all the same thing like everything else now I it's a bunch of white people who didn't grow up and in there and there's a hot black guy and they want to really just suck this dick and tell them about spirits I saw a video today I saw a video file on my shame on them it's all confuse I took white chicks that sucked at him dude dick when they go to hot yoga you know that guy that's sacrum Bikram big dumb as a pig he got his a bunch of white chicks with hummus flavor in their mouth from sucking that brick run dick you know he gets to me inside he you suck that fucking dead dick that smells like hummus chips you know yeah that's what it is in that way like I've been invited to two parties first time I went you know who's in there who fucking the dude from that play easy on me a forest forest whitaker isn't big really to check that one miss america feeding pussy from behind the ladies in this area oh it's not my Santeria I grew up in the Cuba Santeria because it's not cute is it Mexican influence no no no this is why God forest it's very watered down yeah and look at the guy from lover lover Forest Whitaker dressed up like yeah like fucking monks pray I don't do I don't pop a plate came up hilarious I came up under the very strict shut your mouth nobody needs you know you fucking business these two yeah and then I want to I do have a question you know you might have the answer what did you have a half of spray I had one spray good enough okay was the other question do you think why am I asking you this but I think you might have an answer so but I'm totally honest I am exhausted from dealing with like it's like not like it's a big deal but it's like the first time you whether you can admit major things in your life like oh I have a drinking problem let me stupid little things yeah mine is eating like I am exhausted from doing it the wrong way and everything comes back to me for self control so when people want to tell me about a diet I know it's not portions I know what portions are I just want to eat more so it's all down to how do I fucking get self-control I have zero I mean if I'm not gonna call it zero self-control then I don't know what the hell I'm gonna call it but as you learn part funny I know you're very hard on yourself I think you have self-control Todd I think you're a wonderful man but you're you're hilarious and one of the reasons why you're hilarious is because you're so you're free you're impulsive and that sort of that it's very difficult for that to lend itself to dietary discipline it's like I wanna eat it fuck it okay yeah so fuckin eat it right that's you with it's also part of what makes you such a hilarious comic it's like you have these impulses you feel better you don't want splits the difference at least with what you're saying you don't want discomfort and you want to have fun it's like it's right there they wanna I want to eat that food fuck it right instead of thought of me like picture me at the cancer shoving cheesecake him in my mouth and my friends are creative okay so I don't have control over this you unlike meet-in-the-middle you're like okay it's legal but you can't name it what do you think you could fuck a real doll I mean you definitely could if you had - but would that be something you'd be interested in I think I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous the situation was just jerk off and think about things I thought we had as a sponsor I've had a flashlight it's very utilitarian you're not confusing yourself nobody's ever said that she's a girl of my dreams I've never I've had it forever I've never even thought about it I couldn't guess why I would want to use it seems weird it's weird it feels good though does it engulfs your whole dick yeah and you put it in warm water and you get it like to a temperature of a body somehow or another there's like a portal like this tube is a portal to another woman in another dimension but all you can get out is her vagina okay just hold that's it feels real the name of this dimension is called awesome do you jerk off with a fleshlight order yet hold it and fuck it now you're not a jerk off with it yeah you jerk me off with a flashlight yeah but that was for shiz that was on camera behind the carrot green this interview is on the podcast I swear you jerk no for the producer no whoa what's that about is that a fucking real oh that's a real that's a real dog you're getting pretty good man it will redhead though there's a documentary on sex robots really have come far because there are people who fall in love with these sex robots and it looks like the fucking taxi driver johnny-on-the-spot from Total Recall it's like this is crazy like animatronic Chuckie Cheese bass player well it's gonna get to a point where it can totally mimic you and he's gonna get to a point where it really is like Blade Runner is that what they are now that's the dude one I thought about buying a dude one to do jujitsu the proportions are perfect because I have a doll it's as Bubba dummy the practice submissions on but it's super stiff it's like this but he beat you you basically could drill the moves but it's not the same as drilling it on an anatomically correct body if you had an anatomically correct body to practice jiu-jitsu on you get some fucking tight moves yeah but okay we can't wait till the day when you're announcing for robot fights no zero interest there's nothing at stake if they live or die it doesn't matter the whole thing about fighting is that there's some horrible gigantic thing at stake you can fuck one though yeah fight would you watch two robots fuck that's how it goes it's weird yeah man thank you van we need to say anything more about the Brendan Schaub thing did we cover it enough man as far as it goes it's just like that's a worse situation we mean we'd like we need to talk him and hit you you know yeah so it's a weird situation for me because I love the guy and he's one of my best friends and also I can't defend what he said cuz it doesn't totally make sense yeah and so like what I'm saying what I said he talks too much I do too I say stupid shit I don't mean to say stupid shit I don't say that stupid I didn't say that thing I wouldn't say it like that yeah but sometimes you say things you don't even know why the fuck you're saying it you know and a lot of it also was like just ranting like you go into these rants and you say shit and then you like see if you can back it up once you said it yeah like just don't revisit dumb shit that's like it was insensitive it didn't make sense and it was insensitive and I bet he regrets it well I mean I don't know why that's an assumption we're making right yeah god I know the guy that's why I'm saying it yeah he's not a bad guy yeah mister like the imagination he's awesome I'm not of the of the I'm not the guy saying like you're racist for saying this like that I'm like my thing is when you're talking about the the first initial part of it and I conveyed this to him you know was you're saying me or my brother my sister aren't good enough to be here so like that's that's disrespectful because I fully believe that we all are yeah and that that that so that part and he apologized for that and we're cool there you know and then stand then why why are you talking about like this is what I see myself because no dog that's not that's not how it is no no you're not you're not a psychologist a psychiatrist you have no qualifications to to speak on my mental state like like well it's just weird too that you guys haven't I think he's mm I don't know I think sometimes someone says something instead of just straight up saying they fucked up they say I fucked up but yeah you know I fucked up but you know he's his issue is because of this or you know it's something else is going on with him that's making him react this way yeah yeah I I'm more concerned with his pants those shredded up pants and worse those disturbing way more than what he said I can't can't defend either one yeah just don't wear women's pants I don't think they're women's holding them playing hold it on cuz it's like we went through that at the beginning of the show and they have holding them it depends on how many holes right like the pant leg holes little well if you earn those holes like if you work construction you got it like a real hole yeah you get you you get your pants snagged on it yeah you got to do what you got to do you know if you're a farmer you got like real barbed wire holes and your pants that's a different animal you know that's that's okay you earn those holes you wore your jeans out they start ripping in places okay okay you can't afford to buy some new ones yeah but if you paid a lot of money for pants that are already fucked up you saw that shit in a magazine somewhere that's what bothers me about Brendan fucking pants [Applause]
