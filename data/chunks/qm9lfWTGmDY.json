than their clothes I'll be close I'll be close right oh sweet baby Jesus we are live Gavin McInnes first beer already cracked dressed up like Michael Douglas and falling down showing the briefcase shown the briefcase I got the exact reef case he had are those the same glasses he had normally objector would not wear a pocket protector correct no no one wears them anymore but every one in the movie has one yeah whenever you want to have a geek in a movie yes I'm sort of scientific character science character you has to have a pocket protector well I got all this on eBay if you have some pre-planning you can get a costume for like 10 bucks so this is a dollar fifty it would have taken me months to find this on the street yeah how do you find a pocket protector eBay mmm eBay eBay eBay and the Ty assume is yours the shirt and is that your sure did you buy that shirt this is an example what I'm talking about I had to find this in New York it took me like two hours I had to go to a uniform supply store huge pain in the ass I could have got on eBay or Amazon for two seconds yeah that's a weird kind of shirt right a button-up shirt with short sleeves that you wear with a tie that's an odd look it's like I'm formal but I'm not because I need my forearms free yeah it's like la everyone in that movie has one it's like an LA business IT guy back then back then no one wears them anymore now it's like like like a hoodie that's like an IT guy you're like a weird t-shirt and a hoodie like Jamie be trust exactly like Jamie look that's what a hoodie that's what an IT guys dressing uniform - they all wear the American Apparel sweatshirt mmm exactly no that's his own that's a Jamie Vernon special it says pull that shit up yeah and you can get that at a young Jamie comm mm what does that mean all that shit up I'm always telling them whenever there's something going on the news or we're talking about something we don't know what the answer is like what is that I'll pull this shit up Jamie I'll find it up on YouTube huh speaking to pull that shit up I like this I like your your profile because I think you get lumped into like a lot of like really fucked up crazy people because you've got some controversial Diaz but I like what you did I like this pro-west pro-gun pro-life pro-gay pro-israel pro Trump anti-nazi I don't know what antiphon is I see it all the time I'm sure you can explain it to us a anti censorship anti-feminists anti Islam you leave your heart on your sleeve well it's really handy to do that I just did that about a week ago but in this day and age we're in a weird era where it's like a philosophy age where all Romans all of a sudden mm-hmm like Socrates sitting here philosophizing and you kind of have to make everyone know exactly where you stand on this spectrum because if you're slightly right of center your alt right and your honor no those guys hate me but I hate these guys so I'm here right you're pro gay yeah I think these are just you're born gay yeah and the idea that you know I know I've lived in the city since I was 18 so I've been around gays for a quarter century and I think of these guys I know that have been together for 10 years and I go so let me get this straight this these two are gonna break up according to you an evangelical person and then they're just gonna make out with some chick with blonde hair and eat her out and like fucker and have a boner and pray to God come on you know that won't happen I'd I wonder how much of homosexual behavior could be induced by molestation in an early age though yeah that's the million-dollar question that seems to be a real factor it's not and this is not denying people that are born gay but I think there's a spectrum and I think there's most certainly some gay acts that are committed on young people and horrific aliy those people tend to on a pretty frequent basis do the same thing to other young kids yep that's really weird in in in terms of like the victims becoming the victimizer yeah I know where you're going with this we're walking into the elephant in the room but what kind of not even I'm just just talking about I was listening to the George Takei interview today because they're trying to pull up everybody now that the Milo thing is out they're pulling up everybody who in any way has condoned sex with underage people and George Takei was talking about his own experiences in camp and it was on stern show and he was just talking about what what he the way he was describing it as a positive experience with a kid who was in his late teens I think he said it was 19 and he was like 13 somewhere in that age and you know it's absolutely child molestation it's absolutely illegal but the way he was describing it he was pretty much describing it as a positive experience right which when it's your experience I mean it's illegal the guy did something that was against the law but boy that's a weird area because it's his experience that he was talking about yeah well here's the deal and this is a mistake Milo made you have to acknowledge that what you're talking about is fucked up and horrible and wrong but you just so happen to have not had a bad experience within those parameters right like say you were raped as a woman and you came right which by the way happens for some strange okay so if you're one of those women and you're but to say that you have to understand that we're going into a very dangerous place right now and you can't say look some rapes are absolutely fabulous and women have come from them you have to say this is fucking horrible rape is evil but I buy some weird freak of nature actually elected or a murder I'm sure this times when you murdered a guy and he ended up he was a mass murderer and it was a good murder right you know okay I'm describing a murder item not condoning murder but in this weird case it worked yeah and Milo's mistake was he said it worked for me and then he implied that it could work for a ton of other gays to be fucked at 13 well he did that drunken peasants podcast and his take on it from the drunken peasants was different than his take on it from mine and on my podcast it seemed more like he was trying to make light of something that most likely definitely did happen to him the father Michael yeah so there's two there's the father Michael thing and I I don't know if I believe that I think that's it's a I've heard him say that joke a few times where he's like I never would have given such good head if it wasn't for father Michael right so you think that might be something like that he's constructed I don't believe it I don't know why this is my gut mmm and the other thing was condoning sexual relationships 13y and he said especially in the gay world now I know of straight guys who were a strake I'm thinking in particular who was molested at camp and it was by an older gay camp counselor this guy thinks of that guy every day he follows him on LinkedIn hoping he'll die he wants to murder him so the problem with what Milo said is you end up normalizing this behavior and say it's okay in the gay world next thing you know some older gay who's a camp goes well this is probably a fag that I'm blowing right now this is okay yeah so what I say to these gays these thirteen-year-old Gates ago I would be okay with fucking a 29 year old I go well I'm sorry but we're not normalizing that because the vast vast majority of times it doesn't turn out well so no yeah that's a very good way of putting it you know and it's it's really disturb all demilo thing is so odd because first of all I think he's got this act you know let's call it an act because part of it has got to be an addict he's got a wide spectrum of his personalities yeah so on Bill Maher he can be a raging Liberace queen with pearls on yeah dressed like a woman I mean that's like a woman camper than any woman I know yeah and then for the apology he's the conservative with the coke-bottle glasses yeah it's sort of like when a Jamaican goes back to Jamaica and they start speaking in patois like their grandmother not necessarily lying it's just a wide range of use yeah he plays it up and there's definitely a performance piece to a lot of what he does what's what's really interesting is he's very good at riling people up he's obviously very good at getting people upset and and in doing so he's created these sort of false narratives about him that he's a Nazi that he promotes genocide I mean there were so many people outside the Berkeley thing that were screaming calling him a Nazi and saying he's a fascist when they in fact were behaving in very authoritarian fascist ways that's anti-fat by the way you said I don't know what an tyfa is that's those guys anti-fascist is that anti flat stands for okay but you're right they're terrorists and they use terror they use violence to choose political gains which is terrorism and these people it's not like Milo ever set or Trump even ever said anything that is remotely close to genocide but those guys just go anyone that wants to enforce immigration laws is a fuckin Nazi so I need violence because I'm trying to stop Hitler I'm around the first stages of Hitler so I'm going back in time and strangling them in his crib right right but the problem is the way they're reacting to it is the absolute wrong way to react to someone who's saying something that you don't agree with oh yeah the right way is to say something that you feel opposes what they're saying it makes more sense to debate them that's the beauty of free speech like it has no limits yeah if you want to get out there and deny the Holocaust you want to get out there and sexualized toddlers I'll go to your talk I want to hear it and I've been in the queue a day I'll shoot you down well not I don't think it even should just be a Q&A I mean I think it should be real clear there should be someone and we shouldn't just rely on the audience to come up with some sort of response I think if you're gonna have someone as controversial as Milo and you are so opposed to it that you're willing to throw bricks through Starbucks windows and like cop cars on fire there should be someone that can speak for your side course and then you should organize some sort of a talk but this is setting it up the wrong way because you go it's like someone said to me once hey man you know like we were talking about martial arts photos block but I'd fucking kick everybody's ass no you wouldn't no you would first of all you wouldn't because you'd have discipline and you'd realize the consequence is that but second of all when you just kick someone's ass they don't they don't just take it like they come back with a bat or a gun or their brother or you start a fighting they want to get it back and it goes back and forth and back and forth and all conflict it pretty much goes that way you have conflict and then someone responds to that conflict and it escalates so if you have this thing where you start throwing bricks through windows and lighting cop cars on fire and stopping people from talking and hitting people that have make Bitcoin great again hats did you see that girl got chased in the face nobody knows eventually people show up with guns that's what happens and this is what happens when you keep escalating the violence you become a van you become the other you become the enemy and you create this polarizing atmosphere that's so intense that no dialogues can fix it now because you're the enemy we should talking about the north worst of the south you're talking about you know the the Protestants versus the Catholics you you create this horrific environment where almost it's almost impossible to avoid violence well so I'm done avoiding it I'm taking the low road I'm punching them in the face so that's how you're doing with this outfit yes that is really what I'm doing so fit I did a talk at NYU they pepper sprayed me didn't it real when was this this was a couple weeks ago what was it talk about I didn't even have a plan I was they know me as pro Trump or something and they they I'm a Nazi because of that and they do they don't want to give a platform to free speech that's the irony of all this is they pretend that it's gotten so far it's beyond debate now in their world we are recruiting fascists for some sort of imminent genocide so we're like signing up the brown shirts with a form at our talks and you go say that was possible how does that work like we sign you up then you're part of the club then you come with us on the next genocide the fuck are you talking about you haven't played it through in your mind because for these people it's a religion that's why they don't want to debate it's like a born-again he doesn't want to debate about the existence of God he's already on that side so what was your plan when you went there what did what did you want to talk I was gonna say this Nazi that that you've made Milo and I out to be who wants genocide and who sees non-whites is inhuman bla bla bla bla bla homophobic sexist whatever first of all that guy should be allowed to talk if he existed but he doesn't exist your monster is a mythical beast right and you've gone to college you're 60 grand in debt already to fight this mythical beast who doesn't fucking exist well in terms of Milo he definitely doesn't exist Milo is not a Nazi he's definitely he's not promoting genocide and those are two things that just get trumpeted about left and right exactly who is but Milo has said some very inflammatory things about in a very generalizing way about women and about the wage gap and about all sorts of things that he he designs his words and his phrases to be inflammatory so he gets the most response and it's been incredibly profitable I mean up until HarperCollins pulled his book deal he had a $250,000 book advance his book was number one on Amazon just sheerly through controversy yep I mean through pre-sales and controversy so it's a strategy in a lot of ways and it's also a response to this really hard stance that the far left is taking this ant I anti-free speech stance right but all was with these cases you go what exactly did he say I always say this to people who bitch about the Coulter I go what sentence in what book is factually incorrect what specifically are you saying and with this mile of thing he said that often sexual relationships with 13-year olds can be beneficial for gays he has since retracted that and apologized but that's not enough and that's about as egregious as it gets the other stuff that he says we all say in a joking way and then that becomes pure evil and you advocate for this right so the left is willfully ignorant of humor when it comes to Marlo and with Trump too likely to grab the pussy thing which they had a whole fucking parade about and they still wear these dumb wool hats to look like a pussy which is a joke he said on a bus so you're wearing a dumb joke on your head they they know that he doesn't want to have a new policy called the pussy grabbing statute but they are willfully hiding their sense of humor so they can take things literally and go off on a tirade of it well I think they're shocked that we've been fed our entire life politicians that speak in a statesman li-like way a very predetermined planned out way where they have pauses in their speech like Obama when he speaks he has some very non normal patterns to his behavior yeah like those those things that people do the showmanship of being a president that it's all designed to comfort you and have you think that this person is clearly different than anyone you know they talk different they have but better speaks French beaches they have better speaks their their statesman like you know they speak in these pre-planned out sentences that are articulate and and and cleanly worded and that's not what you get with Trump and that disturbs the shit out of people he serves it like I saw so many people going off the other day about his talk about uranium and Hillary Clinton selling uranium you know how it's things and you it's four things very bad things like he's running out of words doesn't know what the words are you know that doesn't necessarily mean anything but people are pointing to it like it's this horrible moment where this president essentially all he did was run out of words and just the fucking guys probably working 16 hours a day he's probably exhausted I mean the overwhelming stress of the job for any one of them is almost immediately apparent once they get into office and you're seeing it with Trump as well he's seen like like that unhinged press conference that he made guarantee you some of that has to do with the fact the guy is worn the fuck out mm-hmm you know he's a 70 year old man like I'm almost 50 and I'm fucking tired all the time how's this guy who's 20 years older than me gonna deal with the stress of running the biggest economy the biggest military the most insane country the world has ever known yeah I mean that's what the United States is yeah they say Maggie Thatcher slept four hours a night for hours a night repeatedly starts to chip away at your psyche oh yeah but the thing I would say about Trump when they say he's not presidential is I tried that I tried it with Romney you got mad at his binder comment I I tried it with Cruz the constitutional Superman who could debate anyone and was erudite and and presidential and you went now he's ugly so I said okay I'm bringing in Rodney Dangerfield from Caddyshack and he's just gonna be a wrecking ball and when Huffington Post says we're putting Trump in the entertainment section instead of the news section Romney and Cruz wouldn't have said anything Trump says an ankle 2-point sits out in your book in Trump we trust Trump goes Arianna Huffington didn't your husband leave you for a man yeah I think he made the right choice I think it was a very good choice and I go that's you you brought this on yourself you made me have to get him well what she's doing you know with Ann Coulter's doing very similar to what Milo's doing you mean they're their merchants of outrage and that's what they're doing I disagree I think they're speaking in a hyperbolic tone they're flamboyant that's what they're yes there's there's definitely some truth especially with Milo there's some of the things that he says it's all truth what like again I'm saying it right now what What did he say this factually incorrect well that wasn't a joke not not factually incorrect but extremely offensive to people like the thirteen-year-old boy comment like the thing about sort of normalizing relationships between grown men and thirteen-year-old boys right you know I think a big part of why he even says that is because he's in many ways like a natural contrarian and in many ways a guy who wants to get a rise out of people and by saying that he didn't feel like there's any consequences to being outrageous in that regard right but I think we could both agree whether or not it's factual in his case it's a fucked up thing to say the fucked up thing to say it was negligent which is why I apologize but I think the grain of truth to that and with his other statements is a lot more than a grain but the grain of truth to what he was saying is gays have less chastity then straights and if a woman is known as a slut she's less likely to be picked up and I've been sued for calling woman a slut were you really yeah who sued you it was a long time ago back in Vice days it was in do's and don'ts and the the way the the law is it's kind of antiquated but it's like oh you called her a slut now she won't have currency in the market of marriage well she's known as a whore so we're gonna punish you punitive ly for this sin did you have to settle yeah what there's no chocolate word for a man no a CAD that's a compliment that's hilarious yeah a cat is hilarious well the fact that there's no equipment for a man shows you that there's a different standard and then with gays it is different to like 13 year old and an older person right if it's a girl and a 40 year old teacher I want to take him the parking lot and beat him til he has a weird he walks weird yeah if it's a woman and a boy I don't want to murder her grossed-out 13 especially 14 a little better and then with gays well I'm not gonna make the same mistake my love made right now don't ever do it but if a gays no one is a slut in the future like say a 19 year old fucks 200 people as a woman no one wants to go near as gay you've been around the block yeah there's not the same consequences for sure and I had a bit in my act about I don't know if you remember this commercial but there was a commercial just for men commercial where there was a baby that was driving a Porsche a baby with a beard and there was a grown woman next to the baby and the baby has like a tuxedo on and it's like you've always wanted the biggest that is beard and the baby goes to the nightclub and the bouncer looks and winks and I'm like look at this look at this commercial see they're babies yeah so the baby walks in just four men I mean I don't know what the fuck just four men if you don't know it is some stuff that guys put in their yard when they're getting old so this baby's got a bottle he goes out to the dance floor there's all these girls with these tiny little skirts dancing around him and he's like he's like a pimp and he's with this hot woman and this is me my bit was this is proof positive proof positive there's no sexual equality when it comes to child molesting because if you even wrote that down with the sex is reversed if you wrote it down you're fucking going to jail okay there's a little baby girl and she goes out to a roomful of guys who are wearing Tarzan's skirts and they're all swinging dicks around her and she's got a bottle and they're all fighting for her attention and kissing her on the cheek you would go to fucking jail but that was a commercial that aired on mainstream television no one cared about it that commercial aired for years it's probably still on now and that commercial is proof positive that we have a completely different attitude towards a grown woman who's hot as fuck and a little baby yeah well even I was watching big with the kids the other day Tom Hanks is what ate in that movie 9:00 and then that woman seduces him but I guess he fucks her he got a boner and I'm like you're raping a child exactly why are we watching when she's hot she's hot he looks like a man so just let it ride Wow it up if that movie was reversed and it was a young girl that all sudden was in a sexual woman's body and the guy was fucking her she's like I don't know are we supposed to be doing this you would be horrified you would be absolutely horrified I've been arguing about because of the my love thing when arguing about all this and a lot and I've been getting from gays and guys are those kids that are young this whole thing about how they keep saying come on don't lie you would definitely want to fuck a 13 year old girl if she was hot and I go I don't know where this became a normal sentence I fucked 17 year olds when I was 17 it was the worst sex you didn't even know when it was in nobody knew what was going on yeah it's not like they go yeah fuck didn't like it till they were like 26 I want pendulous breasts I want a divorcee with a neck pendulous like worn out just for pencils hang hanging hanging low for I want like cocks when she's on all actually I don't want to see them swing because I'll come if I look at this I'm talking about like a orange in a sock okay I mean like it's got meat there but they droop right you like when your fucking ever mind they go in different circles yes they've experienced well I want to play tennis with a toddler yeah I want to play test with someone who can return a serve yes good point yeah I I don't know get that yeah come on you never been attracted to a fifteen-year-old girl like I don't I really don't get that but now I was molested by a woman when I was 13 years old oh shit when I was 13 years old there was a woman that we used to play softball with on our block and apparently she did it to a lot of boys and she took me up to her room she played me some really good music she introduced me to a lot of Led Zeppelin she introduced me to comfortably numb Floyd this day when I think about that song I think about making out with her but she was 21 and I was 13 oh she just kissed you know I should grab my dick but I was just so little I didn't know fuck I was doing no no I was so confused I was 13 I was like a little boy you know if she'd caught me like a year or two later I would probably have fucked her but that at that stage I was baffled because I had like zero sexual experience and then all sudden a woman a 21 year old woman with tits and smoked cigarettes and she's making out with me and taking me up to a room is really weird and she had a boyfriend and her boyfriend was a construction worker and he was a man I remember seeing him like on the job he has shirt off and had a hairy chest I was like what in the fuck and that was her boyfriend but she was just a wild woman and she apparently liked taking young boys that didn't know what they were doing and taking him up to her room you know this is why we have judges cuz there's different cultures different genders different circumstances every time I talk to a black guy about their first sexual experiences if my hair is whitened why it's always like yeah he's fucking my cousin when I was like Chris cotton was talking about fucking his cousin was Chris cotton comedian guy okay dark is a piece of coal fuck his cousin sherrod small fucked his babysitter when he was like 11 or those stories before I've heard the babysitter story before where it's like you know you're 13 she's 18 and next thing you know you're making out with her holy shit but should she go to jail for 15 years well that's a big there's a big difference between an 8-year old 18 year old boy rather and an 18 year old girl and a 13 year old girl and a 13 year old boy there's just a big goddamn difference grown woman and a 13 year old boy like here's the thing here's the big one and this is like this is this it was one of the things that came up in the Milo conversation to where he was saying that it's not that big a deal if a man grabs a woman's tit and she doesn't want him to I'm like well that sexual assault if a woman grabs my dick and I don't want her to that might be sexual assault but I'm not in danger you know I'm saying that she's not gonna fuck me up she's not gonna rape me and that's where it gets different a mo ver and grabbed my ass like that you probably shouldn't do that but I'm not scared of you you know some but if a man does that to a woman and he's willing to violate her space like that a woman has a real fear there's a possibility what the the door might be open at this guy could rape her and this all comes down to the myth of equality and this is why the right is more has a more benevolent society than the left though and I've noticed this with girls I've always said you can hit a woman if she hits you 12 times that includes punches in the face so you just sit there in 1 2 3 12 11 12 and then one hit me 12 I'd have to arm drag her take a back choke her you choke a crazy woman who's trying to kill you but you can't punch well I would only do it if I thought they were hurting someone in my family well when I talk to feminists and liberals with this they go 12 1 and I go what what you know we're stronger than you right they don't want to mint that they don't admit that and it's the same with gays and it's the same like I was writing about remember the documentary dogfight DWG yeah and I'm looking at that that was Kimbo Slice and then and I'm diving onto Dada 5000 Dada 5000 yeah and I'm looking at going you guys were murdering each other on the streets you figured out a way to solve it with fights backyard fighting you shouldn't have the same enforcement as rich white kids doing it in the suburbs or at least that's what your instincts are when you see that now that doesn't make sense the laws should be equitable across the board but you go this is a different situation they're in a shitty situation they're murdering each other these backyard fights sure someone loses an eye but they're not murdering each other anymore it's an improvement and you go I don't know how to enforce this I don't know how it's done but you feel like there should be different laws for different people and when you say we're all exactly the same well the next thing you know women are getting punched one-on-one and they're not as strong as men so they're getting fucking beat them or you're telling women they're invincible they're going out and getting shit-faced like well you and I do and you go no you sure a Lamborghini you can't get wasted yeah you're delicate I'm a fucking cheap old 57 Chevy beat me up right right right well there's there's a narrative whether or not people are aware of it but there is something that is actually being thrown around as being a viable narrative and that is that there's no biological difference between men and women there's no biological difference between the sexes and when you see people say it it's I saw there was a debate that Jordan Peterson had and one of the people he was debating was a professor from the University of Toronto and it was a gender equality professor or something on some bizarre discipline and I think it was a transgender man like she was born a woman and then she's a man or maybe yeah I'm pretty sure it's I'm not sure but it seems like it anyway it's a very feminine man whatever it is and it seems like a woman that became a man and it she/he whichever how Z Z Z whatever Z and literally arguing knowing that this is going to be broadcast knowing this is gonna be on television on the internet saying that there's no difference there's no biological basis and like that's insane there's there's no difference between men and women it is absolutely insane it's absolutely insane there are no women who come anywhere near what men powerlifters can do they don't come anywhere near they might be stronger than you or I they they might because they're doing it for a long time and they're taking steroids but even the women who take steroids there are nowhere near as strong as the men it's not even close there's no women who are in the NFL there's no women heavyweight boxing champions they they're never gonna beat the men there's there's an absolutely a biological basis in sex I have trained extensively with women in martial arts extensively there is a enormous difference in how hard they hit there's an enormous difference in how strong they are I feel like I could beat them up there's a lot it would fuck you up I was like I couldn't beat up Ronda Rousey but I feel like I could beat up the base no a lot of featherweights most of them would fuck you up but it's just a technique thing you know if if you had trained as long as them they would be in trouble it's just there's a lot of factors stranger didn't yes well I got in shit for saying it because there was a man who transitioned to a woman after 30 years of being a woman after fathering a child being in the military the whole deal go living life as a man became a woman for two years and then started having MMA fights with women and not telling them that he was a woman for 30 years she was a woman for 30 years then became only I'm like that's fucking crazy and the structure of the body is different the hips are different the jaw is different that the size of the hands is different the size of the fists is an enormous difference when I tween the power that a man can generate when I see that tranny pounding the living shit out of a woman looks like domestic violence disturbing yeah I see it on the TV and I go there you go liberals there's your utopia what do you think and that's the problem with their utopia it keeps making things worse and worse and worse for them yes like even abortion and immigration in Canada now they're pouring all these Indians in like pancake batter and Indians prefer to have boys than girls and they're starting to have gender-based abortions where they go I don't want to have a boy I mean a girl hanging around here I'm good let's keep aborting till we get the boy and you go hey littles is that real yeah he liberals you it's it's mostly of immigrants but you know it's the beginning of ethnic genocide and you go hey feminists you're pro-choice shit is getting you fucking killed what that wasn't they're gonna become the next retards that wasn't the you know the reason why they wanted it in the first place they just wanted the right to choose they want someone to tell them and particularly in the most extreme cases like if a woman's raped like of a woman's raped and she gets pregnant she should not have to keep that baby they're taking right exceptions but that is the freaky that I'm sick of freak exceptions defining policies okay but it would you be would you be fine with those freak exceptions being law like if you're you you're a pro-life person right that's your stance sure okay would you be pro-choice if a woman was raped I'm not doing that anymore no no what do you mean I'm not playing that game anymore okay well I try to play to know what they do I know I know that is the your daughter they always inevitably especially with journalists I'll be talking about sexism blah blah blah and they'll go what if your daughter was blah blah and I go you're trying to make me irrational okay by bringing my just I'm not accusing you of this but it's like these liberals have these tricks we're like what if a girl was raped by her father and she got pregnant and I looked it up I could only find one case one case in America of a father impregnating a daughter and I thought this freak occurence keeps defining the whole debate we got Kermit Gosnell killing 40,000 babies that were in their third trimester yet this one man is who's uh he was the guy's he's uh he was arrested for performing a late-term abortion abortions and they discovered that it was sorry 40,000 is my personal estimate of the whole country but I think he did hundreds and hundreds now I understand what you're saying that you don't want to get roped into any crazy sort of hypothetical scenario where you say what if it was your daughter and she was raped by some convict who just got a you know I'm saying yeah I know you don't want to get into that but in in certain circumstances I really think there's a there's there's a difference between someone who's pregnant for three weeks and someone who's pregnant for five months there's a big difference yeah like with the motion I just want to get it get get it away from 17 weeks I like I want to get it down I want to get the whole argument down to eight weeks hey that's my goal okay soul I have friends in New York City where everyone has to think outside the box and they're all like yeah it's murder and I'm for it like Jim goat says that all the time J Anthony cou Mia says that it's murder and I think it's awesome well that's because he doesn't want to be responsible and he fucks a lot of crazy girls problem I mean I've been too super fortunate that the the person that I had babies with I love yeah I mean cou Mia has got to take a lot of blame for the shit in Reno we all told him to get the fuck away from her right he kept walking back into the fire fun and I would see him with her and it was like a fucking rape victim being with their rapist like I go oh what is that doing here and she's got five high stockings I can get you a 35 they're not fun he I have a friend my friend Tony Tony Zahra from Columbus Ohio good buddy mine who's a great guy but he's also a wise man and he has had this theory about psychotic and erotic and they're almost the basically almost that's true interchangeable that they sort of rotate on each other's axis and that when you get like we've all had gals from the past that were just like whoa you know you leave their apartment you go holy shit right yeah I gotta take a shower I gotta cool down jasmine yeah and then they start you know calling you later like come over and fuck my mouth like what Jesus Christ like the crazy one so what do I want you to take a teaspoon and scoop the comma off their face yeah they can get yeah this is only gonna happen once in my life but here we go and those girls exist and some of them are really fun and when you're a guy and you're used to girls that are like no don't come in my mouth no don't touch me there no I'm not good you know there's like some so many people are so reserved and so restricted and so so confined and then you date some crazy girl and she's just wild she's like put in my ass like whoa where we going with Anthony she was that and then some and Artie was like framing little kids who were at the house like I think she got one of them got marker on him and or she she put sparkles in his hair or something and the mother goes what the hell's going on with your hair you got that's gonna take forever to get out and she goes it was her and blamed some ten-year-old no evil Evil's dark shit she had done but that being said so that's going too far but I do agree wholeheartedly and when my friends tell me they dumped some bitch cuz she's crazy I get mad at them because I go you crazy bitches are the best sex you'll ever have in your life if she's not calling the cops then fucking her but that's well your hypocritical then because that's that's the gaim it's the balance the point where they call the cops X should be right before that you should see the judge in the room floating above your house going with the gavel like see nobody wants to say that and there is a reality and here's another reality it's super uncomfortable reality and this is and I want to just get real clear about this this is in no way condoning any form of rape or any form of sexual assault or any form of doing anything to anyone male or female against their will that said there are women who undeniably have rape fantasies yes so what's that margaret atwood talks about that and she says yes but in our rape fantasies it's not a guy with a ski mask who jumps out of a bush right fat and ugly it's mr. clean and he's cleaning our house and then he says hey i want to make love to you and you're going no no no ah yeah but that's her though some some women it's a guy comes in with a gun and makes her suck his dick there's i've had a friend who that was her thing we've all everyone louis c.k does a bit about that we've all had women where they're like no no no and then you stop and they go you find out the next day no no you were supposed to oh yeah yeah Louis had that thing like I'm not gonna take a chance to find out if it's your thing I got an email like talk about this all the time but I got an email from a girl that said thank you for raping me last night but that might be that like right up Billy to that well like that and they might be joking around oh yes of course she was but that was her way of saying you got right to the line but I noticed this when I moved to New York to I was went to college in the 90s when it was about permission and feminism so I tried that I was like do you is this okay is this so you were a feminist and let's be clear about that you were a feminist at one point your life would you define yourself as a feminist I still would in many ways I see them as magical sentient beings they're wizards they can make a fucking person come out of their cunt and to say they're dudes is to trivialize it it's like saying to Clark Kent just be a journalist just focus on your journalism and Clark Kent's a shitty journalist you're a shitty man does he have one story that he brought with story ever he's right on time backwards oh that's right but he's never broken a story but we keep telling woman no no come to our meetings come to our tough mudder relay and walk through electrical wires and Goethe underneath oh that's so nasty by the way.you tough mudder people doubt fucking water you would never drink you would never drink puddle water right right yeah of course you wouldn't well guess what fuckface you're getting that water in your mouth when you're crawling around that same shit that you would get in your intestinal tract you're gonna get in your mouth and you're gonna get sick as fuck okay so be goddamn careful when you're doing those things seems like a weird beef to have no sebacean tough mudder people that puddles are way too I gotta be really careful about drinking pot of water like you I know guys have gotten Giardia they've gotten like some serious intestinal disorders from drinking water yeah well you're out in the mountains you go out in the mountains and like they don't bring water with them or their water filter breaks or they put these iodine tablets in the water but they don't wait long enough and they drink it and you're getting these live bacteria in your body and they wreak havoc with your system I mean put you out for months okay okay I won't drink puddle water please so anyway your fucking chicks and through trial and error there's that time around 24 and your fucking girl from behind and you go yeah you like that and you go I'm gonna try a dad thing just and then you go who's your dick like that daddy's fuck and then all of a sudden pussy juice galore just coming and you go oh okay I'm gonna keep mining this vein right your father blob I start saying shit like that and then you start shut and then you come to New York and Jewish girls in New York they're like choke me kill me I'm a fucking whore what all right slap me and you're like um just like that no harder you fucking pussy see those though those girls never made their way to me oh really yeah fuck girls in New York no I did but I think I I don't know maybe I don't know man maybe I just shine away from them or something like that I had some domestic violence in my house when I was growing up so any kind of shit like that I was like well that's kind of what I'm saying we don't naturally go there we're sweeties I had one girl that like to get choked though but it always weirded me out we don't we're not that enthusiastic about it but if they wanted to dress like clowns I would put on the little nose yeah it is you get into it after a while you it's awesome but I don't want to get choked by someone who knows how to choke you though you want to get choked by someone is ineffective like a sloppy choke where you could still breathe well I remember us fucking this Jewish girl and she was she said kill me whoa cheese and obviously I didn't do that and then she's like I'm your fucking horrid as welcoming owners like I'm your dirty whore Wow and then she's having a cigarette after and she goes I brought your horror by the way I was like duh and I thought the Liberals now are ruining that whole role-playing fun game that we all play and sex is a nebulous it's like religion it's personal it's private it's a weird area where you do weird things you say yeah but shit like I want to lick your cock yes you're thinking I wanna you just suck my cock and on a lick your pussy but I'm so horny your brain goes yeah I wanna lick your balls sorry yeah dirty talk is so awkward I'm so fucking stupid I just can do like so good love it heaven yeah but it's also it's like when you're intimate with someone it's like but you're you're sharing that extremely vulnerable moment I mean it's look it's vulnerable because you don't have your clothes on you know and just you feel weird you know we always have our clothes on yeah we don't have our clothes on it's just odd you know and they look funny nude yeah you're funny you look funny and you're aroused and it feels good and you're you want the other person to feel good you feel good to each other and it's just you're looking at each other's eyes and you're like that close it's like it's very strange and there's other there's also the issue that people become very addicted to each other I think human beings especially when they're having sex with each other it's just like a drug addiction I mean I remember the first time love is in a lot of ways I think it is I think there's a lot of there's a lot of endorphins that are being exchanged and there's a lot of arousal chemicals that are excreted when you're with that person that are extremely potent and when the persons not there there's this deep need to get to that person again just like a drug just like you know someone who's got hooked on pain pills and you just you have to get the pills you got to get the and I remember when I was in when I was like 18 my girlfriend broke up with me and I just graduated from high school and I was really lost and confused and when she broke up with me I was devastated I couldn't believe I had to be without her and it was very much like withdrawal from a drug it was like probably the worst breakup for me ever because it was the first one you know and I was like I can't believe this like this is crazy and then I just was amazed at like how potent it was on my system you know how it would fuck with my psyche in my mind I felt like a loser I felt like if this girl didn't want me like I I must be fool I must be a failure yeah well that's the we've all had that yeah that's where you learned never to be vulnerable again and you learned to be a man sort of but you also learn to me I've always been fascinated by psychology and fascinated by the inner workings of the mind and the tricks the mind plays on you because all throughout high school from age 15 on I was competing in martial arts tournaments and they were terrifying you know and so I was always scared and I would go from I mean I'd like to say that I was as bad motherfucker I wasn't scared of shit I was scared of fucking everything man that's why I was good because I was terrified and I was always training super hard and I wouldn't drink and I wouldn't do anything I wouldn't I smoke pot maybe a couple of times because I was fucking scared of getting killed I was scared of getting my ass kicked so when this happened and this girl broke up with me it was so dug just devastating to my to to my confidence and I remember thinking like god why do I feel like such a fucking loser and then breaking it down and try to figure like how was I a winner just like a few months ago and now I'm a loser like in my mind I feel like a fucking loser and I can't get laid girls smell desperation I mean they run for me like ah like like 18 year old girls when you're desperate they fucking they Smet you stink like a sewer and they run from you I couldn't get laid for like six months I couldn't even get close its nature you you played yourself you were vulnerable you learned to never do that again and I think adult men especially married men have to understand that you're constantly in high school when you're married it's not a deal akin when I was eight years old he said dude when you're married you can just go up to your wife and go see your tits then she has to show you her tits right there and I thought I cannot fucking wait I remember saying put my face in her vagina and just go boo but you can't do that if I wanted my wife and said show me a tit she'd say fuck off so you're constantly wooing in them in courting then I had a buddy who got divorced recently he said I just found myself having to draw lines in the sand and make these parameters around how I can be treated and how it can be spoken to and because I've never had to do that before I shouldn't have to do that and I go dude that's what marriage is you're constantly on a date I was on a date with my wife last night we got a hotel in the city or my kids are staying with their grammar here on vacation in Malibu and I was constantly going all right I wanted her to have a good night she wants to get tacos but also I have to draw the line and say no actually we're going here we're going to the Comedy Store we're gonna meet Don Barris and go upstairs and blah blah so I was giving her some democracy but also taking the reins and it's a push and pull that we've been married we've known each other since 2001 but it's constantly like this first date trying to get in her pants watch The Real Housewives pretend I care about that chick who has Pinot Grigio all the time you're not guaranteed the pussy no if you are you have a very strange relationship and you're probably not gonna be satisfied with it because that's part of what's going on in a relationship is that wooing is also like kind of that wooing and courting and and being nice to each other it's very important to like how the whole thing works yes it's what attracted like we were we're at Costa Rica almost stupid sansa flights that are one engine so if it goes out we're dying and the turbulence was insane and so she's gripping me and I'm like it's okay it's just a bus we're in a bus in the sky I am shitting my pants my heart is pounding through my chest and I'm holding her rationally explaining to her what is going on and then I'm looking out the window going holy fuck we're gonna fucking die we're gonna fucking die holy shit and I still married to her for years we got kids I have to convey this man in order to keep her pussy wet same with sons particularly but kids in general but so much of being a dad is being a prison warden and even after bedtime you're walking down the hallways to see if lights are on the other day I go into my son's my middle son's room I touch the lightbulb his reading light feel it's warm like what's going on in here were you reading he's like yeah little bit bedtime is bedtime when I'm back with my little fucking it was 10:30 at night and he's reading Mad Max one of those black Jack's thing when I was a kid cops Adam remember it was like it was a leather like paddle with a good shot yeah yeah people with it yes a really shitty weapon cuz it only hurts yeah okay knock knock someone out if you hit him on the jaw or the back of their head but if you're covering up and someone's whacking you with that black jacket it's so bad I'll take a shot with a black jack yeah try to get a hold of you but like a club like a club or a baton like that's gonna really fucking hurt a black jack is weird it's a weird weapon it kind of went away like yeah this isn't the best thing to be carrying around yeah I remember going to get one of those Arial sort of a things are dangerous those cops tell me I'm not allowed to have that you can have a leather man you could buy those yeah but you're not allowed to have it on you leather man and pepper spray or an ax mag light flashlight you can have wait a minute yeah like so you concealed carry mean he walking around you're not allowed to have one of those but you're allowed to have a knife you can have a knife of it's a utility knife and it's smaller than the palm of your hand I'm talking about New York rules right and then at nan Y you is going to do that talk I got pepper sprayed perfectly legal if they can argue that know who is that per sprayed you and did you see the person doing it do you know who they are they are all the same they're all middle class kids of professors they all live at home they all look exactly the same they look British how do you look British I don't know they have like these angular features and these Roman noses and glasses they all seem to look exactly the same nothing Italian about them you know now what was it that they pepper sprayed you about will you actually be talking and going by the Colombians I started this gang called the proud boys and boys the proud boys what is that what's proud boys about we have chapters all over the world chapters we get drunk and just it's like the Elks Lodge okay like Masons or whatever celebrating manhood yeah no women allowed oh wow I can't tell your woman what goes on two meetings and we have different degrees like the Knights of Columbus first degree you declare yourself a brow boy second degree we beat the shit out of you until you can name five breakfast cereals and yep masturbating and then third degree you still have to give up masturbating but you have to get a tattoo and then fourth degree you get arrested or in a serious violent fight for the Greeley's yes you get arrested and a serious violent fights you're promoting some sort of major altercation you shouldn't erase that part well we don't we don't encourage it but if you're defending Slyke at the at the Berkeley thing with Milo we just my guys just 14 them just walked into a mob of 200 people just to get their stripes said I thought you guys were tough no they were doing it just for fun and these people outside of pepper spray and clubs they can't fight like at the NYU thing my guys were beating them up and he goes this one guy we call Friar Tuck because he's just a monster he goes I started to feel like batting it I started feeling bad after a while because I was just I could tell these kids had never been in a fight and I was just mowing through them they're terrible fighters what is he fighting like this is what confuses me like why are they getting so angry that they're hitting people and spraying that girl on the Fate the girl was really disturbing because she was talking to someone she wasn't offering any threat and she she had a hat that looked like a make America great again hat but it said make Bitcoin great again they walk up to her the guy hits her with a stick that's holding a sign so he hits her in the head with a piece of wood and she's like what the fuck and someone sprays her in the face with pepper spray I mean it's like how in any way how could you ever in any other scenario justify beating a woman publicly for doing nothing but representing what you think is offensive and you're even wrong about what she's representing here's the problem with what you're doing and I did this too much to your intellectualizing a fashion movement this is the mods and the rockers in Brighton Beach in 1961 just fighting each other because one likes Elvis and the other likes the WHO and if you were to sit down with this mod in this rocker and say have a debate they wouldn't say anything they have nothing to say it's leather versus parkas it's Vespas worth versus triumph or motorbikes there's no context there so this guy is on this team and she on the other team and that their tool is pepper spray and that's what they're doing there's no that's they pretend oh I don't to give you a platform no they don't want to give you and anything because they don't have anything to say in fact at the end why you talk I after I watched the pepper spray I went and did the talk they're all screaming whose campus our campus and I walk over the mob with a microphone and I have to and I come on up come on up and it was a radioactive cock I was handing him like he just went oh it was a mic he shriveled up because he wanted to be a part of the big group right and didn't want to be an individual with an opinion and didn't exactly know why he was there in the first place exactly know what he was protesting against that's why like my love would kill to debate any of these people he's been scrounging from the real problem is that they're not debating that's the real problem I feel like this could be really productive if people could sit down and Milo by the way will debate you I mean he might say outrageous things he might say offensive things but he will debate he will sit in front of a podium he always time and anyone else will though that will have their time and they will be able to take questions from the audience and this could be very productive and you could kind of figure out like what you and I are not far left and we're not far right you know neither one of us are we're worse in some sort of a weird way I I think I'm more maybe more left than you are but I'm not as left as a lot of people I know and there's a lot of people out there and I think this left white right paradigm is really kind of fucking foolish at this point and we should kind of figure out like what's what's uh what's what kind of opinions are okay to have because they don't interfere with anybody else's life and it's just your philosophy and the way you look at the world you should be able to express that opinion and express those ideas in front of someone else who has an opposing idea and they tell you why they disagree and you should be able to consider why they disagree and see if there's any merit in that the problem you're with what you're saying is you're implying that these are all informed people right and left and they need to hash out ideas know these people on the right are intelligent people who have looked it up and wanted to bait you want to see some debate songket pat buchanan versus Sean Hannity or Peter Brimelow versus some open borders libertarian like Matt Walsh something or someone from The Wall Street Journal all the inner right fights are fascinating to me these people are religious fanatics they they if for them it's sports it's the Dallas Cowboys is there a team and they want to fuck up your team they don't want to debate like Jared Diamond who did Guns Germs and Steel tons of flaws with that book Steve Saylor was begging him for a debate he wouldn't answer Jared Jared Taylor John Derbyshire all these even Richard Spencer all these far-right guys have made it clear they love to argue with anyone on the other side and the other side knows that they will lose because their foundation is in truth or information their foundation is just emotions we're a nation of immigrants gays are people too and you're like you think I don't think gays are fucking people what is your point I don't even understand your side of things right well you I'm sure you saw that woman who's a middle school teacher who was a part of the protest at Berkeley yeah yeah she was on Carlson Tucker Carlson's show and she was talking about fascism and she said that Milo is homophobic even he's fucking gay yeah he's a racist homophobe who sucks black cock yeah it's so hilarious and she was also saying that he promotes genocide like you can't just throw those labels out and that that I mean it's a clear example what we're talking about cuz those labels allow her to do anything necessary to get you out right mix right and that's fascism that is fascism yeah that's authoritative that's authoritative thinking your authority Rhian thinking you know in a way that's eliminating someone else from expressing themselves because you have deemed them unworthy of expressing themselves they're off this is a racist this is a homophobe this is someone who promotes genocide we will shut them down like you that's that's nonsense and you could see from her talking on that show that she she talks over him she doesn't express herself well she doesn't have clearly thought-out reasons for why she's saying no he does these things she doesn't have quotes and she's relying on she doesn't say why it's so dangerous that he has these controversial opinions she just says he's a Nazi he's a racist he's a homophobe he promotes genocide we're gonna shut him down what you just say that you can't just label people because someone could do that to you too and they will they will that's the problem I forget her name Michelle you've Ellis what her name is by any means necessary but game I like playing with these people is play it through they do that at AAA they go you want a beer okay have a beer then you can have another beer then you're gonna get coke and the heroin but a lot play it's right and I always say these people play through so he wants genocide Trump wants genocide okay so he wants to kill what blacks and Mexicans so there's a van that drives to this house in New Orleans and picks up these black people and then they what they go to a gas chamber how does this work what happens to their property is that divvied up does a state own that now like are you talking about the Cuban Revolution the irony is by the way whenever you start describing their universe you end up describing Venezuela Cuba socialist countries or you end up describing the Middle East oh he's gonna what throw gays off buildings he's gonna start stoning women to death there were rape victims you have your villains right there but you're purposely ignoring him and the other thing that's going on here which is still a theory I'm working on but there seems to be a disturbing peak at what a matriarchy would be like and I'm seeing a lot of women in these movements who are sort of vindictive and and cruel and like this woman we're talking about you know you watch these videos and you hear like these women voices from behind the crowd and I called him shit chessy likes that woman from the University of Missouri can I get some muscle over here yeah remember her yeah yeah yeah yeah she wants men to fight on her behalf and you know Iron Man has that blue thing in his chest yeah I don't think women are evil I like our women are like iron man they're magic right but by ripping out that blue thing you're ripping out their ability to have children and be mothers and everything and then you put in a piece of shit into Iron Man's Chest that's what feminists and like this woman are their shit chests and they're malfunctioning robots you know akela Milo wants genocide killed so do you think that they're imitating what they think are patriarchal societies they're doing their version of it and that's what they're doing with this the whole matriarchal posturing yeah it's like Clark Kent I want to write an article uh I'm writing no you're not writing an you go Clark simmer down dude you write your article I'm doing mine no any crunches oh there's not a whole lot of matriarchal societies in the animal world other than hyenas I tried there's a few of them there's a few where the females are larger than the males a few bugs especially but hyenas in particular the female hyenas are much larger than the males they even have fake dicks we have a faux penis he has this big large tube fake dick that hangs down they actually give birth out of it and they climb on top of the males and they fuck them and the speculation what there's a lot of speculation as to why the females are bigger but mm-hmm one of them is that they think that she has to be bigger because cayenne is are so goddamn ruthless they eat their babies Oh so the female has to go get the fuck away from the baby good then she gets on top of books I mean pieces it's my baby I mean it's there's no more you know no pun intended dog-eat-dog world than a fucking hyena world you're out there fighting for scraps with lions yeah well I actually have described an tyfa and these people as hyenas because that thing I was talking about at Berkeley where our guys went in and said I thought you guys were like tough or something was his exact quote and they're going to get him get him fuck him up and then the guys sort of give up cuz no one wants to fight them they start walking away and then someone runs up behind him knocks him out with a flagpole as they're screaming these Italian slogans by the way like know why she stopped before she stopped Oh from the 1920s they're having fun game they're LARPing and then knock him out and then as soon as he's out that the hyenas come out then they start kicking his unconscious body and they start grabbing they're really like we're little yeah it's online you can find weird little ugly Savage it's a scary thing man you're gonna invite right-wing people to do the same thing and you're gonna get some some veterans and you're gonna get some fighters and you do and it's it's gonna it's gonna be horrific man it's gonna be horrific and again you start kicking their ass and then they're gonna come back with weapons and people are gonna show up with guns it always leads to someone showing up with guns maybe and if this keeps going and these these protests especially the things like the Milo protest me maybe now that Milo has been humiliated and at least temporarily sidetracked or put down for a bit while he has to rebuild maybe someone could come along and have reasonable dialogue and do some sort of a campus but I don't like I know why is he doing these things on campuses first of I don't think he gets paid for most of them what my theory with Milo is I think his eyesight's getting worse his glasses are getting thicker and thicker and he's sort of going this is my moment to make an impact so he's just so you think he's going blind I think so yeah what are you just theorizing this yeah it's like 28 yeah but you look at amis they're insane really yeah and they're getting thicker maybe it's stress stress Ming his eyes worse I don't know I can't think it would be good but I think he's trying to make a maximum impact in a short amount of time because you think he doesn't have much time left that's such a witty seemed healthy in fact when we were in Orlando we made out at the site of the you guys made out yeah at this Milo to offend Muslims Wow so I said bullseye did a big speech about freedom and vegetation this America delicious like strawberries well at least she freshens breath up before no gays just taste better I said fuck Islam and then we made out at the site of the Orlando shooting to annoy Muslims but we had armed guards and stuff and I said all right I want to make sure these guys are scoping out the ruse and shit yes and he goes I don't care if I die I'll happily die for this I was like well I do care actually I've got three kids what is it Neil is amor nihilism I always say it wrong I always say nihilism nihilism that nihilistic sort of instinct that he has he has a burn it all down instinct and I think he has that with his life as well and I think a lot of that I'm playing some serious bro psychologist here you know some armchair psychology from someone totally unqualified but you've got to attribute that to in at least in some ways being molested as a child I would imagine that his experience is that he's calling positive experiences when he was young in many ways those could have potentially damaged him and also being young and being homosexual and being rejected all of those things wreak havoc and you develop this fuck you I want to burn it down and this is one of the strategies that he sort of adopted that strategy to be this guy who was very difficult for like he's he's gay he's an English gay guy who's a right-winger I mean it's it's so baffling to them they don't know what to do they hate it because they see blacks and gays as their little pets and they like putting them on the front lines and going to look at who were helping and then when one of them defects to the other side they become particularly outraged but very few defect at the level that he's defected right I mean he turned around and started attacking direct I who bankrupted BuzzFeed with the Hulk Hogan lawsuit Peter Thiel named the hill yet teal Tia the Silicon Valley billionaire he's on Trump's sort of board right isn't he he's one of the people that Trump is appointed to help him with technology or something I think so there's some sort of see if you get fun with it it's pull it shit up Jamie there's some sort of a position that he has man he's an interesting one because he's a gay man and he's a hugely successful entrepreneur billionaire character so he's what he's a weird one too like these guys that get that they're supposed to like if you're gay you should be on the left if you're you know if you are you know transgender you should be on the left like when Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner and said he's still against gay marriage everybody was like what the fuck what in the fuck he's a trump supporter and he's against gay marriage but now call me Caitlyn and that was my favorite part was and they asked him like like Ellen like really sort of grilled him on it he goes we're all more we're traditionalist well you definitely aren't you fuck well that makes sense to me though because if you see women as so special that it's a major thing to go over there then you must have a 1950's view of a lady that the Doris Day girl with a poodle skirt doing the vacuuming because liberals and and college students just go you and I are chick so but I don't see it as a long jump but Bruce Jenner sees it as this massive pole-vault peter thiel yeah sure Peter Thiel tiel adds allies to Trump transition so it says starting to make his mark on trump's transition team teal a billionaire investor and Facebook board member joined the transition team days after the election and gradually bringing in other members of a circle while teal clashed with Silicon Valley during the campaign by endorsing Trump early this group may be the strongest or only bridge between the tech industry and the president-elect oh this is to me while Gavin's painting this is to me the most volatile time that I can ever remember like the most vulnerable I felt like our country is like as a nation like as a structure as a traditional structure like President and Vice President Congress and Senate now that Gavin's return I was just saying that I think this is the most vulnerable I've ever felt like this country is in terms of like its structure yeah I just seen is this so divided clean up I feel great yeah why do you think it's a clean up and what in what way Trump hiring people as heads of departments that hate that department I hate the government I want it reduced to almost nothing right so when you have someone in the Department of Education that likes charter schools and hates public schools I go get in there just start dismantling the unions the teachers unions start tearing them to shreds make it possible to fire a teacher let's get the free market and that is actually wonderful it is a huge issue I have a friend whose daughter is going to the school and he is absolutely furious because the the teacher has tenure you literally can't fire them unless they commit some sort of a felony and this woman doesn't give a fuck about her classes and he was describing like how negligent she is as a teacher and how how careless and how little effort she puts into it because she has the class it's hers it's like a free paycheck and she's just not the type of person that's committed to her work and she can't be fired and he's so furious and so frustrated with the public's school system and how it all works that he's gonna pull his daughter out and put her in a private school now yeah I had to do that too I got a I call it the $40,000 post I know what I got a post no no my daughter's homework said you're awesome why oh you are no way yep public school she also got no Merkers because my daughter used markers on a homework Emmy RK no Merkers this is a teacher yeah Wow well if you don't have that squiggly red line underneath your text it's very difficult to tell what the fuck you just said and what's wrong with that does it bother UMP thing bother you with the tax returns no no though that bothers me a lot really yes because I want to know how much money he makes from Russia he's got significant business ties with Russia apparently were you concerned about Hillary's ties with Russia no look look mom I'm no Hillary supporter by any stretch of the imagination III think she's impossibly corrupt I think she represents this system where people get to a place of influence and they use that influence to make massive amounts of money by giving speeches to bankers and finding ways to profit and look they're shutting down the Clinton Foundation right you wear that yeah yeah I mean this is the whole thing was a big as soon as she doesn't have any power anymore gee how weird that this whole thing is shutting down it's a pay to play scheme yeah and that's really what it's been the entire time and everyone knows that but it's one of those things where the left didn't want to talk about it because weakens our position it strengthens the right but by not talking about it it makes them extremely vulnerable as well so I'm no supporter of anything that she stand for or bill stands for especially now but he he makes me nervous their skin they're spending more money on travel and he complained how much of Obama spent on travel oh the trumple have spent more money on travel in the first seven months then Obama did in the entire eight years he was in the White House because he's flying back and forth tomorrow LA go back and forth to Manhattan he's doing whatever the fuck he wants is flying his kids when his kids have to fly to do business for him when they're opening up casinos it's all Secret Service everything is being done with taxpayer money it's he is the most very sistent Lee threatened president in history I mean that the Daily Mail printed this no sorry the daily news in New York this list of how many people would have to be killed to get to a Democrat and they go we're just throwing this out there just so you can see would have to be this person and then this the vice president and the secretary then Swiss master Charles blah blah blah blah blah and you go why are you publishing hit lists why would they do that cuz the people man I've seen it all over the place people will read it Canadians are talking about it too like let's just take him out we got to be taken out comedians there's Michael Moore said something strange could happen but he's got some crazy Behar said something like that - well that was Sarah Silverman - she had this thing she was she was advocating she was saying that once the military steps in the Mad King will no longer be there you do not want the fucking military to run the country ever do you understand what that means if they can kill the president they can kill you - do you you have to be absolutely out of your fucking mind to want the military to step in and run the country you are advocating a military dictatorship because by the way that's what happens in the military comes over when they take over you don't get a vote there's no fucking vote now that's all gone the people with the guns are now running things and they do whatever the fuck they want it's very inconvenient for them to have to sit down and listen to people who go to Largo on Tuesday night to watch Sarah Silverman speak like it's very inconvenient for them to take your opinion into consideration and they're not going to well the implication there - is that she's running it like General Brigadier Judd Apatow yeah he's calling up the commands got General Patton Oswalt I just don't think there are tanks they haven't thought it they never think it's true because it's just religion it's all platitudes it's all mods and rockers made up shit what's also there's a lot of posturing online when you're making these statements online you're doing it - not just because you have something to say which I believe there's something there but also because you want love you want people to to like what you're saying you want people to retweet it you want people to say hey that guy is really on the ball that girl is really on top of politics yeah you go girl you know you're saying the right things yeah fuck him we got together but they're not that they're not thinking this thing out you had a contest there's a fucking contest the person that you had go against the person that you were you didn't want to win sucked so the person who won won the fucking contest you can't just come in and say now the military has to take over because I don't agree with the results of the contest yeah we have a country the country trailed with 350 million people enough with your shitty electoral college system decided that this guy should win the contest he won he won fucking fair and square whether or not the Russians were involved in hacking the DNC take that aside look at it for what it is because what the Russians exposed was fucking corruption and I don't they obsessed with these emails and I go you know that's not what lost it for her there was no real smoking gun there was there was what's her name doneita coming with questions for CNN there was Jeff tapper looking dirty in there there was a Jake Tapper looked dirty from he it looked like he was getting questions talking points from the DNC it was shit up yeah there was um there was also the the very clear collusion where they were making sure that Bernie Sanders did not win the primaries right that was where it was most disturbing to me because that leads through emails yes okay yes yeah I mean she did something corrupt yeah she correct and they're saying well the Republicans didn't didn't get exposed and well the implication is the Russians had something on there but there was a deal but how do you know that's the case they might not have done anything illegal that's also possible it's possible it's possible that if you look at the very minimal amount of things that were done by the DNC there's just a few incidents none of them landed anybody in jail right so I think we can't kind of agree that whether or not they're corrupt they're fairly minimal even though you are fucking with democracy I mean that's what you're doing when you're rigging the primaries you're fucking with democracy no one went to jail so the worst case scenario that they were a tribute that was attributed to them was still not enough to warrant a criminal investigation or jail time then you have the other side and you're supposed to assume that their side was more egregious or was it equal and just not exposed like what look all the shit that was exposed look at all look at that Billy Bush interview you tell me that's not worse than anything that was exposed on the other side as far as like public opinion it seemed to doesn't anymore I don't know why it was just a dumb joke but it seemed to be that's what that March was it was a pussy joke March looked like one because of transgender bathrooms he won because of the aggrievement industry he won because of the liberal media spinning stories he won because we're all sick of governor bomber care Obama cares a lot of factors there was so much animosity built up against the establishment that when Rodney Dangerfield showed up in tartan pants and today you owe what someone stepped on a duck we all went that fucking guy I want him to come in and just blow it all up and let's start from scratch if it wasn't leaked but the but the ties to the Russians that doesn't bother you at all no the fact that he won't release his taxes it doesn't bother you at all no that bothers me because we should know where money comes from but look at what they do look at this obsession with reframing things like Milo's sentence has been construed to mean he wants thirteen year olds to have sex all the time with adults every time they get a like what Ann Coulter said are blacks are better than their blacks she meant conservative blacks tend to be more well researched because they get a hammering at Thanksgiving from their family and they're not conforming to the majority of their race so they tend to be heartened that gets construed in to Ann Coulter thinks we still have slaves and then blacks so you can just see the way these tax returns especially in an era where we seem to hate entrepreneurs and we seem to hate wealth and me I've heard so many people criticize Trump saying he's a billionaire or the Betsy DeVos she's a billionaire and you go since when is that a fucking insult that's the only thing everyone on earth wants to be well okay I mean you're kind of setting up a bit of a straw man with that because I don't think that's just what people are challenging and what people are upset about with Trump what they're upset about is that they believe that he might be influenced by foreign governments that have a vested interest in controlling our democracy and that's what the Russian thing is scary if he's making considerable amount of money in Russia and a considerable amount of money in China you have to wonder whether or not he will be influenced by that financial tie by those financial ties and whether or not that that will influence way the policy that he creates in this country whether or not he allows things to happen that we don't think should happen just so that he can profit valid concern but it's not proven yet and if it is proven we'll drag him out of the white house by his heels right but don't you think that the only way you're ever gonna really prove that is by seeing his taxes you have to you have no I don't understand how business works we that's why I bring up this Aintree anti entrepreneurial age like with the bankruptcy laws in the 90s everyone was taking advantage of bankruptcy laws because the government was so bad at its job so they Trump had to go on board the same with his manufacturing his ties in China I've tried to make things in America like toy dolls if they were gonna be 17 times the price if we didn't make them in China so it wasn't like it would be a challenge it just wasn't possible once that system is like that you have to add ear to that system if you're gonna eventually change it and I think people gonna see these tax returns they don't know what the fuck they're doing and they're gonna go oh here's proof that he's in bed with these people but well some people are gonna be able to analyze them and come up with accurate assessments of where he's being influenced and where he makes money and why that could be a problem and why could be a conflict of interest but we should be able to have that information and every single president before him has been forthcoming with that information financial loser maybe but he said he was gonna release it up until the moment where he got in and then he said no why should I yeah I guess if you don't think they should force him to release the texture she to me like these these people that they're worried about foreign influence we had Hillary showing us her foreign Atheneum right we showed her selling the presidency having Bill Clinton do a talk about that doesn't exonerate Trump right no but where were you then you preneur do you write you're right you know we're not talking to them right we're talking to me and I'm not a left-wing Hillary supporter and in any way shape or form I just think that if we're gonna have a president we have to have some pretty universal rules that we follow and one of them should be the president should be beyond influenced by foreign governments and that's really there's really not a whole lot of ways to tell what's influencing you other than tax returns so you you're implying that in these tax returns you're going to see massive checks from Rush I'm not saying that I'm we should find out I mean you should absolutely you're you're the president you shouldn't it's it's very eroding it rose the public confidence if you hide that if you conceal that if you don't tell us where you have your money stored you don't tell us where you're where you're making money where you have bank accounts where you where you know there's there's a lot of factors involved in a guy like Trump was running a massive global empire and if if we don't know like where he's being influenced through his financial connections I I feel it I feel like that's really problematic and I think it's it's it's a real dangerous thing to deny it because it's always been a it's always for spend what presidents do and we've always said it was a good thing and I always thought it was law I thought it was mandatory I never knew that there was places under there under there being an under audit I thought that was over he says it's still going and it's been going since the 70s or something like that or no that's hilarious so he just has to keep the audit going and then he doesn't have to tell us yes I mean I understand your logic I just the bigger picture here is I think that people don't understand that he took a major hit and becoming president financially and I think that was part of the appeal Americans went holy shit you're putting it all on the line for us but he's not losing tons of my funds are running the business and I guess they're doing a great job doing it took a huge hit no oh yeah how so his residences the golf courses well that mar-a-lago the attendance is up and they raised the admission fee to $200,000 a year that's how much it cost now to join okay my understanding is the the brand with his residences and his golf clubs and everything else took a major hit and I understand that because it's like if you're in New York and you say we're a Mets mattress company well it doesn't it's not that people are anti met but now Yankees fans don't want your mattress so seeing anything political when you're a brand like that is going to lose you 50% of your followers and he went on limb and if he lost the election he still would have had that brand damaged without any of the benefits I'm one who saw him put everything on black and they went I appreciate you risking that has that been proven that his brand has been damaged like there's been any studies of like attendance or residency's drop that shit up it wasn't the people that owned condos in one of the Trump buildings tried to change the name in New York they literally ripped the word Trump off of their building they did do that right yep yeah they had construction lasers and people that owned condos in that building right so it's a it's a place where you buy the pole the New York's so weird like that you buy your apartment so strange but they pulled the Trump name down Oh whose whose idea is that and how to get away ward all agreed is a democratic decision and they said we don't want this they probably don't to be targeted to because I was there right after the election I just happened to be there because the UFC was there in Madison Square Garden right after the election so I've walked to the gym and when I came back it was like while we're in the gym the the riots or the parade the March started and so we walked back right in the thick of it and they were parked out in front of the Trump Tower just fucking screaming a bunch of fucking losers I saw no jump KKK racist sexist anti-gay this guy just kept screaming where did that even come from they they did another thing were they they first of all they danced out Friday outside of Mike Pence's house he's not even there like he gives a fuck you never said gays can't dance they start making out with each other for the Trump building like he's gonna go oh stop it from the Smurfs I ate that well it's the same thing we were talking about earlier with labeling Milo a Nazi and fascist and homophobic and promoting genocide if you just say those words and define someone you immediately put them in a nice box that you can attack right and so by someone you this guy was right next to me fucking screaming it Donald Trump KKK racist sexist anti-gay this was hilarious he saw a black guy coming he starts yelling black lives matter I was like oh you son of a bitch you fuck they come up with this concept that the president is Pro hate so then they go hey Trump I'm against hate and he goes that's nice so they build their straw man and then they're attacking him and letting him on fire and the rest of us are going I don't care that you're lighting a scarecrow on fire you look fucking ridiculous but it's not empowering there cause to be exaggerating about his stances on things like gay rights or any of these other things it's not empowering so you say he's KKK when you say he's anti-gay when you say he's racist without like real proof like you could say that he has said some very racist things about some Mexicans you can say that no you can well you could say that he was talking about all the rapists and the murderers that are comin over Senegal's who crossed the border the woman get raped they're at the point now where these women just take contraception as part of the deal it's almost like it's not rape at this point because it's a currency right people that are coming across he was saying they're sending their rapists and they are a Mexico has their own program where they send their criminals over the poor thing he did a good job of expressing that if that's what he really wanted to say and I think he could have been more measured and he could have done it in a way that would but that's not how he talks he could have done it in a way that would have removed any doubt as to what his intentions are how he feels about people right but it is chests like sometimes he talks like an idiot they're doing bad things mm-hm and then you realize four days later holy shit that was brilliant so with the Mexicans thing these Mexicans are rapists you go what and then you look it up and go holy shit eighty percent of these women get raped crossing the border by these coyotes holy crap and then another example of this him being four steps ahead is when he says he's trying to do this travel ban right Muslims are a threat to America and everyone goes that's crazy and then he says the press isn't reporting on the following terrorism cases this this this this he lists about twenty so then the media goes that's not true we were reported on this we reported on that we put on the London bombing we reported on Benghazi we reported on this and then he duped them into talking about terrorism for three days straight all of a sudden his travel ban looks pretty reasonable oh that's interesting so he's off he's often setting a trap for people that they come bounding into well whether or not he's doing it on purpose or whether or not just by finding things that he can say that back up his point he's starting that conversation off in a way that they wouldn't ordinarily start it might have been what happened with Sweden where he goes look what happened with Sweden last night on a particularly dead night in Sweden now you could say look how many blacks died in gang warfare today in Chicago it might be none today right but the average this year is - right and when you look it up and you go holy shit 780 people died in Chicago this year is today the 22nd there was a significant event on the 21st in Sweden massive yeah yeah yeah look Sweden it's got problems Europe has problems there they definitely do and whenever you have people from one culture that immigrate into another culture and they're disenfranchised and poor and they have really I'm just gonna keep going with it but and they also have a really restrictive fucked up culture that they're coming from and they want to impose that culture on the people that live in Germany or wherever and they want women to start wearing long dresses and they treat them like they're whores if they don't that's all fucking real dangerous they're from a different part of the world and it's a part of the world that hasn't changed much in a long time yeah and that part of the world I mean you could call it culture you can call it religious tradition but whenever you're dealing with a part of the world that still has honor killings and female genital mutilation and you don't let women drive and you know you women aren't allowed to vote and you have this incredibly restrictive world that your your existing in and then you bring that world somewhere else you're gonna have a culture clash and you're seeing that and this is this is you know if you want people to be free and you want people to have the ability to integrate into a more free culture like America is you also have to be honest about what the consequences are and you have to be honest about what kind of culture they're coming from and as soon as you talk about that you get labeled in Islamophobe soon as you can talk about this incredibly restrictive misogynistic culture that's based on an ancient ancient series of rituals and beliefs you become a racist and a bigot by talking about a reality like when they're not a race you're talking about culture and it's important to make that distinction as a Western chauvinist that I think the West is the best I don't care what race you are but I don't think that other cultures are different I think they're worse and Islam is 500 years behind us we were shitty we had witch hunts Inquisition we had the Inquisition they're doing they're not caught up to us yet they're not as advanced and I think two big problems with them as far as progress goes is the Koran is an exceptionally violent book it doesn't have a 2.0 the way Christians do and no one ever talks about this but they have a major problem with inbreeding they are marrying their first cousins again and again and again and that makes your evolution Gruber words is this true we're getting that from I never only Jenaya tea I think it's gone Muhammad said it's okay to marry your first cousin for real and you do that once or twice it's pretty bad and you do it for 40 generations and now you're going back in time look at Iran in 1965 miniskirts woman doing chemistry with test tubes driving around hi you want to go to the go-go hop later haha and now just garbage bags Oh Gregorian chants everywhere they've gone backwards in time and I blame obviously the the curtilage and the culture and religion but also I think inbreeding enables them to get hijacked by these radicals I mean we won guys you think they can beat snakebites in America you imagine them taking over Christianity do you think well there are people in America right that do do that still it's hilarious but they're not taking over America the way they took over the Middle East you think it's the same they're equivalent as far as their yeah I shut manji in uh the trouble with Islam she says a weird group of Wasabi's just hijacked their religion and sent it into the dark ages and I go yeah but how were they vulnerable to hijacking Christianity couldn't be hijacked by the snake guys so why and I think a part of it was inbreeding this is your own theory no no look at someone else in breeding major major problem never heard this especially with immigrants in Britain like the Pakistanis in London they'll have all kinds of serious inbreeding problems because that's an even smaller sample size you're dealing with oh and every time I bring this up people go yeah what about white people hillbillies they were inbreeding our royalty they were inbreeding and I go yeah and it went real bad it was a bad move learn the hard way we saw deliverance well this is the first I've heard of it but pull it up I'm sure I'm sure you're not lying you find anything something on Snopes popped up so Oh Snopes Snopes is aiive once I found out about the origins of Snopes and who's running Snopes the guy who married a prostitute and left his wife and didn't know the whole deal that guy's partying he married some woman who was an escort you never seen this story on soaps yeah the guy who ran Snopes ran it with his wife left his wife for a prostitute she's suing him because all the money he spent on prostitutes and now he married the prostitute and she's not a prostitute anymore now she works for Snopes and Wow I knew it was a husband-and-wife team I don't know that's how they met yeah yeah yeah now well there was a husband-and-wife team and now it's a husband with the new wife and then they're suing each other the ex-wife and the husband were suing each other over who gets the money some big crazy story but he's just got a big fucking smile on his face and he's hanging out with this girl used to be an escort and I I find that distasteful unless it's Richard Gere and Julia Roberts because they're gorgeous and then I like it well I think it's mate the best looking guy but the prostitute at one point the gal who worked as an escort I should say don't be disrespectful I dated an escort once did you holla while she was escorting no post post she was molested as a kid whoo so for sex for her we had to go super intense like public humiliation she wanted me to slap her in a grocery store and stuff oh Jesus because intimacy had been ruined by dad oh so that we had to leap over that and get right into mean stuff fuck man yeah it wasn't great but that brings me back to what you were saying earlier let's just spit ball here okay molestation gays here's my theory first of all I think 1% of people are getting 1% 1% what is the current theory like this for 10 all the time that's crazy that's fucking nuts go to 10 people that's not something remember your classrooms you'd have 3 classes there was that one Faye guy who wore lacrosse there's a few cost there's a few I mean it might be as high as 5 but it's definitely I mean unless you're in someplace with maybe some sort of a gas leak well that's what we're getting at nature and nurture so so there's these are gays these are lesbians I think a higher proportion of lesbians are that way from getting from getting molested and it's easier to go with a woman because they're not as gross as Cox right so I'm more daring and they're also been sexualized by our culture right I mean they're constantly on Billboard's selling things and right you know and it's girls kissing girls hot you know you could just get a strap-on there I can have a dude in it I won't think of dad yeah I'm just totally spitballing you're making it up I'm gonna say a third of lesbians were molested right that's a lot I'm gonna say within the percentage of gays less than that I'm gonna say 1/5 1/5 this is talking out of my ass here 1/5 of gays so it's possible that Milo was that way lena Dunham's sister Lena brags about molesting her sister she's a lesbian now Cheers yep Jesus so maybe you get molested it could be by anyone and sex you know brings you bad feels the thing when children experience sex when they're not sexual like when they're not their hormones have been kicked in they haven't reached puberty and they experience sex at a very early age they become hyper sexualized and they say that that's one of the things that happens to women that are molested and they they speculate that that could also be one of the things that happened to men when they experience a molestation by another man at an early age and there's an imprinting that happens christopher ryan the author of sex at dawn has talked about this that there's imprinting that happens during the formative years and i forget what those years are i think he said between 10 and like 14 but things that can happen during those years are they like they like lock in and that's where people develop fetishes and they develop all sorts of weird sort of like kinky sort of things that they connect to sex and it's because of the fact that your body and mind are developing your hormones I'm kicking in yeah yeah I totally make sense well it's a it's it's a disturbing trait and your job as a parent and as a society is to keep kids as pure for as long as possible you want Santa to go as long as humanly possible you want the Easter Bunny is it that fair I don't even 9/11 my kids don't know when 9/11 is I'm keeping that race too racism they I just want them to know that that guy has dark skin right I don't want them to know any of those other things and we're living in a culture where we're normalizing so much decadence that were destroying our own innocence and the prostitute strap yourself in for this 70% of all Pakistanis are inbred and in Turkey the amount is between 25 to 30% more stillbirths among immigrants a rough estimate reveals that close to half of everybody living in the Arab world is inbred a large percentage of the parents said this is blowing my mind a large percentage of the parents that are blood where's this coming from what is his website I posted it before I came here CJ media but these are all the sources that which this is this source is reproductive health journal calm this is a BBC investigation that went to it so so listen to the BBC investigation in Britain several years ago revealed that at least 55% of the Pakistani community in Britain was married to a first cousin The Times of India affirmed that in quotes this is thought to be linked to probability through the probability that a British Pakistani family British Pakistani family is at least 13 times more likely than the general population to have children with the recessive genetic disorders holy shit BBC's research also discovered that while British Pakistanis account for just three point four percent of all births in Britain they accounted for 30% of all British children with recessive disorders and a higher rate of infant mortality what in the fuck Labour Party MP is called for a ban on first cousin marriage medical evidence shows that one of the negative consequences of inbreeding is a 100% increase in the risk of stillbirth one study comparing the Norwegians and Pakistanis show that the risk of child of the child dying during labour increases by 50% Wow that is insane I also read somewhere that's a lot of the symptoms of inbred people are irrational rage with the fanaticism and they end up just describing Isis look at what it says here that with the the IQ points it says findings on intelligence research shows that if one parents are cousins if one's parents are cousins intelligence goes down 10 to 16 IQ points the risk of having an IQ lower than 70 criterion for being retarded in quotes they use that word who is that word they use it like that I've never seen that use like that I've always didn't eat I don't think it's a medical distinction this is a real website the fucking retardation they say we know it says retarded it says retarded in quotes here they're legal that is the medical definition increases 400% among children from cousin marriages let me say that again the risk of having an IQ lower than 70 increases 400% amongst children from cousin marriages an academic paper published in the Indian National Science Academy found that the onset of various social profiles like visual fixation social smile and sound seizures oral expression and hand grasping are significantly delayed among the newborn inbred babies what in the fuck good name for a band new born inbred babies yeah that's a punker ban if ever heard one Wow Jesus Christ then why don't we know this because I don't like the truth Islamophobia they don't like being called Islamophobic by even discussing it like we're gonna be called Islamophobic for even bringing this I know and I'm glad you read that from a reputable site so it's not Joe Rogan and Gavin McInnes call Muslims retarded this is PJ media I don't know what that is but let's find out if there's other corroborating or dissenting sources like pajama media is a well-established networking site are what you wear when you want to be serious about problems with Islam you wear your footie pajamas and you get down to basics people are scared of genetics too because it gets into eugenics and they get comfortable but my guess is racism - racism but yeah I come from a shitty Glaswegian family my uncle's were drunks and maybe coming from a shitty group you you develop this immunity to fear of your group sucking I'm Italian mostly Italian I'm one-quarter Irish and fucking I came from a line of savages there there eight people you know there's a good percentage of my ancestors and relatives that I know that are fucking ape people and I could say that because I know them and I come from them and I have eight people instincts that I fight off every goddamn day and the first time I came here you were trying to separate your spinal cord because you had crushed it from choking people out well I'm not trying to separate it I'm trying to relax it and decompress it some sound like dr. Zaius really try to smart in it but I've worked I did I worked it it's great now my back works wonderfully I'd stretch though my philosophy is I don't care what the truth is no such thing as hate facts to me right let's hear that was let's hear the facts and then they might be uncomfortable for you but they are fact it's the truth and it's best for everyone right let's talk this surgeon recently and I he's trying to accrue a DNA database that would just sort of like going into the singularity it would be like becoming God and you would be able to tell from a babe see if a baby is gonna have a propensity for lung cancer you know right out of the gate and he he's scared of this concept because he's worried it will affect insurance policies they'll demand to see a smear some of your spit and they'll go oh fuck this we're not insuring you you give 40 percent chance of prostate cancer fifty percent chance of this and that makes the point of insurance because then insurance gets real weird it's not a gamble anymore it's like you could see the car it's like let me see your cards no I'm not gambling with you yeah now it's just a bank account isn't that kind of what insurance is right it's like I look at you hey Gavin let me take your blood pressure well yeah cough mmm okay let me hit your knee with this little rubber mallet everything seems okay hey how you sleeping sleeping pretty good Wow okay I'm gonna give you a positive checkup and you bring it to the insurance company go look everything checks out you're gonna insure me too like hmm all right we'll take a chance but they're just taking a chance but do you smoke oh you smoke a lot of things yeah I don't like my odds there do you drink I don't like my odds well as we're getting smarter we're turning into those those chicks in the hot tub in Minority Report and so I can't unsure you you're dying on the way home to the oh I go fine let's get it out there the free market will figure out insurance for the doomed some sort of catastrophic policy but there'll be more money over here to even it out information has to come out we need information about inbreeding I think it explains the hijacking of of Muslim religion you know Hasidic Jews have the same problem but they because they're aware of this and the truth is out they have all kinds of elaborate DNA tests they do on each other not everyone takes it but but rabbis will encourage this for us to check you out and make sure you're not related and encouraged this marriage because it makes the most genetic sense I had no idea you you blew my mind with that information I'm hoping that Jamie's gonna pull up something that shows that that's a right-wing hate group that's infiltrated the statistics and third it does seem to come on a lot of right-wing website so I'm trying to find more sources but I don't gotta find another source just try to find another source and we'll continue to talk about other genetic things have you aware of CRISPR you know where yeah yeah that's some crazy shit and they've they've been given the green light to go ahead and start working on human fetuses I actually had this crazy theory in church the other day where I thought is it possible that were in heaven like you know how the concept of heaven is unfathomable right it's something that's totally different from where we are now and it's this infinite universe thing that our brains can't handle and then I was thinking wait a minute this sounds like a sperm trying to figure out what earth is Brian maybe the sperm was us being born was dying now we're alive here on heaven and we're slowly getting closer and closer to perfection I mean lifespans been getting better the quality of life has been getting better we're gonna die soon but in like 50 generations with crispers and all this incredible genetic information soon we might be able to just be like really we have cured your liver cancers ooh well it's gonna get really weird because they're gonna be able to integrate the the human beings that are here today with not just communication not just visual information but some sort of computer language Jamie and I were just talking about this yesterday where we were talking about emojis and you know and this is something that has been brought up before that emojis are in many a lot like hieroglyphs and that they you can say something with emojis that it can kind of translate what you're thinking without an actual language and we're saying we're gonna get down to the only words you say or like yes and no again and no like nods and affirmations and confirmations and the the language that we speak could be some sort of a weird Universal emoji based language that's just expressed from mind to mind through some neural implants or some fucking snapchat glasses we we're I mean we're not too far away from something really bizarre and paradigm-shifting like that well I remember when downloading your brain was just science fiction movies and you know you talked to people our age about their dead grandfather and they go I have this black in my photo and I have this letter he wrote the newspaper in 1896 that's all I got my life my kids will never be able to read all the articles I've written or watch all the videos I've done they'll never get through them all they can watch them for a hundred hours if they're bored but though there's way more of my brain permanently out there in the cosmos than they could ever want oh yeah for fixtures and everything yeah so the next generation your dad isn't really gonna die Jesus hang out with him whenever you want well I'm sure you're aware of Ray Kurzweil and you know Kurzweil thing is that he wants to somehow or another recreate his father because his father died when he was young and he has some information about his father and he has some DNA that obviously is his and he has you know photographs and memories and he wants to figure out a way to literally recreate his father and have a conversation with them that I know you're an atheist right no oh I am nothing this is I feel like you know the beginning of Prometheus where he drinks that thing and then he deteriorates and goes along yeah that's what I think the Big Bang was it was this beautiful microchip that just started the first domino and everything else is going to this place like the singularity is near this incredible perfection that we're headed to and there's all these checks and balances along the way like I was reading about Audrey Hepburn the other and she was super skinny right breakfast at tiffany's chick she grew up in I think the Holland during the war and the Nazis cut off Holland from all supplies so they were forced to eat tulips and they a lot of them hundreds of thousands of them starved to death and Audrey Hepburn was from that world and she was a skinny chick who didn't need a lot of food and then all of her ancestors kids became obese big giant fat pigs and they say it could have been genetic memory where they their bodies went holy shit you found Doritos I'm gonna hold onto this because you're never gonna find one again and then you get notices this in LA with all these Mexicans I see everywhere they seem more obese than the general populace and I think they have genetic memory from a generation or two ago where food was scarce and they their bodies hold on to it more thoroughly we see this with American Indians all the trapar its major diabetes problems yes and its genetic memory where these are the checks and balances your your said the fact that a cell can remember this so generations like never cell memory yeah well you get an eye transplant and all of a sudden you're seeing the guy that killed that guy I've heard the stories about but I don't know if it's ever been put I don't know it's still in the gotta look it up the peppermint green people getting organ transplants as well where they have hungers like they have a hunger hunger pangs for something that they never craved before right it's it's not it's not known as Bigfoot shit it's known as as I think it was on 60 minutes but I know genetic memory is a real thing and I just see all of this as part of the bigger picture as we've you know check-and-balance ourselves in constantly improving in the left seems to always deny that that there's this 45 degree line even in the stock market if you invested right before the Great Depression and you had the patience to wait ten years you still would have been up so all the dips we've had it's always been improving improving improving improving yeah well there's definitely some memories that are passed on between parents and children and they're trying to figure out exactly what's the mechanism but they don't know what they do know is that they've done these studies with mice and it's really fascinating they take mice and they put them in this cage that has a floor that they can give an electric shock to it and then they release a citrus smell that my smell is citrus smell in a zap them so they zap their feet so then these mice have children the children have never had this experience before the children are they grow to full size and then they spray the citrus smell and they fucking panic no way they've never been zapped before but they fucking panic they have an immediate reaction to it see when I hear that I go how can people not believe in God there's a well I don't know if it's a god thing I think it's a learned reaction to genetics that passed on from parent to child that is the reason for instincts the reason why we shouldn't sessional is magic but what is that magic I mean what is what is the universe itself I mean what is the magic that makes you see me what is the magic what is God I mean it's a weird limited expression to to sort of make some sense out of something that's beyond our feeble mind and imagination at this point no no I don't know if it's necessarily there was an article going around about a month ago where they said we may all be in the matrix this could all be some sort of giant experiment and I go way did it have discovered God that's what it is it's the matrix it's the first domino it's the the machine oh god you're not talking about a guy who lives in the clouds with a horse that's trying to get a grip on it right that says drawing a face on the guy like let you think it's a gun Wilson in castaway you're just putting a face on a baseball glove volleyball do you think it's a guy like we say guy sure guy I don't know when he's Jenny Oh God God is a really fat German guy with a dress and he's got a deep voice and he eats lipstick he's got lipstick all over his teeth man hands he's got a twitch it's like that all the time yeah he's got chipped nail polish on his toes and just disgusting feet or shoved into some high-heeled shoes do you what do you think it's a physical entity do you think it's an energy lickable I mean our meager right what I find I thought of this whole sperm to human thing because the only relationship I can see in front of me that mimics this is a pilot jizz and a human being where the pilot is right so if you said to a sperm so what is this earth man like does he wear a tie the sperm will just go those are words but it seems to me that like when you say something is God or you beliefs a you believe in God well you're you're defining something yeah you don't even know what you're defining gratitude you go to church and it's just about reverence and thank God that I'm here and I really appreciate who's huge that's Latin Mass you go to Latin Mass and it's just like he's something ups Mira 2news frito uh I don't know what they're saying but I'm in this incredible building Bryan that's it's blown I was talking to my little but it once when he was last in New York and I go it is kind of unusual how good these churches are like how beautiful they are do you feel like when the the guy the contractors were making them like the stained-glass it was like they're on adderall and they had this sort of divine intervention and they're like holy fuck I'm really good today well this carving is turning out have you been to Jesus Christ you've been in Rome yeah did you go to the Vatican uh yeah I think we went up to the wall I can't referee went in or not oh god man you got you want to talk about something that'll blow your mind as far as like the religious undertones and the majestic magnificence of its construction st. Peter's Basilica i I mean I whole vat accan is incredible the artwork is just amazing I mean we were there for hours and hours wandering around we had this really cool professor we hired as a guide it was amazing told us all the history of everything but when you get to st. Peter's Basilica he was explaining how many hundreds of years it took to build in their building all this shit with no electricity no machines no nothing everything's massive and perfect and beautiful it's like you're looking at such a incredible work of art that's designed to inspire awe and reverence and the motivation behind building something like this fucking hundreds of years ago it's it's really I think it's gratitude and you see this with my wife's American Indian and all those ceremonies it's we give thanks to the North yeah thanks to the West we give thanks to the East and that's what church is it's just like I don't know the details but thank you for that Wow my hands work thank you so much for this let's pray for other people I think that's a great way to live life is living life with gratitude and I try to be thankful all the time I'm a very lucky person and I've always been very lucky and I'm always very thankful to and Jan I try to be very generous I try to be very thankful try to be friendly as much as I can and all those things I think sort of build on to it but to have it and define it and to put it into like religion that's where things can get a ride because they can get screwy when you're sort of defining things by this ancient set of rules that was sort of established before we really understood science before we really understood the the laws of thermodynamics the way the universe is formed what we know now about the cosmos it's just there's so many variables that have to be taken into account when you're looking at an entire system when you're trying to define what what God is and what religion is and then you look at how restrictive religion has been in the past and how many people have suffered because the discoveries that they had didn't jive with the ancient texts I mean like Galileo and sure all that stuff's very important I guess I mean the Catholic Church was is very Pro science and has been pro science for a long time so as the Islamic Church for the longest time Islam was like the foundation of science and the foundation of literature like before like they're the before Genghis Khan came riding into Iraq and fucked up Baghdad and turned the river red with blood and black with ink as they they said like there were some of the best scholars in the world it was like some of the best mathematics some of the the best writing it come out of the Islamic world and they had been conquered and destroyed and so much of that was lost and you know the ebb and flow of these cultures to us seems like such a long time to go from 1200 to 2017 but in the course of humanity it's just a blip it's a nothing maybe they're right maybe gays should be thrown off buildings it's scientifically proved it maybe a lot of these rape victims are bitches that it should have Stones Throw just kidding Internet you can't kid man certain things you can't kid about Gavin you know we're not allowed thinking about the whole Catholics versus Protestant things goes back to the ultimate core of all arguments which is nature versus nurture and the Catholics say some people are better than others some people are special the Protestants say we're all the same that guy the guy up there on that pedestal isn't better and I vacillate myself like you for example are you special are you magic are you blessed like you're on that show your careers been so weird it seems like every time you get thrown out of a plane we come back a few days later and you got a coconut stand and you're wearing a grass skirt you're like hi come on in these are where everyone sits for their their coconut juice and maybe you were kind of the Judaism seems to say that you're a chosen one that there's some people who are picked by God like that Da Vinci Code thing with Tom Hanks where some people are just way better than theirs like I was having dinner with Sean Lennon but you got to get him on the show yeah you were telling me one of most interesting guys ever met in my life but he was either Mason him and Vincent gala we're Masons and during one of his doohickeys Opie doesn't mind me telling us but there are these like it's almost no two guys they were looking through like a wood thing and they invited him to the heavy shit one that's like made of gold and is through a book where you go upside down and you have to swim there and you come out a thing and you were a cloak and you hold like a diamond sword or something hottest making it all right super fancy one and he's like I didn't do it cause it's not me and I don't feel like doing that I'm not gonna go to the fancy one I want to be with my voice and I I was thinking later yeah but maybe you are that who yawns or of The Da Vinci Code guy well this is my take on it I think there's definitely nature and there's definitely nurture I think both are factors and to go nature versus nurture to me seem simul simple it seems too simplistic it seems too silly because it seems to me like you're you're trying to pick a side we're clearly both have massive amounts of it well it comes down to percentages and I think they've discovered the frontal Loeb where at everything matters is 80 nature 20 nurture and we see this with identical twins separated at birth one group rich in Paris the other was poor in Detroit similar dogs husbands looked the same same car one does film critic critiques the other makes movies she's a line producer they are basically the same person hmm well there's definitely gifts right some people are intellectually gifted when we know people that are just really fucking smart they're just born le fuckin smart they're smarter than me I talked to him ago Jesus yeah and then there's other people that are athletically gifted like Michael Jordan like you can't like there's not a there's not a chance in hell like take Jonah Hill Jonah Hill could work every day all day for the rest of his fucking life he's never gonna play basketball like Michael Jordan it is impossible if Michael Jordan never worked out ever like never like literally just kind of did normal stuff like everybody else does like a man went to the gym took a spin class he could probably jump way fucking higher than Jonah Hill he could probably run way faster than Jonah Hill and he'd probably be better at anything he applied himself to athletically because he's got a gift he's got clearly genetically gifted you know I think the same could be said of Carl Malone same could be said of Mike Tyson the same could be said of a bunch of great athletes the same could be said of Brock Lesnar like no matter what you do you can live weights all your fucking life you're never gonna be as strong as that guy who's the mountain Giroux thorne with that name form be orson or whatever the fuck his name is that gigantic mountain dew guy from Game of Thrones like that's a gift man that guy's gifted 100% and I'm glad you use sports as an analogy because the general understanding is there's this sort of line and it's a gray area and there's a guy who can throw a softball a fastball at 10 miles an hour 20 miles an hour and it goes up to a hundred and then there's a guy who can do 99 98 but I don't think it works like that with baseball I think there's like the forty miles an hour people and then there's this floating bubble of the hundred mile an hour pitchers and these guys are magic they're very special they're the da Vinci Code is children of Jesus well in fight in fighting in striking in particular there is well there in existing crackling as well there's strength and grappling it's like there's some people have just freaked strength but I believe that that could be nurtured more than striking strength people when people are good hitters strikers like guys who are power punchers and power kickers there's only so much you can teach someone you can teach someone proper technique but power is something that's just given to you by the great beyond and no one understands and no one knows why you could take two guys one of them looks exactly like the other one they're built the same they both have big muscles they both have big hands and one of them can punch a hole through the fucking universe and the other one can barely make the bag move it doesn't make any sense and no one knows why you could take someone and their body looks completely unimpressive but when they hit people people just go flat and no one knows why well no I don't believe transfer that hard truth to intellect yes there's this myth that we all need to be educated we all have to go to college when my dad was young in Britain you did your old levels at 13 and my dad had a high IQ his brothers didn't so they sifted through just like a Pink Floyd video and they sifted him over to a scholarship from private school and they sifted his brother's over to work in a printing press and they all did fine they had good jobs and they were they were taking advantage of their skills and then we came with this idea where everyone had to go to college and now to lower the bar so everyone can get in we have all these retarded classes there's a class at NYU called 20-something where it's just about being 20-something done when there's twenty something and you go now you've just wasted your time by not admitting that some people are special and that's what I was getting at earlier with the Western culture thing some cultures are better some are more advanced there might be a satellite of people that are just magical like Jimmy Kimmel he kept having his career shat on when he was in sports radio we had this woman above him was out to sabotage him he got sent down the shitter yeah I never heard that story was that about ask him about some horrible cunt that tortured him every day and reducer or something yeah Wow he's so talented though well that's why I said what I'm saying like Michael Jordan you throw him in Africa and there we there'd be like you have to meet this man who is in the Congo he jump a million miles yeah his name is juju Jordan and he has like a leather basketball I don't know what it is I am so good at this he would write all over like Jeremy Lin or whatever and I think Jimmy Kimmel and you are the same that they just they get fucked over I've done it a million times I've thrown my career down the toilet and then I just keep flying through the sewers and pop I come out of another manhole well you've figured out a way now particularly with your show to let your personality shine through like to like your unique way of looking at things very thorough examination of the world around you and an honest take on that also happens to be humorous but I did that with advertising I got involved in advertising I hate advertise that's the hell's up an agency sold it for millions then we got fired because I said shitty stuff about trannies I pointed out they're mentally ill gays well what you pointed out was that there's a lot of regret and that was where people were getting really uncomfortable and there's there's a website I think it's called transgender regret Dom yes and there you cannot tell me that any sort of major surgery doesn't carry some sort of regret when I was in my 20s I had hair transplants I have a big scar oh yeah that's because they take a piece of meat out of back your head with hair on it cuz I my hair was falling out and I was on TV and I was like fuck if my looks go I'm gonna be poor again I'm fucked I'm losing this news radio yeah yeah and so while we were on hiatus I had a hair transplant so you take a piece of meat back here with take the hair and they move it all up in here and the words you know it doesn't work because eventually the other hair falls out friends just you left with this mess but yeah I regretted it it was a stupid thing to do and people make irrational choices that can become permanent and if you don't think that some people who decide that they would be happier as a woman and then become a woman and then are miserable because first of all their hormonal profile has changed they don't have a penis anymore they don't have their testicles anymore they wish they could go back to where they were you don't think that that's possible that those people have major surgery could also possibly have major regret that is debt is dishonest it's disingenuous and you are you're adhering to an ideology rather than looking at something in a completely objective and an open and honest way you're you're using these people as pawns for your own virtue signaling and it's murder it's like when you see toddlers like if that woman's March they had these toddlers thing with my pussy grabs back and you're looking at a three year old and you're going Jesus Christ that's child abuse and I feel like these liberals are doing tranny abuse by normalizing such a drastic decision and it inevitably I know this is the guy you're talking about he's rights for the Federalists all the time and he goes what happens with these people is they have all these problems clearly you're nuts if you think are a woman but they also have bipolar and they're schizophrenic and manic depression and all these other things they go if I could just get rid of my cock and be a woman it would be fine then they do that and for a month they're happy and then they realize wait the bipolar is still here I'm still depressed what the fuck have I done holy shit this isn't the cure-all solution not only that there's also this there's a real problem in that you're not allowed to bring that up like we know when you look at the average person whether they're gay or straight the average people men and women out there in the world there's a certain amount that are going to be schizophrenic there's a certain amount that are gonna have all sorts of mental illnesses depression etc there's a certain amount when you start talking about transgender people you are no longer allowed to take that into consideration and you must treat every transgender person as if there are 100 percent mentally healthy which is insanely rare in regular people people that are not transgender cisgendered if you were is that you look at this gender that's what I said them that article that got me and shit I go let's get the shit here okay like you're looking at what's-his-name in transparent Jeremy whatever his name is the actor sorry Jeffrey Tambor yeah and you're supposed to look at him and go you know that's an interesting struggle you're going through it's mrs. Doubtfire right I can't not laugh when I look at you it's comical and everyone just has this willful ignorance like I saw Laverne Cox on some dumb day Today Show type thing at the hotel earlier and he's sitting there with his legs crossed going yes I met Beyonce and I was so nervous like didn't even say suck my stomach in and you're like are we all pretending that you're not a dude who is who's Laverne he was on that show orange is the new black I never watched that no me neither but he's a mock there's Laverne Cox they're all the top ones at Caitlyn Jenner and whenever you see them you go you're a dude but oh sure I'll sit here and clap and go yes you're gorgeous oh my god that is a problem it's it's this is that's a guy yeah that's a huge guy is that he's not giant really yeah and not a guy anymore how long has she been a girl I don't know you never get the straight answer from these people she's got acid and pussy out of chopping their dick off she thinks about Caitlyn did right I don't think so no oh yeah Caitlyn didn't I mean it did push you out of it yeah yeah get it done there you go you go girl if there be if there comes a time we're through CRISPR or some other newfangled genetic manipulation you can turn a man into a woman and then back and forth and you really can be gender fluid like there's a there's an Instagram page about gender fluidity and one of the things it's like I'm not a man I'm not Oh sometimes I'm a man sometimes I'm a woman but I'm always a human like okay okay you know like maybe here that's another thing about I'm not a homophobe I'm a homo board I don't care who you fuck like when you make out in front of my building have a nice French session you see that I see that sometimes black and white couples like in New York they'll be walking the train holding hands and looking indignant you know hi we're in love got a problem with that Oh congratulations you're fucking someone you're attracted to blow minds you're sucking your boyfriend's dick I'm stunned and I think that's why they get so mad too is I go you're not a snowflake you're not transgendered you're just a fucking dude well when time moves on and once we really do eliminate all the things that trouble us when it comes down to homophobia or racism all these issues that they're really still do exist you're going to be left with the actual human beings themselves so when no one is transphobic when no one's homophobic and no one's racist they can judge you for who you are we're there and but you're not in a lot of ways because people get free passes if they're transgender if they're gay like a guy like Caitlyn Jenner saying that he doesn't support gay marriage like that you get a fucking free pass like you're getting a free pass you but here's the best free pass that Caitlyn Jenner got she fucking killed a person she slammed her car and it's some lady cuz she wasn't paying attention slammed her fucking Escalade and pushed her in at oncoming traffic and the lady died and no one brings it up that's the freest free pass of all yeah took a life by completely being negligent and that's the problem with this bigotry of low expectations you put these people on a pedestal until they can do no wrong and they end up doing wrong I mean that happen Milo - he had to get out of jail free card he could say whatever he wants and the next thing you know he goes too far on the devil's advocacy with thirteen-year-old sexual relationships and you go come on guys let's just dial it in a bit here we're all the same racism is over homophobia is over let's not sexism racism is over I don't think it's over I think there's plenty of racist people here's the deal with racism okay I'm hiring okay I'm checking out your resume here oh you're an accountant oh you want to you want to make 80 grand a year you saved your previous company a hundred and fifty grand a year well that's a great profit for me I'm gonna make 70 grand a year just hiring you I'm gonna look like a champ my job would be more secure the company will make more money I think we yeah I didn't know you were black you're gonna have to leave we're a Negro free zone but you're only talking about hiring okay your heart you're sitting there and you're like I got my BLT you didn't toast the bread it's like socks you just put a sock on a tomato and some and now when I touch it it forms in the shape my fingers like a tempurpedic mattress you can't fuckin toast bread and then some black guys like I fucking hate when they do that who has a sandwich that's not toasted and by the way the giant sucked this year and you feel the same way about toast the same way about the Giants and you go yeah yeah I'm gonna deny myself this interesting conversation because you're a negro but you'reyou're being rational though like you're talking about rational people people don't know themselves money that they don't deny things that are gonna make the money and people are selfish don't deny themselves cool interesting friends I think there's plenty of people today amongst us that are very racist what is racist racist is prejudging someone based on the color of their skin or their ethnic origin so the the guy likes all the stuff you like but you refuse to see him as an exception to you know he likes you like because if you're looking at the bar well that's that one guy in your scenario yeah well I you know what you were you're painting some very simplistic scenarios that deal with a really complex issue people prejudging people and people not liking people or people identify with other people that look like them like you and me being two white guys okay the racists you're describing doesn't like black people I'm bringing up a scenario where if he sees a black person say there is a racism it's like this thin veneer oily slick in the bathtub when you have Brylcreem and you take a bath all you gotta do to go through just go bip so the second that black guy says I hate the Giants this year that guy's racism just goes I mean I have so much more prejudice for people wear flip-flops for men who have those utility backpacks when they wear a suit what about manners stay-at-home dads man buns I don't think I could be your buddy backpacks and they wear a suit on but their backpack is all mountain climber II with the ergonomic things that bothers you chose me nuts why does that bother you you have a briefcase if you have a suit but why you've mountain climbing and to do you're at tax audit but what is that I mean they want to have their their laptop and all their books and they want to carry it and it's easy to carry things in your back so find a canvas backpack if you must but what's the matter with Kent and I don't even like when people have rolling luggage we are going luggage you can't carry 20 pounds you pussy rolling luggage is easy to roll yes so is wearing your PJs on the plane it's disgusting to do but this is is this acceptable this backpack yeah that's great cuz you have a t-shirt on okay so your your backpack is actually more fanciful than your clothing that's fine I'm not measuring matching up correctly you're matching up just fine but if young Jamie with his IT tech slash comedians outfit if he was wearing that and he had maybe like a certain type of backpack what what would he be allowed was he God all that seems that's nice perfect my problem with you Jamie you shouldn't have anything on your t-shirt after 30 but that's a fighter in the kid okay you're doing an ad but people like when you give the ramones on your shirt when you're 40 or no one good here's what bands you like at that age anyway my general point is we all have our little quirks your general point is you're very specific and what you allow people to do and not do I saw a guy we were on Jamaica on vacation and there was no you can eat thing and he he had a his plate and he just must have been Irish he piled on three huge spoonfuls of mashed potatoes it took up most of his plate and I'm looking I'm going we're in fucking Jamaica this jerk chicken all this fancy shit and you're using up your whole meal on mashed potatoes you met bothers you Mick and I hated them for the rest of the trip I think I needed someone to hate on the trip so I would see him he just be like eating an ice cream cone I just go fuck Wow do you recognise that's your own personal issue it's a Scottish thing those we were at war for 800 years with the English and honestly looking abroad the ones who don't like confrontation are extinct so dr. drew says this he goes the reason that if Scots are drunks is they like they like conflict so they'll put a war in their body so they're going out of those walking is hard I'm giving myself a hand cap so we like struggle we like pain that's fascinating even in fucking I'm never totally enjoying it I'm always like I gotta last longer think of Kevin Spacey yeah what do you think of what when do you think of Kevin space oh dude if you think of kind of something you're gonna call me tomorrow and go thank you so much my wife can't walk today you imagine Kevin Spacey's head floating over the bed okay not like dismembered and bleep I like his face doing nothing just just staring at just staring at you and if you two-and-a-half minutes did you imagine him as Keyser Soze or it's Frank Underwood I don't I'm not I don't have strong feelings about him like I've never seen that House of Lies show it's a card show okay show I don't know why I'm in that season three right now oh he was in it in it no no no no into it I talked to a guy who was gay and he goes I'm with Kevin Spacey and I go can you tell him banging him then I use him and all my friends do no I'm not saying that that's really mean and I've never occurred to me that yeah you don't want to be known as the guy who can make you not come yeah nobody wants that but anyway even fucking I'm stressed out even when Trump won we had a big party we're all wearing Hawaiian shirts and when I saw Donald Trump president on the big screen in the bar everyone started cheering my buddy Alan was just pouring beer in his head and I went yeah because I didn't want to bomb other guys out but my brain hadn't processed it yet and I couldn't thoroughly enjoy it and then everyone pick me up and they're carrying me around the bar yeah do you have any problems with him being the president because you you seem pretty pretty aware and pretty rational other than the way you make people dress and wear backpacks but did you have any problems with him being president is there anything disturbs you about it I'm totally open like if he starts fucking with the First Amendment I'm gonna drag him out of there by his heels I'm not excited about this son-in-law getting a job that sounds like nepotism to me what a coincidence your son-in-law is the most qualified person for the job this times when the tweets can be petty I don't know why we're talking Arnold Schwartzenegger ratings and no I'm not excited about the travel budget although he is doing a lot of shit but as far as what we've come out with and and the amount of fucking left-wing back back-patting that we've been going through for the past eight years I'm fuckin ecstatic what's the back padding that you're talkin about oh we're so wonderful and Obama is so great and you know you you you come to LA and you realize that everyone in this fucking city thinks Obama did an awesome job and they also think that Bill Maher is Christopher Hitchens like he's an intellectual demigod in this town Bill Maher's yeah every time I talk to someone they go oh you should talk to Bill I'd love to see you in a room with Bill Maher I'm like that's your intellectual heavyweight that's your main guy I think he would probably agree with you on a lot of things which would really be confusing to them cuz he agreed with Milo on a lot of things a lot of people are mad at him because of that and you know he said that he reminded him of a young Christopher Hitchens except you know gay and foppish and he said a bunch of other things well yeah but he's like you know you just gotta abandon some of what you're doing cuz some of what he's doing is fighting the good fight against irrational feminism that denies the biological differences between men and women and lies about the gender wage gap and all these different things that he does accurately point out which people parrot all the fucking time and drives me nuts I've talked about a way too many times in the show but that goddamn gender gap was in The Guardian yesterday I know and when Obama said it I go do you know that you're full of shit no that's not true you know you have researchers did you ask them are you knowingly repeating this myth because most people don't get boats most people don't know it smart people that I know who have not looked into it or haven't had debates about it with other people don't understand what the gender pay gap really is that it's simply a matter of working less hours and choosing different jobs it's not two people one man one a woman working side-by-side doing the same job where the woman makes significantly less and that's what we're being led to believe and that is that is a real sticking point with feminism they're being dishonest in their portrayal of the issues of the workplace oh yeah enough going you guys are making me think women are dumb so I don't like that woman's March I go you guys are out I don't know what you're out to prove here that your pussy has teeth you're making lemon rock dumb even the abortion thing a half 50% a woman are pro-life so why are you making this a gender issue it's an it's an ethics thing it's like a youth in a but it does nothing to do with man or woman are you okay with abortion up to a certain age no not at all so a week after conception when it's a bundle of cells aside as your fingernail no do not kill it Wow no heartbeat just a viable little B cells beautiful little green cells sitting there you can suck it out with one of those tiny cocktail straws I don't really drink out of but they don't do they they suck it out and they watch it splat against the Plexiglas you swallow it rip down the side turns out it's good for your skin look if we can get down to morning-after pills and that kind of stuff I would love the debate to go there but right now it's it's way too far down the line and you know what speaking of Bill Maher he doesn't have kids Angela Merkel doesn't have kids there's this lack of connection that these childless people have in our media and in our political system and there's an anti kid culture going on that is ethno masochism combined with laziness and it really is our death knell in many ways like when I'm in Williamsburg with my fucking stupid dog that I would happily kill right now kill your dog feel nothing no my daughter's dog it's a little Havanese puppy I don't fucking know it's a poppy you would kill the puppy well if it you know if it bit one of the kids I could take a meat cleaver to its head and I would be on the phone as I did it like be like preparing a chicken for dinner I feel no oh Jesus and when I have that dog all these spinsters are oh what's his name is it a boy or girl who fucking cares he's not gonna wear a dress but when you're with your kid with my kids my son my youngest my foil'd is uh so cute he's a freak like it's he's the Elephant Man of cuteness he doesn't he looks away from people cuz they freak out it's he's garish he's so cute but they see them with disdain and I've noticed that not just in hipster Williamsburg but you know what FoxNews I would get that from people who didn't have kids oh you're sitting at Fox News and you're looking on the table and you're like we're sitting here talking about family values and the future of America and I'm the only person in this entire panel with kids and I can't help but think that Angela Merkel's suicidal policy of bringing the refugees in fuck the whole country up is somehow lick linked to her childlessness it may be it's certainly linked to her desire to not come off as racist or homophobic or excuse me Islamophobic yeah it's definitely lysis parties and dinner parties you don't want things to be weird but when you have when you have skin in the game you go I don't fucking care if you hate me I got to make sure that things are kosher for the boys like Dana Dana lash she was a feminist raver with big fucking chinko jeans in college and and chain wallet and then she saw what a feminism was doing to young boys and making them ashamed of being men and she had boys she went whoa whoa we created a monster here and pivoted and became all about saying masculinity is a okay fuck these feminists we were wrong yeah weird times man it's really weird times were people trying to find themselves now just fucking breed I was talking to some asshole at the bar last night and he's repeating what he saw in an Oliver Stone movie and I'm like that movies been debunked Michael malice no sorry Michael over Michael Moynihan the one about a world war 2 and how Stalin was under you know under appreciated and we have to understand that we shouldn't have gone into World War two and we shouldn't have fucked but I don't know what move is that is you talking about the untold history of the world yeah I'm watching that right now it's read Michael Moynihan's takedown of it yes goddamn apologist well he was it's made out Stalin to be a fucking monster in it oh I thought he didn't he didn't do it off I thought Stalin came out real nice really yeah did you watch the same thing I saw did you watch it yes how long ago when did it come out four years ago longer than that thing but a long-ass time ago but I was really interested in media didn't all of us don't have to respond to Moynihan steak okay well have to read those - what is the name Patrick Moynihan no just Michael mine in one hand who's Patrick Moynihan what do I know that name I forget but I know that name too but uh I'm listening to this fuckface this 34 year old this man look he's with this we've been with this woman for five years and she's 29 and I just said to him just stop repeating a documentary you saw last night and go fucking propose you pussy did you not know him before hell this is I was shit I was shit-faced my weary head when wife and I left the kids in the in Malibu room he came to we went out partying got a hotel room got laid it was awesome nice and single again I don't know how these childless people are not fucking 24 hours a day they probably are that's but they don't want that to end they don't want the fun part to end guys want to be racked up together and then contemplating divorce if you're out there right now and you're in a relationship with a girl you guys live together I don't know why she's allowed to wear clothes in the house the second she walks in the front door nude will draw the blinds she should be nude at all times don't you kind of want him to wear clothes so you can take the clothes off nope if I was sick if I didn't have kids my wife would just they would there be a basket by the front door for clothes that she has to take off when she comes you make her huh yeah nude lady rules high heels owner just thinking about leather underwear I would wear leather pants and a oversized baseball hat a flat brim yeah guitar player plastic guitar now how about a ukulele ukulele do and clenches clown shoes yes those those need to come back actually you know
