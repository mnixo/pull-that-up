join my gang Joe Rogan podcast my night all day last couple of years you've been you've been involved in a lot of crazy shit you know what are you have you are you disappointed in yourself with a lot of this stuff yeah I am I know Liam I tell Liam yeah what does it feel like like like gimme the thought like we can go through all of them but give me the thought like probably the most I was disappointed in you and I love you as a person I think you're a great guy hello you to Gio Thanks I really do I've always had a good time hanging out with you but I was very disappointed with you with that car accident there yeah when you ran away from that car accident yeah that to me was like goddamn John's in a bad place yeah I was at a bad place it was a it was a messed up situation man I literally as an appointment life then when I was winning all these fights I was the it boy in the UFC sponsored by Nike and Gatorade and you know greatest of all time finishing legends after legend after legend just really in this position where I felt so untouchable and I just felt like I just felt like everything was meant to go my way and at that time of my life um started to I was smoking pot you know majority of my career dragged me to uh I mean drinking you know every weekend pretty much you know it's the point of blacking out just lacking out yeah just just being hammer you know and just being a total party boy but still um still training my butt off you know I'm working really hard believe me really hard have big goals big dreams but just being a party boy and I I think I just took everything that I had for granted because everything for the majority of my career has gone my way and that that morning I got in a car accident man I just it was it was just it was it was a huge reality check and it was you know I think in some people's mind they they envisioned me you know hitting this car and running up and seeing that it was a pregnant lady and then taking off running and then people said that I came back and grabbed a load of money which is the stupidest thing ever I was a millionaire need to grab cash right unless you run back to the car so I literally I I went through a light it was like a green light that said that I could turn left but you supposed to the yield for the right away right to turn left and person came through and I I just assumed it was my green light to go obviously being not completely clear headed and I ended up running into a car I was definitely disoriented disoriented from the accent from the accident for sure just kind of like what the hell just happened was a really big hit but I was fine I had no injuries and I just felt like well maybe it wasn't that bad of a hit so I literally step out of the car and I realized like seconds later I realize my Bulls in the car so your bull my my yeah my my my yeah my top black part yeah and I wasn't smoking weed in the car or anything but it was in the car but my bow the head residue was in the car so I literally I opened my car door I like take two steps away from the car and then I go back to the car and I I would like search the the car cuz I had it in my cup holder and when I hit the bowl fell somewhere who knows where it flew to but I knew I knew shit like I can't find that bowl that's gonna get me in trouble just having a ball in my car so I looked for like two seconds Clinton find the bowl and I just took off running did you look at the other person in the other car no I had no clue that it was a woman I had no clue that it was a pregnant woman how much time are we talking about like from the time was really the from the time that I hit I had a head I was over a fence probably eight seconds later it was it was literally a super reactionary Electress I just felt I hadn't been home yet I stayed at a friend's house I wasn't drinking and driving it you know my decision was to sleep in my friend's house because I knew I couldn't drive home he woke up early the next morning to go to work and he's like John's feel free to stay here and you know you can make yourself breakfast or whatever whatever and the guy has a family he has a wife and he has a newborn baby and I didn't want to stay at his house while he's at work so I was just like no I think I'm okay but really I had maybe like two hours of sleep and I didn't realize that I was still wasn't ready to drive so um you know I wake up and get him a car and you know I just wasn't ready to drive or not but um why didn't you look at the other car because it all happened so fast yeah sorry yeah so it all happened so fast and I just knew I was I knew I smelled like alcohol and um I just felt like if the police came it would be a bad situation for me and I just thought the person that I hit had to have been okay because I was totally okay I was like maybe this collision wasn't that hard so I just feel like in a lot of people's minds they see me as like I knew was this woman I saw this woman hanging out the window crying and bleeding or something like that and like I just chose to leave her and I I didn't know what I had it know if I had a truck I didn't know if I hit a punch book I didn't know what it was that I hit I just know it was another vehicle you didn't even look no I didn't look my uncle and I didn't go back for cash but it doesn't make it doesn't make what I did okay the fact that you know I didn't go back for cash and I really went back for my bullets there's no better right the whole situation was just a shitty situation I wasn't I was in a really bad point in my life taking like I said everything for granted if you wanted to have a situation come up with this like worst case scenario that is the worst case scenario a pregnant woman oh yeah it makes me like a monster yeah it makes me like a monster when you found I was a pregnant woman what was what was going through your eye I thought man I am I'm done I'm done first I was afraid that there would be some type of problems with her baby because you know obviously if she had a difficult pregnancy then that's that's a whole different level of being in trouble god forbid if she wasn't having miscarriage you know I would imagine that that would be one thousand six foot of me so I thought about the fact that I went from just partying and joined this career and this amazing fairytale life I went from that was going from that to like literally being in jail and being label doesn't murder so that was my I was my number one um thing was just hoping that the baby was okay what it would about what were you thinking about yourself like when you did that when you Remy there's no way you could be happy with yourself that you know that little terrible what were you thinking well I made my mom have a great relationship I'm a mama's boy and then I'm the father of four daughters so um you know if anything my my respect for for women is is I have tremendous respect for a woman and I tried to like obviously we had a father I like I tried uh I just felt like a monster I feel like a monster you know I mean um I just felt terrible I felt I felt really bad I was just I was really just concerned with this woman's health and safety and I'm really glad that she ended up being okay I felt really bad I was just like dude even in the public's eyes like you just heard a pregnant woman like doesn't really get worse than that but boy yeah I had no clue I had no clue that it was even a woman that I hit and I felt terrible and what was the what was not just that was the reaction from your family and friends um you know surprisingly it was it was okay you know um they they they support me so much and they loved me so much and they know that you know that I have a really I believe I have a good heart they know that I have a good heart and they were just there just thinking man like did anybody step in and say hey man you got to get your shit together oh I've had a lot of people tell her anything about shit together what was it about like what besides that uh what do you like besides this one what other things have come to you and say hey John you got to get your shit together um-hmm what kind of all of it all everything that's happened over the last you know two years or not makes people feel like they can tell me that I need to get my shit together and I recently I recently went outside to Mike where's my garbage man was coming up and I was late getting one the garbage out to the side of the road so he waited for me and he even told me he was like he was dumping my garbage he's like hey man like I'm waiting to see you fight again like you really need to get it together I'm like man just two parked outside of my little mansion pretty much telling me to get my shit together [Music]
