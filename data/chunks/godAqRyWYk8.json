the gyro gun experience what I was going to say is that the boom we were talking about the needing some sort of a lesson and how to think and how to operate the mind if the human mind if the human body was in the just you know just the human experience if that wasn't an instrument that you had to learn to use think about navigating the human life with the human body and language and think about if you came from somewhere else and the human body wasn't and the human experience wasn't just a person living a life but rather was a ride that you had to figure out how to how to master how to accomplish and that the human animal with its creative abilities with abilities to reach out to people with it's a ability to build buildings and use electricity all these different things that's a that's a that's a vehicle that's what that is learn it learn how to use that view yeah you would have intensive study for a look for years as engineers of just trying to figure out how to go about the correct way of doing this they would be like you know you'd have to figure out what is the best way to think what is the best way what most beneficial way to you to approach every project as as a person moving around in this human world with this human machine it would be like a super complicated thing but instead it's just two people fucking a loop some guy shoots a load in the girl boom she swells up like a person comes out no one knows shit thank you so the three of them are standing there no one knows what the fuck is going on and they keep doing the same thing they keep interacting to each other same thing the way the human the way the human being and the human body interacts with the world is so bizarre and complicated and to get it right and correct take so much fucking thinking it's an amazing coolidge we just let these things just go loose out into the world you know mean which is why people are desperate and lonely and of course well we're caught in this machine there's a real machine going on with with society today and that machine is the building of society the increasing of bandwidth you know the interconnectivity that's provided by technology it's all of that it's it's all that with this exponentially increasing momentum behind it and we're all caught up in that and we're caught up in that we have mortgages and we have bills we have all these but we're doing is we're feeding this system we're feeding the system of televisions and computers and and and cell phones and new clothes and distracting it's so distracting like you you start unknowledgeable and and the Greek so I said you go from knowledge but you don't jump all the way to wisdom there's an in-between place which is correct opinion correct opinion comes from when you study as you're reaching for wisdom you start to develop the world crystallizes around you with the right teaching and end stuff you start to learn what the what what sort of the correct way to look and reach and follow and the correct opinion is and then you finally get to a point where you understand and can explain why that is the correct opinion that takes a long fucking time that's life mastery in a way but it's like what you're saying is it's it's it's we don't have a system and we tried it with public education but we don't have a way or a system to really teach people how to live the Argo no no one knows what the fuck they're doing and we the the people that we were raised by they didn't know what the fuck they're doing either I mean my parents are very nice people my mother is with my stepdad they've been together forever it's like they're a very nice couple they're very nice people but they were raised by people who didn't know shit and their parents were raised by people who didn't know shit and this era that we're living in right now it's like human beings are just starting to wake up and realize that we were all living in this weird sort of momentous world this world that moves on momentum and the meant make any sense at all and we're all just waking up realizing that it was set up by people didn't know what the fuck they were doing I mean they knew how to build buildings they knew how to use electricity but no one knew to teach society how to chill the fuck out relax and enjoy each other not one fucking person besides like Martin Luther King and a few people with some dreamy speeches not one person emphasizes that in the role of government not one person is pushing that like can't we figure out a way that human beings are just nicer to each other can't we figure out a way where there's maybe a little bit less profit but also less pollution and less fucking with people and less light less control over the human populace is that possible say I would say though you're also dealing with the residue of of a most of human history almost all of it has been not enough to eat yeah and dying of disease yeah no it's no doubt there's been a lot of things that led us to this point but this is also the first point we have a responsibility as the human beings that have the first access to this sort of information to not be looked at like a bunch of silly fucks by the people of the future because that's a real problem because if I look back I mean living this life right now just looking at all the silly nonsense that human beings are involved with like everybody look on Twitter and everybody has these fucking equal signs on their their their Twitter avatar to let everyone know that they're into marriage equality that's equality it's marriage equality you should be you should be that's like saying you having that on your Twitter avatar you might as well just say waters wet is hot hot it's cold cold and of course marriage equality makes sense the fact that you even have to tell who you talking to what who this is I know but but seriously in 2015 13 anybody we should find out who doesn't have that on their avatar it should be that what's how about nobody use their face anymore and and let's let's find out and do the people who have a problem with it it gives a shit whether or not a couple of lesbians want to marry each other you're an asshole like you're an asshole and maybe nobody tells you you're an asshole why do you give a fuck about them you worrying at all about what other people are doing sucks it sucks for everyone around you you fuck everything up you can or that two people love each other they want to sign some paperwork why do you give a fuck what do you give a fuck of Qi sign some paperwork that the other chicks gonna be our ass eating slave till the end of time and she'll have to be reincarnated in the future a seater and upon turning 18 we resume her practice we're just gonna be immortal write that on paper what fucking difference does it make why do you care if you care you're an asshole you're just an asshole instead I never understood that it's fucking dumb the desire to control the people and to impose your mythology or your belief system on someone else it's some really nice forever uncreated fucks to or not thinking about how ridiculous you're going to look in the future when they're looking back in the past the way they looked at those idiots that thought that leeches were the best way to cure your broken leg those fucking people we laugh at them today and don't tell me about scientific applications of leeches you have fucks because there's none I cannot stop this people like you know there are medical applications for leeches like people sent me that tells me I might use them for gangrene yeah you can use it for stuff but guess what medicine works better you know you for almost every maggots
