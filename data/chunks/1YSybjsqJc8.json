five four three two one and we're live with Justin Brown Justin first of all I'm very upset to give you such a small badge what's up with that yeah and I was nice and tiny they're not all enforcement's though seems like you should have like like you there's some badge there there's some enforcement right it sure looks like it doesn't it bet yeah no law enforcement on my end in this the biologists well listen man I read about your work in an online article I remember where it was but about coyotes in the urban area all around Los Angeles and I've been fascinated by this since I moved to LA the first time I saw a coyote was in 1994 when I first moved here I was in Burbank and I had an apartment and what you know all those um they have those pre furnished oak woods Gardens apartment on Olive Street you know where that is enough top my head it's where people always when they they transition to LA they get one of these pre furnished apartments see you know anyway yeah I'm driving up olive and I saw these coyotes and is the first time I'd ever seen a coyote and I was like this is crazy like this is in Burbank this is in a residential area and they were just hanging out and I pulled over and I stopped and I roll down the window and Iost airing at them and they're staring at me and they didn't give a shit about me they were so calm and they didn't run and I just remember thinking this is so strange he's like wild dogs that live like right amongst us and then from then on I've had some encounters I had a coyote steal a chicken from my yard I watched him hopped the fence with the chicken in his mouth quite a few encounters with coyotes but I'm absolutely fascinated by them I mean they've been amazing I've been working with them now for almost 15 years actually a little bit more than that now and I've seen them do some amazing things I mean they're able to live in some of the most urban environments we can imagine I mean I'm tracking them right next to I don't know if you know where the Westlake neighborhood is in downtown LA but yeah I have a coyote running that neighborhood which when I first drove through there so I worked in Chicago for a long time we were tracking coyotes and some incredibly urban areas they're like right along Lakeshore Drive in Chicago and but in Chicago there's some green spots where when you get down in LA there's not a open spots yes a little vacant lots and stuff but I tracked this coyote for about nine months down there in that area and she was just amazing like she was running the streets she came to hang on these little vacant lots and was even more amazing is that no one was really complaining about her we actually talked to people in some of the houses and stuff they were actually fascinated to see home versus yeah being like they're in my backyard were they doing well people have always had a weird relationship with coyotes I had Dan Flores on the podcast last month who is the author of coyote America and he's a wildlife historian and has just some amazing insight until like the relationship to coyotes had way back with the Native Americans you know they thought there were gods in a lot of ways yeah I actually listened your podcast with Dan I was great Dan's got some pretty interesting facts just in his book in general things I didn't actually know about before it was kind of nice to have a historian tie in some of the facts like get lost asked lots of questions about where the Coyotes came from how they're moving around yeah and so it's nice to have something like Dan's book to kind of reference people to I think most people in the downtown LA probably welcome something like a coyote cuz it's kind of cool you don't have this thing I can get around as long as you don't have a dog or a cat that it's Natchez yeah and that's definitely the case a lot of people think it's cool but they do cause problems I'm actually dealing with one in Silver Lake neighborhood that keeps going up to people walking their dogs and trying to it's got a den in somebody's backyard is actually dinning under their deck so the decks open and she put our seven pups underneath his den whoa yeah so it's pretty crazy but she was basically but he gets close with a dog she comes out and tries to run them off and this is pretty common during pupping season this is like the time when most people have issues with coyotes because they're trying to protect their dens I mean we're all obviously protective of our offsprings right so they think that the dog is going to find the pups and kill them or something I mean we don't really know why they're doing it we assume that's probably the case they come up and the most the attacks have been where they just come up behind the dog and start trying to like nip it it's back and one the dog the people move on people freak out as far as I know there hasn't been anywhere that I would actually like draw blood on the dog so it's almost more like it's like get the hell out of here right so they're just scaring them they're not trying to they're not actually being predators that's what it seems like for the most part I mean definitely do kill little dogs yeah and occasionally end up fighting with big dogs as well but that's that's rare Wow so these what are they eating like this especially the one in downtown yeah so that's that's interesting we've actually been doing this study using it working with a bunch of citizen scientists and I don't know if that's the story you read or not but we're basically having people collect coyote scat from around downtown LA and we're actually breaking the Coyotes got up to look what's in it and we're seeing a huge variety of things I mean lots of fruits and stuff they're actually big-time and vegetative vegetation type stuff a lot of fruits in an urban environment obviously we got peaches and plums and all kinds of crazy fruiting stuff that they take advantage of but they're also eating rats and squirrels cats insects we seen things like earwigs and those big old potato bugs and you can see I mean there's almost anything you could think of they're taking advantage of human trash well I I've had him in my yard for a long time and one of the things that surprised me is how much coyote scat that I find with berries in it like I didn't know that they were omnivores I mean they were they really are omnivorous then it's not like like a dog or a cat I mean they pretty much everything yeah I mean coyotes can take advantage and that's why they're able to live amongst us I mean cuz even when there's not a lot of prey available they do they're able to take advantage of these different fruiting trees yeah you know I was talking with a friend about it and he was saying that he hates them and no he wants to kill them all and all the stuff and I was saying but yeah but ever notice that you don't see any rats like we hardly have any rats like it's so rare that you see a rat or a mouse in my area and I think a big part of that is because you hear coyotes all the time and I think they're eating them all I mean they definitely take advantage I mean there's other predators too not sure where you live exact howls and hawks and bobcats yeah and all those different things definitely yeah edge of those prey as well but yeah coyotes I mean they're amazing you there are they are really are fast any animal so this this one that got to downtown LA do you know like when it arrived I don't know when it arrived so I I kind of drove through there looking to see where I might be able to call her a few animals so we could kind of see what's going on and how these animals are persisting down there I mean actually do that how do I see if we're there persist no see caller how do i collar them so first we have to capture them so we'll put out traps we'll capture them and then once I get them in a trap I'll go out with a pole I'll pin them to the ground and then I'll hold them down Jesus I'll put a muzzle on them and hold their feet together and then we'll throw a collar on them we'll take blood to look for disease you don't train Jose we don't tranquilize them wow that's crazy yeah they actually go very docile they're like a dog once you kind of show them that you're the dominant dang they they kind of just lay over and you start to be careful obviously they can turn and bite you if you don't muzzle them right but usually once you get them down that first time they usually just lay there until you're done no kidding and it usually takes me somewhere 35 40 minutes to do the whole thing and they just lay there they're not fighting me video of that uh I'm sure I do I want to see that that's gotta be a trip ya know I would think that they would be like a wild cat like I've had a feral cat before um and I had her when she was a kitten or he rather when he was a kitten and he was like a spaz like you couldn't even hold on to him you'd freak out climb the curtains and hiss and sputter on you and that was like a little domestic cat that was born outside oh yeah we do drug any of our cats we catch so we catch Bobcats it's an assignee that we're doing a lot of we've actually had a bobcat project going on since 1996 and so we've been calling those guys for a long time they're not docile they're not docile we don't trust them raccoons or another species you don't handle those guys undrugged oh yeah I would imagine they'll make you pay the price and that crazy like people don't realize that raccoons or predators yeah well they're definitely omnivores like just like the Coyotes are they actually eat a lot of fruit and stuff they take I mean part of them living in an urban environment is they're just taken a massive advantage of our garbage right I Koons just I mean we've seen amazing photos of like 1314 raccoons and one garbage can all feasting down I have chickens in my backyard and this one raccoon was by my chicken coop the other day and I flashed a light on him and he walked towards the light I was like look at this cocky bitch he just started walking at me and I got nervous I was like I don't have a weapon on me and nothing I thought a flashlight he'd be like well let me get out of here he's just looking right at the flashlight walking towards me you know trying to get to the chicken coop you'd be amazed how many people feed them because they're so dang cute right big old masks on people are like oh they're starving out there they can't find their own food and so they feel like they need to feed them and see the Coyotes - its people feel like these animals can't fend for themselves which is ridiculous because they're not able to make it there because we're feeding them they're making it because there's resources for them to take advantage of yeah I would imagine they probably play I mean like I said I think in my neighborhood they do play an important part of keeping the rodent population down but in downtown there's got to be a ton of rodents as well I mean downtown for people don't know is like the only area in all of LA that really looks like a city yeah definitely I mean that like I said I drove through there I mean after tracking coyotes in Chicago I didn't think they'd be in some there is they are in LA there seemed to be everywhere I look I get photos of coyotes on our cameras or get people reporting them to us and this one that's in downtown is just a single Keio by herself no actually she's got a whole pack so I call her her and then within a couple she was actually lactating when I caught her so I know she had pups and then we ended up seeing her with five pups probably a week later and there was actually a ambulance that drove by and she just started howling and all the pups were out there yipping and this is all like in this little vacant lot between two houses Wow so they just find these areas where people aren't yeah and so before we collared them the one thing I always heard is oh the Coyotes are coming in from Griffith Park or they're coming in from Elysian Park and coming into our communities and they're just here for a night or two night causing problems and leaving well that's not what we're seeing definitely once we threw these colors on these animals were like no they've got pretty small home ranges they're kind of living just in the urban environment they're not going back and forth one of the thing with us so do you feel like it's a good thing or a bad thing to have them around or just a thing I think it's just a thing I mean depends on your perspective I think it's bad when people think we need to feed them right to do these things like to encourage them and make them more comfortable with us that's not a good thing because that's when bites and that kind of stuff happen but if when it comes to the Coyotes and stuff living in these urban environments it's really all about us it's more about managing people getting people to quit feeding them or quit one thing I encourage people do scare the stupid coyote off thing because there's lots of people that have little issues that occur with the Coyotes their cats get taken or the coyote stark just sitting there watching them I had somebody complain recently because the kayo was sitting behind their yard looking at their wife in the jacuzzi know Jesus Christ so coyotes a pervert exactly so it's like come on like all he has to do if he really doesn't want it there go back there run the thing off signal on you and tell you that a kayo staring at their wife yeah you'd be amazed the calls we get about coyotes people just people are still not comfortable and being there even though they've been there for a long time it's just people cannot get comfort with idea of there being a medium-sized predator in these urban environments they're like the perfect size to almost get away with it too you know like they it's not like a wolf like if a wolf was around everybody be freaking out like it's too big yeah coyotes like you know 40 pounds something like that and that's a pit that's a big coyote what's a small one uh so our average is around 25 to 27 pounds Wow okay so you're really not that small they are and that's why I'm always like when people are so scared of on the link it's really not that big of an animal I'm hmm there's a lot of small dogs are bigger than that they're smart though man they're really clever one of them um he or she essentially what you would say honeydicked my dog and tricked my dog into do you know what I'm what it's like when a chicken moult's you actually have chickens as well okay cool yeah so my chicken was molting so I had to separate her from the rest of the chicken so she wasn't in a nesting box and I put her in a cage by herself if you let him sit in a cage for a few days they figure out that they don't really have an egg and then they go back to the normal behavior so um this coyote was too small to knock over the cage but my Mastiff is big enough to do it so she literally tricked my Mastiff into coming out with her towards where the chickens are he knocks over the cage she steals the chicken and hops over the fence why did you see all this happened did I caught him with another chicken in his mouth and I was like you motherfucker and then that I see the coyote jump over the fence with the chicken like he was with the coyote right next to it he thought it was his and like he was treating the Kyle like this is my friend she's cool we hang out together and she tricked him into knocking over this small pen you know he's like 140 pounds he just smashed that thing and broke it open and she grabbed the chicken thanks puerile and hopped over the fence and I watched her I was sitting there I was playing like Monopoly or something with my wife and my kids were sitting in the living room and I see that Kyle running across the backyard with the chicken in its mouth and hopped over this five foot fence like it didn't even exist just boy just right over the top of it I was like wow that's crazy yeah their curly smart I mean heck to live in downtown they've got to be yeah like crossing roads it's amazing like I watch and walk up to these busy roads they stop about ten feet shy kind of sit there listening then they'll peak around the corner and look both ways and then they'll run across well I've heard that they understand traffic lights now there was an article I've read yesterday about coyotes and traffic lights that there's real evidence that coyotes understand when that beep-beep you know that be a sound that they use for blind people yep the coyotes understand that that means the cars aren't allowed to go and that's when they walk huh I haven't seen that one that's interesting it doesn't surprise me I mean there it's incredible watching them move around this urban environment and just dealing with us and doing with traffic like they they get around I mean they'll come out in the street all suddenly somebody will peek out in the street to go down the car and they'll cut between the cars and go down the sidewalk like they they figure out our movements and how to avoid us pretty quick how many do you think there are in the greater LA area I get asked that question a lot and it's a hard one to answer because we don't know because they are pack animals so you could end up with easily it could be just two animals in an area or it could be two adults with seven young or it could even be five six seven ten adults together with with a pack of young as well because a lot of times the young from the year before may not disperse if there's enough food available they'll keep hanging in there until they are able to find their own territory so whenever someone would give an estimation it's really just a rough guess it's a very rough guess a lot of times what they'll do is they'll just try to be like okay this is how big of an area Keio uses and then be like okay there's this much area in LA and throw an we're out there but there's a lot of variables that come in and it has the do you feel like the numbers increased over the past few years or definitely not over the last few years it's possible over the long run because I know there are some reports of places that there weren't coyotes like the Baldwin Hills there was some work done where they identified all the different animals there and coyotes weren't in their list hmm so they use trail cams like what did they use to identify the animals um back then I think they were doing a lot of track surveys and just going out there in the field and looking for them track surveys meaning like looking at the ground exactly yeah and with coyotes they leave enough scat different places like if they were looking hard for him they would have found them how can you tell the difference in coyotes cat and dog scat usually so dog scat is almost always just dog food and it doesn't these coyotes cats end up getting more circum spiraled inside and so they'll be really tapered on the ends where dogs cat can be tapered but it's usually just drastically different huh why is it tapered it's partially just the way their digestive system works and they're getting all this hair in there because they're eating these animals and so it gets more and more spiral as it comes out and we can tell apart from like Bobcats because Bobcats kind of get this they're more almost I don't wanna call it a pellet but they're they're smaller segmented and they're kind of just one sides concave one sides convex of each pellet and so you can tell them apart that's actually can be more difficult for some people than the dog and the coyote I found some mountain lion shit once Santa Monica not in Santa Monica excuse me Santa Barbara and it was very disturbing because it was a rope like a fat rope of hairy shit I was like what is this from and I sent it to a friend of mine who is uh he's very knowledgeable about animals he's like it's almost definitely a mountain lion like whoa somebody got got here no it was pretty thick rope like a human size log yeah with all this hair in it yeah we actually have a lion study going in our mountains - we've been call our mountain lions for a long time sure you partner - p22 in Griffith Park I have yeah that's actually an animal that one of my colleagues collared oh yeah that's the famous photo over the Hollywood Hills exactly that is an amazing photo of that enormous cat with that collar on yeah that was Steve winters with National Geographic got that phone I mean it's pretty impressive he worked hard between him and my colleague Jeff they they did a lot of work to get that photo Jamie says I'm gonna pull that photo up when you take a look at it now that is that is an iconic photograph man you know what I think we should have that photo in the new studio we should get a print of that we buy a printer you know where could and someone could buy a print of that uh I believe you can get from Steve winters listen Jamie make a note of whoever this gentleman is and if he sells that because that is like that seems so crazy it doesn't even look like a real photo as the Hollywood sign is so perfect in the background and the cat is fucking huge you know what's amazing about the Hollywood sign there's no lights on the Hollywood sign he got that photo because he was able to do enough camera work that he made the Hollywood sign Claire out that's just from lights from the city really if you look at the Hollywood sign at night it's not lit up like that Wow look at the forearm on that thing yeah I mean that's like a thigh yeah god it's a huge cat how big do you think that is it's a big male I think the last time so we've captured him three or four times now and I think the last time he was about a hundred and 120 130 I believe I don't not positive of that but it's somewhere in that area oh well he's a good-sized cat I mean what's amazing he's running in Griffith Park he'd ever leaves the Griffith Park general area because he's blocked by freeways and yet there hasn't been any conflicts with him and people besides the time he got underneath that guy's house God living the size of him but yeah Jesus Christ that's so weird so joggers no one gets interrupted by him interrupts as a funny word jacked is a better word he doesn't he doesn't it mess with people at all no we get sightings everywhere what people report it but yeah we haven't had anything any conflicts with him which has been amazing I mean he's four he's got the smallest home range of any mountain lion male mountain lion that we've know of and I said what is like a square mile mark just a park he's just the park I mean he goes that he's been up by like Universal Studios right in there once or twice like in some green strip through there but for the most part yeah he's just hanging in the park and there's a DWP property next to the park how big is the park I wish I could call that number off top - roughly if you had a guess ooh yeah I'm not good with that Griffith Park yeah I looked up it's like 4,300 acres or something like that okay see the biggest in America or maybe the world urban park it's a pretty big park it is politically eaten but when you compare that to mount lines in our main mountains we initially think to mountain lions can live in the Santa Monica Mountains which is about 150 thousand acres so his range is pretty small 4300 compared to about 75 thousand acres that's incredible and he's mostly eating deer eat some coyotes raccoons but it's almost most of the most of all of our mountain lions all their diets deer well that's one of the reasons why there's so few deer in California I hear that I'm we don't we don't know if that's truly what's going on mountain lions they do kind of self-regulate so the big males usually kill the smaller males and so they do kind of control their own populations at some level oh and that's interesting so the competition they kill comput aided not they're not cannibals though I don't believe they eat them they usually just kill them that's interesting so do they kill them to bring the females to estrus or they do them just because their competition we believe it just because it's competition because they're usually killing those yearling okay now so they tell once they're independent exactly so and they also we have had them kill a female lion as well so really it's not that simple hmm that's interesting and is this in the park you found this yeah Wow so you find a dead mountain line in the park I mean they have radio collars on them so we kind of know what's going on now is there any concern like does anybody make the argument that they shouldn't be there does anybody ever say hey you know this is where I live I don't want this cat here why do you guys let this thing is a giant predator wandering around our neighborhood yeah I mean we definitely hear that but we also get the other side as well a lot where they want to protect every lion right I mean we got the same thing with coyotes people don't want the Coyotes there with coyotes even more tricky because we tried to kill coyotes for a long time to try to get them out of areas and you know we have not been successful I mean places like Chicago with coyotes I mean they'll go through and do removals like a lot of the landowners will do removals and the Coyotes come back pretty quickly interesting well it's really not that effective let me start trying to remove these animals yes especially coyotes right there they're so crafty um well I've read a really disturbing article about mountain lions where they're talking about the number of mountain lions that get killed every year by a professional mountain lion hunters that the government hires because they're preying on cats and dogs and that they said that fifty percent of these animals this is around the San Francisco area that 50 percent of their diet was was domestic animals like domestic cats and dogs yeah I'm not familiar with that one but we definitely haven't seen that with ours so this one has just got a good supply a deer and that's just what it's eating on a regular basis that's what it seems like I mean even Griffith Park that's what they're focused on I mean like I said they also kill the coyotes and raccoons and stuff as well but sure that the other thing that was really disturbing about that article because they were that it was the the author was trying to make a connection between missing children now they were talking about several cases over the years where children were missing and never found again and there's the same areas where these mountain lions were roaming and they were wondering whether or not that had been the case and that makes you just go whoa yeah I mean I think it's probably more likely human cause than wildlife caused I mean maybe were way creepier than these animals are that's true but do you remember about two years ago there was a case in Cupertino right near the Apple Campus or a mountain lion attacked a kid and the father had a fight the mountain lion off I mean these stories definitely pop up every once in a while but they also have lots of places where there's lions and there's no issues right our mountains we haven't had a light human lion issue I mean we've had light stock taken but that's about it and we're talking our Park that gets huge amount of visitors Griffin yeah lion well Griffith but also the whole Santa Monica Mountains right were part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and we've got at any given time we could have 12 to 15 lions in there Wow really and we've never had a human lion issue besides livestock what is the big issue when they do attack people because I know it's always like someone either running or on a bike is it they think that the purse is trying to get away is it like a cat thing like a regular cat you know I give you the rollerball yarn in front a cat they just jump on it yeah I don't think we really have a full understanding but it probably has something to do with the prey Drive yeah because I've read a few mountain lion attacks on people that had to do with mountain bikes and I was I was thinking like why would they want to attack someone on a bike it seems like a bike could be scary yeah I mean they're an ambush predator and they're they're big animals so they're not used to having anything bigger than them take them on so right they're not they're not that fearful of most things I mean a lot of times when people see the Lions they don't run and so people freaked out but that's it's actually not that uncommon for them just to kind of sit there and look at you and judge your situation yeah try to figure out what they can do with you but whether or not they should eat you hope that's not what they're thinking but right most likely not right most likely not how like what are the numbers of attacks on people do you know like with yuta you'd have to talk to my colleague I'm definitely not the lion guy in our office I'm much more focused on coyote do you remember the last time you heard of a lion attack on people um then off top my head I mean it might have been that Apple thing or there was there was attack in Orange County quite a while back but that's really it it's not that common there's a machine on the number of lions that are here there's a mountain lion in San Juan Capistrano that's been attacking this farm a buddy of mine Ian McCall who's a UFC fighter has a friend who owns this farm and this mountain lion has been hitting this farm every now and again and the other day killed 37 ducks and a goat just goes on a rampage yeah and doesn't even eat them just fucks them up and leaves so what we usually see with them is I mean because they almost always eat what they kill it's just when they kill something in a farm they usually end up being uncomfortable afterwards because we come in we see the situation things change and so they don't come back because they'll feed on a deer for a week or more right so it's it's I think it's more of a factor when they leave those things it's more that they just also like oh crap what I do I gotta get out of here why they kill 37 then they just pray drive I mean they can't help themselves yeah they get in there's times when they get in pins with bigger animals to things like llamas and stuff where they'll end up killing multiple animals yeah cuz they get in this pin and then all suddenly they're jumping around making all these noises and so then the animals get excited I mean just like a doll dogs are getting after chickens also and the dog goes in and kills the whole flock of chickens right the same type right this can't help themselves yep yeah there's that one that's in the Santa Monica Mountains what is it p-52 is that the name of it P 4045 guessing if that's what you're talking about is that the one that killed the bunch of llamas and the woman got a depredation permit to kill the mountain lion then people freaked out started sending her death threats yeah got a little out of control yeah it's like it was really creepy listening to this woman's position because she didn't know what to do cuz she's you know she lives there she's got this farm and this big ol cat this keeps coming in fuckin up like 10 llamas yeah in a setting yeah so US a National Wildlife Federation actually started working with her to try to help pin or animals up better because a lot of it just comes to making sure your animals are secure at night is that what it is like you have to figure out a way to close the area so the mountain lion can't get into exactly and should take anything that complicated we actually held a workshop for people in the local vicinity and we'll be holding more to teach livestock owners how to secure their animals so that that stuff doesn't happen there's a way they can do something that like emits a sound or something that scares them off so there are some devices out there that are being tested and being used in some vicinities but nothing's 100% the problem with a lot of devices you've got livestock moving around so they're going to be triggering the devices all night and so it's it's kind of a tough situation the best thing is to try to pin the animals up so you have to put something with a roof on it so the mountain lion can't get in over the top exactly so when you're talking about an animal like that like when they date sometimes they capture them and then they move them to a new area right um that is very rare to happen is it really yeah like when we capture animals we don't move anybody you just let them go right back to where they are we call them we take blood we do what we need to do to them and then we just let them go right there so is the idea like mess with them as little as possible exactly yep we didn't have to capture them we wouldn't capture them we would just throw if there was a way to get a collar on the animal without touching it we would do that like maybe a dart that shoots a GPS unit in them or something yeah whatever the technology is if it ever comes up that way most wildlife people would prefer because the least we have to do to them the more work understand their writers yeah I would imagine this cat in Griffith Park you said it's been captured three times yeah that's kind of crazy I even before I can't remember I'm not like I said I'm not a guy that does all the lion work so I just help out the cat must be like Jesus Christ they got me again I guess brother like I'm so tired of wearing the stupid jewelry they keep putting on me yeah well I don't know you might have saw the pictures too where he got he was really sick with mange oh yeah that's right and so they got a medication so we caught him and we have a topical medication that we can give animals we do it to bobcats and stuff so what we found with this mange disease is that it's caused by a rodenticides so all these rat poisons we put out there basically ends up getting into the mountain lions and bobcats and the Coyotes and there seems to be some sort of correlation between those poisons and why these animals get sick oh is that him right there with mange yep yeah that's fascinating that is a real issue with people poisoning these animals so that it also affects owls apparently that rat poison is causing a drop in the owl population because the owls are getting a whole these rats that are sick from the oh that's interesting yeah well it's amazing I mean to think of a mountain lion getting rat poison it's not like their other hunting rats right but it's because they're killing the Coyotes that thinner that are eating the rats that are sick that's happening so rub mine wouldn't eat a rat I mean they might but for them to eat enough rats they're not just sitting there focusing on rats it's really so big great source for right so they're they're definitely focusing more on the Coyotes in the bigger prey I can't believe there's that many mountain lions in Santa Monica Mountains that's crazy yeah and the these are collared mountain lions correct not all of them there's definitely some out there that are uncoloured we can only get what we can capture so it's so like when you make an estimate of like would you say 15 is that we just said that we think that's our upper size limit how many of them are collared um I think right now we're around 8 or 9 yeah I wish I was Jeff was in here he can answer these questions a lot better than Meeks like I said I'm go get Jeff in here next time yeah it's it's so fascinating because California is such a unique area in that we are very urban you know but we're real spread out and we've got the Santa Monica Mountains right there like in Topanga right there I mean to pay I have a buddy lives in Topanga you go in his backyard you would swear to god you're in Colorado or something I mean just it seems like the wilderness ya know the mountains are amazing and it's 155 thousand acres Oh Jamie's got a map be pulled up of all the mountain lines ah look at them all just so obviously the the Santa Monica Mountains are just there south of the 101 basically so the park is basically from the Hollywood Hills out to Point Mugu and it incorporates most of Malibu and then it goes a little bit up in the Simi Hills but the mountains themselves are mostly south of 101 this is such a unique place to live that we're so sort of surrounded by nature in a lot of ways and there's so many different places like you could go to Big Bear in an hour and a half and you're in the woods I mean you are literally in the wilderness that's a great thing about LA yeah like living here it's pretty cool it's pretty cool but people are super uncomfortable with the fact that this wildlife sort of interfaces with our urban environment and that's where guys like you come in right yeah I mean we're we're hoping to help reduce some of these conflicts and a lot of it comes to what we do it's not so much with animals I mean with coyotes a huge amount of the issues are because somebody next door to use feeding them and so the Coyotes hanging around is really common like the people leave out food yeah sometimes it's intentional sometimes it's not like feeding your dog outside it's never a good idea right having fruit trees in your backyard that are just dropping fruit constantly and no one's picking it up or cleaning it up that's all attractant so it's all bringing in coyotes raccoons possums skunks all these animals are coming in take advantage of that stuff so do you think they eat olives uh we've seen olives probably would take advantage um here and there but I don't think it's like a super big food source forum I haven't seen any spots so we've been doing this diet study for a little while now and olives are not one that pops up regularly because my dogs eat them that's why I'm asking my dogs catch them when they fall out of trees and it's the same yard obviously where the Coyotes had been visiting yeah I mean I wouldn't rule it out but definitely few have anything like figs we find tons of figs and bigad yeah so they really like figs they do when figs fruit twice a year a lot of the varieties of figs and so they're there a lot so that it's just kind of learn to key in on them okay and probably a lot of calories there too former exactly what are those little tiny red berries that they like to eat pyracantha maybe as though it is I think so now it's not even edible to humans right not I don't think so but caios can eat them yeah I mean whether it's edible to us or whether we would want to eat them Raburn question I guess yeah they're all there grinding exactly they're eating a lot of things that we would not touch yeah no kidding I mean they they golf pick stuff up off the road nasty little it looks like just putty on the road I've seen them grab stuff no actually I mean coyotes they're just they're crazy I mean there's a lot of these talk about Katie's going after cats and all that and there's no question they eat cats I've seen them one of our collared animals was actually eating a cat did and two of its pack mates were sitting there just eating this cat in somebody's front yard which I'd never seen I knew they ate them have you seen that video but of the coyote the cat that someone captured in Los Angeles I don't think so it's a great video because these people from their car are filming this coyote that's right they're on the street in busy LA and it's just staring at people chewing on this cat yeah that's like Jesus Christ we played it for Dan Flores and Dan has the opinion he's of the opinion that a lot of these cats that are getting killed by these coyotes like here's some kayo it's just wandering across the street I mean this is really crazy because this is as urban as it gets I mean busy street and this coyotes just hanging out and so these people follow this coyote all around the street does it look at that has a caller what I see I could no no caller ID but it Dan thinks that the Coyotes are eating the cats because they're competitive predators um so that has definitely been seen with things like focuses there is so just chillin eating a cat right in front everybody I mean that's crazy did they actually see it I'm guessing they didn't see it actually catch thing no because the cat is stiff yeah so stiff that cat is that cat looks like it's been dead for quite a while but he's just chewing on that cat front everybody that Kyle actually you see how its face looks kind of bold and I mean how I actually have mange and you think that could be from rat poison uh with the Coyotes it's a little more complicated in that we think that it's a different type of mange so we don't think that's directly tied to rat poisons it could be still but where does it's kind of uncertain with those guys and some of it is because of bugs as well right so mange is actually caused by a mite yeah and it just irritates their skin and they end up scratching their own fur off oh that's it yeah really yeah I thought it just fell look at that one cats like huh that's my friend dude that cat is so crazy he's just sitting there watching this coyote yeah so what a dumb cat well I saw a cat in the middle of a street a coyote walking down the street I thought it was a bag of garbage I was about a hundred yards away and I've seen her watching sky oh go to it I was like cats can get in this garbage next thing I know this coyote circles at three times walks off all something jumps up and walks away I was like whoa did I just see that wow do not believe it like because even like I know it's complicated but I was like that was a pretty easy prey they could have just grabbed it so Coyotes much faster than Kass is that what it is well that's an area Dean has to be faster the cat was just laying there right like it could have grabbed it at any point you know wonder why the cat felt calm enough to do that yeah I don't know and yio didn't go after it I have no idea I think it's just it's just not that simple that they go after every single cat yeah well they obviously don't right now now you so you say that it is fairly common that people feed them it is I've just with tracking these animals I've been to a bunch of places where people feel like they need to put dog food or cat food out on the street just for the Coyotes or the skunks or the raccoons or whatever they're feeding something intentionally out there and then the Coyotes are taken advantage and you talk to these people do you have to have so I will occasionally at usually I just tell Animal Services about it and they'll talk to them or if it's somebody I'm like already having some sort of communication with I'll definitely be like yeah you don't really need to feed these guys they're they're doing fine on their own yeah all you're doing is encouraging them to come here yeah do they get that do you deal with some nutty animal people that don't get that yeah we definitely deal with some people that don't understand they feel like these animals are gonna starve to death or or die of dehydration if they don't put that bowl of water outdoors so crazy so yeah Dan Flores had a woman who came to him and was doing a documentary on saving the coyote yeah and he was like I don't think you understand like they're doing great yeah they've expanded their range incredibly like they're living in every big city around me from New York Chicago Toronto yeah that's sane yeah it's crazy they're everywhere yeah they literally are in every state in every city in the entire country except Hawaii except why yep but so what that is so bizarre that to think that they're in Queens there they found them in the Bronx yeah what's amazing they've expanded their range over fairly short time span - yeah really just since Europeans have been here that they've been able to kind of expand out and do that and that's through all this time I was trying to kill them and all that mm-hmm and so I get a lot of people that want to remove coyotes from the urban environments I'm like well we've been trying to do that for a long time and it's not working what is the solution then the solution is just to try to sort of mitigate their impact on us I think we need to change what we do yeah I mean it's about not making sure we don't have food out there I mean if the more food they have it's been showing coyotes can increase their litter sizes and so they produce more coyotes and so it's it's really about trying to reduce the amount of food that we are responsible for that's also what I've read in Dan Flores book that the more we impact the Coyotes as far as like people trying to push them out and pressure them the more they produce extra babies like especially if they do that roll call thing when they scream out in the 90 hearing which is amazing that is one of my favorite things about Cairo its man when I'm out at night in like you know like you're sitting on the deck like having a cup of coffee or something here you like wow this is wild like they're really out here like grinding that makes you feel you're actually out in the wild a little yeah a little bit you know like you're sitting on your deck that's not in the music exactly yeah I have to going off yeah drinking a nice cup of coffee or something it's just um it's just it's such a unique relationship that we have with that one predator where it's like I like them around like I would be really weird if that was a you know any other kind of like scary predator but Kyle it's are kind of cool to have around yeah yeah I mean definitely I think the same way a lot of people may not feel quite the same when they're doing in their backyard but I don't know yeah I get that yeah I do too I mean I am I'm a dog lover I've got chickens I've got all these things that coyotes could ya infect me as well but I also realize that there's things I can do to make sure that they're not going to get to my chickens or they're not going to look at my dogs well I have a puppy right now that's my my big fear is because I have a Golden Retriever puppy and he is like golden retrievers owner if you ever had one they they are like the most non dog dogs like they don't bark at anybody they're terrible watchdogs they love everybody and they just have zero killer instinct like zero they're just sweet hearts and I'm just worried that he's going to get jacked yeah I mean I would definitely keep them secure until he gets up to that forty fifty pound range right there they're generally pretty safe yeah so now they do sometimes ambush them though right that happens it's rare usually most attacks are smaller dogs however there are definitely cases where they've gone even after something as big as your Mastiff that's not raised I mean it's pretty rare that happens the whole coyote dog thing is complicated I bet you if you googled dogs and coyotes playing on YouTube you would find a dozen videos very quickly yeah because we've actually looked at some of that and it's just like that relationships not as simple is this like they're going to go after the dogs no they play around together but then they'll kill them and eat them yeah it's just like what kind of relationship do we have man yeah well and we don't know how often they actually eat them we think sometimes they just kill them and carry them off because that same thing they do with foxes really yeah so like gray foxes and red foxes the Coyotes will kill them but they generally don't eat them what doing when you started thinking ecologically it makes sense right like they're so related that there's lots of diseases that could be transmitted between them so it's kind of a risk anytime you eat something that's very closely related to you oh that's fascinating so essentially the same thing as like a mad cow disease exactly which is comes from the prions which is we feed cows cow material and then they get that what does it call jacob's crux felled disease that's right yeah which is the same disease that they find in cannibals in where is it what country is it find that in Indonesia mm-hmm I forget where it is but that's interesting that's essentially the same thing saying yeah yeah I mean anytime you start and that's just one disease I mean there's lots of parasites and stuff too that if you were a transfer between similarly related species much easier than it does to say between a cat and a dog Wow so I mean there's a lot of spillover and zoonotic diseases between wildlife and domestic animals luckily we have lots of vaccinations for things I'm sure you've heard of like parvo and distemper yeah and so there's there's vaccinations we can give our animals to take care of that obviously these wild animals just have to deal with it yeah distemper is very common right I had a dog part always click down yeah but in parvo it's also deadly to puppies right they get that exactly a parvo is very common in seria we actually not just right down the street here we lost some pups to parvo and is this something that's transmitted through wildlife as well it can be so we're not exactly sure if it's only wildlife to domestic it's probably both it's probably being moved between the different populations so I mean luckily if we vaccinate well we can reduce that spread but people have to be good about vaccinating their animals so do you guys have a mandate like when it comes to studying coyote when it comes to dealing with them like what is the overall emphasis on is it on just understanding their range where they are or is it do you try to do something with them so our role is to try to help protect wildlife within national park areas and so what we try to do is we try to get as most understanding we can so we can help reduce conflicts help reduce disease transmissions help just basically help the whole ecology of these animals to make sure there's not things coming into our populations that are are going to end up affecting them it's interesting because you know think like when people start cutting budgets and they start looking for like wow where can we reduce spending like there might be a few people to come along go ahead why do we give a shit about these coyotes you know does that does that come up I mean that always comes up anytime budgets are dealt with but for us for an important thing for us is just make sure that we do everything we can to protect our resources within our park and so we we've identified that this is a potential risk for our local wildlife and so that's why we've started studying the things like the mountain lions the Bobcats so our park is completely surrounded by urbanization we have lots of influences I mean our mountains are about 50% of it is privately owned and so there's a lot of chances for development so it's important for us to understand how development is affecting the wildlife so we can help try to mitigate that in the future that's awesome now when you're dealing with these animals and you're collecting data and information do you guys share it with people that maybe other peers that you have that work in much larger areas and do you find like similar patterns and similar similar results so we generally shared through scientific publications is usually how stuff is shared kind of between us that being said we definitely talk to other parks like you simha t I just recently went there to help them do some raccoon stuff and so we will definitely share information to try to help deal with similar issues and it so I was up there for about 3 or 4 days and we talked about lots of different things one things they've had with coyotes is people feeding them out of the cars like people drive through they'll take food because the Coyotes hanging off nearby and they'll throw it out the car to the coyote well Kyle got so habituated to that it would just be coming up to every card czar jumping up on cars Lo and so they're like this is they end up having to remove the animal because all these people just end up feeding it they would go up and scare the thing and they would I think they even tried I think they said they tried to paintball it but it ended up learning who they were like they learned their cars learned who they were so every time they would come up the kite would disappear back into the bushes even if they tried it in their own cars but see them in their own cars the Keio Trek ignite I'm it ended up learning to recognize the people they're too small they are wow that's so interesting yeah and I definitely noticed that even like with trapping and stuff when we're trying to capture these animals I feel like there's times when they definitely kind of avoid the area because some of these animals have been on the air for years and so we we try to capture them as many times as we can to keep them on there so our callers only generally last somewhere between a year and three years depending what kind of color we put on them it's a lot of times we want to keep them on long terms that we actually understand the whole lifecycle what's going on and so we'll go in and try to capture them again but they're they're smart they kind of learn to avoid once I start going into an area well according to Dan flora is a big part of their cleverness and also their adaptability comes from them being preyed upon by gray wolves and their relationship with gray wolves that gray wolves had left and then come back to North America and in the meantime coyotes had kind of thrived and when they came back there was a period of thousands of years of them being preyed upon by these gray wolves so they've adapted all these different sort of mechanisms in order to stay alive and to avoid predation and one of them being that they expand their range so as we've tried to kill them one of the things that Dan was saying is that when they do that roll call thing if someone's missing the female will actually have larger litters and then they'll expand the range so when you shoot one you think like well keeping the coyote population down now you probably raised it up by like 10 15 percent and you expanded their range by a few miles yeah I don't know if it's just based off the calling I've heard that before and there's some dispute about whether that's the full case or not but definitely because there's lower numbers there's definitely more food resources available and so it makes sense that they would read then reproduce more because we definitely know if food resources go up coyotes can increase their numbers so oh that's interesting because he was saying that it's a direct result of them being preyed upon you think that's probably in dispute well the preyed upon I mean I know the shot or killed or you know removed I mean truthfully doesn't matter how the animals how the population decreases and in fact is that it's down so then prey numbers go up and so then there's more prey and so then they reproduce more because Dan was implying there's a direct correlation between there's a physiological event that happens inside the female that when the the population grows smaller their litters grow larger in response to the population being smaller not necessarily in response to the increase of food supply as far as I know the only things I've read it's usually they've associated somehow with food supply mmm so it's probably maybe a combination of those factors it very well could I mean it's complicated right these novels are crazy with what they can do it's it is absolutely fascinating how adaptable they are though is there anything like them I mean you start thinking things like crows they can be pretty adaptable to they can live in a wide variety of areas but they mail it through 3d space they move down the air that's a different sort of bargain yeah no I mean the Coyotes they definitely there's not any other species been able to move around the country like they have they're able to live in the most urban environments we can imagine I mean places that people generally think it may be a raccoon be able to live I know in Chicago they've gone into areas where they have coyotes living and they did not have raccoons living in those same locations or if there were they were records were very rare and yet the coyote seen a bill to persist which is amazing for an animal that size it just shows how intelligent they are to be able to move around us and be able to take advantage of us is it because they run faster they're just it's probably a combination of things they learned how to deal with roads I mean anytime you get these urban environments right like one thing I always like to say it's like the Westlake neighborhood it's one of the most dangerous neighborhoods for pedestrians yet this coyotes running this neighborhood all the time and it didn't have any signs of ever being struck by a car do you think the smartest coyote is smarter than the dumbest person yeah whoa that's deep yeah it is deep yeah I mean they live a place about I don't know if I could live there Wow Wow now what city has is there any city in the country that actually has a legitimate problem with coyote Penza you talk to I mean la we definitely have our issues right I mean there's been bites there's been other situations I spoke on bitten yeah yeah Legion Park had some bites there's been bites down in Orange County so mine had some bites are they biting homeless people or they biting people to take naps what are the it's over the board usually it seems to be tied to people been feeding it and so it's almost coming up and biting like people on the hands or people on the leg I don't think any of them know the ones I've heard have been like where they're trying to take the person down real type thing they've all been more like where they're coming up and one of them like none I didn't have yes you heard about that woman who's a folk singer in Canada that got killed a couple years back by coyotes yeah I actually went up there a couple years after that they actually got a study going on coyotes up there they radio collared a bunch and I went up there and helped him capture the first couple animals to kind of see what's going on and that's just a crazy scenario out there it's way different than what we see down here the coyotes first are their eastern coyote so they're a little bit bigger but they're also they've kind of there's very few food sources up there they're dealing with snowshoe hares which their cycles kind of fluctuate up and down and so sometimes there could be tons of food and other times there could be almost none but they've learned that they can take advantage of moose during the winter and they're actually killing moose in the snow what'd you think of this little for teh pound animal take it on this huge moose but they're seeing it they do these snow surveys and they're finding these dead moose that were very clearly killed by coyotes Wow so a full-grown moose yeah that's insane now a full-grown moose is like more than a thousand pounds yeah yeah I know it's amazing I mean obviously these moose in the winter the snow gets deep so they're they're definitely they can get stuck in things and that type of scenario how do they know that it's coyote killed him in our wolves there's no wolves there wow that's crazy yeah I did not know that a coyote kill a fucking moose yeah well and they had them radio collared so they were able to see the Coyotes at the carcasses and stuff - Wow so when they have the radio collar how much the information are they getting do they get like a full like if you could see a map would you see like the trail like everywhere they go it depends so the caller's have different settings so their GPS units so you're there's always a trade-off between battery life and the number of locations you can get so you could if you only cared about a two-week span you could have that GPS unit take a location every 30 seconds and you could map it out but generally we're interested in a broader timeframe so a lot of times we're getting so like the Lions a lot of times it's about eight locations a day and that's a pretty good size caller on the coyotes I usually do somewhere around six and then I'll do these little bouts where I'll do 20 min of occasions a day and so then I'll get more intensity and then I can map out like where they come up to roads or where they do different things where they're feeding so yeah you can get some pretty detailed data on how they're moving so what kind of a battery source are you using on these collars that you can get such a long like how long does a like if you stretch it out the longest how long can they last so there's different sizes of collars and so like the lion collars are they can be 2 D cell batteries in them which are just lithium cell batteries and those go about two years with a 2 D cell battery Wow you can put them on tiny little things I mean people done not with GPS yet I don't believe but they've even done like little bugs where they've put the so the caller's have two different things they have a GPS and they have a VHF function the VHF allows us to actually go out and track the animals so when you see biologists out there with those antennas so you literally know where they are they are yeah so that's how like lot of these observations I've talked about that's how I see them is because they have that little beacon that goes off and a collar and so I can track them with that antenna and see where they are and get pretty close to them and see them what they're doing that's incredible so they literally the last two years with two D cell batteries yeah and then when the two years are up you don't know where he is exactly well what's amazing about the Lions is that we can recapture them we have really good success we're getting those guys back and so Jeff's been amazing and he's been able to get these animals time after time after time and that's why I like the p22 has been captured so many times we have to replace the collar right so it's usually about every two years but to replace the collar so God so how are they tracking that cat um I mean there we've done multiple things we got lucky one time and he was actually down in a hole and me and Jeff were actually there and we darted the thing and it just fell asleep in the hole which was pretty sweet so you saw in a hole like a hole in the ground it was kind of a drainage channel was kind of eroded away and he was kind of down in this and there's a bunch of brush covering it and so he felt pretty comfortable I guess and he just stayed there and so we were hiking and I don't know if we were looking for a kill or if we were just checking on my camera or what we were doing but whatever we saw him and so we're like well let's tried to dart him and so I stood there and waited for Jeff to go get the stuff and Jeff was able to dart him when he came back and the cat just laid there like we put a dart in him he growled at us he laid back down and fell asleep and we were able to process him how creepy is when a cat growls yeah I was actually pretty freaking cool like I've it's pretty amazing be not close to such a big animal how far away were you uh probably from me to your wall oh no really yeah oh my god so pretty like God you have a backup gun or a Taser or we carry Paterson America shield Kevin I'm so nice yeah I'm out there mr. Harris yo come on I got you I would think that would actually be a good move for a cab right like a big old like gladiator shield I probably confused they try to Jack you bang they run into the shield where is he nice yeah I don't think I want carried out through the brush though that's a good point um no we we do carry bear spray does that work I mean we haven't had to use it so yeah yeah use it once and tell me because I was thinking like I run through the hills I was thinking you know I did it was an area where I run where it's really desolate there's no one out there and I know this Bobcats there but I also now know that there's a mountain line there cuz a buddy of mine saw a mountain line there and had a caller and then he heard about a mountain line that got killed on the five freeway and he checked a website is there website that shows you the track like where where the animals been um there are that we can see we don't share that with other people I wonder how he found out he knows a lot of people maybe ask somebody but but found out that it was the was the mountain line that he saw in his neighborhood and he lives pretty close to the five okay and so he was a explaining that you know like he saw it yeah I mean we don't have any cats that are up there near the five so probably he coulda probably looked at that map that you guys put up there even it could have easily been one of those kings because there's just not many up in that area that we have collared but they do occasionally get hit by cars right yeah that's actually one of our biggest causes mortality these days is them getting hit by cars so we really we work a lot with Caltrans to try to improve permeability of the roadways for a wildlife and protect them from being hit by cars I know there was a ramp that was being proposed that they were going to put a ramp over the highway right oh here it is yeah Caltrans proposes wildlife overpass on the 101 freeway now where were they kind of try to put that so this is supposed to be near Liberty Canyon this is where's Liberty Canyon it's just a little bit west here near gora okay yeah so this this overpass will be big from outlines but also lots of other wildlife in our mountains hmm so we have seen that the 101 freeway is a major barrier to gene flow and so things like even coyotes even though they were able to live in this super urban environment that 101 and the development along 101 is serving as a barrier that they're not getting across regularly enough to keep the population genetics up so genetic diversity sound of the freeway is a lot lower than genetic diversity north of the freeway right right now I asked for Bobcats mountain lions and coyotes yeah I have a friend who works at the Tejon ranch do you know where that is yeah I have a buddy that works there too oh do you yeah I was actually just there this weekend and they were explaining to me that they had a camera trap on one of the water holes and they saw 16 different mountain lions Wow they've got 16 photos of 16 different cats that are on there a huge ranch 270,000 acres its enormous ranch yeah yeah I I don't know how they could identify each individual lion that's my first question yeah how does they know individual but yeah I'm not Lions they can be quite a few of them I mean a lot of times in my own lines will come back obviously with especially with the thing like a water source there right so I would I would question whether it was different or not but yeah I mean the place like the hoenn I mean it's amazing right there's lots of different prey animals there oh yeah from Elk - dear - that's a special place it is it's really crazy you know just I mean everything the wildlife the flowers the the pigs like it's just a crazy crazy place it is only pigs there it's it's a nutty farm I mean a nutty ranch but it's so large it's just amazing like my buddy's like a cowboy up there and so he took me for a tour to kind of see the ranch and it's amazing yeah well it's the biggest ranch in California yeah 270,000 acres is almost hard to like wrap your head around how big it is but when you're there and you go how far does it go and they go see that third mountain range we go to that what yeah over to the desert over yeah yeah it's everywhere and then the water for Los Angeles goes through it if you see that gigantic water pipe that goes through the knee right branch yeah yeah and you know what that's where all the water goes it goes through this thing it's just it's just crazy it's amazing yeah well it's weird that we have a place that's an hour and a half outside of LA that has elk now and that's like yeah we're so lucky like it's such a unique spot you know a lot of ways that's amazing I mean used to be tons of elk here right like all the tule elk they used to cover the whole area yeah worries of tule elk out in the San Joaquin Valley there's just amazing numbers of elk so yeah well also grizzly bears and Grizzlies yeah that's there's a there's a town up near Tejon that's named after the last guy that got killed by a grizzly bear in California but before they wiped him out god I'm trying to remember I'm trying to remember the town's name hmm damn it but the it's been confirmed that he was killed they actually exhumed his body and found it you know broken up into pieces and one of his legs was chewed off like it was wow like you really did get jacked by a grizzly apparently we had enormous coastal bears and that's why they wiped them out it's just like when the settlers came here they were like okay fuck this we gotta kill these goddamn things because they were like you know Kodiak sized enormous bears but obviously they did a good job since we don't have a single grizzly left in California yeah that's one animal Lebec thank you jack okay Beck that's that's one animal where people are not clamoring for a reintroduction yeah you know like well it's really there's no area left for them yeah like the area that Grizzlies occurred we've developed turned in agriculture urbanization so bringing Grizzlies back I mean you hear it every once while somebody say that but I'm like they're too big and they need too much food yeah and too much of that food is living animals and that would be a problem yeah well even if that's I mean even all that if there's no habitat where do I put them like they're sure they're not going to live up in the high mountains that's what we have see as we have protected the Sierras and those type I'm not grizzly Tabet at so well we do have quite a bit of black bears we do but they can live up in the mountain yeah they do much better in that scenario yeah it's really fascinating to me how the whole thing is sort of like a balanced system and they all sort of keep each other in check you know California's a good example of that because it's one of the few states that that has a large healthy mountain lion population but they don't allow hunting of mountain lions so because of that you have less deer but and people will complain about that hunters but also because they you have less car accidents with deer yeah like if you live in like I have a buddy lives in Iowa you have to drive slow because the fucking deer just jumping out in front of the road every 50 100 yards means crazy how many especially during the rut when they're breeding and they get silly see just dead deer every couple miles see a dead deer on the side of the road yeah I mean we're a lot different obviously than the Midwest like you're talking about - we got a lot less vegetation or a lot less rain so we have a lot less of that good quality vegetation for the deer so our deer numbers are also going to be in check partially just because we don't have the the highest quality habitat for deer in most of our areas is what like what they're just eating grass and stuff right like what are they eating they'd a lot of brows a lot of brush sage right a lot of sage they can definitely sage there's a lot of like deer brush and just lots of variety of type of broaden and you walk through there there's tons of different varieties that they eat we actually have a couple deer radio collar right now that we're following in there they're always browsing on something when I see them usually something taller and how do you capture them we dart them so you do you set like you trap them and then dart them I tell y'all we freed ardham okay so how do you do that you basically just try to find where they're Adam he's basically hunting basically hunting with a dart rifle so it's a lot like archery basically I mean you rain just be like really short right yeah so somebody really go at the dart rifle and probably get up to 70 meters or so really I'm not that person I'm about 30 meters with mine how many deer have you darted I've only darted two here but we're hoping we still have four more we need to do so is it an air rifle uh so there's two different types there's one that's basically powered off a seat a 22 shell then there's another one that's powered off co2 hmm and so do you just with this thing how do you get good at it yeah you practice I mean it's like a rifle you got a scope and all that so you can count you get it all sighted in but the ballistics must be terrible how they're bad and it's even more complicated because you want it to arch really lightly you want to advance soft as possible cuz if you hit them hard they're gonna run right and the drug it's not like the drug takes them down immediately we usually have about ten minutes for the animal to go down and oh Jesus she'll never find them exactly so it's really about like arching that shot in there really softly hit them as soft as possible and then a lot of times they don't go very far Wow so like what's the feet-per-second of the dart oh I don't know we I haven't we don't have the Koenig refer you don't have a radar thing that you shoot it through we don't want to borrow mine sure okay well I'm gonna tee I want to know yeah I think that's interesting like what like because you must have like a but the drop must be huge it is like how do you sight in a scope for something for people to know what we're talking about I give you shoot a rifle rifle a bullet goes very fast so you could shoot out to 100 yards and it essentially is going to go exactly where you're aiming at but then when you go to 200 yards it gets a little tricky and you have to adjust your scope because it'll drop a little bit you get to 300 yards it'll drop a little bit more 400 yards and out is where it gets really weird like you're dealing with wind drift you're dealing with drop so I would imagine that a dart is not going very fast so it probably drops quite a bit it does and it's heavy they're fairly long there how many grains is half inches I don't know how many grains they are they don't come those measurements and I've never weighed one so I'm not positive but obviously because they are going so slow they're doing with wind drift at yeah five metres then it can start doing it so if you're not aerodynamic either right it's not horrible I mean it basically looks like a syringe yeah with the needle on the end then we have some feathers on the end oh so you have like fletchings to make sure you I wouldn't call it fletchings it's that's what it looks like yeah exactly like that 20 ml air for 10 point o ml dar was that mean so that's a you can put 20 milliliters of air for the 10 the dark that's the holds 10 milliliters of drug oh I see so that's that's not the exact drug we use we use one called I believe it's nude art no that's a little different it actually has a so ours least the ones we use for the deer we use these type as well but for the deer we use ones that have a little charge in them so when it hits it discharges basically by like a shell would doesn't look gunpowder in there that trigger triggers off Jesus Christ Wow so you have to sneak up on these deer and then do this yeah so what I was going to tell you kind of how we adjust for that distance because it's last question you're asking so the nice thing about our rifles versus a regular rifle so you get one chill and that's what you go with with us because it's air powered we can adjust our pressure so to account for that distance we know at 20 yards we do two bars of pressure at 30 yards we do three bars of pressure that one so we have a little more adjustability than typical rifle would so you're walking around with a rangefinder yeah and then you're changing it on your rifle as you go along yeah as we make our decision we because we don't like we don't walk with it charged we I mean our darts and they're ready to go but we don't fire I mean we don't have our our pressure up until we know what deer we're taking in the distance and are you just aiming for center mass and hip hip huh why hip because that's where the biggest muscle is oh I say okay so the drugs in act in intramuscularly right either so if you accidentally hit the ribs it's not good um it's not great no it's it still will probably put them to sleep the needles aren't long enough that it should do much damage so you hit a vital right I mean you know you can't ever say never but yeah it shouldn't but it's not gonna kill them they shouldn't know and that we practice a lot to make sure we hit where we went ahead yeah how you practice that you have a rubber deer that you shoot at we have archery targets that we shoot at yeah wow that's interesting and do you use a regular rifle scope or do you have like a scope specifically designed for darts now it's a regular rifle scope no kidding yeah Wow so how often are you practicing um before we do it I practice quite a few times I go out like I don't practice daily like you do with the archery right but I practice pretty regularly when I write before I was starting these last two we're kind of taking a break right now because they're fawning and so we don't want to dart them while they're of course dropping bombs dropping fawns we were I feel fawns a little bigger that's interesting move your missed one um I haven't taken that many shots did I miss any of my shots how many of you darted just the two just two yeah and we this is our first time doing to your stuff so Fish and Game came out and helped us with these guys and which was great and you have to dart to Moore's that we just said four more four more yeah and why Dix is that just like you just want a good study number that so we're looking at roadways and trying to identify crossing points for I mean we're not just doing deer we're doing other species as well but we're trying to identify where we can make improvements things like that wildlife overpass in other areas so that's why we're doing that and so we're just trying to get a sample size that we can kind of work with and the colors aren't cheap so it's it's about resources and what we have that runs towards the project and what and what are you trying to gather like what would it would data so it's all movement based data so they these are GPS collars they transmit us can be anywhere from I think the caller sixty points a day down to I think Milo is eight points a day and so it'll tell me it'll give me an idea of where the deer are approaching the roadways and how they're moving relative to the roadways so we can help come up with mitigation to improve their ability to get across okay so it's all about their migration and where they're moving around and keeping them away from danger yeah I mean I wouldn't quite call it migration but close enough yes idea is just to help them be able to get across now are they Columbia Blacktail these are not these are mule deer and our mule deer yeah no kidding yeah and now they they're like a pure meat mule deer I believe so hmm yeah the black tail start a little bit north of us I don't remember exactly where the cutoff line is but so like right around here like in the hills like Encino and stuff like that those are mule deer those are our mule deer wow that's interesting yeah yeah I always thought that too cuz I hunted for years and I always thought blocked hill but no once I got here and started working with them was like all these are all mule deer now how do they make the differentiation how they understand that there are some just physical characteristic differences and I think there's been some genetic work done as well because it only when you think of mule deer you think of a large deer with a big rack like mule deer have enormous racks yeah like that deer right there that's a mule deer yeah like if you saw one of those around here you'd be like holy shit you never see a deer that big around here no I mean there's some decent deer in these mountains but yeah it's I mean but mule not all mule deer that big there's lots where there's mule deer that are still quite small and that's just what we're doing with here is the smaller and you think it's because of the the Predators like they never really get a chance to get that bag because there's the populations are pretty small or is a genetic issue we think it's a genetic issue I mean they're this populations been kind of isolated for a long time from others but California generally is not thought of to have monster bucks even though there's plenty of mule deer in this state right so it's more just a factor of what's here and so north of us is where the Blacktail are yeah and why like where'd that what does that range begin I wish I could I'm not sure up top my head I wish I'm sorry in a breeding correct I'm sure there is yeah and they're viable or the hybrids I would assume they're viable but I'm not positive hmm yeah I'm not I'm definitely not fully up on all the deer literature so what other animals are you guys concerned with like they're theirs their safety and populations so I mean we're worried about the whole community I mean we knew things with frogs salamanders we do surveys for snakes we actually have a red-legged frog reintroduction right now reintroduction yeah so there's people complaining not enough red legged frogs well there used to be here and we had a well we don't really know why they disappeared but they disappeared thirty years ago or so and they were left in one little pool in one place and so we're just trying to help them get reestablished do don't let Donald Trump fun about this so cut funding right like a frog what we need that money to go to bankers I mean it seems it's it's fascinating to me that we do have these programs to like help out like a frog hmm yeah I mean it's all severable man-hours right uh it takes some but it's not huge amounts mates one person going out and doing these projects and it's not like that's their only job they have lots of different things they do right so it's just one small part of their job so they just bring like a bucket of frogs and throw them into the bushes it's not like guys yeah quite that simple they have to move egg masses basically it's what they do they do yeah oh so that when they move the egg masses do they move the mom as well and or the the the frogs just develop independently in the new area yeah they develop independent ooh that in their own area the mom doesn't care for their frogs or any of that bitches so when they do that when they when you drop off these egg masses in this place so this frog will be born or hatched in this area rather and they just assume this is where they live yep that's interesting so if you took a fully developed frog and put it there probably wouldn't know what to do with the area because it would be a new area for it it'd be like why am I here yeah this isn't my project either so I'm not a hundred percent on it but from my understanding is that they will try to move back towards their natal range and then they don't end up making it so it's better to do the tadpoles or the eggs and then they'll hopefully stay there that's cool so what is the benefit of having these red legged frogs around they're just a part of the ecosystem we think it's a good idea - exactly it's just trying to protect the overall ecosystem we don't really understand I mean we like to think we understand all this ecology and all that there it's it's complicated right we don't know that interaction swing Lobby species so a lot of its just trying to make sure that our full suite of species is there so our ecosystems right healthy as possible so when you reintroduce the red frog will there then be subsequent studies about the impact of the reintroduction of the red frog redleg frog and it's hard to know at this point I mean it's all based off funding like their Lea there's potential there but right now we we don't really know all right let me propose this to you what if you had an unlimited budget what if I made Justin Brown king of the world and I said listen dude you could do whatever the fuck you want with all this money and what would you do if you make any promises here no I wish I could I wish I could obviously I don't have that kind of power yeah of course yeah if I did though if I said listen man I'm gonna give you an unlimited budget to take care of this wildlife as you would see fit what would you like to have done well one of the first things would be that wildlife overpass you see for are released if you're talking about doing things for what's good for the local right ology here that would be probably the highest thing on my priority list because that is something that's not just affecting one species it's affecting everything that's within our mountain range which is fairly large under 50,000 acres that there's just completely being disconnected from other wildlife mmm so to me that that's our number one thing the other thing is so we have lots of issues with these poisons there I would try to find alternatives to these poisons that are being spread throughout the environment because that's a major issue for our wildlife yeah that is a giant issue when you see the mange that's on that cat and you think that that all comes somehow another from rat poison like whatever happen to rat traps like I will just use a trap and people don't let's see blood is that what it is that's my best assumption because people you try to recommend traps and they just won't do it there's such a trickle-down though when you're using those toxins I know it sets that's frightening to me because that gets to people in some way shape or form yeah definitely yeah that's it's my worry as well it also leaks into the ground like there's there's all sorts of weird effects you can get from poisons yeah and we don't even understand the facts we put tons of toxic ins out there that we have no idea the actual long-term effects or how it's going to change things I mean like these rat poisons there's a long time they said it wouldn't move up the food chain but we are quite clearly seeing it move up the food chain to have a mountain lion die of rat poison is crazy yeah do they die of it yeah we've had three mountain lions diaphragm poison Wow and you believe this from coyotes that's what we thank yeah so one of them they went back to a few kills that it made right before it died and they found that it killed a couple coyotes uh Wow Wow and it doesn't kill the Coyotes who knows the coyote have been really sick at that point and maybe that's how the mountain lion got it anyway exactly so cuz with these poisons a lot of times these animals don't die for four to ten days Oh God so they're walking circles I don't know if you've ever seen like rats walking circles out of running into buildings like I've seen a couple times out walking around that's generally what they're dying of their diet they're they're dying of dehydration basically because they're just bleeding out internally yeah so well that was actually in Dan Flores his book is that they had developed certain types of coyote poisons that were slow acting so that they could trick these coyotes into eating this stuff and the other coyotes wouldn't know where the Caillou got sick from because it took so long for them to die it wasn't like strychnine where you eat it you watch the other one die and that's also what rats do did you ever see that rat documentary on Netflix I heard you mention if I still haven't seen it you gotta watch it it's amazing it freaked me out it's nuts like when when they show the amount of rats that are in New York City and they show all the people dealing with them and they show them in the sewer system and everything it's mind-boggling and then they talk about how the rats will literally send a young dumb rat over to the poison and they watch that rat eat the poison and die and I'm like fuck this rat here and they all take off like they've got a whole system for dealing with poisons yeah well because they did the same thing with rat poisons my understanding they they kind of gone through different more for the poison to try to make them last a little longer so that because the rats will do the same thing the Coyotes doing not to eat it so that didn't surprise me they saw that documentary I don't have to watch that there's no way to mitigate the problem now I mean though the rat population is so large in New York City they think there's many rats as there are people or more yeah I believe it oh I mean I've been in little intersections down in LA at night and just rats it looks like the grounds moving at these crazy locations like most places you see go you don't see that me rats then also you'll hit this called a honey hole for frat yeah and they'll just be like whoa look at what the hell's going on here I was in New York City way back in the day it was so long ago there was payphones and I had to make phone call and I was getting gas so I pulled up this gas station I put the you know pump in I'm filling up my car and I go over to this pay phone to make a call at as I mean in the time it took me to walk from the pump to the payphone I'm watching rats jump on to the wheels of my car like they're jumping on the wheel and crawling up and down they're like I don't know if they're looking for food or they're looking to get in the engine for warmth or whatever but apparently people have a real issue with rats getting inside the hood of their car and like nesting they like climb in there for the heat and they stay warm inside the hood of your car good lord yeah I mean they're so adaptable but they instantaneously did I mean I pulled the car up put the pump in walked turned around like what the fuck I'm not talking about like one rat I'm talking five six seven rats just hopping up but another one would hop up and one would hop down it was terrifying because I was trying to figure okay am I gonna be driving there's gonna be a rat on the floor and then I'm gonna hit the gas instead of the brakes I'm gonna freak out like a little girl yeah it was terrifying now that would be creepy because they're just so adaptable I mean and it's it's an another essentially we don't like to think of them as a wild animal but a rat is a wild animal that lives in this weird symbiotic relationship with people in urban environments yeah I mean it's amazing there that is the one species that's probably more adapted to us than the Coyotes are obviously because they are able to live in almost everywhere that we live yeah and there I mean they serve a purpose and some sort of a weird way I mean if they were removed I wonder what the impact would be yeah I mean I'm sure we probably more nesting birds and some of that kind of stuff because we know that rats definitely impact bird species yeah and who knows there may not be if there was wasn't rats weather coyotes or some of these other small predators would be around the urban areas because they're obviously another prey source you know but trying to get a rats the whole another ball good luck yeah yeah it's just that's the one that's probably a IOT yeah in Nuuk death city you'd have to get everybody to agree and then they'd probably move back in within a couple of years yeah yeah it's you're not going to do it so this proposed bridge across the 101 what is is there a roadblocks that is it a funding issue is there anybody that is against it Oh as far as we know there's not anybody really against it there might be a few people in the nearby community that's worried about more mountain lions coming or something but yes we don't think that's a realistic thing because you're ovulating at holding capacity from as far as we understand so we don't think that's going to be a major issue but it's really about funding we're trying to National Wildlife Federation's leading the charge to try to raise I think the cost is over fifty million dollars to do this yeah so it's a big price tag the bridge is going to be quite wide it's going to be natural covered and it's going to ask to go over the gora Road and the 101 both and so why don't it's going to be a big bridge so why does that oh I wish I could call that of top of my head I yeah sorry you'd have to look it up I think it's probably on that thing you had up earlier so you probably deal with a few hundred yards or something yeah I mean it's almost as wide as it is long oh wow so it's gonna be big it's gonna also have it's going to be used for hiking during the day as well so it's not just for wildlife so people can go across it exactly because currently there's no easy way to go from the the Santa Monica's in the south to the Simi Hills in the north which are all public property so there's no way to get across there so people can hike they have to go down on the Liberty Canyon Road and cut across there which is kind of sucky so how does one raise money for something like this do they try to have like a GoFundMe or do they just rely on the state budget no after all they're doing fundraising trying to get people to kick in I believe the Annenberg has already offered to donate a million dollars matching so they've got to raise another million to get that amount it's all for the most part I believe it's all from either conservation agencies or from private donations so if you were king in the world that would be the first thing that you would work on as far as wildlife in California definitely for our region yes what about other issues other issues I mean habitat protections just obviously incredibly important if we want to keep all of our species so protecting more land is there's always a valuable thing to make sure that or at least make sure what development we do is done in a proper way now when you say protect more land would that be like buying up available private land when it comes for sale and then turning it into public land um to some level I would consider that I don't know if that would be my ultimate goal to me it's more important to lock it up so it's natural versus public versus private oh so like to stop development stop major developments from going in and putting things right in places that are going to be major blockages to wildlife movement yeah Boulder is kind of interesting in that way where they buy up all the available property and then turn into open space yeah so you can't develop on it ever yeah they're really smart with that because they think Boulder is an amazing place and that they've really recognized that they have this incredible sort of beautiful little community that's surrounded by this inescapable beauty of the mountains the he's you know get much more beautiful place and run boulders no make sense I mean if you want to keep your communities the way they are you kind of have to protect them the land yeah they're not into anybody developing there they're like no no let's not do that if you see really wise of them but it's amazing that they've a mad a managed rather to go so long without being co-opted by money you know mm-hmm yeah I mean that's kind of the name of the game I mean obviously we need developments because our populations keep growing so to me it's not always realistic to say we need to protect every piece of land we can protect right what development we do we need to do it smart and make sure that things are protected in the proper places is there any other wildlife issues in and around this area that uh are being addressed right now um I mean that's that those are the two biggest things going on that were we're actively trying to deal with yeah I can't think of too many I mean there's always the little nuisance issues that everybody's trying to deal with where a coyote is in somebody's yard or going after dogs or whatever that we try to deal with but those are the two major ones would be connectivity habitat loss and then just poisons and there are a lot of raccoons in this area um a lot I would depends what you comparing healthy population yeah there's a decent number of raccoons if you're comparing it to somewhere like Chicago no we don't have goggles larger population of Raccoon yeah they're just much more adept there they're just the way the landscape is a lot more mature trees mature forest which is what raccoons like a lot more water which are all things that attract raccoons we're we're a lot drier raccoons can occur within like our mountains but they do seem to be more focused near roadways and some of that stuff taken advantage of whatever resources are there well they're big garbage hunters too right they definitely take advantage of garbage they'll also eat lots of fruits and stuff so some of the scats you see in your yard that you think are coyotes they could be raccoon as well they eat a lot of berries and stuff so yeah found some skunk poop we're friends yeah my friend who recognized the mountain lion poop I sent him some stuff and I said what is this he said that skunk poop skunks are amazing like I before I start tracking these coyotes in downtown LA oh I never thought skunks could be down in that area there's actually decent number skunks like in that Westlake neighborhood yeah I could not believe how many skunks I've seen I smelled skunk in Hollywood last night I was driving through it could have been strong weed but I don't think it was I'm pretty sure it was an actual Scott okay I was leaving the Comedy Store and it just stunk of skunk and I was like how weird that these animals have figured out a way to live right here in like right near sunset yeah I know and air I mean little short legs not super mobile but yet these striped skunks seem to have figured it out yeah they did they were going after my chickens two little creeps really yeah yeah they're there apparently they like to eat chickens huh that's interesting yeah one night I actually had a we were sitting in the house me my wife just hanging out also here my chickens going crazy out there and I'm like we both got up and took off run and we have a lot of feral cats around our house and I was like listing cats are in there we go looking around our chickens are flying all over the yard because we hadn't gone out and closed the door yet because my chickens can kind of free-range my yard and we're looking around we'll see anything also I open up the coop door and there's a big old possum just sitting there grinning at me oh those criminals oh yeah so I didn't get anything it didn't affect didn't grab one of my chickens even though one of my chickens was just sitting there like looking at it and squawking it's like you should be he was trying he was trying but he just didn't they're not very fast they're not yeah they're with possums you like for me they're another species you don't need a drug to handle I can just you just grab them up by the tail usually and oh really hold on to a man now you could just run up to him and grab them people do there's definitely there was a guy doing his master's work on possums and he would drive around town and when he saw one he'd jump out of his car he's he out hanging out his friends you see a possum jump out grab it cram it in his trunk oh Jesus Christ and throw it in his trunk yeah that's that's dedication right there what did he do with it once he got it in his trunk he was collared him he's doing kind of like what we do here trying to identify their movements and it's going on with them what did they find out anything unusual I don't know I've never saw his talk I wasn't like I'd ran into him at a conference one time we got chatting about what he did and I was like that's pretty hilarious it is really weird how many animals we live around I mean it's really weird there's so many different and such a wide variety especially when it comes to birds you know one thing that I see a lot of is there's a lot of Hawks in my name and we did this thing in our backyard well we had a wrought iron fence and we changed part of it and put a glass fence and these Hawks hadn't figured it out and they would swoop down and slamming the fence headfirst week' out quite a few these poor Hawks I can imagine yeah but it's just amazing how many you find out there and how many predators mmm and there's the occasional golden eagle in this area too right we get reports of them coming through every once in a while yeah it's they're not super rare by any mean or super common by any means but they come through now and when you know whether or not you're looking at a golden eagle just because it's really big it's really big there's some other little characteristics that I'm not as good with but they're significantly larger than like the Red Tails which would be the one you'd be most likely to confuse it with yeah it's just the wide variety of different Raptors and these yeah it's amazing I mean I'd shouldered Hawks everyone smile we'll be trapping four bobcats and we'll catch a red shouldered Hawk on our traps it's like close so cool we've even caught a great horned owl once and so it's pretty neat seeing some of these animals up close yeah I'm worried that the owls in my neighborhood have been poisoned because I used to have quite a few of them and you used to hear them all the time used to hear them you know hooting all the time and one time I went out in my back porch and there was one sitting on the fence and it was huge I mean I don't know how big it really was because I'm sure I was kind of freaked out by it but I was shocked it was at least 2 feet tall and it was just sitting on his back I mean at least that tall I mean no exaggeration but it looked like it was like 4 feet tall looked it looked I couldn't believe how big it looked great horned owls are huge huge yeah I think they can carry away foxes yeah there's a study in Bakersfield that they've documented and howls coming down grabbing the kit foxes and carrying them up to their nest sites I had a video on Instagram it's still up there that I got online of this owl swooping down and jacking a hawk and it's next Oh have you ever seen that I haven't but I've heard about it my one of my co-workers actually is a falconer and he when he released or what did he do one of his Hawks got away from him and he said that tree was is being swarmed by great horns he stayed there all night trying to keep the trying to help his Hawk stay alive no kidding yeah isn't it crazy owls eat hawks yeah I didn't know that until he was telling me that like that's crazy I mean great horns are huge they check out this video cuz it's really not officially a picture I saw the other dad you know how long I was legs oh look at those legs never seen that before that that's crazy hard to find something even close to it but wow yeah they're amazing i got i worked at Cal State Bakersfield in there they had a Raptor rehab thing and I got to handle great horned owls when those guys flap their wings it's like whoa it was pretty crazy I comparable to the golden eagle the golden eagle is definitely more powerful but they go the long are they great horned owls be pretty amazing well our perception of them is so interesting because they're a serious predator but if most people don't think of an owl as a predator they think of them as some wise forest creature that gives advice on fire yeah well they're obviously not threat to you or me right obviously your cat they could potentially grab a scent right uh-huh and who knows is people get smaller and smaller dogs watch this because you see the eyes in the distance see the eyes yeah check this out I love this video being Wow the other hawk doesn't even know what happened he's like what's up what's going on what's what's happening man that'd you but I'll I do not know I don't know they look a little fuzzy yeah they do a little bit right especially the one in the back the one that gets jacked act Wow but the way it gets jacked it's like boy that thing's dead before it leaves the nest those claws and talons are so gigantic they are they're amazing well that's kind of why we want him around right hunting rabbits yeah rats and everything else yeah there and also because they're cool yeah yeah I mean that I think that's a big thing about coyotes too and I wish some of these short sighted folks that don't want them around because they're worried that they're going to get their dog and all this different stuff like man we're really lucky that we can see these things I mean nature is cool it's cool to see well it's amazing now I mean being in downtown LA though a lot of these people that live down there they don't ever get to see wildlife right now all suddenly there's this medium-sized carnivore run around their neighborhoods that they get to see and some people I mean it's funny I talked to one person that's like scared to death of this thing and the next person's like it's a coolest thing they've ever seen in their life right and it's always that balancing act I mean I to me I've always been pretty fascinated with them yeah I identify more with the people think it's cool it's just it's we're really like we were talking about we're really lucky we live in a very unique area and that we have this big city huge city and then just outside of it we have all this wildlife like real legit wildlife you can get from downtown LA to 100% wilderness in an hour yeah that's crazy yeah or less I mean nice yeah you can get into like Santa Monica's getting quickly from hill spots in LA and that's you get in there and it's pretty amazing well listen man I really appreciate you coming on here and sharing all your information and and and educating us on the stuff it's
