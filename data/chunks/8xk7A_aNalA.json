trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day so so let's back up I made a note here on that John Jones thing did you follow the whole John Jones drama in the most recent one the only post drama yeah was that he had a press conference the next day did you follow that press conference at all I saw the crime pictures okay me sent him to me all right yeah I went to that press conference and there was a couple of takeaways and this is all speculative but this doesn't make John innocent at all yeah well John's guilty they've got they've got the samples guilty but his actions were not that of a guilty man historically guilty guys go bury their head in the sand they try to outrun this thing they get with their legal teams they show up at the hearing they hope for the worst for the best they get the worst and they deal with it John face the music 12 hours later he came through the hotel his whole lives pulling apart right now I imagine he didn't sleep that night he comes to the hotel with the fans he comes into the media PR 101 says you read a script that was written for you and you exit the stage instead he read no script he took every question asked of him and that's just not what a guilty guy doesn't I understand that he's guilty in terms of who sada but what we care about is intent was he trying to get over on somebody was he trying to hide something his actions would represent that he didn't but here was the problem with the press conference jail when you hold a press conference you have you have one goal in mind which is to win over the media and that they say nice things about you before you do go home and bury your head in the sand secondly you want to break something you want to get something out there to get ahead of the story that's the whole reason you show up at these things the only card that he had to play is what did you test positive for that was the only thing we didn't know and they refused to reveal it so that was a little bit weird and where I was sitting because I've been in John's spot and here was the thing that happened with me where we're talking about John this whole thing is going on with John based on a test that took place on June 16th the reason that relevant when I went through my thing I was know he tested positive for some estrogen blockers those don't really have anything to do with anything they don't help your bit they're silly I think you might have just revealed something yeah he tested positive for two estrogen yeah but you just no one else knew that there you go I'm revealing it dare you yeah well broke personal information that's what we're doing here though right Wow but this is like this is like the only way that anybody could find that out is if you talked about it boom it's out there right and that we're doing here aren't we creating some news it's a big news day but listen but here's the relevant and let me tie myself into this when I went through this Joe I had something silly in there in fact I had an estrogen block I had something silly in there and everybody forgave I was I was going to be suspended but Fox everything I was fine everybody looked okay you know we changed the rules in the test night and everything was fine but what I had to live with what only I knew there was another test out there but the results hadn't come back yet and I didn't know what that test was gonna show I know what it could have shown I know what it should have shown but I know what the other test could have been showed of as well so you're sitting there hoping how good is this damn test that's all you're thinking about well we you and I had a conversation with you're the guy caught you were on stage and I'm blowing you up you're like hey man I'm doing a show can I call you tomorrow tonight I will stay CAPITAL LETTERS tonight I need to hear from you tonight yeah I remember the exact words you said well you know we were wondering how stringent these new text tests are turns out they're really good turns out it's a pretty good test turns out it's not like the old 1-800 requested test that cost $99 okay there's a reason this cause this test is 40 plus grand but the thing that I'm wondering does John have another test out there if he does it doesn't mean it's going to come back but that was the same spot I was in there was a shoe that could drop for me it did for him is there another test out there and if there's not then who sadhas' got some explaining to do if you're telling me a guy that's got a track record the tested positive for cocaine gonna fight in the biggest fight of his career in the last time you tested him was one month before the bout then oh sadhas' got some explaining to do but there's more to the story now what do we hear it does he pass his end up in the spot I don't know but that's that's the piece that's still missing well there's one aspect to his test his positive test that people are saying could possibly play a factor and it's supplements that he could possibly have been taking something that like this is what happened Tim means this is what happened Yoel Romero where they get a supplement and it says it has a bunch of stuff on it says you look through the ingredients okay creatine b12 we're good we're good but then when you run it through a lab it turns out there's a bunch of other stuff in there too and that's why it's so effective and that's why it sells so it is possible that that could be the case we don't know yet because then if that's the case then john has to give them all the supplements that he was taking and then they have to go to a store buy them independently test them and verify that these ingredients were in not just the batch that he hands them but also in other batches so it's not like he doctored it showing some stuff in there sure but estrogen blockers are usually when people are getting off of steroids right when you're coming off a cycle yeah it's a blocker you know men don't want estrogen anyway but it's a blocker it's it's not going to so as far as that substance goes and that's all that's all he's gonna have to live with you're not gonna evaluation explain how they work like for someone it doesn't all that an estrogen blocker will do if you up your testosterone then your estrogen just naturally ups and guys don't want estrogen so if your guy you you take a blocker that can block that bring it you won't get you know the demands over there you may come though I'm trying to make it work guy Gaston I can't even I came from bitch tits is all that comes to mind I can't think of the word dime dime we're closed I know I know I know gotta mastica at any rate it can stop some of those things so that's the speculation the reason that that's on the list is they find that that's a way they can catch you after the fact hey if we missed you doing the cycle we can catch you're here well it's not just that the the reason why they take it after the cycle is because you get hypogonadism your your your body stops producing testosterone because you took exogenous testosterone that's right and so the to restart it they take this stuff these estrogen blockers that's right yeah I tested positive for an estrogen blocker and it was that exact same thing they banned testosterone I went on something called HCG she'll return your testes back on and then you have to clone f√©in which is by definition an estrogen blocker for that same thing but it can also help get your body going back on testosterone so they're being John's got a problem again this comes back to the press conference he said I have not taken anything new that I have not taken my entire career so somebody gave him a follow-up question he quickly realized what he just said and he goes why I do have a new supplement company I have taken some new supplements so he realized he put himself in one point need to get out of it the supplement company then who dropped him immediately quit came out with the press release said do not put this on us we don't have anything to do with that and we'll turn over any samples you want so that that's that's the downside to holding a press conference is if there's anything the Commission hates it's when somebody isn't honest with them well there's anything who sada hates if it's with Lance Armstrong found out it's when you deny the scientific accuracy of their test that's the risk with holding a press conference that's why most legal teams will tell you go home be quiet rewrite the right to remain silent execute that show up at your hearing date get sworn in say your piece and then go on about your life how does John not have a trusted handler how does John not have someone who realizes that you don't just have like a high level athlete you have arguably the greatest light heavyweight of all time who has not in my opinion reached his potential yet I think John has massive potential outside of what he's actually shown because when he moved to Albuquerque and we saw that he was training all the time and we saw the most recent footage before he fought ovince st. Preux where he's powerlifting he looks fucking huge he's dedicated is eating clean he's making these Instagram videos of all this healthy food he's eating we're assuming he's getting the proper rest all these other things we're assuming okay the wild man days are gone he still got the wild man's mind but now he's gonna approach this like a real competitive athlete here's my question to you when someone is wild and talented and impulsive just a wild motherfucker like John Jones is is it even smart to rein that guy in can what cat can it affect him I mean is it a positive thing to read him in or is part of what he is and why he's so good and why he's willing to open with a flying neon Shogun their first fight I mean the first fight for a title it was he 23 for 20 opens up with a flying knee on you know one of the legends of MMA former pride champion or pride a Grand Prix Tramp champion and UFC champion as well you look at a guy like John and the way he competes in the way he's he's so creative and wild in there and impulsive it's almost like that's a part of his success I fully agree and historically I could bring up athletes where that is true or they go sober where they go straight in air when they find God whatever these things are and they change something that yeah the dominoes start to fall the problem is when you got a wild man like John he's in a box and it's a loose box and he's having some fights but usually that continues to escalate so he kind of needs to keep himself right in that framework and the bad news is it usually just keeps get it just usually just keeps pushing so that's a very important that becomes a problem that's a very important point where people escalate things like billionaires want more billions right they want Islands now they want fucking jets and spaceships and and with a pro athlete or a wild person who's doing crazy shit they want to do more crazy shit they want to drive 150 miles an hour right they want to ah man but it just seems like whatever the fuck you do just just nerf everything around him you know right by up to town yeah fucking have three guys that he trusts follow him around everywhere and make sure that he doesn't eat anything he's on supposed to eat her don't take any pills you're not supposed to take don't most of us don't drive I mean that was his biggest problem was getting behind the wheel in front of everything else he was doing like John you got to get you got to get a chauffeur you got to get uber you got to take a taxi don't get behind the wheel that was the most of his problems you had some other ones but that was the most of it you just took him out of the driver's seat a lot of this doesn't exist yeah a lot of it doesn't exist but this most recent one obviously does and the most like yeah he had those the car to two major car accidents we had that beautiful Bentley and slid it into a tree right and then obviously the one where you crashing that woman and left the scene of the crime which was horrendous he survived that though yeah you know she vibe that he came back and the ovince st. Preux fight he won he beat a top six guy on short notice and then this happens and to get positive on something as small and innocuous as estrogen blockers yeah I agree so you go back to that ovince ape proof right single worst performance is a performance of John's career single worst by light years then you break it down a little further he won the grappling he won the striking he won every round he did it he did it back off you didn't get tired he was stronger and that was on a bad day I didn't think it was a bad fight I you know everyone says a single worst performance I have a great deal of respect for ovince st. Preux and I think ovince is a very dangerous guy he's very explosive his left power kick is extremely strong he has a nasty left hook he's a southpaw and he fights odd he has a very odd style I would agree about ovince I think your assessment there is fair and I think his stock went up that night but when I'm watching John I'm going okay this isn't that this is a rusty John this is slower the outputs a little bit down the bottom line is on a bad day he left with a world championship on a bed that's how good he is the other side of John you know when you're talking about the car wrecks or talk about the cocaine or what he's going through now and again this is my takeaway from the press conference the biggest takeaway was John won't own anything and it's like John at some point you can't do the routine about I don't know why God put me in this spot this is a bit I don't know why God put me in the spot everything happens for a reason I'm going to come out better on the other sites like John you're acting like you got diagnosed with diabetes or cancer or something you know that you're the victim you were in a hit-and-run you did the hidden and you did the running that was your fault on the cocaine thing you didn't say somebody slipped me a Mickey said I was at a party in Brazil I rolled up 100 and went down to the tip that was your fault now you're in a jam here for two banned substances and you're still not taking response and you think God's put you in this spot it's like John said you put yourself in this spot and at some point if you're the baddest dude in the world and you are you got a man up on these things you got to man up and go hey I'm guilty and I how exactly it happened I'm gonna try to figure that out but I'm definitely guilty who sada does a good job I trust those labs let's get to the bottom of the jail son in public relations is what we need we need a man us need a little earpiece you put in John Jones ear you sit behind the screens you have a martyr he's gonna jog this is not John stop stop right there but you see the victim were no more victim were ya you stand up like Tony Montana in that fucking restaurant you're looking at the bad guy there's al oh there it is Oh through that bad guy yeah I like to party bitch I fucked up I took some shit what's up what's up laments would have testosterone blockers or estrogen blockers excuse me none that I've ever heard of and again but there but if they boost testosterone right estrogen blockers apparently that is more of an effective testosterone how's it work I've never heard that now that could be true I think of myself as kind of an expert in this field from being on the wrong side but you know we're on both sides of it but I I've never heard of that I can't imagine why supplement company would do that and this supplement company wasn't like Tim means his company or Yoel Romero they came out with a press release instantly so do not put this on us let us know what you need from us we'll drop it off at the lab ourselves Jamie see if you find this online because someone told me about it this weekend and I never got a chance to look at someone said that there are certain things in supplements that you know could have been sold by a company that would allow you to test positive for these very things see if you can find that in relationship to John Jones's test because I remember someone talking about it I said I gotta remember to look this up well it's owned they're only kept those two chemicals they only exist like in a pharmaceutical world right well that's right so it's not like it's a root or something and you know okay no and then wait what exactly they got him for me that that's still coming out but that was one of the things again to go back to the press conference and I think I think John did more good than he did bit I think it was kind of a good thing that he came out he showed courage he didn't really strip to answer all the questions but the bad was he didn't tell us what he tested positive for right and the bad news now he stuck with speculation if he would have come out and told us exactly what it was you and I went have to guess and go to the Internet and smokey and speculate and rumors is which what you don't need right I don't know why he held that with understanding Assad is gonna tell us if you're not telling SATA I don't think they know no I don't really I think they're gonna charge him and then you're getting sued well if they're going to charge him and they are within the event that I'm going for permanently one dearly it's a nickel information you'll take it well no not if it's medical information I suppose you're right with HIPAA but this doesn't fall under that the Commission's going to bring charges against for certain supplements are going to bring him in require that he's there they're going to have to address it then he's going to say his piece look I took this I didn't think I'd get caught or I don't know anything about it that's that's a route guys go as well but the bottom line is it's going to come out I thought he had a good opportunity to tell us what it was and perhaps give a guess as to how it got in his system if he's going to take that path the outright denial path that's not a great one historically but some guys taken if that's the route he's going to go to of outright denial tell us what it is
