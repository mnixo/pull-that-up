you to ask me this I want you to ask me what my experience with Joe but how did you meet him how did he come into the fold I met Joey Diaz in the late 90s at the Comedy Store I think I met him in like 96 or 97 something like that right when Joey moved to LA we just started hanging around the Comedy Store we became friends and then I started taking him on the road with me like the late 90s okay we've been best friends forever so I know of Joey I don't know Joey I've never met him never met Joey never I call him up right now TV and the whole bit and you know I know him from chameleon when I see your podcast and all the but and he's in the circles he does some Jiu Jitsu he's funnier in hell and he's a gangster so I like him but I don't know anything about him so he comes on my podcast now he has a podcast so of course my opening line to him is hey how'd you get into pocket right I'm gonna put here's your plug for your podcast and we're gonna go on and talk about my agenda so I say Joe I say to him Joey how'd you get into podcast in his response you know Chael Sonnen he wouldn't call me jail it was always you know what jail son still calls me joe rogan i mugged a hooker down in new jersey and senator late set her wig on fire it's okay we got sued there's two moving parts here first off that is how that answers my question of how but now I need to know the story here so he ties it all together with so he went on something she's something he got in appearance he told the story of mug and her hooker in New Jersey and setting her wig on fire and all of a sudden he blew up overnight he cuz yeah I realized people like those stories I never knew that I had stories from the part of the country I'm in in the neighborhood I grew up and I thought everybody had these stories he's like chill son and I thought I'd tell you i mugged a hooker and light her wig on fire you go yeah well I'm out ten hookers and what ten wigs on fire no I had stories and then it just goes from there and he starts telling me about son so he ends up doing two years or 18 months I said well what kind of jam did you get in there and he said well I was actually I was doing the cops job for him you know the cops don't want drugs on the streets I went took two kilos off the streets forum this is how he presents it to me he goes yeah you know the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal oh he said Oh III robbed two kilos he goes and you know what else chill Sonnen I just happened to have a machine gun and I could see where that happening because she has sometimes you just back into a machine guy had a machine gun with me and he goes but it's funny I wasn't in trouble for the gun I really wasn't that much trouble for the drugs what they were upset about was the kidnapping I'm good okay what what happened yeah this is my intro to the guy I'm like what what the hell is this story you probably know the story but I did it so he tells me the whole story he says yeah but you know kidnapping is kind of a weird charge because when you invade all they got in that scuffle in the Ultimate Fighter if I come and grab you and I take you into the next room just to cool you down taking you into a room against her what that's kidnapping so I think like they got him on a technicality jam like what they're doing with Frank Mir some of these guys were talking about and I said okay is that what happened and he goes no I duct-taped the guy who's in my trunk and I held him in the house for a week before I let him go well then why did you tell me why did you bring up the initial example of taking me next door and cool and me get what that have to do I still don't know cuz he's crazy very kangaroo looking yeah yeah dude kangaroos scare the fuck out of me now all the sudden they started getting jacked when I was a kid when I was a kid do you think they'd lift like they were like fucking schoolteachers like they were just like newspaper reporters or something or a librarian no it

kangaroo window fist-fighting himself in a window shadowboxing a window that's a weird animal I love them I think they're great but it's so weird what it does like though the way it acts sits on its tail we think it's bouncing around these legs jacked upper body they were there was like they get spooked easy to like this one big one was trying to have sex I'm gonna say it wasn't sex it was definitely rape but it was like he was pulling her back and she was trying to get away but there was a reason she was trying to get away is cuz there was like a weird wing come then when it came they all scattered then they went under the tree and then they got into it and I was like oh maybe she just wanted some privacy or it was really interesting how they had a sneak out but she was scared and then as soon as this weird thing came it was like a wind they all went scattered and then they got back into it yeah so scary me so it's knock on the door that was not too jacked boy boy it's creepy though God getting pissed don't you scratch my window video oh my god he's not wrong himself at the window fuck man he's trying to chest off himself oh he's trying to fight what he sees as a reflection in the window whoa
