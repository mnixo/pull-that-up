person yeah whoa that's deep nice yeah empty yeah I mean they live in places I don't like it live there Wow well now what city has is there any city in the country that actually has a legitimate problem with coyotes can you talk to I mean la we definitely have our issues right I mean there's been bites there's been other hazards and vines been bitten yeah Legion Park had some bites there's been bites down in Orange County their line had some bites are they biting homeless people or they biting people to take naps whether it's all over the board usually it seems to be tied to people been feeding it and it's almost coming up and biting like people on the hands or people on the leg I don't think any of them know the ones I've heard have been like where they're trying to take the person down really tight thing they've all been more like where they're coming up and none of them like that none of them have yes you heard about that woman who's a folk singer in Canada that got killed yeah actually years back by coyotes yeah I actually went up there a couple years after that they actually got a study going on coyotes up there they've radio collared a bunch and I went up there and helped him capture the first couple animals to kind of see what's going on and that's just a crazy scenario out there it's way different than what we see down here the coyotes first are their Eastern coyote so they're a little bit bigger but they're also they kind of there's very few food sources up there they're doing with snowshoe hares which their cycles kind of fluctuate up and down and so sometimes there could be tons of food and other times there could be almost none but they've learned that they can take advantage of moose during the winter and they're actually killing moose in the snow what you think of this little for teh pound animal take it on this huge moose but they're seeing it they do these snow surveys and they're finding these dead moose that were very clearly killed by coyotes Wow so a full-grown moose yeah that's insane now a full-grown moose is like more than a thousand pounds yeah yeah no it's it's amazing I mean obviously these moose in the winter the snow gets deep there they're definitely they can get stuck in things and that type of scenario how do they know that it's coyote to kill them in our wolves there's no wolves there wow that's crazy yeah so I had Russian nurses running from me and just crazy stories like what were they trying to do to you well this Russian nurse was in an allergist office and she was giving wrong doses to the kids and stuff of shots vouchers allowed all my documentation like these yellow pads I goes there's uh you can see right I'm 22 years old you can see right here then she tries to grab it now it's a tug-of-war across a desk and I don't know what the fuck is going on and she takes off and runs down the hallway and I'm 22 I shit I start to run down the hallway afterward and she goes into a patient room and then she locks the door and then I get the door open on somebody unlock and she's in there and she's talking to her husband on the phone she goes I'm through there is a mom here who still me lies he told me lies and and I didn't want to tell you is what I am pregnant and I'm going to lose the baby because of this mom I totally freaking out all my so I had a tea to teach a bunch of Vietnamese people had a shit there was one day I got awake a call yeah I got a call from you on the issue well they were amongst okay you know how long is if you saw a gran torino that movie with Clint Eastwood I think the H is silent yeah mom's yeah alright the H M o un geez yeah and then there are people without a land yeah and then they call came to San Jose California to work in assembly plants so they're in this cable assembly plant plant called cable Co that was a big client ours and I got a call from it's really cool guys names chip chip Bronk because al you gotta get down here you're not going to fuck them believe it and I got a situation and I go what is it because better you see and I go to the bathroom shit everywhere was because they had never been used to toilets so they were standing on the toilet seats I found out that's what was going on they all had fake names like the name is fook Li but you can call me Keith that stuff like hey Keith spookley can you come here for a second can I start Alyssa shit everywhere like on the ground yeah they were missing so tonight is not that fucking hold you up so they're waddling up there standing on the turning on the toilets so what they were just used to like shitting in the ocean in holes all my Krister lucky you know in the woods or whatever so this is your eyes so if you like even Ella you were the older forever so yeah just backed up his queens of brick yeah so on anyway I gathered everybody around I just appointed a bathroom monitor oh my god a bathroom monitor so I had one of the guys who's a supervisor I had a clipboard I put a lock on the bathroom door and then so you become this corporate fixer that's what I was doing you tell me a story didn't that we engaged in that famous that's not about this journey I'll give you an example the prodigal son parable Christian seems the religious villain really make much sense do you know the story sure but why don't you lay it out so there's a father he has two sons an old son a younger son and he says to them who wants to spend their inheritance the younger sister says me dad I can't spend it and the younger son takes all the dough and he runs off and sniffs coke off strippers tits for a number of years until he realizes this is getting pretty boring and I'm in a lot of trouble he ends up feeding throwing food to pigs that's his job and he can't even eat the food that he gives to the pigs at which point he says bad for you take me back dad then goes to they don't meet somehow happens not through telephones it just happens at which point dad goes to the fatted calves has killed the fatted calf older sons hold on dad what's going on I've stayed with you since the beginning I've been loyal to you and I hear the stories of my younger brother coming back who's been sniffing coke off strippers tits for the laptop from those how many years and you'll prepare to kill the fatted calf what's the SP dad I want another story this is you're right son don't worry about that you take a look slide a little step to the side you'll always be with me you're a good boy at which point it goes out to me the prodigal son the wasteful son the wasteful son returns and he says you were lost and they have found that's the end of the story it's quite hard to make sense of that in a literal sense you get old dad was a bit unfair I mean you should have been kind to the oldest son because he never ran off and did anything but the essence of the story is that you are the father you are enough your older son is your intellect says all Daniel is been doing that is trying to reconcile make sense of a prosaic and material world the younger son being the wild feral entity that he is let's go out and find out what it's all about so in his recklessness and sense of adventure he finds that he can't escape himself so he has to return to himself and at which point he has to accept who he is which born intellect is left out the equation pretty much is the older brother because he can't understand the significance of the journey of the wasteful brother in the end you have to leave yourself to understand the value of yourself you have to lose stuff before you realize that all the stuff that you're losing is ephemeral and transitory it's not yours you're enough you're always enough but you've got to somehow prostitute yourself before you realize your own value that is the essence of all stories [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
