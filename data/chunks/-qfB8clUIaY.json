boom hello Ben hey there good to see you man yeah it's a pleasure to be here thanks for doing this yeah yeah thanks thanks for having me I've been I've been looking at some of your shows in the last last few days just to to get a sense of how you're thinking about AI and crypto and the various other things I'm involved in it's been interesting well I've been following you as well I've been paying attention to a lot of your lectures and talks and different things you've done over the last couple days as well getting ready for this it's a AI is either people are really excited about it or they're really terrified of it those are the sort it seems to be the two responses either people have this dismal view of these robots taking over the world or they think it's going to be some amazing sort of symbiotic relationship with it we have with these things it's gonna evolve human beings past the the monkey stage that we're at right now yeah I tend to be on the lather more positive side of this dichotomy but I think one thing that has struck me in recent years is many people are now you know mentally confronting all the issues of writing AI for the first time and I I mean I've been working on AI for three decades and I first started thinking about AI when I was a little kid in the early late 60s and early 70s when I saw a eyes and robots on the original Star Trek so I guess I've had a lot of cycles to process the positives and negatives of it where it's now like suddenly most of the world is thinking through all this for the first for the first time and you know when you first wrap your brain around the idea that there may be creatures ten thousand or a million times smarter than human beings at first this is a bit of a shocker right and then I mean it takes a while to internalize this into your worldview well it's that there's also I think there's a problem with the term artificial intelligence because it's it's it's intelligent it's there it's a real thing yeah it's not artificial it's not like a fake diamond or fake Ferrari it's a real thing and it's not a great term there's been many attempts to replace it with synthetic intelligence for example but for better or worse like AI is there it's part of the popular imagination that seems it's an imperfect word but it's it's not going away well I my question is like are we married to this idea of intelligence and of life being biological being carbon-based tissue and cells and blood and or insects or mammals or fish or are we married to that too much do you think that it's entirely possible that what human beings are doing and what people that are at the tip of AI right now that are really pushing the technology what they're doing is really creating a new life-form that it's it's going to be a new thing that just the same way we recognize wasps and buffalos and artificial intelligence is just going to be a life-form that emerges from the creativity and ingenuity of human beings well indeed so I mean I've long been an advocate of a philosophy I think of as pattern ISM like it's the pattern of organization that appears to be the the critical thing and the you know the individual cells and going down further like the molecules and particles in our body are are turning over all the time so it's not the specific combination of elementary particles which makes me who I am or makes you who you are it's a pattern by which they're organized and the patterns by which they change over time so I mean if we can create digital systems or quantum computers or femto computers or whatever it is manifesting the patterns of organization that constitute intelligence I mean then then there you are there there is intelligence right so that that's not to say that you know consciousness and experience is just about patterns of organization there may be more dimensions to it but when when you look at what constitutes intelligence thinking cognition problem-solving you know it's the pattern of organism not the specific material as as far as we can tell so we can see no reason based on all the science that we know so far that you couldn't make an intelligent system out of some other form of matter rather than the specific types of atoms and molecules that make up human beings and it seems that were we're well on the way to being able to do so when you're studying when you're studying intelligence you're studying artificial intelligence did you spend any time studying the patterns that insects seem to cooperatively behave with like how leafcutter ants build these elaborate structures underground and you know wasps build these giant colonies and did you study how I did actually yes so I I I sort of grew up with the philosophy of complex systems which was championed by that by the Santa Fe Institute in the 1980s and the whole concept that there is an interdisciplinary complex system science which includes you know biology cosmology psychology sociology there's sort of Universal patterns of of self-organization and you know ants and ant colonies that have long been the paradigm case for that now I I used to play with the end colonies in my backyard when I was a kid and you'd lay down food in certain patterns you'd see how their answer laying down pheromones and the colonies are organizing in the in a certain way and that's an interesting self-organizing complex system on its own it's lacking some types of adaptive intelligence that that human minds and human societies have but but it has also interesting self-organizing patterns this reminds me of the novel Solaris by Stanislaw LEM which was published in the sixties which was really quite quite a deep novel much deeper than the movie that was made of it did you ever read the book so Larry so what I'm not familiar with the movie either who well so where there was an amazed brilliant movie by Tarkovsky the Russian director from the late 60s then there was a movie by Steven Soderbergh which was sort of climbed up and Americanized and all that was fairly recent yeah ten years ago but that wasn't didn't get all the deep points in the novel the original novel in essence there's this there's this ocean coating the surface of some alien planet which has amazingly complex fractal patterns of organization and it's also interactive like the patterns of organization on the ocean respond based on what you do and when people get near the ocean it causes them to hallucinate things and even causes them to see simulacra of people from their past even the like the person who they had most harmed or injured in their past appears and interacts with them so clearly this ocean has some type of amazing complexity and intelligence from the patterns it displays and from the weird things it reeks in your mind so that the people on earth try to understand how the ocean is thinking they sent a scientific expedition there to to interact with that ocean but it's just so alien even though it monkeys with people's minds and clearly is doing complex things no two-way communication is ever is ever established and eventually the the human expedition gives up and goes home so it's a very Russian ending to the novel I guess it's not I saw that but that the the interest the interesting message there is I mean there can be many many kinds of intelligence right I mean human intelligence is one thing the intelligence of an ant colony is a different thing the intelligence of human society is a different thing ecosystem is a different thing and there could be many many types of AIS that we could build with many many different properties some could be wonderful to human beings some could be horrible to human beings some could just be alien Minds that that we can't even relate relate relate to very very well so we we have a very limited conception of what an intelligence is if we just think by close analogy to to human minds and this this is important if you're thinking about engineering or growing are the official art forms their artificial minds because it it's not just can we do this it's what kind of mind are we going to engineer or evolve and there's there's a huge spectrum of possibilities yeah that's one of the reasons why I asked if we've created if human beings had created some sort of an insect and this insect started organizing and developing these complex colonies like a leaf cutter ant and building these structures underground people would go crazy they would panic they would think these things are organizing they're gonna they're going to build up the resources and attack us they're gonna try to take over humanity I mean this what what people are worried about more than anything when it comes to technology I think is the idea that we're going to be irrelevant that we're going to be antiques and that something new and better is going to take our place which is which is all most of them oh yeah so we're thinking worried about it because it's sort of the history of biological life on earth I mean well yeah there's complex things they become more accomplished Eldora isms to multi-celled organisms there seems to be a pattern leading up to us and us with this unprecedented ability to change our environment that's what we can do right we can manipulate things poison the environment we can blow up entire countries with bombs if we'd like to and we can also do wild creative things like send signals through space and land on someone else's phone on the other side of the world almost instantaneously we have incredible power but we're also we're also so limited by our biology yeah the thing I think people are afraid of and I I'm afraid of but I don't know if it makes any sense is that the next level of life whatever artificial life is or whatever the the the the human symbiotic that it's going to lack emotions it's going to lack desires and needs and all the things that we think are special about us our creativity our desire for attention and love all our camaraderie all these different things that are sort of programmed into us with with our genetics in order to advance our species that we we were so connected to these things but they're so that the reason for war they're the reason for the lies deception thievery there's so many things that are built into being a person that are responsible for all the woes of humanity but we're afraid to lose oh yeah I think it's it's almost inevitable by this point that humanity is going to create synthetic intelligences with tremendously greater general intelligence and practical capability than human beings have I mean I think I know how to do that with the software I'm working on with my own team but if we fail you know there's a load of other teams who I think are a bit behind us but they're going in the same direction now I feel like you're at the tip of the spear with the stuff I do but I also think that's not the most important thing from a human perspective the most important thing is that humanity as a whole is quite close to this this threshold event right so how far do you think it's quite close by my own gut feeling five to thirty years let's say that's pretty close but if I'm wrong and it's a hundred years like in the historical timescale that sort of doesn't matter it's like did the Sumerians create civilization ten thousand or ten thousand and fifty years ago like what what difference does it make right so I think we're quite close to creating superhuman artificial general intelligence and that's in a way almost inevitable given where we are now on the other hand I think we still have some agency regarding whether this comes out in a way that you know respects human values and culture which are important to us now given who and what we are yeah or that is essentially indifferent to human values and culture in the same way that we're mostly indifferent to chimpanzee values and cult at this point I'm completely indifferent to insect values and culture not completely if you think about it I mean if I'm building a new house I will bulldoze a bunch of ants but yet we get upset if we extinct an insect species right so we we care we care to some level but not but we but we would like the super ai's to care about us more than we care about insects or gradation solutely right and I think this this is something we can impact right now and to to be honest I mean in a certain part of my mind I can think well like in the end I don't matter that much my four kids don't matter that much my granddaughter doesn't matter that much like we are patterns of organization in a very long lineage of patterns of organization and they matter very much to you yeah and another you know dinosaurs came in one and the under thoughts came in what humans may come and go the a is that we create may come and go and that's the nature of the universe but on the other hand of course in my heart from my situated perspective as an individual human like if some AI tried to annihilate my my ten month old son that would try to kill that AI right like so as as a human being situated in this specific you know species place and time I care a lot about the condition of all of us humans and so I would like to not only create a powerful general intelligence but but create one which which is is going to be beneficial to humans and other life forms on the planet even while in some ways going going beyond everything that we are right and there can't be any guarantees about something like this on the other hand Humanity has really never had any guarantees about anything anyway right i mean since since since since we created civilization we've been leaping into the unknown one time after the other in the somewhat conscious and software we're way about it from you know agriculture to language to math to the Industrial Revolution were leaping into the unknown all the time which is part of why we're where we are today instead of just another animal species right so we can't have a guarantee that AGI is artificial general intelligence as we create are going to do what we consider the right thing given our current value systems on the other hand I suspect we can bias the odds in the favor of human values and and culture and that's something of I've put a lot of thought and work into alongside the you know the basic algorithms of artificial cognition is the issue that the initial creation would be subject to our programming but that it could perhaps program something more efficient and design something like if you build create you have to I mean general generalization is about creativity right yeah but is the issue that it would choose to not accept our values which it might follow clearly will choose not to accept our values and we want it to choose not to accept all of our values so it's more a matter of whether the ongoing creation evolution of new values occurs with some continuity and respect for the previous ones so I mean with I have four human kids now one is a baby but the other three are adults right and with each of them I took the approach of trying to teach the kids what my values were not just by preaching at them by entering wisdom into shared situations but then you know when your kids grow up they're gonna go in their own different directions right and these are humans but but they all have the same sort of biological needs which is one of the most they're still as an analogy I think the AI is that we create you can think of as our mind children and we're starting them off with our culture and values if we do it properly or at least with a certain subset of the whole diverse self-contradictory mess of human culture and values but you know they're going to evolve in a different direction but you want that evolution to take place in a reflective and caring way rather than the heedless way because if you think about it the average human a thousand years ago or even 50 years ago would have thought you and me were like hopelessly immoral miscreants who would abandoned all the valuable think things in life right I mean I'm I mean I'm an infidel right I don't I don't I haven't gone to church ever I guess I mean my my mother is lesbian right I mean there's all these things that we take for granted now that not that long ago were completely against what most humans considered maybe the most important values of life so I mean human values itself is completely a moving a moving target right and something in our generation yeah yeah yeah in our generation pretty radically very radically when I think back like to my childhood I lived in New Jersey for nine years of my childhood and just the level of racism and anti-semitism and sexism that were just I'm ambient and taken for granted then was this between I think if this were the same age were both yeah yeah yeah everyone in 66 I lived in Jersey from 73 to 82 okay so I was there from 67 to 73 oh yeah yeah so yeah I mean like my I mean my sister went to the high school from with a with a black guy and so we got our car turned upside down the windows of our house smashed it was like a you humongous thing and it's almost unbelievable now right because not now no one would care care whatsoever it's just life certainly into some fringe parts of this guy yeah yeah but but still the point is there is no fixed list of values human values it's an ongoing evolving process and what you want is for the evolution of the AIS values to be coupled closely with the evolution of human values rather than going off in some other Li different direction that we can't even understand so this is literally playing God right I mean if you're talking about like trying to program in values I don't think you can program ins values that fully you can program in a system for learning and growing values and here again the analog analogy with human kids is not hopeless like telling telling your kids these are the ten things that are important doesn't work that well right what what works better is you enter into shared situations with them they see how you deal with the situations you guide them in dealing with real situations and that forms their system of values and this is what needs to happen with a eyes they need to grow up entering into real-life situations with human beings so that the real life patterns of human values which are worth a lot more than the the homilies that we enunciate formerly wrote the real life pattern of human values gets inculcate enlike into the intellectual DNA of the AI systems and this is part of what worries me about the way the AI field is going at this moment because I mean most of the really powerful narrow AI eyes on the planet now are involved with like selling people stuff they don't need spying on people or like figuring out who should be killed or otherwise abused by some government right so if the early stage a is that we build turn into general intelligences gradually and these general intelligences are you know spy agents and advertising agents and like what what what mindset did he early stage a eyes have as they grow right if they don't have any problem morally and ethically with manipulating us which were very malleable right we're so easy to manipulate what we're teaching them we're teaching them to manipulate keep on we're rewarding them for doing it successfully right yeah so this is this is one of these things that from the outside point of view might not seem to be all that intelligent it's sort of like gun laws in the u.s. living in Hong Kong I mean most people don't have a bunch of guns sitting around their house and coincidentally there there are not that many random shootings happening in Hong Kong so yeah you look in the you coincidence yeah you look in the u.s. it's like somehow you have laws that allow random lunatics to buy all the guns they want and you have all these people getting shot so similarly like from the outside you could look at it like this species is creating the successor intelligence and almost all the resources going into creating their successor intelligence are going into making a eyes to do surveillance like military drones and advertising agents that brainwash people into buying crap they don't need know what I think what's wrong with this picture isn't that just because that's where the money is like this is the yes is the introduction to it and then from then we'll find other uses and applications for it but like right now that's where there's a little thing is there's a lot of other applications financial financially viable well yeah the applications that are getting the most attention are the financial lowest hanging fruit right so for example among many projects I'm doing with my singularity net team we're looking at applying AI to you know diagnosed agricultural disease so you can you can look at images of plant leaves you can look at data from the soil and atmosphere and you can project whether disease in a plant is likely to progress badly or not which tells you do you need medicine for the planet do you need pesticides now this this is an interesting area of application it's probably quite financially lucrative in a way but it's a more complex industry than then selling stuff online so the fraction of resources going into AI for agriculture is very small than like e-commerce or some very specific aspect of agriculture to predicting diseases yeah yeah but there there's there's a lot of specific aspects right so I mean AI for medicine again there's been papers on machine learning applied to medicine since the 80s and 90s but the amount of effort going into that compared to advertising or surveillance is very small now this has to do with the structure of the pharmaceutical business as compared to the structure of the tech business so you know when you look into it there's there's there's good reasons there's good reasons for for everything right but nevertheless the way things are coming out coming down right now is certain biases to the development of early stage a eyes are very market and then you could you could you could see them and I mean I'm trying to do something about that together with my colleagues in singularity net but of course we're so it's sort of a David versus Goliath thing it seemed well of course you're trying to do something different and I think it's awesome what you guys are doing but it just makes sense to me that the first applications are going to be the ones that are more financially viable it's like well the first applications were military right I mean until about ten years ago 85% of all funding in the AI was from us plus plus Western Europe militaries well what I'm getting at is it it seems that money and and commerce are inexorably linked to innovation and technology because there's this sort of thing that we do as a culture where we're constantly trying to buy and purchase bigger and better things we always want the newest iPhone the greatest you know a laptop we don't want them to the coolest electric cars whatever whatever it is and this fuels innovation this this desire for new greater things materialism in a lot of ways fuels innovation because this is a buzz but I think there's an argument that as we approach a technological singularity we need new systems because if you look at that things have happened during the last century what's happened is that governments have funded most of the core innovation I mean this is well known that like most of the technology inside the smartphone was funded by US government a little about European government GPS and the batteries and everything and then companies scaled it up that they made it user-friendly they decreased cost of manufacturing and this process occurs with a certain time cycle tour like government spends decades funding core innovation and universities and then industry spends decades figuring how to scaled up and make it palatable to users and you know this matured probably since World War two the this sort of modality for technology development but now that things are developing faster and faster and faster there's sort of not time for for that cycle to occur where the government and universities incubate new ideas for a while and then technology scales it up so genies out of the bottle essentially yeah but we still need a lot of new amazing creative innovation to her and but somehow our other news new structures are gonna have to evolve to make it happen and you can see everyone's struggling to figure out what these are so I mean this is why you have I mean you have big companies embracing open-source Google releases tensorflow in there and there's a lot of a lot of other different things and I think I think some projects in the cryptocurrency world have been looking at that too like how do we use tokens to incentivize you know independent scientists and inventors to do this stuff without them having to be in the government research lab or in a big company so I think we're gonna need the evolution of new systems of innovation and of technology transfer as things are are developing faster and faster and faster and this is another thing that sort of got me interested in the whole decentralized world and the block is the promise of new modes of economic and social organization that can you know bring more of the world into the research process and accelerate the technology transfer process I definitely want to talk about that one of the things that I wanted to ask you is when when you're discussing this well I think what your mate is saying is of one very important point that we need to move past the military gatekeepers of Technology right not just military though though it's it's big tech which are at advertising agencies in social media things that are constantly predicting your next purchase right yeah because if you think if you think about it and I mean even in a sunny democracy like we have in the US I mean those who control the brainwashing of the public in essence control who votes for what and who controls the brainwashing of the public is advertising agencies and who increasingly are the biggest advertising agencies are the big tech companies who are accumulating everybody's data and using it to to program their minds to buy things so this is what's programming the global brain of the human race and of course there are close links between big tech and in the military like look at Amazon has what 25 thousand person headquarters in Crystal City Virginia right next to the Pentagon and I mean China it's even more direct and unapologetic right so it's a new like military industrial advertising complex which is is guiding the evolution of the global brain on the planet which found that with this past election right with all the intrusion by foreign entities trying to influence the election that they've these giant houses set up to write bad stories about whoever they don't want to be in office yeah in a way that's almost a red herring but it I mean the Russian stuff is almost a red herring but it reveals what the processes are which are used to program oh because I think the whatever programming of America mine's is done by the Russians is many minuscule compared to the programming of Americans minds but I got the American yeah American corporate and government elite it's fascinating that anybody's even jumping in as well yeah sure it's it's it's it's interesting and if you look at what's happening in China that's like yeah yeah yeah they're they're way better than we are much more horrific right and as well it's more it's more professional it's more polished it's more centralized yeah on the other hand for almost everyone in China China is a very good place to live and you know the level of improvement in that country in the last thirty years has just been astounding right lucky I mean you can't you can't argue with how much better it's gotten there something took over it's it's tremendous because they're not they embraced capitalism to a certain extent they've created their own unique system what what labels you give it is is almost arbitrary they they've created their own unique system as a you know crazy hippie libertarian anarchist socialist freedom-loving maniac that system rubs against migraine in many ways on the other hand empirically if you look at it it's improved the well-being of a of a tremendous number of people so hopefully it evolves and it's one but the way it's evolving now is not in the more pop freedom love well it's not in a more freedom loving and anarchic direction what one would say it's positive in some ways and negative and others like most um I fell in love with a Chinese woman she's she has great reason we had a baby recently she she's not from Hong Kong she's from mainland China I met her when she was doing her PhD in computational linguistics and shaman but that was what sort of first got me to spend a lot of time in China but then I was doing some research at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and then my good friend David Hansen was visiting me in Hong Kong I introduced him to some investors there which ended up with him bringing his company Henson robotics to Hong Kong so now after I moved there because of falling in love with the writing then I brought my friend David there then Henson Robotics grew up there and there's actually a good reason for Hanson robotics to be there because I'm in the best place in the world the manufacturer complex electronics is in you know Shenzhen right across the border from Hong Kong so now I've I've been working there with Hanson robotics on the Sophia robots and other robots for for a while and I've accumulated the whole AI team there around Hanson robotics and singularity in that so I mean by but now I'm there because my whole a AI and robotics teams are there right makes sense do you follow the the State Department's recommendations to not use Huawei devices and they believe that their own oh you heard that yeah I mean that the Chinese are spying on us you know I'm sure you know when I lived him I lived in Washington DC for nine years I did a bunch of consulting for various government agencies there and my wife is a communist party member actually well just because she joined in high school when it was sort of suggested for her to join so I'm sure I'm being watched by multiple governments it doesn't I don't have any secrets and it doesn't really matter I'm I'm not in the business of trying to overthrow any government I'm I'm in the business of trying to bypass traditional governments and traditional monetary systems and all the rest by creating new methods of organization of people and and information I understand that with you personally but it is unusual if the government is actually spying on people through these divides now that's unusual I don't it's unusual at all I mean III I mean without going into too much detail like when I was in DC working with various government agencies it became clear there is tremendously more information obtained by government agencies than most people realize well this was this was true way before Snowden and WikiLeaks and all these revelations and what is publicly understood now is probably not the full scope of the information that governments have other so I mean privacy is is pretty much dead and david brin do you know david brin no you should definitely interview david he's an amazing guy but he's a well-known science-fiction writer he's based in in Southern California San Diego but he wrote a book in all years ago called the transparent society where he said there's two possibilities surveillance and sousveillance it's like the power elite watching everyone or everyone watching everyone I think everyone watching yeah well yeah but he so he articulated this as the own essentially the only two viable possibilities and he's like we should be choosing and then creating which of these alternatives we want so now now the world is starting to understand what he was talking about back back when he wrote that book like really write the book oh I can't remember it was well more than the decade it gets weird when some people just nail it on the head decades in advance I mean most of the things that are happening in the world now were foreseen by a Stanislaw LEM the Polish author I mentioned Valentin Turchin a friend of mine who was the founder of Russia and I he wrote a book called the phenomenon of science in the late 60s and you know in 1971 or two when I was a little kid I read a book called the Prometheus project by a Princeton physicist called Gerald Feinberg you read a physicists book when you're 5 years old yeah started reading when I was 2 my grandfather was a physicist so he I was reading a lot of stuff then but he Feinberg in this book he said you know within the next few decades humanity is gonna create none of technology it's going to create machine smarter than people and it's going to create the technology to allow human biological immortality and the question will be do we want to use these technologies you know to promote rampant consumerism do we want to use these technologies to promote you know spiritual growth of our of our consciousness into new dimensions of experience and what fun drug proposed in this book in the late 60s which I read in the early 70s he proposed the UN she'd sent a task force out to go to everyone in the world every little African village and educate the world about nanotech life extension and an AGI and get the whole world to vote on whether we should develop these technologies toward consumerism or toward consciousness expansion so I read this from a little kid it's like this is almost obvious this makes total sense like why why doesn't everyone understand this then I tried to explain this to people and I'm like oh shit I guess it's gonna be a while till the world catches on so so I instead decided I should build a spacecraft go away from the world at rapid speed and come back after like a million years or something when the world was far more advanced so or covered in dust yeah right so now well then you go in another million years to see where they only evolve but so now pretty much - the world agrees that life extension AGI and nanotechnology are plausible things that may come about in the near future the same question is is there that that that Feinberg saw like 50 years ago right the same question is there like do we develop this for rampant consumerism or do we develop this for amazing new dimensions of you know consciousness expansion and mental growth but the UN is not in fact educating the world about this and pulling them to decide democratically what to do on the other hand there's the possibility that by bypassing governments in the UN and doing something decentralized you can create a democratic framework you know within which you know a broad swath of the world can be involved in the participatory way in guiding the direction of these advances do you think that it's possible that in of choosing that we're just gonna have multiple directions that it's growing in that there's going to be consumer baby it will be multiple directions and it's that that's inevitable it's more a matter of whether anything besides the military advertising complex gets a shake right right so I mean if you look in the software development world open source is an amazing thing right Linux is awesome and it's led to so much AI being open open-source now now open source didn't have to actually take over the entire software world like Richard Stallman Moreland in order to have a huge impact right it's enough that it's a major force so I mean it's very hippie concept isn't it open source in a lot of ways in a way but but yet idea iBM has probably thousands of people working on Linux right so like Apple it began as a hippie concept but it became very practical right so I mean something like 75% of all the servers running the Internet are based in Linux you know the vast majority of mobile phone OS is Linux right so this is the vast majority being an Android is Lex yeah yeah so I mean this hippie crazy thing where no one owns the code it didn't have to overtake the whole software economy and become everything to become highly valuable and then inject a different dimension into things and I think this the same is true with decentralized AI which we're looking at with singularity in that like it it doesn't we don't have to actually put Google and the US and Chinese military in Tencent out of business right although if that happens that that's that's fine but but we it's enough that we become an extremely major player in that ecosystem so that this you know participatory and benefit oriented aspect becomes a really significant component of how humanity is developing general intelligence what it's accepted generally accepted that human beings will consistently and constantly innovate right it just seems to be a characteristics that that we have yep why do you think that is and what do you think that especially when it in terms of creating something like artificial intelligence like why build our successors like why do I do that like what is what is it about us that makes us want to constantly make bigger better things well that's an interesting question in the history of biology which I may not be the most qualified person to answer it is an interesting question and I think it has something to do with the weird way in which we embody various contradictions that we're always trying to resolve like we you mentioned ants and the answer social animals right worse like cats are very individual we're like trapped between the two all right like we're we're somewhat individual and and and somewhat social and that and then and then since we created civilization it's it's it's even worse because I mean we have certain aspects which are which are wanting to conform with the group and the tribe and others which are wanting to innovate and break out of that and we're sort of trapped in these biological and cultural contradictions which tend to drive innovation but I think there's a lot there that no one understands and the roots of the human psyche evolutionarily but as an empirical fact what you said is is is is very true right like we're driven to seek novelty we're driven to create new things and this is certainly one of the factors which is driving the creation of AI I don't think that alone would make the creation of AI inevitable but the thing why don't you think it would make it inevitable if we consistently innovate and it's always been a concept I mean you were talking about the concept existing 30-plus years ago well I think a key point is that there's tremendous practical economic advantage and status advantage to be gotten from AI right now and this is driving the advancement of AI right to be incredibly rapid right because there are some things that are interesting and would use a lot of human innovation but they get very few resources so for example my my oldest son Zarathustra he's doing his peach do you know what it's just Zarathustra whoa my kids are Zarathustra Amadeus Zebulon Ulysses Scheherazade and then the new one is quarks eqo rxi Wow which is an acronym for quantum organized rational expanding intelligence I was never happy with Ben it's a very boring day I'm something more interested anyway Zarathustra is doing his PhD on the application of machine learning to automated theorem proving basically make a RS that can do mathematics better and to me that's like the most important thing we could be applying AI to because you know mathematics is the key to all modern science and engineering my PhD was in math originally but the amount of resources going into AI for automating mathematics is not large at this present moment although that's a beautiful and amazing area for invention and innovation and creativity so I think what's driving our rapid push toward building AI I mean it's not just our creative Drive it's it's the fact there's tremendous economic value military value and human value I mean curing diseases teaching kids there's tremendous value in almost everything that's important to human beings in in building AI right so you put that together with our drive to create and innovate and this becomes an almost unstoppable force within within human society and what we've seen in the last you know three to five years is suddenly you know national leaders and titans of industry and even like pop stars right they've woken up to the concept that well smarter and smarter AI is real and this is going to get better and better like within years two decades not centuries to millennia so now the cats out of the bag nobody's gonna put it back and it's about you know how can we direct it in the most beneficial possible way and as you say it doesn't have to be just one possible way right like what right what I look forward to personally is bifurcating myself into an array of possible bends like I'd like to let one copy of me fuse itself with a superhuman AI mind and you know but become become a god or something beyond the God and I wouldn't even be myself god I wouldn't even be myself anymore right I mean you would lose all concepts of human self and identity but would be the point of even holding to any of it yeah whoa that's for the future that's for the Mega Ben to decide Nega BAM yeah yeah on the other hand I'd like to let one of me remain in human form you know get get rid of death and disease and the psychological issues and and just live live happily forever you know in the people Zoo watched over by the machines of love and grace right so I mean you can have it doesn't have to be either/or because once you can scan your brain and body and 3d print new copies of yourself you could have multiple I mean there's a lot of mass energy in the universe in the universe yeah that's assuming that we can escape this planet because of you if you're talking about was that people if you're gonna make a suit themselves well you live in a world with a billion Donald Trump's because like literally that's what we're talking about well the people being able to reproduce themselves and just having this idea that they would like their ego to exist in multiple different forms whether it's some super symbiotic that's connected to artificial intelligence or some biological form that's immortal or some other form that stands just as a normal human being as we know it in 2018 have you have multiple versions of yourself over and over and over again like that that's what your well once again once you get to the point where you have a superhuman general intelligence that can do things like fully scan the human brain and body and 3d print more of them by that point you're at a level where scarcity of material resources is not an issue at the human scale of doing so I've actually of Human Resources in terms of what scarcity of mass energy scarcity of molecules to print more copies of yourself and I think that I think that's not going to be the the issue at that point but people are worried about as environmental concerns of overpopulation yes people are worried about what they see in front of their faces right now but people are not most people are not thinking deeply enough about what potential would be there once you had superhuman a eyes doing the calculation manufacturing and the thinking I mean I mean the the amount of energy in the single grain of sand if you had an AI able to to appropriately leverage that that energy is is tremendously more than most than most people think and the amount of computing power in a grain of sand it's like a quadrillion times all the people on earth put together so I mean what do you mean by that the amount of computing power there's well the amount of computing power that could be attentively fit reorganizing the elementary particles in the ground of CERN yeah there there's there's a number in physics called the beacon stone bound which is the maximum amount of information that can be can be stored in a certain amount of mass energy so that that if the laws of physics as we know them now are correct which they certainly aren't then the then that would be the amount of computing you can do in a certain amount of mass energy we're very very far from that limit right now right so I mean but my point is once you have something a thousand times smarter than people what we imagined to be the limits no doesn't matter too much any issues that we're dealing with in terms of environmental concerns that could all potentially almost certainly going to be irrelevant right there may be others problem issues that we can't even conceive at this moment the first but the intelligence would be so vastly superior to what we have currently yeah they'll be able to find solutions to virtually a single problem that's right Ashima ocean fish depopulation all that stuff so just arrangements of molecules but but don't want to hear that though environmental people don't want to hear that well I mean I I'm also on the everyday life basis like until we have these super a eyes I don't like the garbage washing up on the beach near my house either right so I mean but on the everyday basis of course we want to promote health in our bodies and in our in our environments right now as long as there's you know measurable uncertainty regarding when the benevolent super a eyes will come about so I think the main question isn't whether once you have been officially disposed super AI it could solve all our current petty little problems the question is you know can we wade through you know the muck of modern human society and psychology to create this beneficial super AI in the first place like I I believe I know how to create a beneficial super AI but it's a lot of a lot of work to get there and of course there's many teams around the world working on vaguely similar projects now and it's not obvious what kind of super AI we're actually gonna get once we get there yeah it's all just guesses at this point right it's educated guesses depending on who's doing the guessing would you say that it's almost like we're in a race of the the primitive primate biology versus the potentially beneficial and benevolent artificial intelligence that this the best aspects of this primate can create that it's almost a race to get who's gonna win is it the warmongers and the greedy whores that are smashing the world under its boots or is it the scientists that are gonna figure out some super intelligent way to solve all of our problems I look at it more as I look at it more as as a struggle between different modes of social organization than individual people I mean look what when I worked in DC with intelligence agencies most of the people I met there were really nice human beings who believed they were doing the best for the world even if some of the things that we're doing like I I thought were very much not for the best of the world right so I'm in military mode of organization or large corporations as a mode of organization are in my view not generally going to lead to beneficial outcomes for the overall species and then for the global brain and the scientific community the open source community I think are better modes of organization and you know the the better aspects of the blockchain and crypto community have a better mode of organization so I think if if this sort of open decentralized mode of organization can marshal more resources as opposed to this centralized authoritarian mode of organization then I think things are going to come out for the better and it's it's not so much about bad people versus good people that you can look at like the corporate mode of organization is almost a virus that that's colonized a bunch of humanity and is is sucking people into working according to the to this mode and even if they're really good people and the individual tasks they're working on isn't bad in itself they're working within this new this mode that's leading their work to be used for ultimately a non good end yeah that is a fascinating thing about corporations isn't it that the diffusion of responsibility and being a part of a gigantic group that you as an individual don't feel necessarily connected or responsible to the whole even the CEO isn't fully responsible like if the CEO does something that isn't in accordance with the high higher goals of the organization they're just replaced right something there I mean there's no one person who's in charge it's really like it's it's like a net column that's like it's like its own organism yeah and I mean it's us who have let these organisms become parasites on humanity in this way in some ways the Asian countries are a little more intelligent than Western countries and the Asian governments realize the power of corporations to molds and there's a bit more feedback between the government and and and corporations which can be for better or for worse but then in America there's some ethos of like free markets and free enterprise which is really not taking into account the oligopolistic nature of modern markets but in Asian countries isn't it that the government is actually suppressing information as well they're also suppressing Google in South Korea no I'm in South Korea if you look at what the only ones well Singapore you know really Singapore is ruthless in their drug laws and some of the archaic well so as us they're far worse though Singapore gives you the death penalty for marijuana they do yeah yeah I mean the South Korea is an example which has roughly the same level of personal freedoms as the u.s. more in some ways less than others massive electronica innovation well interesting their thing there politically is I mean they were poorer than two-thirds of sub-saharan African nations in the late 60s and it is through the government intentionally stimulating corporate development toward manufacturing and electronics that they grew up so that that now I mean I'm not holding that up as a great Paragon for the future or anything but it does show that there's there's many modes of organization of people and resources other than the ones that we take for granted in the US I don't think Samsung and LG are the ideal for the future either though I mean I'm much more interested in you know interested in blockchain I'm interested in I'm interested an open source and I'm interested in in blockchain I'm basically I'm interested in anything that's you know open and participatory disruptive right as well yeah because I think that's I think that is the way to be ongoingly dis disruptive an open source is a good example of that like when the open source movement started they weren't thinking about machine learning but you know the the that open-source is out there and is then prevalent in the software world that paved the way for AI to now be centered on open source algorithms so right now even though big companies and governments dominate the scaleable rollout of AI the invention of new AI algorithms is mostly done by people creating new code and putting it putting it on on github or get lab where their open source repository posit or E's open source is self-explanatory in its title pretty much people kind of understand what it is it means that various coders get to share in this this code and the source code and they they get to innovate and they all get to participate and use each other's work right right but blockchain is confusing for a lot of people yeah please explain that sure I mean but block blockchain itself is almost a misnomer so we're confused okay they're confusing it at every level right so we can should start with the idea of a distributed ledger which is basically like a distributed Excel spreadsheet or database it's just a store of information which is not stored just in one place where there's copies of it in a lot of different places every time my copy of it is updated everyone else's copy of it has got to be updated and then then there's various bells and whistles like sharding where you know it can be broken in many pieces and each piece is stored many places or something so that's a distributed ledger and that's just distributed computing now what what makes it more interesting is when you layer it decentralized control onto that so imagine you have this distributed Excel spreadsheet or distributed database there's copies of it stored in a thousand places but to update it you need like five hundred of those thousand people who own the copies to vote yeah let's do that update right so then then you have a distributed store of data and you have like a democratic voting mechanism to determine when all those copies can get can get updated together right so then then what you have is a data storage and update mechanism that's controlled in a democratic way by the group of participants rather than mining one central control and that that can have all sorts of advantages I mean for one thing it means that you know there's no one controller who can go rogue and screw with all the day without telling anyone it also means there's no one who's some lunatic can go hold a gun to their head and shoot them for for what data updates were made cuz they're you know it's controlled democratically by by everybody right it has ramifications in terms of you know legal defensibility and I mean you could have some people and Iran some in China some in the US and and updates to this whole distributed data store are made by democratic decision of all the participants somewhere cryptography comes in is when I vote I don't have to say yeah this is been Gertz all voting for this update to be accepted or not it's just ID number one three five seven two six four and then encryption is used to make sure that you know it's it's the same guy voting every time that it claims to be with it without needing like your passport number or something right what's ironic about is it's probably one of the best ways ever conceived to actually vote in this country yeah sure kind of ironic there's a lot of applications for that yeah that's that's right so that there's so that that I mean that's the core mechanism though where the blockchain comes from is like a data structure where to store the data in this distributed database it's stored in in a chain of blocks or each block contains data the thing is not every so called blockchain system even uses a chain of locks not like some use a a tree or a graph of blocks or something this is that tom was everybody it's it's an alright term is it like AI like just one of those terms were stuck with yeah yeah it's one it's one of those terms were stuck with even though it's not quite technically not quite technically accurate and I mean anymore I mean because what I don't know another buzz word for it right what it is is a it's a distributed ledger with encryption a decentralized control yeah and blockchain is the buzzword that's come about for that know what what got me interested in blockchain really is this decentralized control us so my my wife why been with for 10 years now she dug up recently something I'd forgotten which is a webpage had made in 1995 like a long time ago where I'd said hey I'm gonna run for president on the decentralization platform for her which I'd completely forgotten that crazy idea I was very young then that had no idea what an annoying job being president would be right but that so that the idea of decentralized control seemed very important to me back then which is well before Bitcoin was invented because I could see you know a global brain is evolving on the planet involving humans computers communication devices and we don't want this global brain to be controlled by a small elite we want the global prime to be controlled in the in the decentralized ways so that that's really the the beauty of this blockchain infrastructure and what what got me interested in the practical technologies of blockchain was really one theory inque mout and you add the notion of a smart contract which was a theorem a theory amia so what is that well so the first blockchain technology was Bitcoin right which is a well known cryptocurrency no theory 'm is another cryptocurrency which is the number two cryptocurrency right now that's how out of the loop I am did you know about it you did however aetherium came along with a really nice software framework so it's not just like a digital money like bitcoin is but aetherium has a programming language called solidity that came with it and this programming language lets you write what are called smart contracts and again that's sort of a misnomer because a smart contract doesn't have to be either smart or a contract right but but it was a cool name right what are you in then if it's really a smart contract contract it's like a programmable transaction okay so you you can program a legal contract or you can program of a financial transaction so a smart contract it's a it's a persistent piece of software that embodies like a secure encrypted transaction between between multiple parties so pretty much like anything on the back end of a bank's website or transaction between two companies online a purchasing relationship between you and the website online this could all be scripted in the smart contract in the secure way and then it would be automated in this simple and standard way so the vision that Vitalik butyrin who was the main creator behind aetherium had is to basically make the internet into a giant computing mechanism rather than mostly like an information storage and retrieval mechanism make the internet into a giant computer by making a really simple programming language for scripting transactions among different computers and different parties on the internet where you have encryption and you have democratic decision-making and distributed storage of information like programmed into this this world computer right and then that was a really cool idea and the etherium blockchain and solidity programming language made it really easy to do that so made it really easy to program like distributed secure transaction and computing systems on the internet so I saw this I thought wow like now we finally have the toolset that's needed to implement some of these pillars it's very popular yeah I mean I mean basically almost every ICO that was done the last couple years was done on the ethereum blockchain what's an ICO initial coin offering okay so for bitcoins for I'm sorry cryptocurrency crypto currencies yeah use this technology yeah yes rings right so what happened in the last couple years is a bunch of people realized you could use this aetherium programming framework to create a new cryptocurrency right like a new artificial money and then you could try to get people to use your new artificial money for certain types of how many artificial coral coin thousands maybe more and but I mean how many popular is Bitcoin right the point is Bitcoin is by far the most popular the most aetherium is number two and there's a bunch of others I mean how would comparison like how much bigger is Bitcoin than aetherium I don't know five factor of three to five yeah well maybe just a factor of two no it's actually last year at thorium almost took over Bitcoin when Bitcoin start crashing yeah yeah and now a theorem is back down it might be 1/2 or 1/3 does that worry you the the fluctuating value of these well to my to my mind creating artificial monies is one tiny bit of the potential of what you could do with the whole blotching tool said it it happened to become popular initially right because it's where the money is right it is it is money and that's interesting to people but on the other hand what it's really about is making world computer it's about scripting with a simple programming language all sorts of transactions between people companies whatever all sorts of exchanges of information so I mean it's about decentralized voting mechanisms it's about AI is being able to send data and processing it for each other and pay each other for their transactions so I mean there's it's about automating supply chains and and and shipping and ecommerce so that there's an in in in in essence you know just like computers and the internet started with a certain small set of applications and then pervaded almost everything right yeah it's the same way with blockchain technology like it started with digital money but the core technology is is gonna pervade almost everything because there's almost no domain of human pursuit that couldn't use like security through cryptography some sort of you know participatory decision-making and then distributed storage of information right so and these things are also valuable for AI which is how I got into it in the first place I mean if you're making a very very powerful AI that is going to you know gradually through the practical value delivers he will grow up to be more and more and more intelligent I mean that this AI should be able to engage a large party of people and AIS and participatory decision-making they I should be able to store information you know in a widely distributed way and and they I certainly shouldn't be able to use you know security and encryption to validate who are the parties involved in its operation I mean these are the key things behind behind blockchain technology so I mean the fact the fact that blockchain began with artificial currencies to me is a detail of history just like the fact the fact that the internet began is like a nuclear early warning system right then it did it's good for that but it's as it happens it's also even better for a lot of other things yeah the the solution for the financial situation that we find ourselves in it's one of the more interesting things about cryptocurrencies that someone said okay look obviously we all kind of agree that our financial institutions are very flawed the system that we operate under is it's very fucked up so how do we fix that well sending the super nerds and so they figure out a new and we're going to send into super is super super I mean obviously who's the guy that they think the this fake person this may be not real that came up with Bitcoin oh so Toshi Nakamoto do you have any suspicions as to who this is I can neither confirm nor deny okay yeah you wouldn't be on the inside we'll talk later but that this is it's very it's very interesting but it's also very promising I I've like high optimism for crypto currencies because I think that kids today are looking at it with much more open eyes than you know grandfather's grandfather's are looking at Bitcoin again I'm sure you're exceptional one but there's a lot of people that are older that just they're not open to accepting these ideas but I think kids today in particular the ones that have grown up with the internet as a constant force in their life they're I think they're more likely to embrace something along those lines well yet so that there's no doubt that you know cryptographic formulations of money are going to become the standard the question do you think that's going to be the standard that will happen yeah however it could happen potentially in the very uninteresting way how's that but you could just have the e dollar I mean the I mean that government could just say we will create this cryptographic token which counts as a dollar I mean most dollars are just electronic anyway all right so so what what what habitually happens is technologies that are invented to subvert the establishment are converted to a form where they help bolster the establishment instead I mean and in financial services this happens very rapidly like PayPal Peter Thiel and those guys started PayPal thinking they were gonna obsolete fiat currency and make an alternative to the currencies run by nation-states instead they were driven to make it a credit card processing front end right so so that's one thing that could happen with cryptocurrency is it just becomes a mechanism for you know governments and big companies and banks to do the things more efficiently so what what's interesting isn't so much the digital money aspect although it is in some ways a great way to do digital money but what's interesting is with all the flexibility it gives you to script you know complex computing networks in there is the possibility to script new forms of you know participatory Democratic self-organizing networks so blockchain like the internet or computing is a very flexible medium you could use it to make tools of oppression or or you could use it to make tools of amazing growth growth and and liberation and obviously we know which one I'm more interested in ya know what what is blockchain what is blockchain being currently used for like what what different applications cuz it's not just cryptocurrency they use know a bunch of different things now right they are I would say it's very early stage so probably the how early well the heaviest uses a blockchain now are probably inside large financial services companies actually so if you look at theory him the project dimensions so he theorem is run by an open source and open foundation the etherium foundation then there's a consulting company called consensus which is a totally separate organization that was founded by joe Lubin who was one of the founders of etherium in the early days and consensus as you know it's funded about to the work within the etherium foundation and community but consensus has done a lot of contracts just working with governments and big companies to customize code based on etherium to help with their internal operations so actually a lot of the practical value has been with stuff that isn't in the public odd that much but it's like back-end inside of companies and in terms of practical customer facing uses of of cryptocurrency i mean now the tron blockchain which is different than aetherium that has a bunch of games on it for example and some online gambling for the for that mother so that that's that that's gotten a lot of users but their online games like how do they use that well it's a payment mechanism i say but that there this is one of the things there's a lot of hand-wringing about in the cryptocurrency world now is gambling no just the fact that there aren't that many big consumer facing uses of cryptocurrency I mean I mean everyone would everyone would like there to be that was the idea and this is one of the things we're aiming at with our singularity net project is to you know we by putting a I on the blockchain in a highly effective way and then we're also we have these two tiers so we of the singularity net foundation which is is creating this open-source decentralized platform in which a eyes can talk to other AIS and you know like ants in a colony grouped together from smarter and smarter AI then we're spinning off a company called the singularity studio which will use this decentralized platform to help big companies integrate AI into their operations so with the singularity studio company we want to get all these big companies using the AI tools in the singularity net platform and then we want to drive you know massive usage of blockchain and the singularity in that that that way so that's if we're successful with what we're doing this will be you know within a year from now or something by far the biggest usage of blockchain outside of financial exchange is our use of blockchain within singular unit for AI basically for customers to get the AI services that they need for their businesses and then for a eyes to transact with other AI is paying other AIS for doing services for them because this this this I think is is a path forward it's like a society and economy of minds it's not like one monolithic AI it's a whole bunch of AI is carried by different people all over the world with not only are in the marketplace providing services to customers but each AI is asking questions of each other and then raiding each other of how good they are sending data to each other and paying each other for their services so this this like network of AIS can emerge in intelligence on the whole network level as well as they're being intelligence in each each component and is it also fascinating to you that this is not dependent upon nation so this is a world yeah that ever I think I think that's going to be important once once it starts to get a very high level of intelligence again in the early stages okay what would it hurt like if I had you know my own database the central record of everything like I'm I'm an honest person I'm not gonna rip anyone off but once we start to make a transition toward artificial general intelligence in this global decentralized Network which has component a eyes from every country on the planet like at that point once it's clear you're getting toward AGI a lot of people want to step in and control this thing you know by law by military might by any means necessary by that point the fact that you have this open decentralized network under underpinning everything like this gives an amazing resilience to what you're doing like who can shut down Linux who can shut down Bitcoin nobody can write you you want AI you want AI to be like that you want to be a global you know upsurge of creativity and a mutual benefit from people all over the planet which no powerful party can can shut down even if they're afraid that it threatens their hegemony it's very interesting because in a lot of ways that's a it's a very elegant solution to what's an obvious problem yeah yeah just as the Internet is an elegant solution to what's in hindsight an obvious problem right it's the distribution of it yeah yeah yeah yeah but this is a extra special to me because it if I was a person brought in a country I would be terrified of this shit I'd be like well this is what's gonna that depends which country if you're a person running the u.s. or China you you would have a different relationship than if you're a person like I know the Prime Minister of Ethiopia RB Ahmed who's a has a degree in software engineering and he loves this but of course Ethiopia isn't in any auditioning any other countries right and they're not in any danger of individually like taking global AI hegemony right so for the majority of countries in the world they like this for the same reason they like Linux right I mean I mean this this is something in which they have an equal role to anybody else right the superpowers and you see this among companies also those so a lot of big companies that we're talking to they like the idea of this decentralized AI fabric because I mean if you're not Amazon Google Microsoft $0.10 Facebook so if you're another large corporation you don't necessarily want all your AI and all your data to be going into one of this handful of large AI companies you would rather have it be in the secure dissent decentralized platform and I mean this is the same reason that you know Cisco and IBM they run on Linux they don't run on Microsoft all right so if if you're not one of the handful of large governments or large corporations that happen to be in a leading role in the AI ecosystem then you would rather have this this equalizing and decentralize thing because everyone gets to play yeah what what would be the benefit of running on Linux vs. Microsoft well you're not at the behest of some other big company I mean well I mean imagine if I'm at imagine if if you were Cisco or GM or something and all of your internal machines are all your servers are running in Microsoft what if Microsoft increases their price or remove some feature then right you're totally it that that that their behest right and with AI the same thing is true I mean if if you put all your data in some big company's server farm and you're analyzing all your data on their algorithms and that's critical to your business model what if they change their AI algorithm in some way then I mean then your business is is basically controlled by this other company so huh I mean having a decentralized platform in which you're you know an equal participant along with everybody else is actually a much better position to be in and I think this this I think is why we can succeed with this plan of having this you know decentralized singularity net platform then this singularity studio enterprise software company which mediates between the decentralized platform and big companies I mean it's because most companies and governments in the world you know they don't want hegemony of a few large governments and corporations Egypt either and you can see this in in a lot of voids you can see this in embrace of of Linux and and aetherium by many large corporations you can also see like in a different way you know that in the indian government you know they rejected an offer by facebook to give free internet to all indians because facebook want to give like mobile phones that would give free internet but only the access Facebook right India is like well no thanks right and India is now giving they're now creating laws that any Internet company that collects data about Indian people has to store that data in India hmm which is so the Indian government can subpoena that data when they want to right so so you're already seeing about a bunch of resistance against hegemony by a few large governments or large large corporations by other companies and other governments and I think this this is very positive and is one of the factors that can foster the posture that the growth of a decentralized AI ecosystem is it fair to say that the future of AI is severely dependent upon who launches it first like whoever if whether it's singular so the bottom line is the official general intelligence the bottom line is as a scientist I have to say we don't know right it could be there's an end state that AG I will just self organize into almost independent of the initial condition but we don't know and given that we don't know I'm operating under the you know the heuristic assumption that if the first AI is been officially oriented if it's controlled in a participatory democratic way and if it's oriented at least substantially towards like doing good things for humans I'm operating under the heuristic assumption that this is going to bias things in a positive positive direction right I mean within in the absence of knowledge to the contrary but if the Chinese government launches one they're controlling yeah we don't know hop it off first I mean I like the idea that you're saying though that it might organize itself I mean I understand the Chinese government also they want they want the best for the Chinese people that they don't they don't want to make the Terminator either right so I mean III think even even Donald Trump was not my favorite person doesn't actually want to kill off everyone on the planet right so he might as they talk shit about him yeah yeah yeah you know you know you never know it was just him yeah yeah yeah I told you yeah so I mean I think you know I wouldn't say we're necessarily doomed if big governments and big companies are the ones that develop AI or AGI Flowers's big government big companies essentially developed the internet right and it got away from them that's right that's right so there's a lot of uncertainty all around but I think you know it behooves us to do we can to bias the odds in our favor based on our current understanding and I mean toward that end we're developing you know open-source decentralized AI and then singularity in that process if you would explain some singularity net and what what you guys are actively involved in well sure sure so singularity net in itself is a platform that allows many different a eyes to operate on it and these AIS can offer services to anyone who requests services of the network and they can also request and offer services among each other so it's it's both um just an online marketplace for AI is much like you know the Apple App Store or Google Play Store but for a eyes rather than phone apps but the difference is the different a eyes in here can outsource work to each other and talk to each other and that gives a new dimension to it right where you can have we think of as a society or economy of Minds and it gives the possibility that this whole Society of interacting a eyes which are then they're paying each other for transactions with our our digital money or our cryptographic token which is called the HEI token so these AIS which are paying each other and raiding each other of how good they are sending data and questions and answers to each other can self-organize into some overall AI mind now we're building this platform and then we're plugging into it to seed it a bunch of a AHS of our own creations so I've been working for 10 years on this open source AI project called OpenCog which is oriented toward building general intelligence and we're putting a bunch of AI agents based on the open cog platform into this singularity net network and you know if we're successful in a couple years the AIS that we put on there will be a tiny minority of what's in there just like the apps made by Google or a small minority of the apps and in the in the Google Play Store right but my hope is that these OpenCog AI agents within the larger pool of AI from the singularity net can sort of serve as the the general intelligence core because the OpenCog AI agents are really good at abstraction and generalization and creativity we can put another a bunch of other AIS in there that are good at highly specific forms of learning like predicting financial time series curing diseases answering people's questions organizing your ear in box so you can have the interaction of these specialized ai's and then more general-purpose you know abstraction and creativity they say eyes like open cog agents all interacting together in this decentralized platform and then you know the beauty of it is like some some fifteen-year-old genius and Azerbaijan or the Congo can put some brilliant AI into this network if it's really smart it will get rated highly by the other a eyes for its work helping them do their thing then it can get replicated over and over again across many servers suddenly a this 16 year old kid from Azerbaijan or the Congo could become wealthy from from their copies of their AI providing services to other people's a eyes and be you know the creativity in their mind is out there and is infusing this global a I'd network with some some new intellectual DNA that you know never would have been found by a ten-cent or a Google because they're not gonna hire some Congolese teenager who may have a brilliant AI idea that's amazing that's amazing so this is all ongoing right now and there are some singularity that you guys are using the the way I've understood that term correct me if I'm wrong is that it's going to be the one innovation or one invention that essentially changes everything forever well singularity isn't necessarily one invention the singularity which is coined by Kurt well it's coined by my friend Vernor Vinge's who's another guy you should interview he's in San Diego - brilliant guys down there but Vernor Vinge is a cemetery down there yeah Vernor Vinge he was a math professor at a San Diego University actually but well-known science fiction writer his book fire upon the deep one of the great science fiction books VI ng e Vernor Vinge e yeah brilliant guy fire upon the DVR any further oh yeah the ER door yeah oh yeah he's brilliant he coined the term technological singularity back in the 1980s really but he he opted not to become a pundit about it because he'd rather write more science fiction boats that's interesting that a science fiction author Ray Kurzweil who's also a good friend of mine I mean Ray Ray took that term and fleshed it out and did a bunch of data analytics trying to pinpoint like when it's gonna when it would happen but the basic concept of the technological singularity is a point in time when technological advance occurs so rapidly that to the human mind it appears almost instantaneously like imagine 10 new nobel prize-winning discoveries every second or something right so this is similar to the concept of the intelligence explosion that was posited by the mathematician IJ good in nineteen sixty-five what IJ good said then the year before I was born was the first truly intelligent machine will be the last invention that humanity needs to make right right so this is an intelligence explosion is another term for basically the same thing as a technological singularity but it's not just about ai ai is just probably the most powerful technology driving it I mean there's AI there's nanotechnology there's femto technology which will be building things from elementary particles I mean there's life extension genetic engineering mind uploading which is like reading the mind out of your brain and putting putting it into a machine you know there's advanced energy technologies so that all these different things are expected to advance and around the same time and they have many ways to boost each other right because the you know the better AI you have you're a I can then invent new ways of doing nanotech and biology but if you invent amazing new nanotech and quantum computing that can make your AI smarter on the other hand if you if you could crack how the human brain works and genetic engineering to upgrade human intelligence those smarter humans can then make better AI eyes and nanotechnology right so that there's some of the virtuous cycles among these different technologies the more you advance in any of them the more you're going to advance and in all of them and it's a coming together of all of these that's going to create you know radical abundance and and the technological singularity so that that term which Vernor Vinge II introduced Ray Kurzweil borrowed for his books and for the the singular the university educational program and then we borrowed that for our singularity net-like decentralized blockchain based AI platform and are in our singularity studio enterprise software company now I want to talk to you about two parts of what you just said one being the possibility that one day we can upload our mind and make copies of our mind you up for it my months you and I'm so into here yeah I could use a little joe rogan for my phone you could just call me dude the organic version but the do you think that that's a real possibility inside of our lifetime that we can map out the human mind to the point where we can essentially recreate it but if you do recreate it without all the biological herbs and the human reward systems that are built in what the fuck are we I mean well that's a different question right I mean I think what is your mind well I think that there's two things that are needed for let's say let's say human body uploading okay to simplify the body uploading there are two things that are needed one thing is a better computing infrastructure than we have now okay to host the uploaded body and and the other thing is a better scanning technology because right now we don't have a way to scan the molecular structure of your body without like freezing you slicing you and scanning you which you don't want done at this point in time right yeah so assuming both those are solved I mean you could then recreate in some computer simulation you know an accurate simulation of what you are right but that's where I'm getting this where I'm getting at the inaccurate simulacrum is get that's getting weird because the biological variability of human beings we very day to day we very dependent upon it and your simulation would also very day today so of a deviate program it in to have flaws because what we very dependent upon how much sleep we get whether or not we're feeling sick whether we're lonely so it's all these if your upload we're an accurate copy of games then the simulation hosting your upload would need to have an accurate simulation of the laws of bio physics and chemistry that allow your body to you know evolve from one second to the next my concern would change second-by-second just like just like you do and it would diverge from you right so I mean after an hour it will be a little different after a year it might have gone in in a quite different direction for you it would probably among some super God monk living on the top of a mountain somewhere in a year if it keeps good with the problem but the point whatever depends on what the world it's living in true I mean if it's living in the in a virtual virtual world there'll be a virtual world if you're not talking about the potential of downloading this again in sort of a into a biologic as a lot of possibilities right yeah I mean you you could you could upload into a Joe Rogan living in the virtual world and then just create your own fantasy universe or you or you could 3d print and altering the synthetic body right I mean once you have the ability to manipulate molecules at will this the scope of possibilities becomes much greater than we're used to thinking like my question is do do we replicate flaws do we replicate repression of course but we knew that wouldn't we want to cure depression so if we don't cure depression here's the interesting thing okay once once we have you in a digital form right then it's very programmable so then right then we dash up the dopamine the Saratoga then you can change what you want and then you have a whole different set of issues right yeah because once you've changed I mean suppose you make a fork of yourself and then you manipulate it in a certain way and you're then after a few hours you're like well I don't I don't much like this new Joe here maybe we should roll back that change but the new Joe is like well I like myself very well thank you so then yeah there's a lot of issues that that will come up once we can write modify and then the reprogram or so this is the point that the ramifications of these decisions are almost insurmountable once once the ball gets rolling well the ramifications of the ramifications of these decisions are going to be very interesting to explore yes you're super positive been super positive of your optimism any bad things will happen many good things will happen that's a very that's a very easy prediction to make okay I see what you're saying yeah I've just a one I mean I think think about like world travel right like hundreds of years ago most people didn't travel more than a very short distance from their home and you could say well okay what if what if people could travel all over the right like what horrible things could happen they would lose their culture like they might go marry someone from a random tribe you can get killed in the Arctic region or something a lot of bad things can happen when you travel from home a lot of good things can happen and the ultimately the ramifications were not foreseen by people 500 years ago yeah I mean we're going into a lot of new domains we can't see the details of the plusses and minuses that are gonna unfold it would behoove us to simply become comfortable with radical uncertainty because they otherwise we're gonna confront it anyway and we're just gonna be nervous so it's just inevitable this is this it's almost inevitable I mean of course barring any natural disaster yeah yeah I mean of course Trump could start a nuclear war and well and then we're resetting to Ground Zero this is like we get hit by an asteroid right yeah I mean so barring a catastrophic outcome I believe a technological singularity is essentially inevitable there's a radical uncertainty attached to this on the other hand you know in as much as we humans can know anything it would seem common sensical II there's the ability to bias this in a positive rather than the negative direction yeah we should be spending more of our attention on doing that rather than for instance advertising spying and making chocolate ear chocolates and all the other things many people are doing that I mean it's prevalent it's everywhere but I mean how many people are actually at the helm of that as opposed to how many people are working on various aspects of Technology all across the planet it's a small group in comparison working on explicitly bringing about the singularity is a small group yeah on the other hand supporting technologies is a very large group so think about like GPUs where did they come from accelerating gaming right lo and behold they're amazingly useful for training neural net models which is one among many important types of AI right so a large amount of the planet's resources are now getting spent on tech that are indirectly supporting these singularitarians technologies so as another example like micro Ayres and let you measure the expression level of genes how much each gene is doing in your body at each point in time these were originally developed you know as an outgrowth of printing technology then instead of squirting ink mometrix figured out you could squirt DNA right so i mean the amount of technology specifically oriented toward the singularity doesn't have to be large because the overall you know spectrum of supporting technologies can be subverted in that direction you do you have any concerns at all about a virtual world i mean we may be in one right now is I want to find that programmer and get them to make more attractive people you know that I would say that that's part of the reason why attractive people are so interested yes that they unique and rare yeah all right problems are calling everything beautiful yeah beautiful I was like well you just stuff yeah let's get realistic if I get in the right frame of mind that can find anything beautiful well you can find it unique and interesting no I can find anything view I guess I guess but in terms of like yeah I guess it's subjective right it really is we're talking about beauty right yeah now but for existential angst just on the the when people sit and think about the pointlessness of our own existence like we are these finite beings that are clinging to a balls it spins a thousand miles an hour hurling through infinity and what's the point there's a lot of that that goes around already we if we create an artificial environment that we can literally somehow another download a version of us and it exists and this blockchain created or powered weird fucking simulation world what would be I mean what would be the point of what I really believe which is a bit personal and maybe different than many of my colleagues and what I really believe is that these advancing technologies are going to lead us to unlock many different states of consciousness and experience and then most people are currently aware of our I mean you you say we're we're just insignificant species on the on a you know a speck of rock hurtling in the other so there's people that have existential angst cuz they wonder about what the purpose yes I mean I don't I ended that I tend to feel like we understand almost nothing about who and and what we are and our knowledge about the universe is far smaller extremely miniscule I mean if anything I look at things from more of a Buddhist or a phenomenological way like their sense perceptions and then out of those sense perceptions models arise and accumulate including a model of the self and the model of the body and the model of the physical world out there and by the time you get to planets and stars and blockchains you're building like hypothetical models on top of hypothetical models and then you know we're we're by building intelligent machines and mind uploading machines and virtual realities we're going to radically transform you know our whole state of consciousness our understanding of what mind and matter are our experience of our own selves or even whether a self exists and I think ultimately the state of consciousness of a human being like a hundred years from now after a technological singularity is going to bear very little resemblance to the states of consciousness we have now we're just gonna we're gonna see a much wider universe than any of us now imagine imagine to exist now this is my own personal view of things you don't have to I agree with that ii think the technological singularity will be valuable but that is how i look at no like Ray Kurzweil and I agree there's gonna be a technological singularity within decades at most and Ray and I agree that you know if we bias technology development appropriately we can very lightly you know guide this to be a world of abundance and benefit for humans as well as a eyes but Ray is a bit more of a down-to-earth empiricist than than I am lucky he thinks we understand more about the universe right now then than I do so hmm I mean there's a wide spectrum of views that are rational and sensible to have but my own view is we understand really really little of what we are and what what this world is and this is part of my own personal quest for wanting to upgrade my brain and wanting to create artificial intelligences is like I've always been driven above all else borrowing to understand everything I can about the world someone I've studied every kind of science and engineering and social science and read every kind of literature but in the end the scope of human understanding is clearly very small although at least were smart enough to understand how little we understand which I think my dog doesn't understand how little he understands right yeah so and even like my 10 month old son he understands how little he understands which is interesting right because he's a because he's also a human right so I think I mean everything we think and believe now is gonna seem absolutely absurd to us after there's a singularity we're just gonna look back and laugh in the warm-hearted way and all the incredibly silly things we were thinking and doing back when we were trapped in our in our you know our primitive biological brains and bodies that's stunning that that in your opinion or your assessment is somewhere less than a hundred years away from now yeah that requires exponential thinking right because if you that's harder to wrap your head around right no it's it's immediate for me to wrap my head around but for a lot of people that you explained it to I'm sure that that that's a little bit of a roadblock no it is it is it took me some time to get my parents to wrap their head around because they didn't they're not they're not technologists but alright I mean now I find if you get people to pay attention and sort of lead them through all the supporting evidence most people can comprehend these ideas reasonably well computers from 1970 it's hard to grab people's attention and yeah mobile phones that made a big difference like I spent a lot of time in Africa in other Sababa in Ethiopia where we have a large AI development office and you know the fact that mobile phones and then smart phones have rolled out so quickly even in rural Africa and that if it's such a transformative impact I mean this is a metaphor that lets people understand the speed with what's X p'n engine happen when you talk about yourself and you talk about consciousness and how you interface with the world how do you see this I mean when you say that we might be living in a simulation do you actually entertain that oh yeah you do I mean I think the word simulation is probably wrong but yet the idea of an empirical you know materialist physical world is almost certainly wrong also so I mean that's oh well again if for you go back to a phenomenal view I mean you could look at the mind this primary and you know your mind is building the world as a model as a simple explanation of its perceptions on the other hand then what is the mind the self is also a model that gets built out of its perceptions but then if I accept that your mind has some fundamental existence also based on the sort of I you feeling that you're like a mind there our minds are working together to build each other and then and to build this world and there there's there's a whole different way of thinking about reality in terms of first and second person experience rather than these empiricist views like this is a computer simulation there's something right but you still agree that this is a physical reality that we exist in or do you not what does that word mean that's a weird word right it is women if what is it your interpretation reality if you look in in modern physics even quantum mechanics there's something called the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics which says that there's no sense in thinking about an observed entity you can only think about an observed cama observer pair like there's no sense to think about some thing except from the perspective of some observer so that's that's even true within our best current theory of modern physics as induced from empirical empirical observations but in a pragmatic sense you know if you take a plane and fly to China you actually land in China I guess yeah you'd guess don't you live there I live in Hong Kong yeah well close to char I mean III I have an unusual state of consciousness I mean that's what I'm trying to get at well if you think about it like how do you know that you're not a brain floating in the VAT somewhere which is being fed illusions by a certain evil scientist and two seconds from now it's going to pull this simulated world disappears then you realize you're just a brain of the Vatican you don't know that you run it but and your own personal experiences of falling in love with a woman and moving to another but these may all be put into my brain by the evil scientist how do we know but they're they're very consistent are they not the the possibly illusory and implanted memories are very consistent I guess I guess my own state of mind is I'm always sort of acutely aware that this simulation might I'll disappear at that dunny at any one moment I'm so cutely aware of this consciously on an everyday basis yes pretty much really yeah really why is that that does seemed to make sense I mean it's it's pretty it's pretty rock-solid it's here every day I mean so so you're possibly implanted memories lead you to believe yes possibly implanted memories need to believe that this life is incredibly consistent yeah incredibly consistent this is you Humes problem of induction right from philosophy class and and it's not and then it's not solved I'm with you in a conceptual sense I get I just feel this philosophy but you you embody it right this is something you carry with you all the time yeah on the other hand I mean I'm still carrying out many actions with long term planning in like I've been I've been working on designing AI for 30 years and I be designing it inside a syndrome I might be and I'm working on building the same AI system you know since we started OpenCog in 2008 but that's using code from 2001 that I was building with my colleagues even even earlier so I mean I think long-term planning is very natural to me but but nevertheless I don't I don't want to make any assumptions about about what sort of what sort of simulation or a reality that that that we're living in yeah and I think everyone's going to hit a lot of surprises one wants to simulate singularity K you know we we may find out that this hat is a messenger from after the singularity so it traveled back through time to implant into my brain the idea of how to create AI and thus let's bring it into existence well who it no that was McKenna that had this idea that was something in the yes to this attractor Terence Mckenna yeah yeah he had the same idea like some posts post singularity intelligence we talked she was living outside of time somehow yeah he's reaching back and putting into his brain the idea of how to bring about the singularity not just that but novelty itself was being drawn into this yeah there was a time wave zero that was gonna reach to the apex in 2012 that didn't work no he died before that so he a chance to hear what his what his idea was yeah you know I had some funny interactions with some McKenna fanatic 2012 votes this was about 2007 or so this guy came to Washington where I was living then and he brought my friend Hugo de garis another crazy a Irish researcher with him and he's like the singularity is gonna happen in 2012 concerns McKenna said so and we need to be sure it's it's a good singularity so you can't move to China then it will be a bad singularity so we have so we have to get the US government to give billions of dollars to your research to guarantee that the singularity in 2012 is a good singularity right so he he led us around to meet with these generals and various high who has an in DC to get them to fund Hugo de garis is in my AI research to guarantee I wouldn't move to China and you go wouldn't move to China so the US would create a positive singularity know the effort failed you got you go move to China then I moved there some years after so then this that this 2012 I he went back to his apartment he made a mix of 50% vodka 50% robitussin PM he like drank it down he's like alright I'm gonna have my own personal singularity right here and I haven't talked to that guy since 2012 either to see what he thinks today about the singularity not happening then but I mean Terence Mckenna had a lot of interesting ideas but I felt you know he he mixed up this the symbolic with the empirical more than the now what I would prefer to do I mean right I mean it's it's very interesting to look at these abstract symbols and cosmic insights but then you have to sort of put your scientific mindset on they say well what's a metaphor and what's what's like an actual empirical scientific truth with within the scientific domain that he's a little bit half-baked right I mean the whole idea was based on the II Ching he was a mushroom ayahuasca it was now a skirt what's it I think led him to the the II Ching I don't believe it was maybe I mean it was psilocybin it might have been okay yeah I mean I know you know his brother Dennis yes I know very well yes so they yeah you brother thanks at the time we've zero was a little bit nonsense he read their their book with true hallucinations yeah yeah very very very very interesting stuff and that there's a mixture of deep insight there yeah with a bunch of interesting metaphorical things that's the problem get involved in psychedelic drugs it's hard to differentiate like what makes sense what's what's this unbelievably powerful insight and what is just some crazy idea you can learn the differentiation you think so yes yeah but but yeah I mean granted Terence Mckenna probably took more psychedelic drugs than I would generally recommend was speaking all the time and there's something that I can attest you from podcasting all the time sometimes you're just talking you don't know what the fuck you're saying you know and you become a prisoner to your words and in a lot of ways you you you get locked up in this idea of expressing this thought that may and I may not be viable I'm not sure that he was after empirical truth and in the same sense that say Ray Kurzweil is like when Ray is saying we're gonna get human-level AI in 2029 and then you know massively superhuman AI in a singularity in 2045 I mean Ray Ray is very literal like he's plotting charts right I mean Terrence Terrence was thinking on an impressionistic and and symbolic level does is a it was a bit different so you have to take that in a poetic sense rather than in a literal sense and yeah I think it's very interesting to go back and forth between the you know the symbolic and poetic domain and the either concrete science and engineering domain right but it's also valuable to to be able to draw that draw that distinction right because yeah you can draw a lot of insight from the kind of thinking Terence Mckenna was was doing and certainly if you explore psychedelics you can gain a lot of insights into how the mind and universe work but then when you put on your science and engineering mindset you want to be rigorous about which insights do you take and which ones view do you throw out and ultimately you want that you want to proceed on the basis of what works and what doesn't right I mean that Dennis was pretty strong on that yes Terence was a bit less in that empirical direction well the dennis is actually a career scientist yeah yeah how many people involved in artificial intelligence are it also educated in the ways of psychedelics uh-uh yeah that's all you have to say is that unfortunately did the illegal nature these Young's it's a little hard to pin down I would say before the recent generation of people going into AI because it was a way to make money the AI field was incredibly full of really really interesting people and you know deep thinker is about about the mind and in the last few years of course AI has replaced like business school is what your grandma wants you to do to have a good career so I mean you're getting you're getting a lot of people into AI just because it's financially well yeah it's it's cool it's frankly viable it's popular because I can you know in our generation AI was not a I was not what your grandma wanted you to do so as to be able to buy a nice house and surround a family right so you got into it because you really were curious about how the mind works and of course many people played with psychedelics because it also they were curious about you know what it was teaching him about about how their mind works yeah I had a nice long conversation with Ray Kurzweil and we talked for about an hour and a half and for this sci-fi show that I was doing at the time and some of his ideas he has this is this is number that they had they people throw about it's like 20 42 right isn't that is that still 2045 is it 45 now you know you're being the optimist now you're combining that with Douglas Hofstadter's 42 which is the answer to the universe no the 2032 thing was a New York conference that was my place in 2000 that was 2045 was it I was at that conference okay that was organized by Dmitry Itskov was not oh you're right another friend of mine from Russia so I'm off by three it's 2045 that was no that was raised prognosticators why why that year um he did some calculations yeah I mean he looked at Moore's law he looks in the the advanced and the accuracy of brain scanning look at the advance of computer memory the miniaturization of various devices and like plotting a whole bunch of these curves that was the best guess that he came out with what am I see course there's some confidence interval around that what do you see as potential monkey wrenches that could be thrown until all this innovation like what where that where the pitfalls well I mean the pitfall is always the one that you that you don't see I mean of course it's possible there's some science or engineering obstacle that that we're not foreseeing right now I mean it's also possible that all major nations are overtaken by like religious fanatics or something which which slows down development some will have a few thousand years I think it would just be by a few decades yeah I mean in terms of scientific pitfalls I mean one possibility which I don't think is luckily one pus but it's possible one possibility is human-like intelligence requires advanced quantum computers hmm like it can't be done on the standard classical digital computer right do you think that's the game no but on the other hand because there's no evidence that human cognition relies on quantum effects in the human brain like based on everything about neuroscience now it seems not to be the case like there's no evidence it's the case but it's possible it's the case because we don't understand everything about how the brain works the thing is even if that's true like there's loads of amazing research going on in quantum computing right and so we're gonna have you know you'll probably have a qpu quantum processing unit in your phone and like 10 to 20 years or something right so I mean so that would that might throw off the 2045 date but in a historical sense it doesn't change the picture like I've got a bunch of research sitting on my harddrive on how we improve open Coggs AI using quantum computers once we have better quantum computers right so there's there could be other things like that which are technical roadblocks that we're not seeing now but I really doubt those are gonna delay things by more than like a decade or two or something on the other hand things could also go faster than then then Ray's prediction which is which is what I'm pushing towards so what are you pushing towards what do you think I would like to get a human level general intelligence in five to seven years from now Wow I don't think that's but by any means impossible because I think our OpenCog design is adequate to do it but I mean it takes a lot of people working coherently for a while to build something something big well this being cased in the physical form of a robot it'll be in the compute cloud I mean it can use many robots as user interfaces but the same way I could control many different robots actually and many other sensors and systems besides robots I mean I think the human-like form factor like we have with Sophia and our other Hansen robots the human-like form factor is really valuable as a tool for allowing the cloud-based AI mind to you know engage with humans and to learn human cultures and values because get I mean getting back to what we were discussing at the beginning of this chat you know the best way to get human values and culture into the AI is for humans and eyes to enter into many shared like social-emotional embodied situations together so having a human-like embodiment for the is important for that like I could look you in the eye I can share your facial expressions it can bond with you it can see the way you react when you see like a sick person by the side of the road there's something right and and you know can see you ask the AI to get give the homeless person the twenty dollars or something I mean the AI understands what money is and understands what that action means something interacting with an AI in human-like form is gonna be valuable as a learning mechanism for the AI and there's a learning mechanism for people to get more comfortable with a eyes but I mean ultimately one advantage of being you know a digital mind is you don't have to be weathered any particular embodiment I can go between many different bodies and they can transfer knowledge between the many different bodies that it's occupied well that's the real concern that the the people that are that have this dystopian view of artificial intelligence have is that AI may already exist it's just sitting there waiting til Americans are too many bad movies in in Asia in Asia everyone thinks AI will be our friend and will love us and tell us yeah you're very very very much that's what you're pumping out there no that's business their philosophies there I guess I mean you look in Japanese anime I mean there's been a eyes and robots for a long time there they're usually people's friends dystopian aesthetic and it's the same in China in Korea the general guests there is it a eyes and robots will be people's friends and will will help people and somehow the general guests in America is it's going to be some big nasty Robo soldier marching down the street well we have guys like yeon musk who we rely upon smarter than us and he's fucking terrified of it sam harris terrified of it you're very smart people that just think it could really be a huge disaster for the human race is not just bad because no it's it's a cultural thing because the oriental culture is sort of social good oriented most Orientals think a lot in terms of what's good for the earlier the society as opposed to themselves personally and so they just make the default assumption that guys are gonna be the same way worse Americans are more like mimimi oriented and I say that as an American as well and that's when they sort of assumed that a eyes are gonna be that that's possible it's like a bra it's like a Rorschach blot right well whatever is in your mind you impose on this AI when we don't actually know what it's gonna become right but there it is there are potential negative aspects of course artificial intelligence deciding that we're illogical and unnecessary well we aren't allowed to go and unnecessary yes but that doesn't mean that I should be badly disposed toward us I mean yeah did you see ex machina I did it like it sure it was a copy of our robot so it was I mean our robot Sophia looks exactly like the robot in the next American uh so is a good video that online yeah yeah yeah it would tell Jamie how to get the good video oh just search for Sophia Hansen robot on Google you how advanced is Sophia right now only how many different iterations have there been there's been something like 16 Sophia robots made so far we're moving towards scalable manufacturer over the next couple years so right right now she's going around sort of as an ambassador for humanoid robot kind giving giving speeches and talks in various places so she Sophia used to be called Eva or we had a robot like the current Sophia that was called Eva and then exhibition that came out with a robot called Ava that exactly like the robot that that my colleague David Hanson and I made I think it's coincidence of course not they just copied it and I mean of course the body they have is better and the AI is better in the movie and our robot AI currently is so we change the name to Sophia which means wisdom and instead but I mean was it freaky watching that though with the name Ava the thing is the more of that movie is just if you know if a sociopath raises a robot with an abusive interaction it may come out to be a sociopath or a psychopath so let's let's let's not do that right let's raise our robots with lovin that's an offering compassion yeah you see the thing is that if we the familiar this I haven't seen this particular how much is it actually interacting with them it really has a nice ring so yes so fear we can run using many different AI systems so that there's a chatbot which is sort of like you know Alexa or Google now or something yeah but with a bit a bit better AI and interaction with with you know emotion and face recognition and so forth so it's not human level AI but it's responding to it yeah yeah yeah it's it's f know it understands we say and it comes up with an answer and it can look you in the eye and that may take more than one language well right now we can load it in English mode Chinese motor Russian mode and there's sort of different different software packages and we also use her sometimes to experiment with their OpenCog system and singularity in that so we can we can use the robot as a research platform if you're exploring some of our more advanced AI tools and then there is a simpler chatbot software which is used for appearances like like like that one then in the next year we want to roll out more of our advanced research software from OpenCog and singular you know roll out more that inside these robots which is one among many applications we're looking at with our singularity in that platform I want to get you back in here in like a year and find out where everything is because I feel like we need someone like you sort of let us know where where it's at when it's written that when the switch is about to flip it seems to me that it might happen so quickly and the change might take place so rapidly that we would really will have no idea what's happening before it happens I mean we think about the singularity like it's going to be some huge like physical event and suddenly everything turns purple and this cover with diamonds or something right but I mean there's a lot of voice something like this could unfold so I can imagine that with our singularity net decentralized AI network you know we get an AI that's smarter than humans and can create you know a new scientific discovery the Nobel Prize level every minute there's something that that doesn't mean this AI is going to immediately like refactor all matter into into images of Buckethead or do something rather I mean I mean if the AI has some carrying and wisdom and compassion then whatever changes happen but it's not art those human characteristics not necessarily in fact human passion just as humans are neither the most intelligent nor the most compassionate possible creatures that that's possibly clear if you look at the world around you and one of our projects that we're doing with the Sophia robot is aimed exactly at AI compassion this is called the loving AI project and we're using the Sofia robot as a meditation assistant so so we're using Sophia to help people get into deep like meditative trance States and help them you know breathe deeply and achieve more more positive state of being and part of the goal there is to help people part of the goal as as the AI gets more and more intelligent you sort of getting the AI locked in to a very positive reflective and compassion state and I think I think there's a lot of things in the human psyche and evolutionary history that hold us back from being optimally compassionate and that if we create the a in the right way it will be not only much more intelligent but much more compassionate than then human beings are and I'm in this we'd better do that like otherwise the human race is it's probably screwed to be blunt I mean if I think human beings are creating a lot of other technologies not with a lot of power we're creating synthetic biology we're creating nanotechnology you know we're creating smaller and smaller nuclear weapons and we can't control their proliferation we're poisoning our our environment I think if we can't create something that's not only more intelligent but more why isn't compassionate than we are we're probably going to destroy ourselves by some method or another I mean with something like Donald Trump becoming president you see what happens when this you know primitive you know hindbrain and when our are unchecked you know mammalian emotions of anger and and you know state is seeking an ego and rage and lust when these things are controlling these highly advanced technologies this this is not gonna come to a good end so we want compassionate general intelligences and this is what we should be orienting ourselves toward and so we need to shift the focus of the AI and technology development on the planet toward you know benevolent compassionate general intelligence and this is subtle right because you need to work with the establishment rather than overthrowing it which isn't going to be viable so this is while we're creating this decentralized self-organizing AI network the singularity net then we're creating it for profit companies singularity studio which will get large enterprises to use this decentralized network then we're creating these robots like Sofia which will be mass manufactured in the next couple years roll these out of the service robots everywhere around the world to interact with people in the you know providing valuable services in homes and offices but also interacting with people you know in a loving and compassionate ways so we we need to start now because we don't actually know if it's going to be years or decades before we get to this singularity and we want to be as sure as we can that when we get there it happens in the in the beneficial way for everyone right and things like robots blockchain and AI learning algorithms are our tools toward that end well Ben I appreciate your optimism I appreciate coming in here explaining all this stuff for us and I appreciate all your work man it's really amazing fascinating stuff yeah yeah well thanks for having me it's really fun there what wide-ranging conversation so yeah would it would be great to come back next year and do it updating you on the state of the singular schedule it once a year and just by the time you come maybe who knows a year from now the world might be a different totally different place I may be a robot but I might be a rope like a robot now yeah all right thank you [Music]
