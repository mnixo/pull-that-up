trait my name Joe rocky podcast by night okay that's what y'all know them I know them then you can't lie to me yeah there's nothing you're gonna lie to me about because you lie to me I'm gonna see you on Monday idiot and we're going to see what you're made of oh you'll know anyway I mean without even knowing what they're made of you'll know they're mine but it's different when you fight somebody you literally know what they're made of when you see the look in their eye and they say what they say and they do what they do and then they go and they fight and they don't say what they say and they don't do it they do yeah and that's just fighting and that's what's so refreshing about it to me yeah well the psychological aspect of it I mean you know who has it that said this is fighting is 90% mental and the other 10% in your head I forget who said that I remember either but that's a great quote out here I remember who said what I mean I believe it with all my heart there's so many people out there they're so incredibly physically talented and how many gym assassins do you know that for whatever reason oh they just can't put it together you can't when the referee says a fighter are you ready fighter are you ready go they just aren't a fraction of who they really are well just really break down and think about what happens to the ones that do make it and then have to deal with the media and the opinions and I really feel like athletes the the biggest hurdle is the fact that we're willing to actually just get up there and say we might win we might lose right and just put that out there and say are you willing to put yourself out there like that are you willing to embarrass yourself if you do lose are you willing to deal with the media if you win for ten years straight and then lose and then now you're the worst guy that's ever been seen in the sport or the worst female that's ever been seen in the sport you didn't even belong there are you able to deal with that that's the question that's what being an athlete is not does being a fighter yeah they have ever trained little basketball game what's true you lose a basketball game and people might think you're a fuckin loser or scrub but it's nothing like the shit that I see fighters face online no I mean just look at I got to bring Ronda Rousey up because guitar breaking for me as an athlete I know what she's feeling I know what she's going through and as a female it's even on another level I can't really imagine that just it's a different level scrutiny I would imagine but um it's just it shows how hard it is to deal with this man I know the ups and downs because the Downs hit hard just as hard as about fit you know you got to be ready and there can't be any separation in who you are with the win and a loss because if there is it's going to show yeah and you got to be who you are and not be solely connected to fighting as your whole being otherwise you're over when you win it when it ends right that was something about the Ronda Rousey promos that I always felt like I just I didn't like hearing it like she's like I got to get back to fighting because it's the most important thing and it's the thing that I can be best in the world on I was like oh I actually like here in that studio I do and the reason is it's such a lesson if you're really listening in between the lines to the issue of the world and that's just my opinion we're all putting so much into this one thing we think that that is our everything when really if she sounds cheesy but if you put all that energy towards loving yourself and not the fight career the fight career will still be there just as heavy as it is right you know so what I mean is she's using the fighting as her identity with that championship belt she is Ronda Rousey V Ronda Rousey without the championship belt we don't know who she is she won't come out so who are you unless you're winning we don't know do you know you're counting on that belt to know who you are now and that's that was my biggest point that was a hurdle I ran into when I lost my belt I didn't know who I was anymore and that's how I knew this that's how I figured out what my issues were you [Music]
