the girag and experience yeah I took fourth grade and I know those kids are grownups Wow and that's really cool good somethin some of them told me it was the best year of their lives they come to see me do stand-up oh that's amazing who you teach him what worth great you know everything but how fourth graders like different at science everything I mean yeah it's different than what you did because you went to some people who had like an interest and a love for something and wanted to explore it he what you were doing but mine is different they had to be there so I my thing was self-doubt self-esteem I figure I can't teach them these subjects are going to come and go in their lives but teach him self esteem and some of the most rewarding things were like I just want kitty was real shy he was so shy he's real tall my name it was embarrassed by it and he would stay in the clinic cloten cloakroom they'd call it you know where all the coats he just stay in there won't come out I go this guy who's come Sky King because he was a space cadet go sky you gotta come out he can't stay I can't let a kid just sit and you know and by the end of me just like working his self-esteem and all he was in the middle of the class just what everybody else waving his hand and his mother came up to me and she was like really touched by it and told me that I changed his life Wow and you know that's kind of shit school and now I got like a couple of the girls come to see me as she goes one of the girls goes mr. why did you let us do so much stuff you know like good I said because you were smarter than me I said she go to me I said look you know I was I had more knowledge because an adult but you know you kids Lonnie you have more brain power to me I I know I wasn't dumb I was smart enough to know that I was in that's why you ran the class you know what I mean so you were an easy teacher that's what really easy I told them at the beginning of the year I said look I want this to be the most fun year of your life only you can mess it up I said a fucking awesome opportunity that must bend i said i want to go to the gym this one i was playing basketball i said i want to go to the gym more than you do so the read you know we're going to have a party every friday afternoon I would have we would have liked kids that would do break dancing and stuff and really yeah it was hard that's all so that was great did you ever try to pitch that as a sitcom no but somebody else had an idea for a couple times with would be hilarious sitcom that seems like a natural yeah you as a funny teacher because you really did it it's legit and if you really stop and think about it that would be like for a kid that's like one of the greatest rolls of the dice that kid can get for the fourth grade teacher yeah I degrade our era for your fourth-grade teacher you're still cool to mr. Herrera she's 26 years old right when she said whatever and then she calls me mr. I rarer all right and I go Theresa first of all you're taller than me she's hot blonde I go you stop with the mister are you gonna call me dumb because I just can't call you Dom that's funny like she's got you got me down as mr. I rare that's good gotta keep you from being a dirty birds whoa stay away down you noticing she's a little girl let it talk call you missed our ears trying to establish boundaries somebody said what he grows so young I go cuz i can come on I'm pumped do you think that becoming more aware or reaching a higher state of consciousness because of your experiences will actually help you because it will abandon a lot of the distractions that you present yourself was almost unknowingly yeah well it helps me it helps me in training and particularly when I'm running now because I used to listen to like Pantera and and yeah like vision of disorder when I was running I'd worked myself into like a rage so I would run to exhaustion that was kind of how I trained and I trained all the way through my career like that the last couple of fights have switched it up a list into a lot more like more like buoyant binaural beat type of stuff when I'm running so I can get into more like a meditative stage you know we're doing a lot of yoga as well and trying to find the same thing where you just you you you within yourself and you're not focusing on anything else so your body's almost like on autopilot yeah that you the music that you listen to when you train can have a profound effect on approach your training yeah it really can it's so important and that's why I've always been so vocal about all the stuff I listen to like a dad like training camp playlist so I've tweet every day trunk songs i was listening to and that kind of thing it is important and the other thing is well like earlier on in my career I would use music to anchor feelings so like like when I fought ludwig i use the song called iron by Woodkid which was the first time I'd switched up from England longs to me for like you know a bunch of files so like for the 12 weeks of that fight I was training with Frank Mir we were going up to read about Charleston and now into Red Rock and like doing hill running and stuff and we had some real tough sessions I mean you know we really put ourselves through it for that training camp and as soon as I got back in my truck after the session after the session if I felt like it was a good session it was productive and I felt positive i would put that song on and i would constantly connect those feelings to that that song so then when when I'm walking out and that song comes on immediately I get that feeling again huh you know and it's just like you know just like when you listen to a song when you think of a person like oh I heard that sometimes will you meet you made that connection immediately but you can also train yourself to do it yes that's why you like I listened to cypress hill now and it will take me back to fighting cage warriors like you know back in two thousand six Wow and I have songs all the way through like that and now I don't listen to because it'll like my first two fights I came out to pantera drag the waters by the time I got to the cage I was so wound up and so angry that I was just ads run out gas immediately and now whenever I listen to those songs I get that feeling of like exhaustion like oh and I look at what's out there some answers make no sense to me and they seem to lead down really unhealthy path so thank you but no thanks other answers make more sense or maybe they don't and I come up with my own but it's bad it really is boil down to the Bruce Lee you know researcher on experience reject what is useless absorb what is useful and add what specifically you're on you know his basic methodology for how to approach knowledge I mean he applied it martial arts but it is a brilliant way of approach just any kind of knowledge whether is ready it's about life yeah yeah it's hard for people accept that right so it's much easier to follow the pattern that your family's fault I'm a Lutheran because of grandmas Lutheran right grandpa always said no matter what will be Lutheran's yeah I remember talking to this girl and she said that she was gonna get a tattoo of a cross and I said I said oh I go you really religious she was not really but you know what i was born catholic and i figure uh no matter what that's the one thing that'll be for the rest of my life I me and I remember saying I'm like you know I didn't know every well so I was like okay um how do you know like how do you know you won't change my mind about that she's like oh my God my family would kill me hahaha and I was like oh okay well good luck with that good luck with that Wow the surname is is that yet Edward to Gandhi for there would be people today's like not a really Nancy but you know if I don't put the swastika on my gran out her feelings will get really hurt and so it's I don't hate the Jews but grandma fucking hates jesus i love grandma yeah exactly so it's like I don't want to make them sad you know what's hilarious is that she was gonna get a Catholic tattoo in the first place because like in the Bible it very specifically says you know I was a so like getting a religious tattoos like were you not listening to me ya know I listen when it's convenient but a cross tattoo is so sexy it makes Milk spiritual and it thins out my back and that's the other point of like the people get pissed when you already create your own is like what you can create your own it well there are some absolute truths that fall from heaven say stop all the people are making up their own shit anyway I mean when people say they fool or something is bullshit really they are making up their own thing because they will edit some parts that they don't like they will focus on the parts they like and pretend that it's the one and all the interpretation and say if you're gonna do that might as well be honest and just pick from any source if you're gonna pick and choose you
