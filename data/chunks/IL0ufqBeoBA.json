go on yeah yeah boom and we're live what are you doing Greg I'm looking up the title of a book I want to talk about which book it's an audio book and it was about reconstruction oh we were just talking about with slaves yeah and it was about how you know once the once the slaves were freed they still perpetuated slavery by it was it's called and I gotta find it by slavery by another name by Douglas Douglas Blackmon and it's about how they would they had they put loitering laws in all around the country and they would find black people and if they were standing around they would arrest them or if there was like a petty larceny or a domestic violence thing they'd arrest them for fucking two years with the trial with one judge and no jury and the judge was very often a magistrate of the coal mining company they'd send that the the prisoner to a coal mine for two years where he'd work seven days a week with shackles on and they would fucking whip them and if they tried to escape they tracked him down with dogs and they beat them sometimes to death and this went on for fucking decades yeah so people talk about well slavery ended back you know forms of slavery went on for a long time not only that slavery ended and what effort was done to sort of rectify the situation what effort was done to like try to give even opportunities for people who grew up in African American cities that were predominantly slaves mm-hmm before 1865 yeah like what's ever been done forty acres in a mule do they ever get that is that real I don't know I guess it was a but even even if you're dealing with that even if some people got 40 acres in a mule like what is that enough now like the whole thing is crazy like if you have an entire country that the ancestors that did most of the work did it against their will and then you just like yeah yeah yeah well you don't have to do that anymore and then people are like we want reparations and white people are like that was a hundred years ago you know in Georgetown do you read about this Georgetown University is giving reparations to the slaves that built the university so the families of the slaves they with like 23andme or one of those up and Asians and they they're fucking knocking on doors and they're like hey are you blah blah blah well your great-great-grandfather built Georgetown University and they're assessing the students I don't think it's official yet but it looks like it's happening my concern they're sensing the students like fifty bucks each or something my big concern is that it's gonna go the other way mm-hmm they're gonna track down people's DNA and gonna go we found out that your family profited from slavery like yeah I'm 22 Yeah right what the fuck did I do yeah give me all your money all of your money all your ill-gotten gains yeah and you like but no no no no my dad had a legitimate job he worked for H&R Block and this enough yeah yeah yeah but his grandfather got his money to raise his dad because he had slaves yeah well wasn't Schwarzenegger grandfather an SS yeah we don't talk about that he was easy his grandfather was I think he was a green shirt whoa wait you know I there's a kid named John Gotti the third who's John Gotti the gangsters grandson yeah he's an MMA fighter oh no shit it's good no shit good yeah Wow so far he's fighting on these small promotions but he's fucking people up Wow jacked Wow yeah yeah I remember John cuz I lived on Mulberry Street in remember little lace and it was a fucking tenement apartment and downstairs literally downstairs and one door over was the ravenite social club which was where Gaudi met on Wednesday nights yeah all the bosses would pull up and the the capo I don't know the terms but they lined up fucking limos usual Barry Street oh yeah they walk up and down the street smoking cigars and John Gotti junior was kind of in charge at that time which I guess would be this guy's father yes and he parent wasn't known as being that sharp well the family's thing kind of fell apart since then I don't think there's I think the FBI just had unlimited resources government backing and they slowly picked the fucking organization apart and then it's got people to rat on each other they bugged the ravenite social club they got inside and they bugged it and then when they found out it was bugged the the wiseguys would walk up and down Mulberry Street and talk about their business so they smoked the cars on the route they bugged the hubcaps of the cars on the route you heard about that yeah well that was always the thing about that guy the chin what's his name the chin Gigi auntie how the fuck they say his name Vincent the chin and he was crazy but he wasn't crazy but he would act crazy so he'd walk around the bathroom right yes he was up on trial he was out on bail Yeah right wander to streets with a bathrobe on playing crazy that's him just walking around I'm crazy bug Tim - that'd be fun to pretend you're crazy I think he was actually the guy that they got with the hubcaps oh yeah maybe what maybe they used that tactic more than once yes guys you know they they had a fucking neighborhood where they would go to and when they were in that neighborhood that was their their territory right like when you were living there was that going on like God he was out of jail yeah but they still mostly guys I think I think they're really headquarters is more in Brooklyn but they still came back to Mulberry Street and it is literally across the street was st. Patrick's school which is where Robert De Niro and Scorsese went to school as kids and where you remember the film Mean Streets yeah that was shot remember they jump over the wall into the cemetery that's that's st. Patrick's School it's across from the ravenite social club fuck I don't remember anything about that movie I remember the movie but I don't remember anything about what happened I need to see that one again yeah I need to see that one again you what I saw again recently bullet train I think I did see they show it on a plane now yeah and United or something what that fucking that's my car I saw that movie when I was young and I said I want that fucking 69 fastback Mustang oh that's a badass car beautiful car yeah 68 is it 68 67 or 68 yeah 68 this is very specific shape that the 68 had they had like the best rear end yeah it's a beautiful though they had really cool setup with the rear terrible taillights at 68 here's a little broader it's just it was weird looking yeah just real unusual and compared to some of the other Mustangs but I loved it yeah and it's my favorite I think and you watch those movies like that and you realize you think it's gonna be there's one big car chase that's it yeah it's long slow yeah but you know different they were different they weren't afraid to do a tracking shot for two minutes with no dialogue yes just fucking follow a guy walking walking down the street yeah we just assume people are stupid as fuck and because of comments and because stupid people want to comment so often the signals all skewed towards stupid you know like a movie like jersey LeMans with Steve McQueen and then a great Steve McQueen movie there's no talking at all for first X amount of minutes of the movie he's no talking it's just cars racing all right him driving around and shit yeah there's no talking yeah and if you were a movie theater today there was no talking people look is this broken the original 68 Mustang and that's also a 68 Charger though he's in a race with original 68 Mustang I think just went for sale think somebody just bought it look at that you mean the one from this movie yeah yeah that hero cars wrecked a few of these fuckers yeah if they're doing like how many cars did they record on with God in 60 seconds that Nicolas Cage movie we drove that Eleanor Mustang yeah well do a bunch of those how many fucking orange challenges do you think they needed to get for oh my god so we never wrecked one in every episode that to me is one of the more interesting episodes in our culture that that show which was a beloved part of our past is now taboo you will never find it anywhere because the Confederate flag on the roof and when we were kids oh yeah that came over it's fuckin KKK it's racism it's white sheets it's when we're kids it meant the south yeah it didn't mean the same thing there's a fucking poster that I have over the pisser from Leonard Skynyrd concert from like said that sometime during the 70s they have a giant Confederate flag behind them stage yeah but it didn't mean they were racist it meant they were from the south but somewhere along the line it shifted this is where the argument gets weird right because people say hey it's not about that it's about southern pride I understand it used to be about southern pride but now unfortunately that flag is now connected to racism so you're sending out a bad signal yeah so what you want that flag to mean for you that's great but what that flag means for other people has now changed yeah and you either accept that or you know you're fighting against it oh you can't get me the fucking shit this means this today but people don't they just they're not thinking people don't have time to rationally consider whether or not you're racist or whether or not you're from the south what are you why do you have that flag they don't have time to consider that they just go oh you must be in the KKK oh you must hate black people Oh bang there it is racist you got that flag so some something shifted like really radically and deduce a hazard is like a great metric of it so one of the great things in our culture we could use to measure you know look what happened you had a hit show then literally sparked a type of clothing the daisy dukes for gay men yeah and for girls that are really sad like we see a girl with davis daisy dukes like sweetie you don't need that you're hot without it oh you so hard those daisy dukes I just went to a food truck before I got here and it was an Asian girl and like my favorite kind of asian girl she was a bleep Filipino big lips tan dark tan with daisy dukes oh my open-toed sandals beautiful feet nice pedicure we freaking out it was it was just me and her so I couldn't there and it was so painful you were like you're fighting your neck like don't fuckin turn keep your head straight here's what's interesting and this is the dynamic there's a difference between men and women if we were just describing this exact same thing but you were a girl and you were describing a guy it would be innocent yeah it would be nothing it wouldn't be creepy it'd be like that girl's so horny oh my god like if she was like I was in line and behind me was Jason Momoa you know Aquaman oh my god if you think he looks good in movies he looks so good in real life sweetie I couldn't stop I was looking right at his dick I looked at his dick and I looked his face I look as dickless and he starts smiling then I'd start nodding and no one would care no and you'd say that girl's liberated she's free she's crazy there goes wild if she could maybe grab it on the way out tell ya let me give a little tap tap tap no one's gonna call the cops right but if that's the difference and that's I think this is something that as men this is a shaky one because there are definitely some fake male feminists out there that are just doing it because they want women to love them mm-hmm and they say a bunch of shit that really screws the curve up but if you're being honest and you're being rational you have to realize that the way a woman perceives being hit on is gonna be way different than the way a guy does cuz the girls in danger she's in potential danger like legitimately yeah like if you or some fucking serial killer psychopath and you decided to follow her back to her house that's on the menu that's on the menu how rare is it that you meet a girl somewhere and she wants to come back to your house and kill you yeah pretty fuckin well yeah Aileen Wuornos that monster for the Charlie's the wrong movie oh yeah that girl's a prostitute yeah she would she'd pick guys up and they would think they're gonna go get laid and she'd kill him right and they were all so it wasn't you know people can demonize the DeJohn because he's picking up a right hard worker because he's no sex they see it's not victimless yeah but you know he just wants sex he doesn't want you murdered you know but she was tortured and you know abused so horribly in her life that men became the enemy yeah there's a big lesson in that man I've known guys and watched them as they got older and like failed relationship after failed relationship where they started developing this like resentment towards women you know this is like a deep-seated like fuck them all they want is this and all they wanna because what they're getting from the women all the time it's negative they're getting rejection because they're trying to get laid they want the women that touch them and the women are like I'm not really into touching you like fuck these wars and they eventually develop this thing where they just hate isn't there a name for those guys misogynists no there's like an online so insults or guys who the I think mostly they're talking about like like a lot of those guys are genetically unfortunate yeah fucked up bones drop and butt and that's why there's an argument for legalized prostitution because there are men that just because of deformities or whatever reason or maybe they're maybe they're even neurotic dude where they can't hit on a woman and so there should be a place where a woman can knowingly and confidently and safely be a prostitute yes yes it should be your option the problem is we equate prostitution with two things that are horrible sexual abuse and sex slavery sex trafficking we we we equate prostitution with those things that's why like when Robert Kraft got busted one of the first things they said is this guy's a billionaire and he was participating in sex trafficking that's they accused him of but then they had to drop that I don't know if you know that now so there was no sex trafficking there there was prostitutes there was women who wanted to have sex for money and they weren't they didn't come over in a seal tanker and slept in though no they were prostitutes yeah you know and it's their their choice and they you don't hear much about that this the sex trafficking was like a big thing I think to get him to plead guilty and they put it out there and they they said you know they were shaming you and making it this big deal this guy I paid to get his dick touched you know and here he is what is he like 78 years old 80 years old or something like that this old guy just want to get his dick touched he paid he was a deal's a deal she probably did it 13 times that day before him you know that's what they were doing that place there were jerking guys off but people kept coming back why they keep coming back because they hated it why they keep coming back because it was a ripoff why they keep coming back no because as adults they wanted to get their dick touched and this woman was willing to do that and she yeah is that a bad job it's a fucking terrible job so is Wendy's so is being a dishwasher those are terrible jobs too do you want to do you want to be the guy who puts the coal the the fucking tar on the streets in the hot day do you want to be that guy yeah the fuck out of here that job sucks do you want to be a guy who works in a gas station we've constantly sniffing fumes fuck that that job sucks LA job suck that's your choice it's your choice as a human being to take that job or not take that job I feel the same way about prostitution let's feel about massage it's like if you can pay someone to touch your feet and rub your feet you can pay a dude to just be rubbing your feet why can't you pay someone to touch you why can't touch your genitals and like you said ulis get rid of the stigma by legalizing it and making sure those girls right I've been to the bunny ranch I got a tour I went you know my wife gave me a fuckin Hawaiian shirt on no I had the t-shirt with the tornado he died recently Dennis HOF Dennis HOF dive yes so he invited me he came to a show I was doing in Lake Tahoe I know Reno and he goes hey do you want to come take a tour and like because of the stern connection I kind of knew him so if you want to come take a tour of the ranch and I go let me call my wife and then I called her and I go can I just I go I just want to see it just gonna smell it and she goes well if you bring Kathleen roll who was the feature act with you then you can go so they send a limousine and we go off and we walk in and there was like one room had like a fucking trap he's in it and the other one had a hot tub they all had different like themes to them and it was like it wasn't a skanky as I thought but it was pretty down and dirty was like trailers but they were clean and while I was there a doctor showed up and they gave them all fucking they check their snatches for whatever what they had a little kitchen at they'd somebody cooking little snacks for them they offered me some I said I'm gonna pass and then at the end he pulls me aside he goes by the way Greg take any of the girls it's on the house and I go well Dennis I've never been with a prostitute before and it wasn't because of the hundred bucks I wasn't waiting for a freebie and but the girls were they were happy they keep 50% of the money they can't use drugs on the premises they they can refuse a customer and they come and go when they want I think people should be able to do whatever they want that doesn't hurt people and I think that that falls into that category and I think it does provide a service for really frustrated men they can't get sex any other way yeah and I think it's stigmatized I think it's stigmatized in a very weird way it's not a good job I don't want to do it I don't want my children to do it I don't want your children to do it I don't want my kids to work as a dishwasher either I don't want my kids to be a coal miner those things are real jobs you know I just don't I think that if we had different attitudes about sex we wouldn't look at it as harshly we would look at it as horribly as we look at it we look at it different because we think they like intimacy is connected to romance and romance is connected to this emotional connection you have with this person that you're sharing pleasure with like that's that is wonderful but physical release is also very important for men it's like it's very important to and it's very important for everyone to be touched and some people people don't want to touch them you're just not doing so good yeah it's just they're not in a good spot they don't they're not physically attractive whatever it is whatever the whatever it for some people and they have a desire and a need to be touched and it fucking wrecks them to the soul when they're not touched all the time they constantly walk around filled with resentment filled with bitterness if we just quietly enraged inside at the hand that life has given them and for those people if you had legalized prostitution if it was like someone who liked you you could conceivably have friendships with these people that you're having sex with if you wanted to do that like I knew a girl who when she was younger she was a sex worker she's a I won't even reveal her it would be too obvious I reveal what she does but she did it for a while when she was like young and she fucked some older guys they were like you know in their sixties and shit they didn't know you know they had money but they didn't have the time to date and you know maybe they had a wife and they wanted have sex with somebody on the side and she would take money from them and she liked it she's like it's a great way to make money was a lot more money it's not that big a deal she was I knew who I was doing it with and I was like wow she's smart you know I mean I don't think everybody has that attitude and I would never want anybody to do that that doesn't have that attitude but if you're one of those girls it's like hustling maybe you don't have a family that backs you up know there's girls that like you know they're in kid there is legitimately like there's the I got a friend who's really wealthy and his friends have some of them have like a girl in New York and they pay for her apartment and she's going to college and he goes to New York seven eight times a year when he does she frees her calendar and goes out to dinner with him goes to wherever he sleeps there they have sex and it's a comfortable working relationship so I don't know where's the where's the problem with that who's the victim right yeah he's a sugar daddy yeah yeah I don't I think we have crazy attitudes for finite beings we have this crazy attitude like we're leaving this permanent like ledger of all the moral and immoral things we've done especially when it comes to sex it's like it's just sex you fucks yeah it's great everybody wants it but everybody doesn't get it and everybody sometimes people get rejected so it carries all this weight and so it's just like a bit and then you're not supposed to do it cuz God doesn't want you to or you could get pregnant Jesus Christ you pro-life or you pro-abortion he pro woman's like to choose you didn't even you should even have a say you have a fucking penis like whoa charge yes so charge right and meanwhile biologically your brain is going no no no we got a fuck okay I got loads building up I gotta get rid of these things mm-hmm you know like I used to have a bit called jerk-off first and think about it was my advice for everything because there's so many moments in life when you jerk off first and then you go what what was definitely not responded that crazy fucking letter she yeah in the mail yeah you know when you get a letter from somebody like oh no it's like sobering up yeah jerk off first jerk jarasand know your real intentions if you jerk off first and you still want to call someone you really care about them you love them that's right it's not just lust yeah that's it that's empty bag think yeah yeah I I was never good at that like I've reset the clock one nowadays I pop give you 24 hours didn't leave me a little 25 24 hours well I think I need some of those pills he's no esta strong yeah he's some TRT is that legal Oh a hundred percent yeah I think I need someone I need some of that yeah dude I've been on that show for ten years oh shit yeah yeah he make it a bunch of different ways now to theirs they were making the spray for a while like it was like under the tongue you could put drops in and then I don't know if they're doing that anymore but they have a cream the cream is good but if you hug people it gets on them it's weird wait where do you write it on you rub it on your chest to your arms so if you sex with your wife your wife's arm might grow a mustache well you find very strange that would be like a really creepy way if you were like really into dudes but you were married to a woman yeah how do i how do i bridge this gap like I'm on CRT and you would rub it all over your chest and immediately get on her and she'd be like the fuck are you doing give her protein shakes make a go to the gym a lot yeah yeah hey honey you look at with short hair put her under stress to make her work more there's something that happens with women apparently there was a study on career women and they don't know if it's a correlation or causation thing because maybe the reason why they were career women in the first place because they had a lot of testosterone but they were they would notice that women have to fend for themselves women have to take care of themselves they generally have more testosterone interesting which makes sense but doesn't I you never know like what came first the chicken or the egg is that like who they are are they developing more testosterone because they're they have to be out there competing yeah you know yeah I I remember I was uh i d--'s Rogaine for a while I was actually I got approached by my agent and he goes um you got an offer to do a commercial series of commercials I said for what he goes Rogaine I go but I don't my hair is not thinning and he's like yeah so it's five commercials I was in denial about it I was like 29 and I guess I was starting to crown a little bit but I didn't notice and so he goes do you want to do it I was like I don't know I'm about to move out to LA I want to maybe do some acting I don't want to be seen maybe on TV as the Rogaine guy and he's like I talked to them and they said it's only gonna it's gonna be on like ESPN 4 at 2:00 in the morning don't worry whatever and I go and I go all right fucking I move in LA I got no money I'll do it I'll get health insurance out of it I'm about to get married so I record the commercials and the tagline is it's me and a pharmacy and I'm looking at a bottle and it's MoDOT minoxidil 5 they just jacked it up from 3 to 5 and I go 4 out of 5 the voice-over goes four out of five doctors say this will work and then I go I look at the camera and I go 4 out of 5 I like my chances so I do it I do it and then there is there's that guy I like the nod is legit so they so all of a sudden it starts running it runs during the fucking playoffs March Madness every guy I've ever met was calling me and gone I like my I'm walking down the street I like my chances it was everywhere yeah and so they gave me they gave me a fucking supply for years and I was using it and I would my wife wouldn't let me cuddle with her because she don't you put on your head at the end of the before you go to bed they cuddle up next to her and get your fucking hair on her neck and it made you all greasy my pillows were all greasy and all it really grew is like a fuckin fuzz yeah did you ever try that yeah I tried that shit I tried everything yeah yeah I wish I shaved my head way earlier it's so easy I think I'm gonna do it tomorrow for the first out of my life once I shaved my head I was like wow my fucking around with all this hair yeah if I had I have full head of hair I'd shave my fucking head I'd shave my head like every two weeks I just let it grow too stubble and then shave it down again let it grow too stubble it's like it's so much easier how often do you shave it every couple days you take a razor oh yeah easy I have one that has like it's made for shaving your head it's getting a handle on it it's like an electric razor just one could so you don't miss any spots how longs it take me a couple minutes it's easy feel good yeah that's great I don't have to think about it that's what I like I don't know this I don't think about this I used to worry about my hair when my hair was falling out when something's out of your control four people have a flood of hair they really don't understand this when you start losing your hair young Jamie son of a bitch well you start losing your hair you you just go oh my god like there's nothing to do about this this is terrible like there's nothing you can do and then you look at like these fucking guys like some guys that are like gross looking bald dudes and you look oh my god they used to be a kid yeah they used to be just like me and then one day it all fucking fell out and they were this gross dude with the horseshoe around the bottom of the head like what the fuck that's what I'm gonna be and once you shave your head like for me I got lucky I have a good shape he had shaped my head which is something that I watched I went down a rabbit hole the other day and I went down a plastic surgery facial reconnect reconfiguration rabbit hole because of in cells connected to this conversation we're having earlier about guys can't get laid these guys were going to his one doctor there's a particular doctor I think he's in Indianapolis and he does facial reconfiguration like he widens your jaw he puts implants on your cheeks and jaw he puts implants on your fucking head so I get maybe you have a weird-shaped head maybe your head is shaped like a turtle or something you have a weird crest on the top of your head this guy puts implants under your skin to give you a nice round head and they had like before and after this guy was like oh hated my head and no no my head is amazing and I'm looking at this and I'm going oh my god like I didn't even think of that well how's it look he looked way better yeah but it's what it is is like genetics are responding to symmetry when you see when you see poor genetics you see something weird like weird symmetry Wise's wises face so narrow why is this chin go down so low what's weird about him why is it why his shoulders so narrow why are his arms so long we see a symmetrical or weird looking people that don't seem to like it doesn't fit into your idea of what the accepted breeding genetics of human beings are right da Vinci cut yeah is that what it is oh yeah yeah it's based on a there's a certain shape of the face Beauty it's a Fibonacci code so were you thinking oh no I think it's the da Vinci cut that was a religious thing for that movie yeah but with within it don't they talk about the symmetry of the face I think that's the golden ratio that's the Fibonacci okay that's the Fibonacci but yeah this is the guy this is this guy Wow so they oh this is an article from cut of the cut yeah the cut com yeah that's this is exactly where I started so I started on this and I think it was on dig or something like that and then I went from that to all of the different people that have these things done and that's something if you think about it man if you just get a bum deal you just get a bit of bad roll the dice you will live your life with people that don't they don't want to have sex with you mm-hmm and this goes back to like the prostitution thing like what do people want from those people do they want the world to be a different place than it really is because are we operating as if this world is exactly how it is right now or are we pretending that the world is how we'd like it to be one day in a utopian society because we're doing that I get you how you're behaving but if you're looking at the world around you the way it is and you don't think these guys should be able to get prostitutes you're an asshole I think that kind of boils down with libertarianism is you know it's whether or not we are in a evolving utopian mindset or whether or not we're gonna just say let people be who they are and just accept how things are just a little bit of that I think I'm on both sides of that fence sometimes you know there's there's definitely people that you just want to leave them alone they're not gonna figure it out fuck them but then there's also people like we've all met people that have been in a bad place in their life and turned it around yeah I don't I don't like giving up on people I just don't this isn't it's not human it's not a human thing to give up on people right so inst I'm on both sides of that like part of me wants to go like figure it out and then part of me wants to go like we got to help people figure it out yeah and we have to try to engineer our society like this is a problem it's like we're talking about before about reparations for slavery or these these communities that have always been black and poor since the slave times like it's just leave that alone and let that sort itself out that is never gonna sort itself out that's like a place in your garage that's fucked up and filled with trash that you think is gonna figure itself out on its own like you you you've got to do something you the the garbage that you're leaving behind that's not gonna make its way to the trash you're gonna have to sort it out you have to figure out how to do it you have to get it out there if you have an impoverished crime riddled community filled with drugs and gangs it's not gonna get better you should do something someone has to do something you can't just pretend you can't just go further and further away from it if we're gonna act as a country that's what we're supposed to be we're supposed to be a big-ass team we would we're supposed to be looking at the spots on the team that are fucked up yeah you talk about that Houston is kind of famous for this of literally the garbage dumps were all put in the black neighborhoods they just started dumping all the garbage in the poor areas with the bad schools totally segregated at the same areas that worse they were slave shacks way back when and now that's the same fucking generations later living in garbage all right because what if you do a DNA test yet find out your great-grandfather was the guy putting a fucking garbage dump in the black neighborhood and that's why you have a Cadillac dude my wallets on the table at that point take it off I'm so sorry but you didn't do anything you're 23 I recycle now thank you but stuff in the green bins the blue bins you're gonna save those fish compost bins those whales out there it's eating plaster yeah we gotta just we got a genetic engineer the whales to actually be able to digest plastic figure it out yeah we're good it's free food yeah come on yeah man we got boy onslaught on the podcast he's this really young genius who is in the middle of devising and implementing a way to gather up the plastic he's got like this big machine that operates like so it's got a big arm yeah it's like yeah it's like got like a net yeah capturing I'm really breaking it down much like a paraphrasing in a shitty way but his machine is just gonna scoop plastic up and they think they could actually reuse that PLAs they can make things out of it yeah I saw that I think they I think they ran into some technical problems with it yeah they just used it yeah I think when they tried it out right away it didn't work that good yeah but he kind of figured that he was like well there's gonna be a bunch of improvements it's like everything else right every go by our early Tesla they were they were terrible maybe over Tesla may may not last really yeah they're sitting it well the problem is is they they call it an entrepreneurial shiny object syndrome that's what Elon Musk has is like he can't stop he has to keep you know there was SpaceX which is fucking phenomenal right what that program is done they are they are delivering stuff to space for a tenth of the price of NASA they have cut costs ridiculously NASA was so fucking bloated and and which was great but now it's like he wants to put a fucking tunnel under LA and he wants these charging stations all around the country that are gonna be solar-powered that are gonna be expensed he's just overextended himself and now Wall Street used to love them and now they're not buying it anymore and it could be the end of the company how would it be the end of the company how does that work well they're the they need to be producing like a million cars a year to be cost effective for their assembly lines for the wooden cost for their assembly lines and they're putting out a few hundred thousand a year and they need to they need to up production to that point and they don't think they can do it I shouldn't say that I'm gonna fucking tank the stock yeah it's um how many different places can you charge out now I always charge here or I charge at home yeah but how many places is it real easy to charge you find a lot of spots have no idea but I know he's trying to make it really Universal it's great if you driving it just to work like I do I Drive it to the store or drive it here it's great yeah they're the it's the best car I've ever driven but but it's not it's

funny you know I'm right you know I'm right right I know you're right too at the end of my life no no no no now if it's my kids now I'm saying at the end of my life when I look back I'm gonna go oh my kid went to college fuck him you can take a loan do you have the room for it in your driveway if you had a third car we park on the street I live in Venice 4060 cells that's not much but it's not bad that's a good deal get that fucking thing you park in the street yes sir I'd like a Kickstarter fund or something from my car you think we would do that um no they would say just do some gigs and put some money away you son of a bitch I know you fucking sellout places shut the fuck up some dudes are just so frugal I always find that so funny cuz I'm such a slob but that's how we were we started in Boston oh you were driving a fucking so is it a celica GT or some no it was a Mitsubishi Starion here's like a little sporty layer yeah yeah and you were leasing it and I was like who the fuck leases a new car when they've been doing comedy for two years and I had a fucking I had an 84 Volkswagen Rabbit and and I just remember you had a nice wee you had a jacked-up stereo system in it and I remember you got it got fucking repossessed no that was a different card that was the Dodge Daytona Shelby I got rid of the one and then I got the second one and you didn't give a fuck oh you went to the you went to the impound lot and you jumped the fence to get the radio I had a stereo I put in it I installed the stereo I jumped the fence and pulled the fucking stereo out of the Daytona because I knew I wasn't gonna be able to pay for that fucking car anymore it was it was actually that was the first year of comedy that was my first year actually it got that while I was still teaching and I was still I taught I was teaching at Boston University I was teaching Taekwondo there I was teaching at this school that I was running in Revere and I was delivering newspapers I was making a little bit of money and I was really stupid and when I found out that I could get a car like a brand new Dodge Daytona Shelby in 1988 or 1989 and I could I could lease it they would lease it to me what I was like perfect let's do it but then somewhere along the line I had decided I was really gonna dedicate myself to stand up I was like I am I'm half-assing this and somebody told me that one of the guys that I was doing open mic nights they said you know you were really funny like six months ago that it goes but it seems like you've fallen off a little and he said it to me and I didn't even respond I remember like fuck he's right yeah he's right he's right I'm half-assing it and then that night I was like fuck this I'm quitting everything so I decided was going to quit teaching I quit teaching at bu I quit teaching at high school I shut my school down looks like I'm done I got it I gotta be a comic 100% and then I had no money so you just live off whatever I make I was trying to get odd jobs during the day yeah but I couldn't have anything that I was dedicated to right and when I was teaching I was very dedicated to teaching T it meant a lot to me like martial arts meant a lot to me so technique means a lot to me so when I was teaching people it's very specific it meant a lot yeah and I would teach people on to bring them with tournaments and you know I raised kids from like white belt all the way up to like blue belt and brought him to tournaments and it was exciting was really fun it meant a lot to me though it meant enough to me that I was not gonna half-ass it I was like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna have teach these people because when I was teaching I was very serious about I'm it meant a lot so I was like I'm not I got a I'm out I'm not go once I have a thing I'm like that's the thing all these other things just get in the way of the thing just eliminate those so that's what I did and then they took my fucking car but I got the stereo back I remember cuz I was I was living with your girlfriend and you were coming over every night fucking you'd come from like cappuccinos the restaurant around the corner with fucking takeout like nice meals I was eating fucking ramen noodles I spent every penny I spent everything in put anything away ever come from Blockbuster with fucking five movies under your arm yeah you were living with my girlfriend and another dude yeah a guy named Mike coconut who's a great guy he was a great dude he's the first guy I ever met hell out of Bowflex oh no shit yeah he was the first guy I met who was growing marijuana in his closet oh shit lights that's dangerous in Boston in the 80s all right you go to jail jail he grow he that was some skunk weed we serious smoking that skunk weed you could go to jail jail for that yeah Massachusetts a hundred percent free now hundred percent legal go to a store and buy it yeah how fucking beautiful is that an Illinois House passes marijuana legalization Wow yes YouTube Pritzker governor fuck yeah fuck yeah legalize Illinois see in and get a gang of it out to the southside of Chicago speaking of disenfranchised neighborhoods that are not gonna fix themselves that's another one there was five murders there last week it's crazy and the schools are so fucking bad there's this really good documentary called America is me and it tracks Oak Park which is like a kind of a mixed suburb in Chicago where there's black and white students and they just track the lives of like ten students and hit five black and five white and how they can be in the same place and have such different experiences you know black families where the fucking kid is stressed out he's not doing well in school and they're like the teachers frustrated but he's like yes his he's got a single mom and they just lost the apartment cuz she lost her job and now they living with an aunt and you know there's all these circumstances going on and then you've got the white kids who are taking SAT prep classes and they got a mom who's not working that drives them to their different sports it's a R it's a great documentary it's a different world that's I mean this is the same conversation we were having before the podcast started about this guy that we know the things that homeless people are lazy yeah and we're like look there are people out there that were born on third base and they fucking swear to god they hit a triple hmm and they think wow I I fucking didn't have my shoes tied and I didn't do this and I I missed out on birthday parties and neither you but nobody shot you yeah you know nobody robbed you your uncle didn't rape you you're not in jail you didn't you didn't watch your brother get killed you know come on man like there's way worse hands that people get dealt way worse and just the overall vague sense of entitlement well am i saying on the other side of being surrounded by people that are not achieving oh yeah and being being exposed to people that don't think that finishing high school or college is a priority right and so it's very hard to come up with that concept yourself especially in the absence of like two functioning parents the only thing that helps them now is the internet because you can you could lock onto like David Goggins like that or someone who was also born in this terrible situations like that you can listen to his story yeah and read his or listen his audiobook which is fantastic read his a book and understand there's people like him that used to be like me they made it through and now they have a story and I can do that too it's possible and then that becomes your guiding light but the idea that we're all in the same fucking starting block it's just stupid as fuck yeah it's stupid it's stupid it's a bad way to look at the world yeah and when people get upset at you know certain aspects of life without acknowledging that yeah and then you've got people that live in abandoned factory towns whether it's you know in the Appalachia's or it's you know Detroit where you had jobs and your grandfather had a job and that was it and it was just it was like there was no diversity of work in that area and then the fucking plant closes and it's just despair I have a good friend and his family is from coal miners and I mean he the way he describes it he's like you have never seen that kind of poverty before you've never seen that kind of poverty you're in these coal towns and people just all fucked up on pills like the whole towns fucked up on pills mmm there's like um seeing poverty like that Wow it's dark and there's despair and there's no exit strategy no one there's no one to model around you no one no one's kept there to give you advice everyone's a criminal everyone's trying to get by everyone selling pills robbing people shooting people and this is just a segment this is just what happens with despair right and this is just despair in that ended that context and then there's despair in South Central LA just despair in East LA just despair and you know really fucked up Mexican neighborhoods in LA well that's why we were talking about I think you had a guest on they talked about how with how everything's getting rote robots are taken over that's the book by Han yang it was probably the presidential candidate talking about how they're going to subsidize the the whole populations yes but with that you know it sounds like it may happen at that type of a system but there's still gonna be despair because you still need a sense of purpose you still need to work you feel good about yourself that's the counter to that yeah and I agree with both things unfortunately its hype I agree that most likely automation is going to take over here's the thing when when people need purpose they still need purpose they need purpose now but would a thousand dollars a month if everyone knew they had a thousand dollars a month coming from the government would it make you more invested in being an American would it make you more invested in keeping this thing running like you're you're actually getting paid from it you're looking at the American like it's generating income and you're getting paid from it you're getting enough money so you can eat and have a roof over your head like if the three of us got $1,000 a month that's $3,000 a month there's a place we could get with three of us is like 1500 bucks a month and then the rest of it we would just put into food and whatever and that's we could live Randee hookers you would live like that that's a that's a livable wage for enough if you get enough people to get $1,000 a month it's not perfect so the question is how does it make you feel about yourself and about your country yeah and this is the question - does that stop you from pursuing your dreams because it's not like you're getting 50 grand a year look if you were getting 50 grand a year man be hard to get me to work if I just had free 50 grand every year like how much do you do really if you have an apartment look it's not eat I know folks that are making 50 grand like hey you know you'd be surprised you don't really save much and you know once you if you have a car and a lease and either a mortgage or an apartment payment I get it I get it but if you had 50 grand a year it would be really hard for you to grind it would be really hard for you to really go after something just be obsessed unless that's just your style as that's just who you are well it seems like a I don't know if it's more manageable weight is just socialized medicine and make higher education free I think both those things are imperative I really do I think especially education why would it cost why should cost money to figure out how to make people more intelligent and contribute better why wouldn't you want less losers wouldn't you want more educated people that have a better understanding of how the world works since we're a service economy we're not a manufacturing anymore we need people that understand how to manage and to be entrepreneurial and you know yes communicate but just be educated I mean yeah there's more people that are smarter then you have more competition than you have more productivity I mean it would just be better for everybody you don't want ignorant people ya wanna see well education my son's going to college it's fuckin $65,000 a year that's so much times four years times two kids that's six hundred thousand dollars a year what Americans got an extra six so your kid is now saddled with a debt that he'll be paying off forever he's underwater it's not six hundred thousand dollars a year you're saying sixty five thousand dollars a year and to sixty-five seventy one hundred thirty thousand you mean sixty you mean forever yeah for four years for four years to kids like six hundred fifty grand a year that's like six hundred total over over the course of their college careers yeah your your base and you have to make more than a million to have that by the way yeah who's got to be taxes yeah and you're not just only spending money on that you got to spend money on living expenses and your mortgage and your house and so that you know you're really talking about two million probably and don't think your kids coming out of college into a job that's gonna be able to support himself you're still gonna be subsidizing their phone and their car insurance and probably part of their rent for the next five six years that's when they come to visit yeah and if you're thinking about that over over these four years you really if you want a hundred grand you kind of have to make 200 mm-hmm and then you got insurance if you're on the market as a family of four to get health insurance in California you're paying twenty thousand dollars a year between fifteen and twenty thousand dollars a year which means again you got to earn forty a a lot of people are moving out of California because of state tax a lot of people realize you know I can live in Nevada and not pay any state tax yeah why would I want to pay state acts what am i doing that's a lot of money it is ten percent right yeah and then if you live in New York City you have to pay a stain in a city tax dirty beach fat fucking city tax owed is that to keep the rats that's to keep the electricity going for the guys that are taking a train and Connecticut everyday and work in our Wall Street that aren't they in the fucking city tax fucking communists yeah the people who don't pay the city tax are dirty yeah they work in the city and they don't pay the tax right must pay the tax those estates in Connecticut yeah those weird soulless gigantic Great Gatsby like estates Darien Connecticut they've all got fucking Ferraris buddy my work semantics transmissions buddy my works the high school in Connecticut well as rich kids go he works there shout out to my boy Tommy jr. yeah he works there and like sees these people giant fucking huge lawns and mm-hmm talking about buying a place there I [Music] want a big lawn I want to be like a cannon I'd like to live next to a bunch of people that are on pills they're fucking mine trying to make meaning out of life not one read billion dollars in the bank I want people whose heads have been reshaped by a guy in Indianapolis yeah if you have a flat head though there's something girls don't want to fuck a dude I'm gonna shave my head but it's not gonna look what I got I got a bad head you're fine well I'm too pretty pasty white hours dude shave it really yeah we should do it tomorrow do we have the Clippers from the top do it right now do really are they over there are they charged up probably yeah if it only went half way and then cut off that's the should have that that should be didn't you new look like Kris Kross needs to have their clothes on backwards you shave half the side of your head shave one side leave the other side and people like what is going on like fuck you I'm handicapped look at my head yeah half the crowd I'm doing bald jokes for half the crowd the other credit how're you doing like going bald dude I had Ari Shaffir on my podcast one time and we were at you ever do a podcast and above the Comedy Cellar they've got a studio up north Bobby Kelly started it and it says every day what it's called and um so I'm up there doing my podcast with Ari and it's an apartment it's like there's a there's a bedroom and a bathroom and then the studio and if we got to talking about torture and I go I go you ever been waterboarded he's like no I go this is a bathroom right here I go you want you want me to waterboard you and you know our he's like yep sure else to do it so we go inside and I put a towel over his face and he leans over backwards and his head is below his body in the shower stall the nozzle comes off the wall and I spray down his face and nothing nothing nothing and then all sudden his body's convulsing his legs are kicking he's fucking screaming water is shooting out of his nose he's choking and it went on for like a couple of minutes and I'm fucking dying and then he starts laughing and we were just on the podcast laughing without saying a word for probably five minutes and then he goes want me to do it to you I'm like fuck yeah and then he waterboarded me in the same thing happens Wow yeah the waterboarding is legit yeah yeah yeah yeah that's real torture yeah but it's weird torture because you're not permanently injuring someone like you think it towards you think of like someone cutting someone and lighting them on fire shell like that what's the torture you at least want to be done to you it's good question maybe that one maybe waterboarding I don't know I get like electrocution they electrocute you Ozark spoiler alert oh yeah I don't say nothing look I think I think being made to be cold for long periods I'm cold and knows they say no sleep is actually the worst thing you can do to somebody right like Chinese water torture they just have the water drip on you yeah just keeps you awake okay trip yeah that's a good tip if you ever fallen asleep while you're driving folks get uh if you stopped at a gas station and get like a soda or a water and some ice and then get like wet towel get a wet towel with ice in it and just rub your face cuz I used to smack myself in the face when I was coming back from gigs yeah and I'd be driving on the Mass Pike stuff of the face just sticking my head out the window you know just trying to stay away yeah cuz you're just something about hypnotic white lines just dude I used to fucking hot dog I used to drive from Boston to New York like once a week for like a year and a half I had a place I could crash in the city and I finished my gigs on Saturday night I'd be at the fucking Worcester aku-aku the show it ended like you know midnight and I get my car and I Drive the three three-and-a-half hours to the city and I regularly slept while driving and then snapped out of it like how fucking crazy is that I once wrecked a car I fell asleep on a highway once Oh what wheel I was in college and I had to go down to Providence for a court date I got into a fight in Providence and I got arrested spent the weekend in jail and then I had to come back for the court appearance so I borrowed my ex-girlfriends car and I'd been up the night before all night drinking and so I drove down and I did the court appearance got out of it and I'm driving home and I'm on 95 north and I just fucking fell asleep and I hit the guardrail spun out and hit a truck oh my god and thank God I got I cut my mouth I hit my mouth on the steering wheel this is probably no airbags to right no airbags I was old Toyota Corolla fucking totaled the car on my ex-girlfriends car oh no how's she feel she was all right with it she stopped you were alive she was a great girl oh yeah Cyndi Martha shout-out to Cindy so you probably were relieved because of the court date right yeah you relieved ha got off can't believe I got off yeah and they driving back Oh bang fuck what a feeling man you talk about adrenaline rushing into your body mmm that's second it can't get no more intense than that kid I knew from high school died that way no no shit really hits like the underside of a bridge damn yeah he was a sleeper he was drink I'll sleep fell asleep damn yeah happens all the time man my father he was uh my father was a big drinker and he was driving home drunk one time and my mom was following him in another car that's how complicit alcoholism was back in the 70s yeah wives were just like all right honey I'll follow you cuz you're drunk oh my girl and so he's driving and he falls asleep at the wheel and he goes headfirst into a tree oh Jesus cuts his jugular vein and his arm the veins in his arm my mom drives to get an ambulance he has no cellphones they come by the time they get there he has no vital signs he's fucking dead and they brought him back to life and he was in the hospital for like two weeks well how'd they bring him back to life it was like that was like the five I was like four or five and what but as I say they have some stuff they set aside yeah they really like here I used that pet sematary injection back bring him back spike I didn't see any pet sematary I heard it was uh based on the Stephen King book yeah the book is great yeah the movie the first movie was all right it was all right they're fun they're campy they different Sheen his books and his movies they were so profound yeah his books are terrifying his books like get to the heart of the worst aspects of human nature and right demonic possession the one Maximum Overdrive would be a great one every make now yeah fucking robot sir and yeah and takes over and kills everyone yeah no shit right yeah they have it like with modern electric trucks and shit yeah The Shining was the only one that was just scary is the book what was different very different than the book the show yeah I read the book The Shining the movie with Jack Nicholson apparently bothered Stephen King because Jack Nicholson was like on edge from the beginning of the movie like he was always crazy like he was always like you know he's always just kind of barely fucking hanging on yeah you know that was his whole thing and in the book the guy clearly becomes mad right he becomes possessed he's a normal guy who's struggling he's trying to be a writer and he uses this as an opportunity to write and then the house takes him over it's more smart of a narc yeah yeah it's both this is nothing you can do that's him getting pumped up for the scene oh yeah then fired up look at him yeah is that Kubrick yeah yeah yeah cute Britta you know healed by a fucking axe axe wielding Jack Nicholson yeah I could see that once Kubrick takes over you're not you're not gonna have a lot of saying how the thing is directed well not only that Kubrick put all this moon-landing stuff in it there was all these moon references yeah yeah the kid had an Apollo sweater on like there was there's there's someone made a documentary that was all the numbers and all the quaint all the things that are attached to that movie room 237 that's what it's about because it's two hundred thirty seven thousand miles to the moon when they made the launch he's got us a apollo sweater on the little boy did there's a bunch of things yeah there's a ton of things that Kubrick did on purpose because he would put weird stuff like that in his movies he's a fascinating guy man you know he was like a high-level mathematician no shit yeah he would do high level mathematics for fun while he wasn't doing movies Wow yeah they had an exhibit at LACMA in LA of a Stanley Kubrick exhibit for like six months it was fucking wild that place should be flattened they should take all the homeless people move them there that place is the most of the biggest abomination of all Los Angeles I went there there's a clear plastic box that was yeah like this boxes are this yeah this is art this is our art at our space yeah me this box and this is our earth like what okay they have it roped off so you don't sit on the box yeah and it took like a plexiglass box like get the fuck out of my face with this yeah you know what you're doing another piece of art was like people throwing basketballs in the nets it was like like videos of basketballs like over and over and over again throwing basketballs I'm like hey hey hey fuck you fuck you I know what you're doing I know what you're doing you don't this is art you know this is not okay you know then there was some art there when there was some of that stuff there was some things you like hey fuck you with this box yeah I know what you're doing and you get paid for this yeah who's paying you is this taxpayer funded isn't it LACMA yes yeah they probably have to pay the people to rent their art bro the fucking real estate they're living in yeah some reason about Museum is that only something like 7% like most collections are what you see there's so much stuff in storage like cool shit that people might want to see that there's not room for because the buildings aren't big enough lots of like instruments for instance 300 year old violins getting used by like kids because it's cheaper to just keep them in use and send them around than it is to distort it and hope it like restore it eventually like after it's unused for 25-30 years because of all the old horsehair or whatever is they used to make each thing but there's really cool art but pride to Vinci or who knows what's hidden in some of these places but people that work there know and get to see some of it you know what's interesting to me people that buy dinosaur skeletons apparently there's a giant market for them in China they'll spend like a million dollars and buy a dinosaur skeleton you walk in this motherfuckers house fuck your artwork that's pretty badass goddamn t-rex in my li like that you imagine yeah you walk into some some guy's palace some emerald Palace and you open these two fucking teakwood doors and you see a dinosaur in the middle of his front entrance that's what they're going for so they're buying this it's nothing Nicolas Cage returns stolen Mongolian dinosaur skull he bought at gallery Soros what does that move my animal Tyrannosaurus Bataar have you heard of that man ata AR well it will be repatriated ah I like that word after it was bought by the actor from Beverly Hills gallery in 2007 a t-rex skull Wow but he bought it for two hundred seventy six thousand dollars that's a pretty good deal why was 2007 I think he said yeah she wasn't worth as much back then so fun man nothing stops you in your tracks and in like Museum of Natural History is a good fucking dinosaur skeleton especially the ones that eat things like meat meat I don't want that big guys stupid plant eating brontosaurus get that bitch oh yes what is that that's a weird elephant he's a fucking vegan who wants to hang out with a vegan about here I'm not scared I want some teeth let me see teeth and claws what shit design huh giant head little tiny baby arms yeah it was shit design yeah what is he doing with those arms what the fuck is the purpose of those arms Lindy there's the only animal that I can think of that developed that way and was a de was he a plant eater no t-rex of t-rex yeah yeah t-rex was they they don't know if t-rex was a predator or if t-rex was a scavenger they think by the shape there's some some talk that by the shape of his bones that what he might have been doing was using those bones to crush giant dinosaur bones and that like he might be surviving on undead things yeah and that they also had some speculation that they might have had they don't want no what they really looked like because they don't know the skin color they had some speculation that they might have had faces like vultures like red fucked up really brightly colored faces just to let you know they're disgusting and then Haiti you know cause like when you see vultures it's not a coincidence that they're the grossest fucking looking animal on the planet and all they eat is dead shit yeah and they're big vultures are fucking big that's a big animal flopping around these giant wings but we're not nearly as impressed by them as we are with an eagle you see like the vulture is never gonna be the fucking national bird get out of here with that bullshit we killed ourselves bro well know what I'm here for say scavenger ass fucked up red face stupid bird yeah Oh Sonia I think it opens some the 8th of June just sorry they have this brand new deep time oh that's Irish shale natural history dinosaur exhibit and this is some of the highlights of what they have there they have this like t-rex Wow Triceratops yeah Jesus John brush elk the saber-tooth cat bunch of those stuff like you're just talking about it so I'm sure they might have some of these answers to the questions and this is where which DC Smithsonian naturally when does this come out that's its opening now so like they just built it and I just do all the press seems pretty cool yeah I mean who owns the dinosaur skeletons who owns that at the Smithsonian I think is it's free cuz it's us taxes so some of the stuff I guess we technically own I guess so hmm I don't sit DC or New York one of them doesn't charge for any of the museum's I think it might be DC us the Smithsonian stuff is all free when it's open it should be free my friend John Dudley knows a dude who owns a ranch in Montana and they found a t-rex on its property oh shit yeah Wow found a bone out there moving around stuff on his properties like what the fuck is this oh it's cleaning it up find something brings in some paleontologists they start digging they're like whoa daddy yeah we got a t-rex here alright yeah yeah that's it that's a fucking job people get obsessed with that and I go I'm gonna be an archaeologist when I get older and then you're standing in a fucking desert with a toothbrush for eight hours a day trying to find a bone what's up dude Sam the guy's name from Sam O'Neil sam neill sam neill sam neill from Jurassic Park yeah nobody wants to be him everybody wants be Jeff Goldblum the guy shows up with a sexy jacket and says life finds a way huh it appears the careers of life finds away world's biggest t-rex discovered Jesus Christ what is this huh estimated nineteen thousand five hundred pounds holy yeah that's holy shit and what can those arms even do look at those dimes a weird man they're so weird and look how big the feet and legs are and the giant ass head that's the thing that thinking like that this wasn't something that chased things down they just sort of bent over and just jacked whatever was on the ground yeah but I don't know if that's like I think there was some speculation and we should google this because there was something about the physics of its body that it wouldn't be able to run fast because it's so weirdly shaped they like trying to figure out why is its head so big it has little tiny ass arms and these big-ass legs this big fucking tail like can that thing run like what it would and then there's also some speculation that the atmosphere was way different back then and the atmosphere is much more oxygen-rich maybe things just more different you know like the physics run longer and yes they're like maybe even the physics of earth was a little different in terms of like the way we interacted with the gravity mm-hmm we could wait with the interacted with the atmosphere rather yeah yeah the atmosphere like held them up somehow or another like it was thicker but I read things that I'm high on I don't know what the fuck I read I think this is just saying that it could have been slower maybe then in the Jurassic Park wouldn't have been running that it says running would have broken an adult Tyrannosaurus rexes legs see I don't but okay google this because so now we know that there's people that think that he couldn't run because of the shape google the atmosphere was different during the Jurassic period because there was some I mean it might have been horseshit it was just an article that was written about how like we have to take into account the whole world was like different before that giant asteroid came and fucked up everything and slammed into Chichen itzá you know that says that the oxygen levels might have been about 20 to 30 percent higher during that time period so it might have been harder to breathe I guess I'm not sure hardly to breathe a sudden drop in oxygen from roughly 30% of the atmosphere of the atmosphere to about 10 percent may have contributed to mass extinctions Oh from the impact the dinosaur so that was one of the things they thought killed there's a bunch of different ideas they have of how quickly the dinosaurs died off but one of the more interesting ones that I saw recently was that they all died almost instantly this is it what it made it more humid with higher levels of carbon dioxide and more likely more cloud cover hmm it just is gasping for breath harder - I just keep seeing that stuff's just harder to breathe during it yeah that doesn't have anything to do with the way they moved though there was something about I remember reading something about the way a t-rex move but it's a fucking mystery cuz it's not not like you look at a crocodile you're like oh I get it uses those four legs to get you this big fat face hmm you know it makes sense right then you look at the t-rex like why are you up in the air like that why is your head so big what's with the little legs the ones in the front one of those things most of the arms what's up with this weird body wrap that weight of that head is a large iron yeah it's crazy he needs to go to Indianapolis get that thing fucking shit yeah he's an insult maybe that's why so mad fuck yeah how did they Father they fuck how do they fuck Jesus Christ with that tail how do you get out the pussy with that tail hmm that's a crazy ass tail yeah you'd have to come at it from the side you'd have to tackle her you'd have to blindside her tackle her get a leg up in the air get in like that you have to get one leg but then what the fuck you have no arms ya know ya know she can't give me a job t-rex tiny arms may have been vicious weapons save it nerd save it nerd what like unlike his fucking giant face filled with huge swords he's got a huge head filled with swords trade off remnants of little wings of flightless bird I was looking at my thought maybe at one point I'd heard that there's some one scientists thought those were like remnants of wings well that makes sense and they weren't actually maybe arms but their wings well that totally makes sense if you think about like ostriches and shit like that they used to have wings and they turned into those things let me see it again let me see this fucking little shitty arms that makes me way more sense that wakes way more sense that the remnants of four wings cuz like that if you think about what an ostrich looks like you could kind of morph an ostrich into a t-rex right yeah I mean they don't have a tail but they do have those fucked up legs giant ass legs in a weird body and a fucking head and when they look at you they look at you like they look right through you like you don't mean shit like if you got run over by a truck in front of an ostrich they wouldn't even flinch yeah they don't give a fuck about you now and just like a dinosaur they just have this bird face yeah they have zero compassion for you yeah just have no empathy that's why they have small arms they never hug anybody no assholes all of those all those fucking creatures that fly around or used to they can all suck it all birds all birds are gross I love when people keep them as pets see if you can find Opie Birds my bird loves me yeah keep your window open yeah let's see what happens t-rex used to look like vulture this is a weird one they don't even even know what they're covering feathers they think I'm I haven't covered in feathers yeah that's a more recent speculation they think that all dinosaurs were covered in feathers Wow yeah or most of them you know that's why you know you see chickens chicken look literally is a dinosaur just one that lived when I made it oh that's one it's creepy looking now there was one where it had a red face there was some thing yeah that's it right there exactly yeah yeah so yeah that's how they had it done with like feathers and shit feathers in a big old red face I don't know why we're attached to like one idea what that fucking thing looked like all we have is bones have no idea what the skin was like easily could have been covered in feathers is it amazing that every kid I don't know if it's girls too but every boy gets fascinated with Dinosaurs at a certain age isn't that weird oh yeah it's like archetypal there's something deep in your brain that wants to know and connect with Dinosaurs when you're like four or five years old because it's such a fucking wild Hail Mary by nature and they they ruled for so long and they were snuffed out by a rock like if that rock didn't hit Earth we would be under the reign of these vicious fucking reptiles mm-hmm roaming the planet eating everything we would have never evolved where we are we would have been hiding in little holes in the ground we'd be little mammals hmm this as good as you're ever gonna get you're never gonna develop a fucking city good luck bitch this Raptors everywhere they're just running around jack you don't think Homo sapiens would have ever never made it mmm never got to that part we were moles for hundreds of millions of years we were these weird fucking creatures and then from 65 million years ago that mole evolved into a human being according to these fucking scientists all their fancy they have any $65,000 a year that you have to pay for education yeah this book I was just listening to music and the brain talked about the first instrument found is this I think it was like a rib flute of like an elephant or something that's like 50,000 years old but because it's a flute they go that's probably most likely not the first instrument being used because it was probably drums you can get into a flute that's making sounds it's a big evolution yeah like how how farther back do you think they were just using drums before they had language you know that's a good point the hakka and new zealand that whole thing yeah it's just a lot of sounds and grunts yeah screaming yeah I'm Yoona Kate yeah like what is the accepted timeline for the invention of language let's say you guess I don't know what it is but let's say guess I want to say language that was invented a hundred thousand years ago what do you think is that well then I'm gonna say it's 40 I'm gonna say languages it was invented 40,000 years ago it was Homo Sapien right is that yes first but homo sapien didn't always have language right homo sapien I think is 250,000 plus years old there's like the argument from like 250 tickets shaky to like 350 400 whatever there whatever it could be but they think somewhere around there and the other thing is like they intersected with was it Neanderthal man that came before him and originally they just thought that one ended and the next one started yeah but then in fact they actually existed together yup for a long time and they fought yep and they fucked and Neanderthal was around way longer the Ender thought survived for half a million years so Neanderthal was alive way longer than humans have been alive then modern homo sapien yeah what's up everything I keep finding just says like it starts with ancient Egypt night that can't be that's probably a written language spoken language at the origin date of spoken language when Neanderthal was bigger and stronger but homo sapien they organized yeah well they work with life why what really happened cuz Neanderthals actually have bigger brains oh really yeah but they're also built way better wait wait different so it might have been their bigger brains was too oh they're much stronger body mmm because they were like 5-7 250 pounds and shit 20 pounds yeah they were built there from the nose huh yeah they were thick ass bones man like a 5-7 200-pound man today like man that guy's got to be lifting some weights basically my height I'm 5/8 I weight 200 pounds so I'm built like a Neanderthal like legitimately yes they were all built like yeah that and thicker right but with way denser bones and bigger heads bigger heads bigger arms bigger bones the bones in the forearm the arms the legs everything was thicker they were just more sturdy than us they're like naturally like they don't have to lift weights it would rip your fucking arms off they were just built like almost like a half a chimp like on the way from being you know Australia or you know Homo erectus or Australia Pittacus or any of those early man cut type species they were in that you know there's there was a big thing there was dozens of them they think there's the ones out of Russia that they found out about I think they're called Denisovans there's those little Hobbit people that we're in Australia Flores for us they think there might be ones in those places too even in Vietnam they have one they call the orange pen deck I think that's how you say it and that they that's a like a little monkey man like a little hairy man that lives in the forest out there and before this Hobbit discovery which was only like a decade ago though the people that live in the island of Flores and they found out that this there was absolutely three foot tall little hairy people that had stone tools and you know and they organized they lived in these places and they use fire like that so it doesn't really know shit yeah and they just found that out within the last decade or so so I mean how many of them were out there how many other ones were out there that we just don't have fossils up and when you talk to a guy like Graham Hancock who has that amazing book right there called America before fuck that's a good book I can't find even evidence about ten thousand years ago seems to be the most agreed-upon ten thousand potential for for spoken link that's no shit I only have evidence that goes back too far there's people that say it probably should go back as far back as sixty thousand years but I don't believe there have any evidence to that to support that how would you that's the problem is to when they developed the larynx the voice box I think they they trace it to that you know that's the problem with history right it's like who knows what the fuck Lincoln said all we know is what Lincoln wrote okay when you have Lincoln holding hands with his boyfriend going for a walk through the garden bitch you just making shit up you make that a thing now love there are there is speculation that Abraham Lincoln was a gay man and they slept with a man for long periods of time in the same bed but apparently people did that very often back then for warmth because you know you lived in a place that was made out of wood that you chopped down your fucking self should have been for four years oh listen I scold for four years in a row I'd be tough to share a bed with Lincoln he was fucking huge yeah he's all strong too it's a wrestler was he yeah huh yeah he was an excellent wrestler suppose and he shared a bed with his uh captain captain of his bodyguards whenever his wife was away hip hop array so maybe hey it might be both me no we have to you know think about it in context right I think if you go back to the Greeks and the Romans gay sex was way more common I mean it was like almost like everybody was half gay right see Hannah and pedophilia was just a normal thing young boys like if you read Socrates you read the history of him or of a lot of scholars and like really respected thinkers they had young boys mm-hmm but they would bang so what was what today is a horrific crime against humanity was completely normal back then yeah so when did that stop when did do is to stop banging dudes and did they just kind of do it and not talk about it or was it it seems like Christianity first brought about the shame the sexual shame that we have today so I would probably trace it back to like 2,000 years ago if you how here's the question how much of being gay is stopped by society's expectations like 1 is the percentage of people who are actually gay who just can't act on it because it just it but their mom or their religion or their church they go to or they're you know they got married and they had kids but they really want to be gay how much of that exists today look what percentage out of all all the gay activity if you could put it on a pie chart you have many more gay people would there be if that didn't there was just no one form - yeah there's no expectations from religion no expectations from your community hi bien would you fuck yeah do you think you'd be a top or a bottom top that's what everybody thinks I'd be a screaming bottom crying I'd be a running bottom it'd be just like when you're waterboarded you'd be fuckin the spasming uncontrollably [Laughter] there's that that's what a lot of the guys are into unfortunately just sets the bigotry community waterboard he's a runner got fucked getting butt-fucked by waterboarding it's the new black it's the new thing yeah it's the rage it's all the rage nipple clamps and mmm did you ever watch orange is the new black a couple times was it any good it's not bad I just I mean I felt like the characters were a little too over overdrawn I didn't buy them as real people too much they seemed like it felt like a writer coming up with a character as opposed to like really trying to portray human behavior but then again I've never been in a women's prison my mom worked in a women's prison for years dude really yeah and she talked about they were all Vic and we were talking about earlier about um you know women who were abused and every fucking one of them was abused sexually physically almost all of them are in jail because of a guy they were carrying drugs for a guy they stay fuckin killed a guy because he kept attacking her it was pretty rare you know and a lot of it was obviously drug use but that stems from usually childhood abuse yeah but that but up for a lot of them my mom said it was the best environment they'd ever lived in because there was a solidarity among a lot of the women there was a lot of support there was education there were support groups you know and and they developed relationships with women without men around mhm and so they were able to foster and nurture real female empowered relationships that's so sad and cool at the same time yeah right it's sad but it's like well it's nice that something is working out for the like women in jail seem didn't have a way better time of it than men in jail just seems like a better deal I think so you probably not getting beat up as much isn't there a new reality show about women in jail with her following these women it's not just women most of them I saw that's called jailbirds on Netflix so Washington yes that's right is that good so bad yeah it follows them in like the Sacramento Jail like the weather in holding her it seems like there's so many fucking shows about people in jail that it must be like prisoners must get agents now oh my like get off for a second offer from MSNBC for lockup Greg they like you but they'd like you to just get some face tattoos do you think you'd be good you know they'll put you on yeah hey Andy right okay any bad guys show think of NES guys in jail Greg Fitzsimmons got that from them we're giving you a two-year option but I'm only in here for one you follow golf right yeah I wanted to talk to you about this because it's so ridiculous I saw this guy got suspended from his serious golf show because he was talking about the LPGA and he goes who who's gonna win the LPGA he goes let me go out on a limb and say it's gonna be a Korean he's apparently Koreans went a lot of 70% of the LPGA is Korean that's crazy something he said he goes pick a name he goes is Italy how many leads do we have that entered and it's like six Li's six leaves because their six leads they said he was racist and sexist and they suspended him for those comments like first of all it's not bad to win okay when he's saying who he thinks gonna win probably a Korean well that's good that means that Koreans kick ass at golf that's not fucking racist right it's not racist to say that it's also not racist to say maybe their name is Lee cuz there's a lot of Lee's that's not racist that's accurate it turns out there were six Lee's yeah like come on folks we're not saying anything bad you're talking about something that everybody loves which is golf yeah you all love it that's why you're listening to golf radio and you've had an impoverished country that is found a way like black people found boxing or Irish guys found the fucking police force like you find something to rise up out of well Koreans work hard I mean guarantee that's part of it yeah that's part it's a part of the culture I had a very good friend of mine that I've talked to my main times of this podcast who was a u.s. national champ while he was in medical school national Taekwondo Channel and I realized how hard some people scream oh yeah Jung sook Chang that was his dance yeah great guy one of my favorite people I've ever met I loved him to death I don't know why it's women but in men's golf and men's golf is very international now it's never had more players from around the world but not a lot of Koreans it was like a Japanese guy who's way up top and and there's another Korean guys good but nothing like LPGA that's interesting I don't know anything about I didn't know anything about Koreans in golf before I saw that but we have to make a differentiation between something that is about a race and something that's racist yeah this is not negative you're literally talking about a positive thing they're winners you want to win no you want to win you're trying to win right well they win a lot they're awesome at it yeah it's not they're not cheating they're just kicking ass they're better at golf yeah and some of them are namely there's nothing racist here this is not rare upset because the ratings for the LPGA are way down they want to see Americans playing so there's like yeah it's a big issue because so meanings you think his attitude is racist because he's like mocking it because koreans winning it so he doesn't care I don't know no I don't think it's his intention I think there's a sensitivity about it because it's become an issue I get that I get that that makes sense but it just doesn't make sense if you're just going off what he said well what he said I what I'm getting is you're being super fucking sensitive with how you how you treat people that are talking about winners yeah like that's the case with Filipinos and pool Filipinos are some of the greatest pool players of all time some of my all-time favorite pool players are from the Philippines Francisco Bustamante Efrain Rhea's Rodolfo Lou watt Alex pakya lion some of the greatest of all time Dennis are cool oh all those guys were Filipino there's at the top of the food chain man when you saw those guys playing a tournament like fuck like you knew they were winning yeah I mean F and Reyes want everything Bustamante want everything he's got murderers and if you said like who's gonna win this tournament probably a Filipino everybody would start laughing well yeah probably there wouldn't be a negative it'd be a positive yeah they're the some of the best in the world at pool that's not racist that's accurate yeah now what is it with it with MMA what are what are the big nationalities that's a good question Russians the Russians are murdering it right now there's a lot of badass Russia's wherever what life is hard I'm gonna find fighters and you're gonna find people that survive where life is hard and thrive and then that's how you get like a khabib nurmagomedov you got a hard motherfucker who knows how to fight and then it scares shit same thing with Conor McGregor you get a hard neighborhood a hard life you know growing up in Dublin dangerous fighting since he was young you know that's how you get these beasts and then but a lot of American MMA guys come from wrestling or the military right yeah some of them some of them from the military you know it's rare you know we had special forces guy like Kennedy of course is probably the most famous Brian Stann also military veteran and you look at these guys that are you know the the guys that are capable of being seals or Rangers or Green Berets they're just elite humans they're just the people that know how to do things and push themselves in a way that other people don't sometimes that translates over the fighting sometimes doesn't yeah you know sometimes they just don't have the physical capability of it like they might have the mindset to survive war and the ability to get through buds and to get through grueling physical training but you ain't beaten John Jones you know like there's just levels to this thing there's genetic levels you know John Jones says like some of the best genetics ever and then uses them as good as anybody that's ever existed best at controlling distance of all time he's got two brothers or NFL players so this like super genetics and they're right both his brothers are NFL stars that's amazing and he's the baddest light heavyweight of all time any smart so it's not just physical it's also intellectual he's also sets traps for people he measures them he sees what they're doing and he fails him weakening he pressures and puts heavy pressure on people he knows when to ebb and flow he's just a genius at fighting do lightweights have longer careers no no I would say the opposite I would say the bigger guys actually have they can compete at a higher level deep into their 30s and even 40s a grand eco-tour I think I think here even the heavyweight title when he was 42 checkers I would think there's be more knockouts with heavyweights is a lot of knockouts with every ways but they their bodies maintain what got them to the dance later in life like George Foreman George Foreman won the heavyweight title I think he was 46 when he knocked out Michael Moore so oldest ever heavyweight champion and that's just unheard of at welterweight you're not gonna see 46 year old welterweights winning the world title against Earl Spencer jr. something like that you just not gonna see that 43 he was 43 Randy was yeah and find out how old George Foreman was when he knocked out Michael Moore so that's crazy that's crazy old 43 yeah you don't see that 125 pounds you just don't you just don't 125 pounds no one wins the title at 43 so just the mass almost helps you survive something like that I also think they lose less as they get older he was 44 45 so yeah George form was the oldest ever heavyweight champion at 45 crazy Wow you know like that is so unusual as like a middleweight the only one who maintained a world championship caliber skill set deep into his 40s was Bernard Hopkins and Archie Moore when Archie Moore was younger and was you know we're talking about the rocky marciano days that was he fought deep into his 40s as well but he was just a real crafty veteran he actually also trained George Foreman which is very interesting so like that crafty veteran trained George Foreman to be a crafty veteran yeah and maintain his power he had a real unusual remember but George Foreman used to almost like put his hands up like he didn't know how to fight yeah almost like that but that was his defense he would move forward like this because he was so big he was such an enormous man with these enormous arms so when he would stack them on top of each other and walk towards you like that it was his weird offense and he learned that from Archie Moore that's part of the part of his defense and holding his hands up in a weird way he learned from Archie Moore right well you know the oldest hockey player in the NHL is the also the biggest six foot eight the guy is a Dana Chara Colin's 43 what's that name what is his name Zidane Achara what Slovakian yeah he that dude is from the Lord of the Rings listen to that name they gave birth to him in a meadow they rode a horse out there it was destiny they predicted how long I was yeah this that name in Viking he's an animal and he fights I saw oh yeah I saw this one fight where he hit a guy and the guy kind of took a dive and he he leaned down and picked him up with one hand and started punching him with the other lifted him off the ice on hand yeah I saw one thing that a guy did that's really fucked up a guy hip tossed a dude he judo threw him like he swept him like he grabbed ahold of him swept his leg out kicked his leg out like a chi mata and slammed his fucking head onto the ground he's rough yeah yeah I was like man that ain't the same as fighting like you you know you're on ice yeah no one's told him he couldn't do it right but he used some really fucking sneaky shit yeah you know yeah they fighting and they need chat is funny there's a there's really great clips of guys talking to each other before fights mmm and it's amazingly calm they literally go like hey you want to go and the guy will be like y'all go and then they fight and then they three and then as soon as one the other guy goes yeah they just throw their gloves down and they start fighting it's all it's all part of the game it's all fucking orchestrated and there's players that fight and there's players that don't and if you're on it if you're on the ice with another goon then it's it's expected that you guys are gonna fight at some point yeah what a crazy way to make a living bare-knuckle fighting a slippery floor yeah but you know they don't they don't get hit that much because they get the jersey up they do they get hit enough though yeah I've been watching dudes who have skills now you're seeing way more guys who have boxing skills all right doing this yeah guys who like laying like short uppercuts right f talks where you like oh my god I gotta turn that punch over that guy knows how to punch yeah there's not as many over hands when you're all you're doing the overhead in the guy in the helmet with your fists yeah the flailing sometimes you don't see that sometimes you've seen guys who throw fucking straight punches in like yeah alright you don't know how to fight it and then this guy knows how to do that while he's out yeah this one look at this boom boom vest in my house at home wow that's a good ko while he's holed and then he gives him one why he's going down and then he goes down he's out cold boom boom yeah right from the shoulder oh yeah that guy can punch Hey and he's you're punching in the face while he's punching you in the face - it's chaos it's a terrible way to play not only a great fighter one of the best players in the league and also and also a great fighter Wow that's a crazy sport man doesn't get enough love yeah yeah get the average person name a famous hockey players currently playing I know this is the same guy this crazy thing happened this year this is an insane video to watch I can't show it every people at home I might have seen this but the puck literally flies and hits him right in the face and he barely moves as it might have should show it again in slow motion right here you check to see if his teeth got knocked out oh man you got bucked right in the mug yeah bro that is hard wow that guy can take it fuck it do you know the fucking Bruins and actually dropped Game one last night against the Blues but the Bruins are set to win the Stanley Cup which means Boston will win the fucking Super Bowl the World Series and the Stanley Cup in one year I remember when we lived there they couldn't win yeah it was like they had such a fury already complex yeah and they would get close like the Celtics are good at Larry Bird and Danny they have it forever cuz like what was last time though the Yankees won the World Series how long ago was that she's 2008 so it's been 11 years I know I could be way off on that but they still have it there's still the Yankees you know yeah but for the Red Sox they never pulled it off and then that Bill Buckner thing Bill Buckner just died I know so sad so and that's the thing about being a boy because I grew up a Mets fan we had season tickets to the Mets since I was a little kid and so when they get into the World Series and I was going to school in Boston surrounded by Massholes watching these fucking games and they're just I'm sorry if you're from Boston take it the fuck easy about your sports they're so loud like like like last night with the with the Bruins game they they boo the entire they introduced the Blues they boo every fuckin player it's just it's barbaric they're animals so then fuckin Buckner who's this storied amazing player who's a journeyman he's been out there forever they put him at first base he used to be an outfielder but he he slowed down I think he had bad legs or something I put him at first base he gets a fucking ball hit to him it it took a bad hop watched the video it took a bad hop and he missed it and they fucking there were death threats they dropped him that year he went down a pot Tucket in Rhode Island playing the miners they showed up there and fucking terrorized them he had to move out to like Arizona to hide because these fucking Boston fans I remember people walk in the streets what year was that eighty 46 City six I remember people walking the streets they'd just be walking around the neighborhood with their hands in their hair like fuck yeah after they lost fuck yes walk in the street yeah yeah we're so mad it was all anybody wanted to talk about alright because they hadn't won a World Series since 2017 or something it was crazy I was already 2019 17 yeah 1917 I was already over baseball at that point I wasn't interested in baseball anymore so for me it was really fascinating to watch yeah watch these people cuz I had gone from caring about baseball to being obsessed with martial arts and that was in the trend like I got obsessed with martial arts in like 81 so by the time 86 rolled around like what the fuck are you people paying attention to yeah some guy dropped a ball you're gonna be okay yeah what is this not only that but that same year I believe it was that same year the the Mets that same year that paid the Patriots lost to the Bears in a Super Bowl and they got it was one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history oh yeah they were riding off of that - it was rough times times for Boston yeah I I don't want to live there because I can't deal with the cold I'm too much of a pussy these days yeah but I love those fucking animals Oh Boston's the best love boss they're different yeah yeah yeah their characters the different growing up there I think for both of us like to start and to start our comedy careers there I think was insanely valuable yeah because they're not taking any bullshit there they're not they're not taking any half-assed act slow and meandering and self-absorbed not happening now and it's still like that still like I was just there and it's like they don't here's what here's what it is when you walk on stage in Boston the audience doesn't automatically by default give you credit for being in charge right you have to earn it every time yeah your first joke first joke in Boston is fucking clutch you got to get up there and get a laugh fast yeah it's fucking cold there in the winter it makes that's right it makes people that know how to get past that fucking hump yeah that's a three month hump where it sucks you remember that yeah it's brutal number it's fucking windy down the stitches fucking calm EV it's fucking freeway ting for the joy just trembling while you wait for the train outdoors I'm gonna fuck an underground subway no outside yeah they smush together but it's freezing every time the door opens what's fucking freezing fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck yeah get in your car in the morning to start it like fuck okay so cold and they also have the it says it's an immigrant city too you know they had all the Italians and the Irish they all came in and they fucking fought it out over real estate where they were gonna live who's gonna get the Union jobs and it created a very tough that's it's like Philly or the Bronx there's just cities where they had that that fighting at the turn of the century yeah I think it's that it was the magical ingredient for stand-up that's part of the magical ingredient the magical ingredient wasn't just that there was guys like Barry Crimmins and Lenny Clarke and Steve Sweeney and Don Gavin and Mike Donovan and all these brilliant comedians that we saw that we were so lucky to see it was also that they they were being their audiences were savages yeah so they're like great how about another joke you know great how about another one like they'll keep coming you come with the jokes okay jokes like they want joke joke joke like those guys like when you'd watch like Lenny Clarke murder a room there was no no one's getting a break there's no breathing yeah you're just getting pounded yeah he's just smashing it those guys developed in that style where people just were constantly wanting to be amused like let's go look you know what the fucking meandering yeah they wanted wanted want it with attitude they went an anti-authoritarian attitude it was always like I remember Kenny Rogers joke of like I remember I'm not saying I was drinking a lot but I I drove into a lake got pulled over by the Coast Guard they said I you've been drinking I go I'm gonna lake [Music] it was always just fuck you to it though you know yeah everything was like so I'm doing a bump yeah anything was like doing lines and drinking and chaos yeah John Tobin who runs the left Boston he's telling me the story he's a fucking if you ever want to hear Gavin stories for an hour straight go to lunch with John Tobin and bring a fucking handkerchief cuz he's got Don Gavin stories he's sucking about had Gavin who likes to drink White Russians does a Late Show and goes up there and repeats a joke and he walks off stage and one of the comedians goes uh Don you said the same joke twice up there and he goes record six six times oh my god how drunk are you like on death's door you're like rubbing your face on the door yeah but it's also they're not giving a shit that he didn't give a fuck he still didn't give a fuck last time I saw him still Don Gavin yeah as a slow down drinking one hand big smile on his face he's always been my favorite he's one of the greatest of all time yeah my opinion yeah what from what I've seen I mean he was so sharp in the 80s in the early 90s when we were around he was so sharp he his punchlines would come one after the other and you didn't see him come in and they would just catch off-guard little offbeat punchlines yeah yeah we'll throw ways yeah like throwaway line that was like that some of the funny shit you ever heard yeah that that whole bit that used to do about going to a salad bar oh yeah oh my god yeah he was a murderer he goes up front they got chickpeas in the back he got the lobster giving you the finger which is so lucky man we're so lucky we got to experience that because I think it's so different out here now like where we're at now is like like if comedy was an education what we're hanging around with a bunch of tenured professors right in LA yeah yeah everyone's got tenure everyone's like you know whether it's Jeselnik or you know Neil Brandon are you or what this is just a gang of headliners like a swamp of headliners but when we were doing it man it was so uncertain there was not there was not that thing where there was like this established community of like nationally touring stand-up comedians that you were around all the time you didn't know nobody had any TV credits nobody any TV crap one headliner it was all about and the beauty of it was it was a total meritocracy because you there were guys like you know Gavin ass we there was there were half a dozen guys that could draw yeah and the rest of us were hired because there was a comedy night somebody fucking hand drew comedy on a sign and put it in front of a Chinese restaurant and you showed up and you got booked because the Booker thought you could kill it's all that mattered was that you could do a good job and said can you do it credits you have not fucking Twitter account you have once you got credit so then you could do the road that was the difference yeah to get out of Boston you needed a credit yeah when you're doing the road they all wanted to know what TV show you've been on they all wanted to know that yeah have you done comedy spotlight what about a half hour comedy hour have you done this and if you had HBO special holy shit yeah that was the bomb diggity you were headlining every club you wanted to yes guys got an HBO special but back then everyone that we knew had nothing I remember Budd Friedman came to town in the early 90s when it was evening at The Improv was like the original remember the strip shot stand-up comedy show that put it on them put any on the map it was their first big show I remember he came to town there was a showcase at Duck Soup and we all we all went up and then Budd Friedman who fucking great guy takes us all out to dinner afterwards and sits us down and he goes goes through each of us he goes you did a great job you need a little bit more work I like that bit you do and he gets a day Fitzgerald and he goes you got it you're doing the show and we were just all like Fitzgerald is one people thought they forgot about he was very funny yeah he was great very funny tight great drinking stories yeah he's another guy that found his stage legs during alcoholics Anonymous meetings right there's a few those guys it's like yeah you know you know they say they say you gotta a meetings in the end up just getting addicted to coffee yeah I never walked out of a Dunkin Donuts with a wildebeest on my arm my um my my and the more Boston accent you had in Boston the more they loved you yeah you know hey Lenny was the only one who had legitimate credits because at that time like even in the 80s Lenny had already been on Rodney Dangerfield special THP oh yeah yeah I think when I worked with them it was after he had been on Rodney Dangerfield's like I had Lenny on like three weeks ago four weeks ago he was a fucking hilarious he's still so funny man yeah he's all healthy now totally sober exercises but I opened up for him like the second time I ever got paid and I think it was after he had already been on HBO I think it was like right afterwards so he was literally partying with Kennison and he was in the middle of like his his run where he started got his television show out here he talked about that - about how he got ripped off his agents stole all of his money no shit you don't know that story now I'll send you the link fine I don't want to repeat the story cuz you I don't you want to hear him say wow there was a big scandal those his I think was called spotlight agency I forget what the yes spotlight number they stole everybody's money yep yeah they stole everybody's money got one agent just yeah a lot of colleges and stuff but but there's a story about how Jim McCauley who booked the Tonight Show forever he said it he'd heard about Boston and he's like and they're telling him and this is back in like maybe the mid-80s and they're telling him about how you got to go to Boston and all the great comics were in Boston that you got to you know talk about all the names we just said so he sets up a showcase at the what was that dead Chinese restaurant that was like the original room which one Kowloon no beef oh the ding ho ding ho yeah they set up a showcase of the ding ho and all the guys come down and they're in the greenroom and they're drinking they're doing blow they're cracking each other up and they all go up there and they do fucking you know local references and they're doing jokes about the Boston accent and McCall is just sitting there going what the fuck is going on here and then Steven Wright goes up and he does Steven Wright and and they find out a couple days later nobody got it except Steven Wright and Steven Wright at that time Lennie told him I think it was Lenny one of them sat Steven Wright down and goes Steve you're a sweet guy you're a terrific kid this isn't for you because he used to bomb in Boston because he was he was monotone and you know he was doing his shtick and it didn't play in Boston oh yeah it did for these guys they told him you should stop and then he got The Tonight Show they fly them out he does a set Johnny liked him so much they said can you stay another week did another spot and in that first year he must have done for tonight's shows and he became fucking huge and got a special out of it and they're all sitting at home going like I fucking killed that night yeah whoops telling them that to quit that's hilarious yeah comedy had only been around for 30 years yeah you tell him to quit nobody knows how to do it yet right you don't imagine I'm I'm an expert in this you gotta quit like nobody nobody can really tell you that you can never figure it out cuz comedy is not that different than anything else and then if you really put a lot of time and effort and attention to it you get better at it mm-hmm so if you got any laughs at all you can get you might not be doing it the right way but that's part of the process right yeah I think George Carlin said no matter how bad a comedian is there's always one joke and his act that I go god I wish I wrote that joke and if you have that one joke it means you're capable of writing one yes and sometimes your life changes and it puts you in a different space that makes you a better comedian whether it's your performance or your writing but we go and comedy is it's a you're displaying what's going on inside of you when you're on stage on some level your anger your fear whatever it is it comes out in your performance yeah and so if something changes fundamentally and you're like sometimes it's getting married sometimes your father dies whatever you see people change they get sober and they can they can suddenly get good yeah it can happen if it's like anything else in your life if you run into someone they lost 100 pounds like what the fuck you lost a hundred pounds how did you do it I just made a change I just decided I'm not doing that anymore I'm gonna live my life different and then I started riding that momentum and then here we are all right 16 months later yeah that could happen with anything I remember Jim Norton when he started wasn't that funny struggled and all sudden boom found his voice he's fuckin great yeah it's weird when someone can't find their voice right it's like there's that uncertainty of life yeah it's gonna work out yeah I wasted my time then you find it yeah or not or not you know and again it's dependent also about how good are you at recognizing when you fuckin up how good at you are do you gloss over mistakes or do you examine them and learn from them yeah because if you gloss over god damn it takes forever to figure it out cuz you got to play little games with yourself and pretend you didn't do bad so if you didn't do bad you don't feel bad if you don't feel bad you're not gonna change yeah that's part of the reason that exists that that horrible feeling when you fuck something up like that is so that's the the back that's the biological buzz like hey fuckface you lost this is bad figure this out but if you can lie to yourself you don't feel that Bob did fart it was amazing I was really the crowd sucked well that's why getting sober can can affect that change because that's ultimately what sobriety is you know if you have a problem you keep lying yourself when you go you know I'm fine it was just last night I'm not gonna do that again yeah or you can say it was that crowd and then you know you'll see them struggle in some sort of weird way but comedy is it's so a band follow depending on day to day it's like talking to people you know you talking to people on a day-to-day basis like the people are different day to day they subtly this way or that way and when you get enough people in a fucking room and they drink and it's weird and then maybe you're a little tired and then it comes off strange like god that's that sucked I need to get another set under my belt and then the next set you're like boy I don't want it to be like that last set so I'm gonna fire the fuck up and then oh this one was good good good and we relaxed now just I don't have to work that hard oh sorry yeah motherfucker and you're like okay we're playing this game are we yeah that's the process yeah and if there I never have a better set than after a bad set yeah always you're on your toes yeah I try to play a little game with myself where I pretend I just ate shit oh really where I go and say the protons just ate shit no a chance to redeem myself let's go Wow yeah I play little games with myself sometimes I had last night I had a who was sitting in the crowd Oh Andy Kindler was sitting in the crowd with son of a bitch Andy and I love out there oh and uh Harlan Williams who are both like such interesting comedians that they're watching me and you feel I usually don't give a fuck who's watching me but last night was the Improv and that was like nobody there and I felt like I can't mail it in with a regular set I got to fuck around here a little bit and I had just had a fucking great set because it it made me dig in a little yes yes that's one of the really good aspects about the Comedy Store these days - is it as always people that you respect in the room yeah there's always one there right know is always a lot of whites there you know they complement the other night on one of my jokes that felt nice yeah the Sebastian's a guy that struggled struggled titty or her Leone got a hard time a hard time finding his voice and I didn't get a chance to see how good he had become and I watched him on Showtime in a hotel room in Vegas I was there for UFC or something watched Sebastiao Showtime special and I was like god damn this is good I think I tweeted about it either tweeted it or I emailed him I don't remember which I was like that is fucking he's fucking good yeah he's really good I watched him at the store the other night I mean Jesus he is bigger than life up there he just dominates the room she's very good and it took a while took a while for him to find that thing and I it happened while I was a was not around the company stores I really couldn't didn't get a chance to see his sets so before it was funny he was funny but he would have good sets and bad sets he was kind of struggling a little bit hmm but they he found it yeah just took his time worked hard always hustled found it to Jessel next last special so fucking good he's so good I mean it's like I've always liked them I've always enjoyed what and I don't watch people's whole hour rarely but I've always watched his whole hours his writing is just so like intensely it's he's a craftsman he works hard and there is 2013 Ducati special hotel room laughed my ass off let's podcast you sexy bitch yeah that was that was 2013 I had been still out of the store I'd been out of store for like at that point shit that was on six years I hadn't been the store in six yeah special was excellent I just love guys like him and and and Harlin's what one of those guys to that there comedy is very specific to them like Brody was a great example that Brody's comma is so specific to Brody like if you see eight one eight to like die like why is that funny to you but to you without you like you immediately got a smile thinking about Brody saying it cuz calmly was so specific to him I was a male model in Pakistan I was on the cover of camel beet oh he was so funny we would ask him to do those jokes - and please do the male-model joke like you'd yell out some Brody did you ever do any modeling funny ask ya Rogen supportive aegyo Brody how did you get to the store tonight La Cienega North took it to San Vicente he would just say names of roads in LA for five minutes and it was funny for whatever reason yeah god I miss that guy he was like to me it was always like he was trying to make people laugh and he was also trying to blow himself up he was trying to fill himself up yeah he was like he was doing self affirmations with this comedy he wasn't boasting he was trying to convince himself that he was good enough to be up there forever in my office I had a photo a laminated photo that said Office Depot employee of the month and it was Brody and he took this photo it was like what he was using as a headshot it's I kept it just to give me a smile I was riding I put it up on my little cork board so you can find that man I needed to get another one of those I don't know what the fuck happened to it when he died I've never seen I don't think I've ever seen a turnout for a comedian dying said it the way that laminated in my office please do me a favor and print that up and let's get it get that turned into another one that I put in my office cuz I somewhere in the move from this studio from the old studio this studio I lost it but I always had that in my office was just to look at just cuz Brody was just so Brody yeah he was just open raw and he you know he was one of those guys where you really have to be there you have to see him yeah like it's um he's he's not he doesn't translate no one translates 100 that's a dirty little secret about comedy specials you don't translate a hundred percent of what you're experiencing when you're in that room that's why your writing has to be even sharper and your act outs have to be even sharper everything has to be tightened down because you're not experienced the physical presence of all the audience members and the comedian all in this room together because it's an intangible right so if like going to see you live at the Wilbur theater if that's a hundred percent watching you on Netflix it's like 80 percent yeah the take away all the other people there's no other people there it's just you you can pretend they're there but they're not there so you don't have that feeling of being in a public place with a bunch of other people which lights you up and then you don't have the comic that you came to see right in front of you you don't have that yeah you don't have the air you're all sharing the same air you're all in the room together you feel each other in some sort of a weird way so it's like 20% of every show but with brilliance of the momentum of like if you cut if you come to a comedy show you're surrounded by people that have an agenda to laugh they got a babysitter they paid money they sat down they are motivated you laugh and so now you're surrounded by if you're the Wilbur theater you have a thousand people that all have that energy together you're sitting in your underwear under a blanket on a couch watching a show yeah it's it's eighty percent though for the most part yeah maybe might be in the seventies seventy-nine percent what's the best stand-up comedy special of all time in your mind there error dependent the thing about them is none of them really last they're not its comedies one of the most rapidly depreciating art forms in the culture in terms of its staying power try try and watch a movie we loved in the 80s yeah try to watch a comedy movie let's go why are you showing me garbage yeah a few of them stand-up blues Blues Brothers or yeah but does it really it stands up because it's a classic but if it came out today would it be that much of a classic probably not probably not things change they evolve yeah in comedy they evolve rapidly and they're unforgiving like I always say Lenny Bruce who I think is the main guy that started this whole thing hmm he started it I mean there was other guys that were kind of doing it you know there's more it's all there's a few guys who are dealing you know some similar stuff I'm sure that didn't become famous but as far as guys that became famous at that time who were genuinely regarded almost universally as being brilliant comedians Lenny Bruce was the mack daddy like he was a guy who did all the television shows he did all those shows and they wanted him to come on and he was brilliant he would go on there with a great material and it was clean and then he'd morphed you know he just kept expanding and morphing and he got more into drugs and just started just just at the end of his career was really losing his fucking mind there was just fighting these obscenity cases yeah and he was talking on stage there's videos of him you could watch videos of him of that he could buy that I bought VHS tapes up back in the day where he would read the transcripts of his trial on stage and people would like tell jokes yeah come on where's the fucking jokes like in the end he just completely went off the rails right but his his steps I think were the first steps of modern stand-up comedy so anything he did was the greatest thing of all time back then and you watch it now at all no neither there's a lot of other prior holds up prior holds out yeah prior holds up liam hicks holds up but in a weird way yeah hicks holds up in a way where you're you're realizing like wow this guy was doing some shit that no one else was doing back then hmm a young man on acid realized that life is just you know you know the whole bit that he does make positive stories in the in the news ya member exactly had a bit worse but it's hilarious but that's a brilliant bit yeah well-crafted bit he had a lot of those old people should do stunts in movies yes yeah those yeah I mean he had some great shit man they were great bits he was a different guy what he did is he like made people in the audience think about ideas that he probably wouldn't have thought about if not for his act and he challenged you to be smarter like though there's part of that one of the things that Hicks was doing it's like he was it's like Kennison went this way right Kinnison was like Ronald Reagan's the fucking president who were gonna kick ass you know he went but he was also smart and he had great points like the only reason why that bid the African people that were starving to death that bit about those late night television shows which is one of his darkest bits ever and one of his best bits but this it it worked because he was smart because he had points that were irrefutable it wasn't just these African kids starving to death let me tell you what's funny about that nothing's funny about that it was him saying why don't you feed him you're right there mmm and then and then he would have these kind of bits that were fucked up but there were so well crafted you later Jesus this guy this is so good and so for then he was the greatest of all time when Kennedy came along man he was a motherfucker yeah no one had ever seen anything like that before yeah I remember how much you were affected by him you and Mike McDonald he was fuckin Mike McCarthy Mike McCarthy yeah comedy Barbaria yeah yeah yeah we both were huge Kinison fans didn't we could well he just made me think oh that's comedy - I didn't know you could do that that's a different thing this guy's scream it I was married twice and he was fat he had a beret on overcoat he would come into the stern show drunk after being up at night and do without a doubt the best Stern appearances of all time oh yeah you know his story - right do you know that were each alright you know what would flipped him though what head injury hit by a car no shit up him and Roseanne both the same story Wow yeah there's something about traumatic brain injuries that lead to a lot of people being extremely impulsive and they wind up doing a lot of wild shit dude J mellow themselves yeah he had some kind of a brain thing happened to him and he needed he got treated for it and he recovered but that's when he started acting kind of erratic whoa yeah it happens people get irrational and you get impulsive get very impulsive happens with ex football players X Fighters right but that's what happened to Sammy get hit by a car his brother wrote a book about it called brother Sam his brother Bill and that's one of the things he talks about like Sam was like this normal kid gets hit by a fucking car and then also DS is wild man like a wild demon no control yeah just didn't give a fuck right you know that's a guy that I wish I met like fuck god damn a little oh I really wanted to meet that we met Hicks though we didn't mean heck yeah we silly song we were in the room with him we didn't hang out with him I said hi to him oh yeah I always think of that one like a young comic comes to the green room to say hi to me I always think fucking be nice to this kid because this means more to him than you can imagine yeah just the fact it Hicks acknowledge I was alive yeah yeah we got we got an amazing comedy education my friend yeah it's so lucky to have a job where you could say what you want to and you don't have to worry like that poor lpg a guy cork golf guy gets suspended well especially now because like it really TV doesn't matter being banned from TV doesn't end your career anymore no you know look at fucking Jim Jeffries says some shit that's fucking crazy he says this whole bit about rape that's like I couldn't believe they was on Sirius XM radio the other day mm-hmm and like you know whose show got canceled he's got another fucking show but without those it doesn't matter you get you get your shit up on the internet you do a podcast you tour you don't ever have to do the Tonight Show again you don't have to do you know yeah there was only a few albums back then yeah so they should be good yeah you just have to be interesting we're not even man there's a lot of fucking people that just do makeup tutorials they make millions the world's it's crazy yeah don't think that it supposed to be fair like all those guys back in Boston hey what the fuck I killed that night same thing yeah I don't think this world supposed to be fair this thing is not this thing no one else what the fuck is going on this kid is making thirty million dollars reviewing toys on YouTube yep that's just how it is because he loves toys and that's when he started doing what do you love is just that's how it is are you getting upset about that doesn't help anybody yeah yeah the kid makes 30 million reviewing toys go figure it out do you think yeah don't get a mad at the kid fuck that kid yeah I got money I just want one million year at all from you come on kid hey he would give it to me you're not even use it you're seven I was a veteran yeah it's some veteran reviewing toys online get 12y boy is for good little queers this fucking doll this little doll this fucking soldier never saw the shit I saw the shit yeah this is this fake GI Joe bullshit fucking soldier yeah what what is the next thing like it's not veterans reviewing toys it's not gonna be that but what would be the next thing the next thing so I think it's got to be it's got to be something that that like lets people interact more that's what people are looking for I mean you got social apps but how do you take a social app and make it something that you sit down and watch every day as programming it's what you do what's the clip show or what's the who's the host that can take social media and do like what talk soup did with with video clip with cable cable TV shows yeah how do you capture social media and presented to people in a way that is more linear well the thing is like everybody's sort of agreeing that social media is insanely addictive and that people are sort of in denial about it most people have a real issue with it yeah most people that I know are addicted to their phones their stare at their phones all day they can't help it they're drawn to the next text message they want the next twit tweet whatever it is yeah they want to see that next Facebook post an Instagram post they're addicted to it and what what we're doing is making it more more addictive they're making it better right everything keeps getting better the cameras keep getting better the apps are better the algorithms they figure out how long it should take to reload and to move to another page and when to present the next the next graphic that all that stuff is the same guys have figured out how slot machine should work in Vegas to keep you putting quarters into them yeah they figure out how often you need to win and how loud the bells should be and then they extract your data right and then they sell that data and then they make infinite amounts of money and they want to keep you on the tit and so they're gonna keep that tit juicy yeah all kinds of new stuff what about these anti-vaxxers they're moving into your neighborhood what fuck they are yeah next thing you know you're embroiled in a facebook anti-vaccine it keeps you up in the middle of the night you go back to check the post what the fuck did you write the fuck did he write oh yeah it's gonna go to sleep and now I'm gonna let him know oh my cute my piece of my mind how many people are just ready to blow their fucking brains out stand in front of a computer at night and arguments with people on Facebook yeah first of all that is one of the worst ways to communicate I understand that it's a really effective way to communicate but just text messages just text just writing things back it's like one of the crudest ways that we know it's you might as well send a raven yeah really right wrap a fucking a piece of paper around that Ravens foot and send it and I'll read it when I okay this is what he means yeah like we could talk to each other now like it's we should limit the amount of texting we do I really think well what about video texts yeah I didn't see much of that oh my god hey Joe what's happened to man give me a call later send that's cuz you're white yesterday Wiz Khalifa was here and he was saying that everybody face times now oh yeah and I know this for a fact cuz I was taking a shit when killer Mike FaceTime to me so he is also a member what prestigious community and yeah he's they're fucking there FaceTime each other now yes I'm four yeah that's great that's better yeah that's better that's connecting everybody yeah that's Ben oh you called me on the phone yesterday yes and you were like that's it I'm done with texting I'm only calling it and I was like yeah I'm doing that no she oh he gets offended and almost angry if you email them I mean I'll text people details for things and addresses like that but if it's somebody I like I like I mean I'm going to talk to him yes and there's another thing that's happened when you keep in touch with people with text you realize how rarely you talk to them on the phone you know and there's a few of my friends that I hardly ever see yeah so I've been trying to make time for like dinner plans go to hang out with you know friends and just just instead of us always working yeah so like I'm always every like plan that I make in terms of what I do with my time see the family related or work-related yeah and I feel like I have got a I've got to like reach out to friends more like a one-on-one face-to-face sorta way it was this comprehensive study that started in the 1930s by Harvard University about what causes happiness and the number one thing was friendship yeah people talk about family they talk about work and you overlook community you know friendship means it's almost like like sometimes I feel like I really love my wife I got so fucking lucky she I hear her voice and I get happy when she walks in the door I jump up I want to talk to her but to the point where on a Saturday night we just go out to dinner we just go do something during the day we just hang out and sometimes I think I should be spending more time with friends you know especially since then I can talk shit about her there you go good call but you know it really it really is like you know you don't carve out that time and this this study said that gratitude and friendship by the two main things for happiness well it's great that you're married to your friend that's beautiful too right you know when you have friends when you have people that you can confide in and talk to you have different perspectives different points of view whether I mean it's it's always best if it's in your house like if it's your wife it would be amazing you know I'm very very pro getting your shit together in terms of like the way you run a relationship right like how nice are you how how well do you guys get along and I think you should extend not just to your like your spouse but also to like all your friends like how nice are your friends mmm like what how little bullshit do you give them how much compliments do you give them how much how objective are you the way you guys interact with each other how much talent you care about them yeah how often you take them for granted I think I'm a very pro analysis and I think all of us could we could do well to analyze like how we interface with each other because I think most most problems that people have they it's like one thing happens in this thing happens and that thing happens but if the first thing didn't happen would the second thing have happened if the first slight didn't happen if the first way you greeted someone it was with a big smile and a handshake and maybe a little roll the whole conversation would have rolled in a totally different way and then afterwards someone said hey I thought you were mad at Greg you know what I was but the way he came over and shook my hand and smiled at me and my coke who cares what am I worried about whereas if he came over with an attitude oh this fucking guy and then he's like all that fucking guys hasn't dropped it yet yeah yeah we're still we're still arguing about the stupid fucking thing you know I'm right no it's a half of it is the way we interact with each other right male/female boy-boy whatever the fuck it's just human beings half of the way human beings like the way things go half of it is how we interact with each other he had the energy like I go to the comedy store sometimes and if I show up and like show up three minutes before my spot and then I parked the car and I'm walking in and somebody I like will say hi to me you know I'll see you know Dov davit off or somebody haven't seen in a while and he says what's up and I kind of brush past them because I'm late fucks up the relationship that person feels like oh I thought I meant a lot to that guy right so it's like Sh I could show up early yeah I'd be and think before I walk in be available to people because you know it's it is you're right it can be very subtle how you shake someone's hand how you like don't hug them or hug them yeah yeah a friend of mine goes the other day we play beach volleyball on Sundays that's my big social things we fifteen years I've been playing with the same yeah that's great exercise too it's great and we call ourselves the shirts because we're the only guys on the beach playing with our shirts on and we're fucking terrible we never get any better and and so so we we go out and I I showed up and I hugged everybody and then this one guy Evan goes to me he goes uh you know I don't think you should hug everybody all the time I think a hug should be like for a special moment so it actually means something and I go you have any see intimacy problems and don't fucking put them on me I won't hug you but I'm fucking hugging everybody else yeah I love it I love a moment where I can hug somebody the economy store should be called the hug festival yeah right place is all about hugs everyone's always hugging everybody yeah you know it the more people that you can have like that in your life the more people that you want to hug the better off you are yeah that's you know a community of people that you actually care about I hug the shit out of my kids yeah it bums me out what people don't like - yeah it bums me out when people don't like to hug their kids yeah the kids it's a bummer it's a real bummer you know when you know someone who doesn't like being a parent it's it's rough yeah because you know you you know that that feeling it's all I mean it's this is one of the things about having children do you realize it's all about trying to foster love it's all about that it's all about you want them to be loving people to meet other loving people you think this is possible this is possible if this family can get along and we all love each other and care about each other so much why why can't the human race why can't all these people get along better why can't they they can in the ideal circumstances you're out you're under ideal circumstances and most people aren't well it's fear I think that that's what keeps people from being vulnerable yeah and hugging and expressing how they feel about each other and supporting like uncondition unconditional love is getting rid of the fear yeah you can't be afraid that this love is gonna turn on you and this person is gonna hurt you right and you have to have had that happen a few times so you're like well I know what that is yeah I must have been annoying right yeah listen analysis it's part of the problem yeah we're all part of the problem yeah man it's um I think it's an interesting time for people to communicate though I don't think anybody has ever really gotten to the bottom of things in later I mean in in in the past the way people are trying to get to the bottom of things now there's a lot of noise what do you mean emotionally I think emotionally the way we communicate with each other even the way people are examining government and and examining foreign policy and examining the Office of the President and examining voting and the electoral process and there's there's things that people are in analyzing now and looking at that I think because of all the chaos of the internet we kind of lose sight of all the crazy shit that it's doing like it's doing so many different things and changing things so much that it's it's rewiring the way people are looking at the world itself yeah and that's why all these fucking drugs are getting legalized the a giant part of why psilocybin is getting legalized now it's decriminalized in Denver marijuana's being decriminalized left and right it's because people here people like you and me and anyone else that has a brain that understands about drug laws here I'm talking about it and you go this is correct you can't lock people up for mushrooms and you should take them yeah you fucking take them they'd probably fix your brain they'd probably give you a new perspective and make you realize you were being a dick it's half of what's wrong with us right it's we're just worried about how we interface with each other you're saying the Internet is giving people insights and information that's changing the way we live I think so for sure I think the access to information because the stream is so large so much nonsense comes through it that you you lose perspective of all the positive changes taking place because the Internet right all these drug legalization things I don't think would ever be possible without all of the information that's been distributed online whether it's through videos or through people talking about or podcasts or comedy routines or just facts with facts based you news organizations start putting the here's the real facts about marijuana and you know and fatalities and this is this is these are the real facts about where there is going how it's going right now to fund cartels and how this is crazy because we're literally creating an organized crime Empire because we're making something that everybody wants Yeah right all that stuff is available now you can't cross we were just talking about can't squash it with propaganda yeah like they could in the pad they could just kind of decide what narrative gets played out in the newspaper right you can't do that anymore well did you read that article I sent you about stories versus facts yes I did and it's the you know I'd you've all hottie right yes the guy that wrote sapiens and it basically says that you know stories Trump facts and that basically we are a culture the human the human species has always believed the myth whether it's religion or whether it's a political Dogma that we are more apt to ignore facts that don't support a story because telling facts being factual is difficult because sometimes that fact doesn't jibe with what you thought was true and now you have to rectify that and that's hard and so it's easier for us to just say you know we're all Jesus came and when we die our sins will be forgiven and we're supposed to do this and then if facts come up to negate how how long ago man you know all that all the things we know from archeology that negate everything that's in the Bible then the story you still have 60% of the of our country doesn't believe that the they think the planet is 6,000 years old I think it's 46% yeah yeah 46% of the country thinks that but they only think of it in terms of they won't denounce the Bible do they really I mean if you had a gun to their head they really think that I don't think it's that high I think it's a lot of horseshit yeah I think there's a lot of people that say if that's what the Bible says so is that what the Bible says that's the Bible says believe this Dalembert I told him that's what the Bible says mama good boy yeah there's a lot of that right when he's with his friends and cracks open a beer and it's like what the fuck does my mama know but all the fucking hate this she is yes trend now a lot of people go to church on Sunday because culturally that's what you do yeah it doesn't mean they subscribe to all that stuff but then you got you know the every four years the government puts out an environmental study that is done by I think twelve different departments in the government and it's considered the quintessential update on where the environment is internationally yeah and that came out in November and it was damning about pollutants and the administration put it out on Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving at three o'clock in the morning and they buried it and in it is everything about global warming you ever needed to know and they're no longer calling it global warming they're no longer calling it's no longer fossil fuel its freedom what is the new thing they're calling it freedom juice something like that Jesus come they're literally changing the name of fossil fuels this is the Trump administration yeah yes natural gas is being rebranded to freedom gas wow this is like some Team America world police type shit and it's like people the one who deny global warming it's like the facts are there in a few I don't think anyone's denying that the planet is warming right I think they're denying how much of an impact human beings have and whether or not it's worth changing the way we do in industry ya know and whether or not we're need to impose more restrictions on on exhaust fumes and I mean factories how much you're trying to drive by factoring you see that pillowing smoke and now you're like how the fuck are we allowing that yeah like there's places to this day where you drive there and you go oh this group gets to pollute the air that the babies breathe yeah they do for this business whatever the fuck they're doing what are they making tires they get to pollute the air yeah what is the worst polluter like when you drive by a factory and you see the black smoke shooting this guy what the fuck are they doing dude cruise ships I think I read they're the number one a polluter we did a thing where we were trying to figure out was it with who was it with someone was explaining how much devastation cruise ships do in terms of the amount of fuel that they burn and the impact that they have and the fact those Valentin Thomas was at her they were talking about like each cruise ship like how much actual fuel they burn off it's preposterous I think I read they're the biggest burners of fossil fuels in the world so a giant fucking metal thing in the water yeah you ever try to push a fucking rowboat it's a lot of work it's a lot of work how what assholes are people where they built something like the Titanic like just what kind of an asshole says not only am I gonna make it out of metal look can we just use a bunch of small boats and get thee no no no I'm gonna make the biggest biggest bow ever and when I write on it even God can't sink it I mean I'm Noah imagine what an asshole you have to be to write even God can't shake it yeah on the side of the boat oh is that what they wrote yes oh that's hilarious isn't that is that that's a fact right God that better not be an urban myth I think it said on the side of the Titanic even God can't sink it yeah yeah they weren't one of these people to be excited and they're going nowhere cruise ship just going nowhere well it was something to do back then yeah imagine living back then oh I don't an equation conditioning how that was a TV yeah was a Titanic 1920s yeah the roaring the remaking one and out to tank two same didn't did it say what I think it said that's a quote someone said an employee I don't know if it was written off it was written or 1911 oh it's a launch code it was 1911 quote rather 1911 fuck live and then it's more than hundred years ago okay I hate people were they back then we went so what kind of cave people were they back then yeah do you have x-ray machines how the fuck they sit your broken leg would they do yeah well they do thing on the cruise ships it's a video about how much they pollute whoa one ship or watch a cruise ship
