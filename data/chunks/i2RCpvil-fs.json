started getting these new things in that are not weapons okay and Brian keeps accusing them of being weapons just because they're clubs and maces just because it would really help you if the if the apocalypse went down and we went back to sword fighting okay you would want to use one of these steel maces that we're carrying around these days we're selling these club bells and steel maces and of course kettle bells what all these things are is functional strength equipment and there's two things that are super important to know when you're doing any kind of weight lifting one is the correct

press real simple things to know about where to place your weight and how to keep your posture know those study those and live by those it's one of the most important things about strength training don't be an idiot use proper discipline and use proper form because if you don't you're gonna get hurt okay that's number one and number two if you want to get in serious shape there's no better exercises than exercises that use your whole body those are the kind of exercises that when you you you take it and you can translate it almost immediately to any sort of athletic activity whereas like muscle specific exercises like bench press or you know or curls more you know along those lines those they make your arms bigger they make it a little stronger but it's not the same as working

fused three of the disks in his neck so this is a second surgery he's had on neck and then the other day his arm failed on them so there's another blockage so they have to go in and figure out where the nerves are blocked like that's scary shit you couldn't pick up a gallon of milk that yeah yeah I have a friend of mine who have a place in Costa Rica a little surf shack and he went over on a wave and broke his neck in in the water broken and came out with leg work and about three years ago I in the exact same place went over came up like it rubbed my face off off like on the bottom and I had

be talking about all of our I have a helmet head and a helmet headed flesh-eating parasite Michael and we what what from where well I was supposed to get my hernia you you like ya know I supposed to get my hernia fixed right and so I was scheduled for surgery to get my hernia fixed and then I went to a tropical disease doctor and they're like no no no no if they push on that hernia you've got a fucker living in your bowels and if it if it if it if you push it onto it'll perforate your bowels and you could die because this fuckers wedged in there eating your flesh whoa whoa there's something alive inside well not anymore I took lots of pill but it's like alien yeah how big was it I good to be honest I didn't look at my shit for three weeks because I was like I didn't want to see the fucker come back what why wouldn't you want to know what that looks like you've been all of you say that you've been to Karachi you say that but these do you say that but these things these things would make me not want to fucking do something there's not a fucking army of humans to keep me from looking at that shit I would have to know what that fucking I think growing in my not you would not go anywhere else man that's that's so scary that's one of those things about like that show what does that show that the hidden enemy or something like that where people get parasites I wouldn't want to see it either because you can't unsee that that shit will be don't see it I don't want unsee it man also every every time you go to anywhere and have a glass of water or like eat anything you're just thinking fuck I just got another one of those fuckers in my car oh my god how can you test for this like yeah I feel like I've had a million you you should go I had bad sushi wants you like you should go cuz they get a roto-rooter go up there and usually like there's some amoebas or some shit going on this one's an extra I'm allowed to beat off while they're doing this just listen well the doctor doctors about like 90 years old but they won't even notice but have you been to read maps they might have this on but it was a it was apparently quite a special special parasite so I didn't I didn't want to see large large and and they look they you know they look they look bad they look like an alien and so like the alien the alien fucking HJ Geiger yeah HR Giger yeah oh my god dude what the fuck well you know you're getting old when you're like I can't get my hernia operated on cuz the fucking parasites are too big that's not you know you again oh this is you know you've food on the side of the road in the strangest parts of the world it's actually kind of amazing that you're as healthy as you are when you consider all the different nutty places they've gone you know fuckin healthy as shit the the the idea of eating food in all these different places that I never bother you before you had this parasite you know stupidly I I'd street mean I eat fucking you know fucking well they're doing it you'll do it bombs in Afghanistan they're delicious you know and what are they who knows well I remember somebody said to me the first time I want to have guests and they're like don't whatever you do don't drink the green tea cuz I gave you green tea everywhere yeah but the problem is is if you refuse the green tea it's sort of like an affront it's right why why would you not drink the green tea because the water is very bad and maybe they didn't boil it and so it's very very bad for you and but if you if you say no it's like saying fuck you right right you gotta teach those savages about boiling water so friends here motherfuckers make you teak basically it's the same thing like when I was in Sudan they give you these you know drinks like pomegranate juice but they've had just added water to it and then you're like you can't it's really bad to say now right and and and you're just like I can't say yes to anything and then explosive diarrhea so it is well is it worse I actually the tweets that I get the most response are like Shane's law which is you know the more you need a toilet the ratio is directly proportionate to you know how bad that toilet will be so for example when you have explosive diarrhea in West Africa guess what that toilet is just arcing ropes of shit and piss whereas whereas in Sweden when you're having one lovely beautiful log and then one white wonder right have perfect beautiful clean toilet the smell of jasmine and so that's it's literally like Murphy's Law Shane's laws you know how bad you need to take a shit is directly proportionate to how bad that told its gonna oh yeah those truckstop toilets that's what stops limits and West I ever get know what it must be like just holes in the ground right well actually they're so bad you can't actually get I personally can't even get into the room so I just I'll go outside into the bushes oh Jesus Christ people are so fucking gross at the lowest level we're so disgusting you know like when you're at a concert and go to a porta potti and lying to people shitting into a bucket of blue water in just a bucket of blue water we're all pretending it's okay and as we walk up we're dry all of our technology we could have figured out something better the only guys who really got it sussed to the Japanese because they have you know music yeah and fragrances and spray heated rings and they're really into their sort of pleasure shitting yeah yeah yeah they truly are yeah but the the people that have to shit into a hole in the ground well hole in the ground would be better than better than that than a toilet that's just fucking overflowing yeah it's true yeah that's been baking in the Sun Oh having shines as long as it's a nice deep hole but then you worry about losing your watch you know like it's some freak accident I don't know what you're doing down there you're watching some freak wiping accident you hit a root near the hole or those sinkholes because you think that's a very good point very good point that fucking sinkhole thing in Florida freaking out that scared the shit out of ya that's a terrifying thing yes their fucking house just a hole opened up underneath it yeah and apparently it happened so often at Florida that you have to get insurance for it your homeowners insurance yeah what that's a good horror movie that's a crazy place to live man that is the craziest place to live there's a big slum in Mexico that was built on a on a dump and the reason why I was a dump was because magically if you put your garbage there would disappear because because it was a swamp and so they kept just sort of dumping stuff and then as the garbage got got hired they sort of started building houses on it and now but now like like a hundred thousand people live that's like a city but it's been under harbajan the dump but the garbage was in a sinkhole so every once in a while they won't just have one or two houses they'll have like ten houses just go yep crisis fall through the earth yeah yeah what the fuck yeah and it's weird how you weird in uniform the holes look pristine yeah I was like someone Brian pull up some of the photos because you can't believe it I think the big one was in Guatemala where it started swallowing up and our blocks right it's insane it just doesn't look real looks like a horror movie it's like all the sudden where your house is is a cliff going down and everyone's walking around the edges looking down not knowing when it's gonna expand if it's going to expand if it's gonna stay that way permanently and that looks like a fucking meteor came from the moon and slammed into the earth we went to one of those in in Libya where they they actually have like cars or whatever or junk cars and they throw it in because you can't hear it land it's so deep that you can hear it land so they it's like a thing it's like it's you know oh you're here let's go throw something into the bottomless pit how could they stand near that thing how could they be sure that's I we we threw like some metal rods whatever we listened and you literally can't hear it hit that's how deep it is my balls hurt with you just saying that my balls started hurting my ass started crumpling and I'm Twitter I'm squeezing my toes what the fuck man why does that happen they don't know right they're not entirely sure is that the case these are in fact aliens landing it and then they call it a single I think it's alluvial clay it's a lot of cities are built on beside rivers and those rivers used to be bigger and so there's this alluvial clay which is unstable and it just sinks down but it sinks down like a hundred 215 times what the fuck man there's a big one there Jesus Christ at least you can see the bottom of that one yes all those people standing over there what the fuck are they doing anywhere near that thing who knows what's gonna happen well just when it comes to the earth swallowing you yeah I'm a little you know there's spots where that never happens I say go to those spots where you live in LA I mean that'll shake a little rock and roll will be fine the shit never happens out here oh look at that city just big hole in it now that I said it never happens you know it's common that's a pretty much people gonna blame me wow that hole holy fuck yeah you know we'll floor dwelling very important a good move if you can afford it I think that's really the the safest thing and make sure your house is up to code I think you gotta build it into like a mountainside like doctor no it's very possible if shits gonna get fucked up it's really all about staying alive and you got to think really realistically you got to think if you live here it's very possible that every couple decades or so the fucking earth cracks the foundation of your house plumbing is spraying water into the street and your power's out for a month you got to be willing to yourself yes boss are you a prepper no no I'm prepared slightly I'm prepared for like a few a few months of bullshit mmm you know but I'm not like stalking dried meat or anything nutty I just think that there's no way that with all the possibilities of natural disasters that we really don't take into consideration because the extent of our history of like what we really know about what's taking place on the earth and the amount of devastation that can occur over an enormous period of time billions and billions of years where all these unique events which have been documented throughout history where they're just starting to understand what caused certain geographic features and what kind of cataclysmic effects right now we missed two after that well I would say I'm not a prepper but I will say this you know in in in in northern Canada they have these millions and millions of lakes like fresh waters nobody on them and we can get to them all right and you're like if you have a few bucks stashed away and you can build like a you know a cottage on one of these fuckers with with pure water and start the one you'd be stupid not to because if shit goes down right and you've got this lake in this thing and it's hard to get to and all this stuff then then you can you can get the fuck up there it's just it's like hedging your bets like you're just hedging your bets in and the thing the only problem with it is if she does go down how the fuck that's the issue well I think you should have a little bit of food at your house and you're also try growing your food if you can if you have a small patch in your backyard you'd be amazed what you can do with like pots we you know we started growing our stuff in pots you know just like large pots right and you can grow like big vegetable plants you can get a lot of vegetables just from your garden well we were just we were doing this story on the world is sinking you know we went to the Maldives went to Venice we went to Greenland and then we were in New York City and accident' reviewed the deputy mayor and and I and I said you know you know sandy hit and and it was bad but you know wasn't it was pretty it was pretty fucking bad like I was I was outside of my house you know waist-high in water well you had a video of you standing was it by the Hudson yeah and right by my house dad brats are just floating down hundreds of rats are shooting by but in a current can you pull that video up because the the images and yeah in a current and that's what is the video what was the name of it well that's for the HBO show so we haven't released it yet but you showed it to me yeah I showed the folks that are not privileged as a Hudson went to West Broadway and and I was sitting there doing a stand-up and and all these you know rats are going by and whatever but the thing what's interesting about New York was that it fucked shit up pretty bad but the fact is is there was no gas you couldn't get gassed no there was it was like line ups to get gas the whole city you know we're sort of shut down gas wise people trying to get out and then you realize we're like one centimeter away from everything fucking collapsed yes because you're like oh sorry I got my fucking bolt hole up in Canada on the lake that's talked with shotguns and tuck me ease and seeds and then you're like am I gonna get there when there's no goddamn gas right now and by the way you know you can't get out the bridges and you can't get out the tunnels the tunnels are fucking flooded yeah and at that point you're sort of saying well I don't know what you're prepping for but if something bad like really cataclysmic happens we're fucked so in the meantime I have some fun yeah have some fun is good be nice that's good too so that when the shit hits the fan people want to show you where their basement is with their canned tomatoes yeah you know you could develop a real sense of community it would actually be kind of something refreshing if you could actually ensure that you were getting it attacked by roving hordes of Outlaws that have given up on society and it started robbing people but if we could you know if we had something - not necessarily something that kills a bunch of people but something that gets everybody scared enough to bond together really dark no it's really dark we're like we went from zero to sixty years brother I don't even think it's getting dark I really don't brother let me tell you I don't I don't think it's getting dark that's how I used to see you yeah it used to be communities banded together to defend themselves from everybody else just trying to fuck them up that's the history of mankind that's why we're fighting all the time is because they were truck there's only a certain amount of carrots and they're trying to get your carrots and you got to defend your carrot so your kids can eat so it was a continual warfare and that was the community all supporting each other that's also why we have this tremendous desire to be around each other this two men tremendous desire for community for fellowship exact it's a part of our DNA that's why one of the worst things a person can be punished with is solitary confinement exactly right drive some Nazis well you haven't literally literally drive some nuts I like I said it just like you cuz you're Canadian and it's it's there's a horrific thing that happens to the mind when it's tortured without human contact is you long for it because we really are not individuals so we're we're fibbers we pretend that we're rugged individualists so that we push forward you know an ego and a legacy you know and you know and conquer and all that nonsense but at the end of the day you you must be around other people that's true the worst I'm sorry you go no please you know I said it already I'm verbose well my thing is you know we're a we're a learned species we we learn most things but we are hard-wired for for three basic things which is survive which is why people commit suicide they figure our crazy because you're going against your hardwiring so it's survive procreate right so we're hardwired to procreate and then protect the progeny so at the end you sit there and say okay if you're talking about protect the progeny history makes sense because that means if you're in these villages everyone's sort of intermingled you know like your cousin and me and we're and and everybody's all the kids are there and they're all plating so then you would fight to the death to protect the progeny because that's hardwired into our spinal Fargo right so so that's why we have this innate desire to form these communities and to protect these communities yeah and and and that's been the history of humankind and it's only when sort of the nation-state came and sort of had these supranational entities that guaranteed security theoretically that that politics and modern in the modern form started but before that it was just about we're gonna protect our village yeah I think if we could figure out how to truly recognize that all all people that can speak English and that can follow a certain ethic just to just to be cool to people and just be friendly and be nice to be bowing just that attitude alone if that is possible to change if it's possible to heal people psychologically enough to where they don't lash out at others like for whatever reason for their own mistakes for their own insecurities for their own fucked-up childhood that they had no control over whatever it is the cause and we could figure out a way to communicate with those people and settle everybody the fuck down I think you could make a tremendous difference in how this world is run I mean I think we're literally that close to it we we the the number one thing that was missing throughout all of human history was the ability for all of us all of us to have a say all of us to be able to express ourselves and all of us to connect all of us to figure out how to get information to end with no boundaries as far as like countries and time limp zones and Internet connections it's so free now right then I feel like there's never been a time like this before where people might have a chance of taking a step back it's just overcoming the amount of momentum that's behind it as far as tradition and government and rules and regulations and how we've always done things and but if we could ever if we just relaxed if everybody could just relax and understand that there's no secrets anymore as far as where the oil comes from or where the money goes or whether it's know everybody can prosper there can be a way where instead of being insanely over balanced where the money is going to these foreign banks and all this crazy shit you guys would be happier you super-rich guys if you had less money but no evil karma to go with it I'm not you I'm talking about banker type characters if you're a banker and you're one of those evil cunts that has a house in the Hamptons and you have you know these people that are around you all the time and you've made a billion dollars by finagling your way through Wall Street you're just this maniacal Gordon Gekko type character you failed mmm you-you-you got into a crazy game and you sort of decided that the numbers were more important than people and somehow somewhere along the line you figured out a way to manipulate it to the point where you're like what was his name to do Bernie Madoff Bernie Madoff yeah well your Bernie Madoff is where you just you don't give a fuck you're just stealing money from the system pulling it out I definitely agree with you that look it's all within our own I think somewhere along the line we forgot that it's in our power to do shit yeah it's up to us to do shit and and I think that you know humans generally are capable of incredibly you know I mean you see heroes every day an incredibly sort of heroic feats and and and community sticking together and humanity's taking out all this stuff we're also sadly capable of the most disgusting shit do you can fucking possibly imagine and the the problem that I have with what we're doing advice now with our news and what we're doing with the HBO show is you know we're going out into the world and we're seeing all this shit and you're like holy fuck were fucking we can do some really really bad shit and I think that as people do bad shit it collectively brings humanity down right when you're using child you know children six seven eight years old to be suicide bombers or assassins that's collectively bringing humanity down and I believe what we have to do is we have to stomp that up we cannot let that fucking go on because because of modern-day politics what happens is these kinds of heinous crimes are being you know sort of perpetrated all the time now and it's it's it's it's detrimental to humanity as a as a whole unquestionably no I think no one can argue that the the real question is how to go about doing it and is is the the threat of that is it is it is it cultivated well you can't do it you can't do it militarily that's the problem because it's like Apocalypse Now right and and and they're like you know we went in a knock you laid this is fiction by the way but we went in and knock you lated the arms and then the the you know the the Vietcong came in and cut the arms off and they're like you know the Kurtz when he's going crazy is saying you know how are we gonna win against that these are the kinds of things that we are capable of these are the kinds of things that are happening today that's fiction that well it's I mean it's it's it's fiction within the movie but you know when when it's the reason why I brought it up is I was actually when I was interviewing the Taliban and they were telling me about that they were gonna continue to use the child suicide bombers all I could think of was you know this this quote from the movie of if they're gonna cut off the arms of their own children because they were inoculated by the Americans then you know how can we win against that and I was thinking if they're gonna send their own kids to be suicide bombers then how are you gonna win against that you definitely can't do it militarily because then it's just it's it's one-upmanship who can be worse who can fuck the other guy after the most and you know about this in in any kind of street fight okay well you're beating me with fists and I'll use a bottle well you're using a bottle tonight for you're using a knife I'll use a gun well that's why I always tell people like avoid conflict at all costs always cuz first of all I don't want to be mad at anybody's gonna be crazier than you yes and well not only that nobody likes it when you kick their ass it's not like they forget that no they make you their sworn enemy they want to come back and get you and a lot of times those situations where you make an enemy for life could have been avoided if you went out of your way to be what ever more apologetic friendly or nicer understand his point of view and and then he probably concede a little bit too and then maybe get a drink and then maybe it could be friends I mean there's a lot of moments like that in life where it could go one way when you get in a fistfight with someone one that was totally avoidable but maybe you were in a shit movie because your girlfriend just dumped you or maybe you know he said something that he wished he didn't say but he's fucking 22 and you see stupid shit you don't even really mean it you don't even know what the fuck you're doing you're just making noise with your mouth and practicing being a person you know and next thing you know you've got an enemy for life yeah the other thing is is you know it's a game where Psychopaths win and yeah and that you know pays to be a psychopath what situation because you know you see guys who are going out there and you know you're gonna have a fistfight in the back alley and and then I you know when I was in the place one time where there's a fistfight and the guy sucked out a guy's eyeball but then this toy that was because he's because he's a psychopath and you sit there and go well there's always gonna be somebody willing to take it to the next level and they'll take it you saw them it was in a place where I was I saw the aftermath of it and actually it's a it's a it's a famous what they call firms in in in the UK you know football hooligans it was a hooligan move where they they were they pounding they Sakuraba it's actually it's a it's a it's a move that they that they use it in a football match in the fighting of the firm so like if you're right Chester United vs. Manchester City and they hate each other they have these fights jesus fucking christ how nutty are we man that people in England can't even get along with people in England that just goes back to the village mentality to which is I'm from this village I hate that guy from that there's some tough motherfuckers from the UK there's some tough motherfuckers anywhere yeah there's all over the world but there's like a certain like there's a London toughness you know there's a whole UK toughness but where you come from I always say the tougher like the actually the poor the neighborhood the tougher the fighter often because they're fighting for fucking service remember Barry McGuigan I remember fucking Roberto Duran fuck yeah Roberto Duran because he wasn't as good he wasn't as sugar in later he was not as good of a fighter he was not as fast he didn't have the time but he had the heart and he wanted to win and he meet him and you know and it went back and forth obviously well he fucked up in the second fight you know he went from the first fight that that Duran was an animal yeah that was a street animal yeah and his boxing was it was underrated he just had a very unconventional style like he would Paul with the left he didn't have a stiff left jab the way Leonard did like Leonard would stick you Duran would Paul with the jab it's more of a rangefinder but he was very clever man and by then he had already fought can be cannon you ever watch that fight he was the original Andrew Golota he fucked up Ken Buchanan with low blow he blasted him right in the dick like Duran was an animal man it was a story where they had went to Panama wants to interview him about something it was like for like Sports Illustrated some shit and while these people were talking to him he picked up a cat by the tail and threw it against a wall and smashed its head and they were like whoa what the fuck like he was just so he was savage I mean he literally was a wild man I mean it became eventually like a brilliant boxer as he developed as a man and after he went through the No Mas situation you know for people don't know you don't fall Bock saying he quit in the second fighting he beat Leonard in a really tough fight in the first fight very close fight really wild amazing fight even to this day the standard of that fight is very very high like you could picture the Duran of that era fighting like Floyd Mayweather and having an amazing fight yeah there's it's not like looking at old football players or old mixed martial artists it was like really hotly contested huh yeah real high level stuff and then the second fight Duran got fat he had a hard time making the way he apparently like struggled to make the way and they ate like a big steak and a gallon of orange juice and got really sick and yeah and then there was also speculation then he was told to throw the fight that the people had bet on it but he looked terrible he just didn't look and then he quit and then after he quit man fucking Latinos the the all the people that supported him all the spanish-speaking world were so upset cuz he was this macho fucking savage representative of everything I mean just quit for no reasons like No Mas No Mas like nothing he's fine because it's like you know how much we fuckin paid to watch this so he was crushed for years and years and it was sad I watched him fight like you know it's like all of a sudden he just looked like this dough version of who he used to be and then he came back and fought Davey more if you remember that fight that he was he was a distinct underdog soon as a who's in his late 30s I think he's like 36 and in those days in that day it was like that was really fucking old like 36 like Bernard Hopkins just won the title at 48 yeah but for in the rands day 36 was old as fuck he boxed his shit out of Davy Moore and he thumbed him in the eye more importantly he swole up one of his eyes and he couldn't see and the kid just didn't he never overcome adversity that where he was in with a guy he really couldn't hurt the guy was just clever enough to get out of the way of all the shed and land a little bit a little bit more a little bit more and as the rounds progressed he was like oh my god I'm getting beat up right like it's just like this slow like beat down that he put on him that was that was such a wild thing to see I love a guy that comes back I love a guy that's like his life's in the toilet and then he bounces back yeah George Foreman George Foreman's a fascinating story anything I remember when he made his comeback he's 36 years old and he was over 330 pounds or something like that like it rotund yeah joke I love this fighting stuff which is sort of like a weeble wobble but we don't fall down just sort of rock back and forth and he'd keep his left way out there like this cuz this was what was coming yeah well all of it was coming he could knock you out with anything he had like hams for fists that guy he was the incredible specimen but he went into four years of like heavy depression and yeah was a brutal fight for him because he was first of all I've never been he'd never encountered that kind of psychological warfare you know what alley was like dancing and screaming to the cameras and diversity you've seen the documentary on that Burger King amazing amazing documentary and if Ollie had retired after that fight man maybe it's silly around to talk about shit today you know maybe we can have him on the podcast you know I mean I mean he he hadn't really gotten to the point where he his his illness kicked in like a dust now it's so sad to watch like his later fights while taking taking the the beating that you know Foreman you know that actually in the documentary when they say you know he was taunting he was taunting him and finally Foreman just let him have it yeah they said and then you saw the fear in Ali's eyes then you saw holy shit what have I done here yeah but then he lasted it through and then you know boom came back that was just a will battle a battle I mean a rope-a-dope styling nobody saw that coming against a guy like Foreman and you see him like hitting that heavy back Oh putting a hole in it you're like you're taking that to the ribs to the kidneys there's a guy named Lavar Johnson who fights in the UFC right now who's freakishly strong like that he's got that ridiculous kind of power it's a huge guy about 250 pounds to I think it was 264 his last fight and he fought Brendan Schaub we just kept taking him down Brendan fought a real smart fight because he's just too dangerous standing up he just knocks out everybody he's so fucking powerful I mean he's not the most technical guy in the sport but it for sure he's one of the hardest punchers it hits you you're fucked and everybody's just scrambling to grab a hold of this guy and drag him to the ground as quickly as possible he's just got that thing and there's a few guys like a George Foreman type guy sure they just have that thing like they can hit you way harder than Tyson everyone would watch for his right because it would knock you out and then he's knocking you out with his left Tyson had not yet be this was unrivaled the ferocity and speed and the the ruthlessness of it like if you watch the Marvin reason I am in his prime when he was still up in Vermont and you know Bryan pull up the Marvis Frazier fight pull up Mike Tyson versus Marvis Frazier because in my opinion this was the scariest I've ever seen a human being be in my life right I remember I was like I think I was probably like 18 or something I was watching this at home on TV and Tyson just destroyed Marvis Fraser in the most violent fight I had ever seen in a box man and I and I thought to myself back then I was like if there's one person that would be the most terrifying person to be encountered with it would be Mike Tyson like do persitz ever lived watch this fight I mean he just Marvis Frazier was like a top heavyweight contender Tyson just stepped and just started fucking bow lasting him dodging under punches got him in this corner right here and this is the end right here wah Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing that's all before he can fall down he's already unconscious tyson hits him four times more before he even gets to the ground it was it was like an assassination yeah when I was watching Tyson I was like no one's ever gonna beat not for 10 years he ended up beating himself well you know what it is man it's a it's a bunch of things first of all that that once you've gotten there it's got to be a very strange and uncharted place in your mind and in your your plan and living in this twenty something years old but he you know he'd been trained he'd been taken out of Browns have been taken out of reforms go he'd been trained yes but one of the greatest trainers of all time you know adopted effectively by it and more importantly custom otto was one of the greatest psychological trainers of all yeah and he and he saw in him he said he's the greatest raw talent of ours and he would did custom otto would say things that to this day there's you can have a short precise point that an athlete can digest and take with him as he steps out of the locker room and and into the ring that actually can help and custom otto said one of the most brilliant things that I've ever heard when it comes to being terrified in the face of combat and in the face of a fight and he said that every man experiences fire and that fire can cook your food it can heat your house or if you let it get away it can burn you to the ground and you have to decide how to take care of it but the coward and the hero feel the exact same thing it's just the coward falls into the pressure where the hero figures out how to manage it and overcome it and actually rises to the occasion and keeps it together right so for custom motto like he had studied like he had studied psychology and he had studied so many aspects that are crucial to success in that crazy isolated type of a sport where you kind of kind of like Tyson who's this need young energetic physical specimen just just filled with anger and rage getting enough love and all of a sudden this Yoda motherfucker comes out of the Catskills it's one of the greatest sport stories in sports history it's sad the way it ended you know it isn't sad man it's not sad he's alive he's fine Tyson's doing these story shows with a Dana White told me it's fucking fantastic right he goes on and he tells these wild stories about his life and Spike Lee directed it it's apparently amazing so it's not sad it's inevitable there's no way you can keep beating people up and that's happy because it's always sad for the people you beat up I mean there is no happy ending if you beat the fuck out of people for the rest of your life there's no happy ending there's a bunch of sad endings there's your happy ending you're happy you get to retire and defeated ya know I had never had to take it dished it all out good night everybody like Rocky Marciano I mean everybody was the big deal that Rocky Marciano reached whatever it was 46 you know or 39 and out and everybody was like Marciano was the only one to retire undefeated but that's almost unfair right it's almost unfair you know I think yeah you lost that game performance-enhancing drugs the immune system wasn't able to fight off the alien you had a swallow poison I don't know man I'm just talking shit mmm what was it like hunting in Japan or you weren't you hunting animals no no you're convinced I be renoble sure no yeah though the wolves like their freakish giant wolves out there yeah well they're they're mutated yeah I mean mutated is that true for real I 100% what they look like well the mutations are mostly internal because their their the the exclusion zone which is a huge area is radioactive and so that they've gone they've undergone mutations I actually read something the other day saying I'm from the Ukraine and there's all these horses out there and you know there are mutations we actually have the guys the the the the the people who run the exclusion zone admitting on camera yes they're mutated scientists are saying they mutated and of course are mutated because they're going up and in in a radioactive zone about the size of France and but yeah we went to hunt them and the thing is is we had a Geiger counter with us and whenever they they sort of you go off and they go into the forest the forest which is where all the you know the dirt and everything is trapped they would go it would go off the register I mean it was like you know I forget what it was but it was like four hundred mega REMS or whatever was was was safe and we got to 14,000 at one point you're like oh speaking of speaking of parasites you know I you know parasites I'll take but you know fourteen hundred times the healthy be parasites now there's radioactive you've seen the fish have you seen the fish of Chernobyl those videos of these enormous fish yeah Brian pull that up cuz it's really strange I mean I don't know maybe these fish maybe I'm just ignorant and like sturgeon but if you look at now too if you look at what's happening in Japan they have massive protests in Japan saying you have to stop nuclear energy because look at what the fuck happened in in Fukushima because you know we had a tsunami which we're gonna have more and more of but guess what now we have whole radioactive villages and you know radiation in the in the groundwater radiational but radiation in the food what is that that's like a giant carp is that a fish Fukushima it's fucked up that's just a giant carp dude I think that's in ya know do you uh if you google radioactive fish of Chernobyl there's a video where these these people are by this river and these enormous fish I don't know what they are I mean maybe it's just that's what they are maybe it's like there's a lot of fish there and the people went through when we were there the people who run the actual zone we're saying that the animals they admitted the animals are mutated and so well of course they are I mean why wouldn't you you have you have massive amounts of radiation how can they not be we had this dude Scott Sigler on the podcast yesterday and he's an author and he writes about shit like that what a fucking Island of mutated animals there's a 650 pounds and they're packed predators with fins so you freaking me out right now man freaking me out with these Siberian werewolf stories they'll be an awesome movie though Siberian werewolf because the mutation yeah that was like you know almost all of the like like when you were a kid but well not all of them but it was always a constant theme for superheroes yeah you know like David Banner became the Hulk it was Bruce Banner originally but they thought that was too gay for television they changed it was always you came close to it but just close to the x-men good yeah they would all get like some super power as opposed to testicular cancer or if I can write renal renal cancer wasn't the Fantastic Four like they get to they got fucking opposed to it last year or something happened and they became super powerful so usually so fun easily we're talking about politics like the Fantastic Four I always like the Fantastic Four man I always like comic books out when I was a kid but and now that was such a big theme in that somehow or another you would get into some encounter with massive amounts of radiation but you would become a superhero and so every kid sort of looked at that like wow yeah man as opposed to you know whatever the reality and what it does to bunnies being born with no arms or legs yeah weird shit yeah and you know know like what how's this all gonna balance out how long is it gonna take is by the way life can sort of barely trudge on an incredibly fucked up state of toxicity for several thousand years and you know eventually get to the point where it either figures out how to clean everything up or mutates to the point where you can tolerate it but it's not gonna be fun you know luckily it's avoidable - well when we we interviewed the IAEA for our world's most dangerous border piece which I think we talked about here India Pakistan and Kashmir which actually the fort that we were based out of just got attacked yesterday they they said categorically that if you use more than 100 warheads of which they have hundreds of warheads pointing at each other India Pakistan that the world as we know it ceases to exist everything is just I mean that's gone and we're so it's it's like you know the Planet of the Apes dudes we're underground that's the type of shit that you're you know and you sit there and say this is what's happening today is that India Pakistan hating each other mean that you know we have the distinct possibility that our ozone is gone or that one of these crazy fox posts pushes the button exactly well then we have to hope that the aliens land and stop all that shit that's the only thing we can save us well maybe aliens we're real that would be what the time to move get in between India and Pakistan ago guys guys guys god damn what is this mess you've got here why is there billion people here everybody settle the fuck down you look exactly the same when you hate each other that's a nonsense and you're you're right across it some stupid divide well one person believes one pile of wacky bullshit and the other pretty everybody settle the fuck down all right you need a big spaceship to pull that off though like several football fields long and you need to do a magic trick or two I'll let these bitches know that you therefore for serious you're not taking any bullshit make some trees disappear you're out here in LA in the land of Scientology you know yeah I mean it's dr. zorg and the feet ins and all that but amazing amazing how easy that was to pull off when you really read that story sure it doesn't make you want to start a cult just a little baby one it's pretty interesting I'm gonna say I'm fascinated by it it's amazing if you could live in the 1950s and like start your call he started his cult Warren Jeffs you know is doing it right now Warren Jeffs that's Utah though it's totally different animal Utah's a different animal you can pull it off there we didn't get any New Mexicans to buy into that bullshit we did we did it with a Buy in two rows but we did a story on the Lost Boys but you know these guys to the Lost Boys yeah so because of you know well in Warren Jeffs case you know pronounced with he has like 78 wives but yeah Sam why you hatin bitch the elders get like you know 20 30 40 was but then by just by math okay there's only X amount of women so they have to get rid of these the kids okay you're not thinking in terms of being bountiful I think you bring in more women see you're seeing a problem I see an equation that you have to solve and bring me bring in more crazy bitch what's happening is they're they kick the kid the mend the boys out and so these kids who grew up in this religion that says everybody else is evil and you can't do anything and they don't know how to pay bills and they just kick him out I said you can't you're gone now because you want the girls they have to have to go okay that's weak that's that's player-hating you're not you're not loving you your brothers and sisters they're in New York all together you're kicking out your own kids mm-hmm you're also kicking out people who know how crazy you're nutty cult is and they're gonna eventually tell people why why they're so sad why so sad Billie oh my fucking dad you fucking bitches to Mary so he kicked me out so I can't have girlfriends those poor girls that grow up with no man and they're forced to accept the fact the old guys I like the voice that you're adopting it's me that's me and therapy if I got kicked out by my dad and he was fucking this girl I was in love with my own I need a hundred of them a hundred but you know I on the other hand you can't hate if the guy can keep it up Wow I don't know I don't know if you keep it up in prison don't take that out of context ladies and gentlemen I don't really mean that I was only in jest I I think that that guy obviously victimized some poor people that were easily led my only my question has always been why are people still so easily led that's a good question is it just a way the bodies design that some of us are work of bees and some of us are you know middle management and some of us are the the contrarians hanging on the outside like your life is hard and you're looking for someone to say here's why it's hard yeah here's why it's hard and by the way if you work hard and do what I say then you're gonna go someplace better because now it's a bitch now it's fucking hardest shit but if you do all this shit it's gonna get better and you know what else it is it's like being in a group is great it's nice to be in a group it's us against them yeah like what we call desk wand like it's not like it's not like you have to join it or anything like that it's not real yeah the tattoo is it your right cheek but the whole but it's cool like when we go places and we see all those death squad shirts like there's something cool about it there's something like undeniably cool about it like we're not trying to really start a call that's telling anybody what to do but if we show up somewhere and you wearing a desk watch shirt it's kind of badass yeah you know it's like what's up man how you doing like you know most likely unless he's an undercover cop it's gonna be a very nice guy you know any time with this podcast is for now I'm finally getting you're like starting a cult would be cool but you don't want a real cult see that though the best kind of cult is the kind of cult that doesn't really have any foundation whatsoever no leadership there's no structure and everybody kind of knows what the fuck to do that's the perfect cult well you can't really like say you're doing anything you've said because you're not you set up the meta the medical you just get podcast that's what you do you should just start podcast and you eventually you get into their system and once you get in their system you tell them listen man we just need to spread this and we're all gonna be okay we just need to get this out to everybody spread it out as far and wide and it's real simple it's like Jim Jeffrey said about the Bible you ever see Jim Jeffries bit about the Bible it should say don't be a cunt yeah you know and it really upian you getting up to pee more alcohol that's what you do Jamie watching or yeah one of you gentlemen that's not working you doing with the kool-aid okay Shane are kool aid is women processed in a special micro filter that's pumped uphill using on it yeah using gravel and stream water and and it's all broadcast live on audible.com but thank you sir thank you very much I think III really do think all bullshit aside that you're shit that you guys are doing on vice.com has as much of an impact on where this culture is going and the potential that this culture has for understanding the true inner workings of all the various aspects of intergovernmental relationships and nutty places like Chernobyl and the Liberia episode I didn't know anything about Liberia until I watch that show you guys have done more look just for educating me okay and I and I can like I mean not really educate people but tell you like what link to click on like but that kind of a connection I've you guys have exposed me to some of the most little-understood little talked about things that are so bizarre and hard to believe that exists today well I think I said this last time your audience is maybe the best audience in the Indigo damn world because we you know people used to say vice was the best content on the web that you've never seen and when we started to come out here and do this podcast all of a sudden we can get these you know fanatical sort of positivist Wow like great responses and it was always with the hashtag you know powerful or Rogan or whatever and it's always by a hundred percent of the time it's your it's you know and I've got to say that says a lot about you but it also says a lot about you know the people who listen to this podcast which is you know they're thinking for themselves you know they're they're they're listening to alternative shit they're not believing the bullshit that they see on regular mainstream TV and look they're they're they're positive when someone says look we're like you said we live you and I live on the periphery yes and we live on the periphery but we're trying to do our thing and you know what when when people who listen to this podcast are so positive it makes me fucking happy and it makes me say you know I don't mind I got a home to hit hit fucking flesh-eating fucker because because these motherfuckers on Twitter and on Facebook and on Vice they're so fucking positive and then you know I'm gonna tell you another thing it makes me feel like we can change it it makes me feel like okay there is some negative motherfuckers out there in the world who are doing some really bad shit but we can actually do things to stop that and you're doing it and I'm doing it and by the way the people on this podcast are doing it and and and the more people that actually educate themselves and listen to you and come in here and check on those links that's fuckin how we change it we shouldn't expect anyone else to change the ship for you because they won't I agree with you and I also believe that it's it's also a matter of projecting a certain way of living right um that that you project you you you project a very honest and humbled view of the world and I think when someone is exposed to a guy like you it when a guy's sitting on a stationary bike right now riding along listening to the show and listening to you or your experiences in life and Karachi and Liberia which I really want to get to again they they they sort of like get this view like okay there's this fucking guy who's out here doing all this crazy shit and he's saying all these things like this guy has no reason to lie to me this guy's he's he's not like anybody that I've ever met before but yet I'm sort of absorbing his thoughts and by doing that you're you're injecting these ideas it might not have ever manifests themselves in hundreds of thousands and millions of people and that's some powerful powerful powerful shit and it's it's not on CBS and it's not an NBC and it's never gonna be it's never gonna be broadcast by anybody that doesn't want to risk everything they already have which we get a lot of shit for you know we get we get we get a lot of shit for it and this is another thing I want to say about the people in this podcast is a lot of times you know for example what just went down in North Korea you know we get attacked by mainstream media and yet you know people who are on the for free people who are watching us people's like exactly this is exactly what the fuck we want to have go on well nobody exposed mainstream or nobody in the mainstream rather exposed North Korea the way that you guys did when you went to North Korea and and showed those fake restaurants and showed just how spooky and nutty the atmosphere was over there we were not we there was no shows that were doing that there was no 60 minutes wasn't doing that the honesty in which you portray things like from ladyboys and Thailand loot dude I'm telling you man I became a fan of yours when I saw that video of you hanging with the lady boys huh you know why here's why because you were being kind to them you were being nice today you were you were chilling out with them in a bathtub and y'all like laugh and smile but it wasn't even you weren't being creepy and sexual you weren't being a douche bag you're being a sweetheart you're being a nice person to a bunch of other nice people no no bullshit and it's hard to do that it's hard to do that it's hard to do that without loose fucking forget it's hard to do that without someone being mad at you it's hard to do that without protecting your ego how are people gonna think about you you're hanging out with these lady boys you were just a guy who was there and it was trying to be nice to some other people and they were being nice to you back and it was the right thing to do and it resonated and I remember watching that video going this guy's a cool motherfucker and I I think that was before I even saw hind Mo's adventure or adventure which was the thing that really I mean made me a vice addict you know I mean I check your eye I look at viscom more than any other website on the net pretty much other than Twitter and check in my own email i watch all your shit I watched that hindmost great adventure whatever was Arctic adventure what is the natural name of that it's vice guide to travel yeah it was the most remote man on earth hi mo hi mo the remotest place on earth or remotest man on earth well if you just google hi mo and vice you'll find out whatever the actual do you know what it is did you try one of the lazy blady boys dare you you know we're on the internet everyone always asks for that question you're like you understand that there's like two camera guys and sound crew yeah like like we're shooting we're shooting so what you did the right thing man it was beautiful I wish I would be that strong I'd be like get bitch get off me at a certain point in your life you don't give a fuck what anybody thinks about you you don't get but you know what I'm gonna do my shit I'm gonna try to get through the day and do the best thing I possibly can and that's it that's all I can do it you know well I I think that's that's a possible state to achieve and maintain but I think it's difficult to get there and for a lot of people that's an alien concept right and that's why when I saw you were so like comfortable and cool about that I was like you're there's no way that guys not cool I was like that cuz that's a cool motherfucker like you were just like real easy with these people it was fun and I really I looked there was an issue that came up last week or earlier this week about transgender MMA fighters there's a woman who used to be a man who's now fighting in MMA right against women and you know people have been I've gotten some heat about it on Twitter that I took the wrong stance cuz I said that that's a guy that cut his dick off and he's fighting girls and that's the end of the story you can you can say all you want I don't care what the Olympic Committee says there's a different mechanical advantage to being a man sir but that in no way I want everyone to know that if you really feel like you are supposed to be a woman and you're a man I am I will still be friends with you like I have zero issue with that my only issue in that venue is that I understand the mechanical advantage of the male frame I just I just do if I lost like if I lost my dick and balls if I decided to chop my dick and balls off and be a woman I would still have these giant hands and they're not gonna shrink these aren't gonna go away so this is there's a mechanical advantage to having this big hammer fist to punch a girl in the face with that's fucked up it's just it's not the same and anybody who says that it's the same as far as athletics income might be the same in track and field if you don't have balls anymore you might not be able to run as fast never seen the beautiful boxer that's the Thai boxer that was a ladyboy with testicles successful then chopped him off and then started getting his ass kicked I believe she stopped after some thought for a while yeah that was the issue I I interviewed her in in Bangkok and we fought with her a little bit and I got a say she could kick the shit out of people but you know she she was a guy fighting other guys but you know yeah it's I feel for those people I understand that whatever gets you through the fucking day how I'm not that way however however if it's if you're if you're talking about sports you sit there and say well you're not even just talking about sports you're talking about the most violent sport in the world and a sport which I understand and I am Telling You from a perspective that very few people enjoy I'm telling you from the most honest perspective possible I have called more than a thousand fights I don't know how many fights I've ever done commentary on over ten plus years of doing it a man has an advantage there's a big difference there's not a little difference is a big difference well also then you start to deal with you know the questions of their steroids involved yes different things and enhancements and yeah shit that's involved in all that also the predatory mind of the male is a very different mindset but also you're 30 years old and you get your dick cut off at 30 you've got 30 years a man living okay there's a different thing fighting and dealing with bullshit and dealing with violence and dealing with you know possible death when you're when you're hanging out with a bunch of creepy people when you're 18 years old there's a bunch of violent sexual men especially if there's a little money and very few parental influences that are positive you could there's some dangerous shit you get through all that and then you cut your dick and balls off you still lived all that you're still a man you're still a violent motherfucker you're still a dangerous dude that happens to want to be a woman and why are you getting in shit because I said that although I support anybody becoming a transgender if that's what I really want to do I would never tell anybody with a can of can't kenan can't do but you shouldn't be fighting women maybe a tranny League you know and I don't say tranny and any it's not the raga Tori until it is I mean I mean didn't the the guy from Bravo get in trouble for using the word twink trust me I just remember I remember saying I remember seeing a video of these big sort of uh you know Ozzie rugby player types and they they I guess were fucking with some you know tranny yeah ladyboy whatever and the ladyboy kicked the shit out I'm like just flatten these three rug I guess they were actually MMA or there was something there Muay Thai or some some sort of fighting right and it's trying to just kick this freaking leveled him it's on YouTube oh that's hilarious you know if you're if you know in most countries maybe not tiling but if you're a ladyboy or shemale or transgendered or whatever they're fighting all the fucking time ya know and so so you know anyways I I saw that video on it was just kind of like because I hate those I was just in Thailand at a conference and disease fuckin you know Australian sort of rugby dudes who are just spoiling for a fight just they just wanna go you know those guys need to do they need to get out of rugby and get into some MMA if you want a fight you should be fighting them the thing I would tell them that I'd be like look bro you're a bad motherfucker it's obvious you're you the reason why you're trying to fight at bars is you need to be testing yourself in that way in in a gym I agree defend the choke come on stop it with your stupid ball that's a goddamn euphemism who gives a fuck what happens with that ball you take away your nutty scorer thing with one oh you got a point whoa oh no they did what we didn't want them to do that's all nonsense what you're doing is trying to stop what you really want to do what you really want to do is one-on-one man demands someone your size no mechanical advantage no weight advantage let's see let's see what's going on let's see what's going on there's so any rugby player that shows up and wants a fight stop being a pussy I win - you just I will help them I'm saying you're a bad motherfucker there's a rage inside of you you need to project that shit in the right way and this ball thing isn't working out you leave that ball alone nobody gives a fuck if you get it across that line that's nonsense you're playing a game oh you kicked it between the two sticks the world has changed no it hasn't nothing's changed okay you still you're fighting off those bullies that fuck with you when you were in the seventh grade what you need to do is some fucking kettle bell son some bodyweight squats learn some jujitsu chokes and bitches out get it out of your system stop fighting in bars I stopped letting the demon alcohol bring it out of your body I agree with you because they just bummed my fucking they harsh my brother they do hard they harsh my buzz too man because the the guys that are that that get it out in the gym they don't look for it anywhere well I'll tell you what when you drink the real you comes out and the real me is just a jovial 80 year old man I'm like fucking Buddha I'm just sitting there drinking my drink I'm having a good old time and you know when you see these dudes come out and they have a few drinks on them and they get all ran defied and you're just like yes you know anyway it's not necessary it's not it's not good for them they all need hugs what they all do man in mind well you know you and I and I both know if you're a real fighter you won't fight in a bar no but why would you want to be hit someone that doesn't want to get hit it doesn't want to fight if they do want to fight is it possible that gonna be avoided with talking and if it's not they're probably a bitch for you or you're crazy you're not gonna find a bar so that's not true this guy's like tank Abbott that will fight you anywhere they'll fight you on a plane and he's a real fighter it's just that's that dude that's what he's all about you know it's not about you don't let me see the most professional I know a guy like tank Abbott is he's one of my favorite fighters of all time and one of the reasons why is not because he was the best not because he was the most technical or won the most titles is that you genuinely knew for a fact 100% no doubt about it if you fucking flap your gums in front of tank Abbott he's gonna make you swallow your teeth it doesn't matter if you're on a Greyhound bus or on a fucking Space Shuttle he's gonna beat your ass and there's a reality to that that I find refreshing like drowning in the ocean or or getting hit in the head by a meteor there's certain unavoidable consequences to being in the wrong place the wrong time with that's why I say most of the fun you know many more ninety but the most professional fighters or fighters who you know do it for a living aren't gonna get to a fight in a bar coz someone gonna take a ball to her head yeah fuck up your hand you can do that or they would and they would clean out the whole bar and you have a real problem on your hands because it's only take a guy like Randy Couture and Dan Henderson I don't know if this is a true story or not but there's a legendary story about those two guys in high in college yeah when they were both like elite wrestlers just cleaning out a boxer you know I don't know if it's true I never talked to Randy about it but but what I can tell you of what I know about Randy I've been around that guy for I saw his first fight in the UFC yeah they fought Tony halma and then he fought this really promising kid I forget his name Kevin something another and he beat both of these guys and I was like wow this guy's a stud like this this guy is the the real fucking deal he is one of the friendliest people you could ever be around you would never imagine that Randy Couture would ever get into a street fight if you're talking to that guy whether it's in a bar or a Denny's or a bowling alley he's a smiling hand shaky comfortable pat you on the back gentlemen like you would never imagine that anybody would ever find themselves so kunti that they would be in a fistfight with Randy Couture did you ever hear that story about Tyson and there was a guy flood green yeah yeah they fought in the bar and didn't hear no no it wasn't even in the bar it was in a one of those fancy words for when the haberdashery or something like that when you get like a dope-ass fucking pimp suit yeah yeah it was like two o'clock in the morning in Harlem and Mitch blood green had been taunting Mike Tyson forever and Mike broke his hands face didn't mid screen had like twenty eight surgeries to like because we broke his orbital I believe yeah he caved in his face he broke his hand on his face yeah caved in his face with one punch and you just stood there saying okay with one punch he caved in dude space he had f28 surgery and by the way this guy's a pro this guy's a professional fighter yeah well he gets paid to get fucking hit in the face and you get one punch and it gives you 20 he accomplished what he wanted to do he dragged a guy into the ring that had no business he had no business challenging Mike Tyson he really wasn't at that level and by his persistence and his arrogance he really did get that fight and you so much but you saw in that fight why he wanted that fight and why he wanted that fight is Mitch blood green even though he had no business being in the ring technically with Tyson he didn't get stopped I said beat the fuck out of that guy yeah and he couldn't put him away that was an amazing fight and if you think about it cuz Tyson was in his prime that was the Tyson that was just arching guys just Tyrell big big gold medallist was just running for his life trying to keep the jab on that guy Jesus Christ he's just ripping to your body with that right right to the body and that right uppercut that shit was legendary and Mitch blood green made it through that the reason he made it through that it's the same reason why he wanted to fight Isis in the first place right he was convinced that he was the baddest motherfucker on the play button got his face caved in sort of he did he got beat up but he was alright I mean it's really a amazing when you think about it because who the fuck was training Mitch blood green you know I mean I don't I don't know who his trainers were I mean it might have been someone really good but I had to think about his approach it was there was a part of it was kind of brilliant forced Mike Tyson into fighting him yeah you know but that Mike Tyson that was that was the best Mike Tyson at that era that Marvis Fraser era sure that was that was our our Joe Louis you know that was our Sonny Liston that was our that Mitch blood green thing man that was a long time we're like old man we're like this Chad Johnson about a guy who's really it okay Richard you'd stay down here do it one lick it was all over what was that video you told me to look up earlier to see if it was well what the name was for vice cuz I typed in Hyman vice and that's not good that's it yeah a July hindmost Arctic refuge is what I call that got me sold and then and then David chose search for the dinosaur the dinosaur bones Milo so we went to hind mow we went to the deeds of the Arctic tour this guy lived out in the middle of nowhere and you know he lived with this his wife out there and literally in the middle of nowhere it was the most isolated person on earth until they found I don't know if you heard about this this Russian family in Siberia they were like Russian Orthodox and during the Communist revolution they went up to this mountain that's nearly impossible to get to and they lived in this little shack and and and and they lived like they didn't even have shoes with generous things I don't know how you get not yet frostbite in Siberia but they'd wrapped their feet in like birch bark and moss and shit and they were you know they've their agencies and they lived up there the guy was like 90 years old and they finally came in and he had his family they were there and they were like 70 and 60 and shit and they finally arrived and they had like iPods and everything and and when they got there that they lived this mean people that showed up had yeah you know the family had not been isolated since the 40s right I believe in 1930s yeah it was the 1930s they've been isolated up there know about World War two we did not know about World War two correct they didn't know about anything and they had literally like sort of learned how to how to make shit out of bark and everything in the you know complete survivalist shit how many people were up there I think there was six of them and then and then they all died it was weird because they except that one so this is interesting story they they they they they got found and they found out oh there's another world out there and whatever and then one by one they died very quickly after they got found except for like I believe the youngest daughter is now in her late 70s and she went into the nearest Siberian town sort of lived there for a while and said you know what screw this and she went back she's like 77 year old woman back by herself she went back by herself and she's still there so we wanted to go up there and do like the high mo or the most isolated person in the world which was was our it's a woman it's a woman and she's in her 70s and she's going back up this mountain where you can't like do you hear that pussies okay all you fucking weak bitches complaining cheffing to be at the office by 9:00 are you fucking kidding me this is a hundred Carl juniors on the way to work you're complaining is a seven-year-old crazy bitch on a donkey and it's eighty thousand degrees below zero and she's by herself like 600 miles away from the next nearest person she prefers it she prefers it up he went back what's wrong with that crazy bitch I bet she has a pussy like a softball mitt and I bet I don't even know that means just us thickly padded wall and a lot of pressure catch up on that imagine the weird shit that happened amongst those five people sexually but no but for for 70 fuckin years no alone fuckin mountain it continuous orgy at the end they probably checked it for sperm there was nothing left might be awesome no you're fucking your kids and your sisters so shut up that's fuckin communism yeah I don't think you would be good okay I don't think it'd be good to have no TV I think that shit's nonsense why not be a woodchuck but they were eating beaver fucking your kids like bark bark off your son's dick well it's the last time you had a diet coke what look at that guy is living in shit he's not using 2030 these are the questions that come to me when you're like okay these people are eating bark and putting you know moss on their feet for shoes and I'm sitting there going boy they're just bringing us more and more booze you're thinking do you want to survive this zombie you know what I was what I was out what I was gonna say to you is and this is a serious question right oh no is it no that's it but when you look at shit like that you say okay these people are up there eatin bark right and there's a lot of shit happening we were talking a little bit earlier how much of your life revolves around oh yeah you know how much your life revolves from the pleasure that food booze oh yeah you know before the making the choice between booze and like if you could eat whatever the fuck you wanted and be healthy and live til you're fucking 90 and all that shit or but you couldn't drink this or you could drink but you can't eat shit yet eat cardboard and fucking grape leaves okay well great please give cardboard and fucking grass I truly believe that living without good food and living without I mean if you're gonna survive you know you know if you're living in the walking dead and you got a chute beer and shit that's all well and good but we're talking about in this day and age I'm talking you have a choice if ya make a choice between I can eat my favorite shit or I can drink booze and and and have the added sort of crank that that gives right well what I was gonna say was that the the idea of you know subsistence living is although frightening that food is delicious eating deer over a campfire that's a really yummy tasting food if saying like shitty food like cardboard tasting bland food that's a big story enjoyment of the day in my opinion a meal with my family I think is I have one of my favorite things in life and that sounds like it sounds like utter horseshit but the real idea is like sitting down with your kids and having a laugh and having a meal I I think that that whole process is is very important and nutrition is very important but for me the taste is very important as well I think it's important to eat things that are delicious it's like a it's a part of like a pleasurable aspect of life and so if I had to choose honestly between drinking booze and eating delicious food I would go with delicious food I think delicious food is more important because I've experienced the booze I understand the lessons right the the lessons of the dropping of the inhibition and the good aspects of alcohol which are often overlooked by people who just can't handle alcohol yeah you know like we were we were talking before the podcast started about not there's a certain level of trust that you have for someone as well you drunk with you yeah like you know that guy's demons five or six Jack and cokes you know telling a story about Tijuana and you're like holy shit how did whoa what did you tell your mom well you know I mean it's like you get to know a person like and you realize that there's no benefit in hiding all that shit from people you love anyway there's a benefit in telling them and the sort of camaraderie that ensues from those drunken conversations of complete and total honesty where where the alcohol does a purpose instead of inhibiting you and making you make shitty decisions the alcohol releases you from this this idea that anything makes any sense whatsoever and you start telling the truth or you start expressing yourself or you start looking at things for more relaxed perspective even temper surely with that thought gets planted in your mind and then you just have more of a sense of friendliness the next day like you know oftentimes it's its little encounters it's steer us and like I remember this any Anthony Robbins quote who believe it or not I've listened to a lot of his books on tape and read his books and he's got a lot of interesting ways of looking at things that I really think are enabling but one of the things that he said is that sometimes if two people are going along the very same path like think of yourself as like two boats if one boat just turns one degree to the right like over the course of the boats motion through life just that one decision can lead it so far away from the original path that it was on yeah and that often times it's a good time that leads you you know and it might cost you a day or two of being hung over it might but there might be that phone call when you call each other on a Wednesday like I had a fucking great time didn't even have to be I'm not even talking about like a crazy fucking boozy fucking you know crazy time because the reason why I asked the question is because whatever I meet people I like in my respect you know I like to ask them questions because I believe that's how you learn and so I have this maybe that's problem because I'll tell you what I grew up poor I grew up therefore I left home at a very young age and and a lot of what I learned I learned you know initially through books you know so I read books and and then I that's why I have this sort of intense curiosity about the world because I all fuck I'd like to go there and see that for myself so anyway speaking of general so I I go to the Ukraine you know I'm not you know I'm just a regular fucking dude from the butt fuck nowhere and I go there and I have this dinner and and and and they bring out these potato pancakes with sour cream and caviar and vodka and all this shit and I'm you know I think it's the first time I carry on I'm eating and I'm like this is fucking awesome you love caviar right off the bat yeah first time I ever had it now granted I does a few vodkas in but you know like I'm drinking the bark and eating the caviar and it's Russia and it's crazy we were out in the middle of fucking no it's not Russia the Ukraine we're out of them in the fucking nowhere and it's some crazy Cossack shits going down and it's I'm like fuck this is like living in a book and it's crazy and I I literally had one of the best nights when I was like living in a you know in in a book from the 1800s so I had one of the best times my then you know so for the longest time I'm like I fucking Caviar's my favorite fucking food and this is the greatest thing work then I was shooting in Iran so I'm going to Iran where the best carrier comes from now and I'm and in my hotel room in my story in my hotel in Duran the only Hotel foreigners can stay and they sell caviar and Bobby so I'm sitting there in the lobby and I go fuck yeah I love caviar that's my favorite shit now man so I go and I buy the caviar right in the store it's like the best case oh I don't know I bought like ten thousand dollars of caviar for a hundred bucks or so shit so I get it and I go upstate but they'd have no booze right because it's Iran so I have like orange Fanta and some chips in this caviar and I'm like this is just fucking salty fucking it only tastes good when you're drunk well I think this is the whole question that I have is that like when you have a big fucking fat old steak with a good but you know glass of red wine how much of it is the fucking red wine and how much of it is the steak when you have your linguine with clams with a nice fucking crisp fucking white wine how much of it is how much is the fucking is the is the talk and then the thing around like you said do you meal with your family how much of that is with the family and with the thing and then so when I was sitting up there and in this fuckin shitty fucking hotel room it already shit you know carrier with Fanta I'm like actually I probably just enjoyed the fucking evening right you know I enjoyed the people and the craziness and the fucking vodka of caviar and the fact that I hadn't had it before and everything went fucking apeshit and all that stuff not API should save shit it was it was a very fucking transformative evening right and then when I just had the straight-up caviar like so funny what a contrast yeah so so when I was asking you the question cuz we were talking about food and you were saying like you know if you have a bad back you shouldn't eat the pasta you know I got fucking Boston no what I was saying is that this chiropractor that I was talking to over the weekend he was explaining to me the influence of certain wheats and gluten yeah and how it inflamed tissue and that you can get a substantial anti inflammatory response by just cutting wheat out of your diet yeah I agree with you there's a pleasure to eating that I think is like super important a pleasure to eating in a pleasure to drink I mean I like could I smoke weed and and not drink cuz I would talk to that problem no we're glad me for me weed is like that's the one that really made a big difference like I think alcohol has played a good part in a lot of positive aspects of my life as far as like joyful evenings yeah having fun with friends and nina telling them that you love them and hugging them and and you know even whatever romantic altercations you know I wouldn't waste no girls bro cut the shit Brian but as far as like what what transformed me as a human being no marijuana is more important yeah yeah Marit marijuana was to me like there was like almost like a missing piece to my sort of conceptual puzzle of like how I interfaced with with nature and with the world I was like why am I so goddamn aggro right you know and then all sudden I find weed I was like boom I know yeah I know for me actually booze was my Savior because I was hanging out with a lot of dudes who were doing some serious serious drug that bad drug and my whole thing was I don't want to be 60 years old and not so I always have this my idyllic sort of retirement which I'm trying to get to sooner rather than later now is just like just sort of forgotten like little Cove you know it's a little cold that'd be your neighbor yeah and I'm solar I'm sitting there in this go I'm gonna send you this I'm gonna send you this this article of this couple of your kids three and one and a half dude I'm gonna send you boys or girls girls okay we got big lesbian super I'm gonna send you this article it's a fantastic article about a dude who has diagnosed with lymphoma and phonic cancer like the worst cancer you can ever and he was a Greek dude he grew up in America but like you know came here when his three Assumption so he goes back to Greece to this little island in the middle of nowhere and he has to walk up this hill every day he goes to talk to his buddies drinking the wine he's eating the food from the whatever and all of a sudden like five years but he was given like you know six months to live or whatever we're not even six weeks to live and and they said well you know what the fuck happened you didn't die and he goes you know I came here and I forgot to die because you know he's sitting there and and there's no stress and he's walking up the hill every day and he's drinking wine with his buddies and he's eating the food from the you know the fish from the bay and the fucking whatever and I sit there and I say you know now I'm looking at this shit so my idyllic retirements basically I'm stealing this guy who killed cancer by living this euphoric life of I live on this little Cove and I'm drinking my wine and I'm sitting out there and I'm just blissing out on reality now that's why I didn't get hooked to heroin that's why I didn't get hooked to fucking crack that's why I didn't get hooked all the shit that my boys got hooked to because I always thought to myself if I fucking get hooked to this shit I'm gonna have to a die or be fucking quit it and if I quit it guess what I'm never gonna be able to sit on that fucking Cove with my glass of fucking wine sitting out there I'm being dissed blissful old Buddha dude right so for me that was booze but I will say this we were just in Jamaica filming the snoop stuff over New Year's and Snoop lion and we were in this place he's one of the best and by the way now more than ever cuz like that that shit's been through shit that guy's been through shit we don't even fuckin understand oh yeah and but anyway so you know so we were filming down there and I was in Jamaica and you know generally I don't smoke at all the week I was smoking every day I was drinking rum every day smoking every day I gotta tell you I felt like I felt like God was touching me yeah I was like I felt fucking spiritually fuckin you know we got to start doing eating it when you eat it that's when you really get into that sort of psychedelic love state it's very feminine it's a very feminine sensitive state you know and a lot of people are afraid you know they're afraid of this it's gonna make you a pussy or it's gonna no no you're not afraid of shit I'm not afraid I'm we're afraid of sinkholes and fucking idiot a lot of shit you know people give me Oh afraid of fucking mountain lions and yeah one ain't my dog yeah you know are you afraid of meteors yeah watch some TV show when they come from the sky like goddamn torpedoes yeah yeah that's good life and you don't want to die my whole thing when I was aware when I was a penny I thought I was gonna die so I didn't give a fuck I do anything cuz did you think you were gonna die cuz I was gonna die I mean you know everybody I grew up with you know when I was a kid died because we were bad guys doing bad shit people died almost how bad were you guys anybody I mean everybody who does like blow farts on people no Brian so it's like you know look you do some gang shit you do gang shit but you're doing Canadian yeah exactly how bad where did you beat but no you know look people get it people get into junk doesn't matter if it's by the way this is help rising thing well they get into everything but you know generally the end result is well now could be met but in heroin and the thing is is even in in shitty sort of nice Canada people end up on junk or they're doing they start doing more and more serious crimes and and this is one of the reasons why my my Cove was was my dream was because you know you have guys who are dying of heroin overdoses or guys are going to prison for life for worse getting killed and and you know these are 17 18 19 year old kids and you're sitting there saying that's the biggest tragedy is you never fucking live you're you did teenager you think you fucking live your life you haven't lived shit you haven't done shit you haven't seen shit and one of the reasons why I say I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna see shit and I'm gonna do all this shit whatever is because I didn't fucking buy but at a certain point you sit there and you say look you know and I know how hard life is we know fucking what good things work or can be right and can be and also we realized there's a lot of people who didn't make it you know there's a lot of people who just for one reason or other they don't get to where you are and so that's why now anyways you know one of the reasons why I like coming here and having these discussions with you is you know you you can actually say look I've come to these fucking realizations and in look we're two guys who are saying you know we don't need to fucking fight we probably had fucking on two fights you know between us like you know we're not I've never I've had no street fights I had alright the last street fight I had when I was in high school it was really quick you're smarter I've avoided everything but I've had actual fights I've had like yeah you're three kickboxing I don't know how many talk with no fights but there's a lot of them but I've never what I'm trying to get at is well I you know when you see fights in in in in you know this is a me turn to another but you see fights in Iraq or yeah those fights are different fight those fights are like they shoot you in the head fight sure so what I'm trying to say is you know you want to get to more of a of an understanding and this is when I go back to like I don't give a fuck what people think about me I don't give a fuck about well shit because when you see it you sit there and say on this hand this motherfucker got shot or this sprite to heroin this guy got into this now to go back to the long winded uh-huh but if you go back to it what do I want to do I want to sit in the cove with my family your family and chill hang out have a drink enjoy myself I don't know how much food and although I'm a fat bastard I don't know how much food is gonna play it into that but I definitely want to be sitting there with that glass of wine looking out at that Cove and just going I fucking made it I mean and that's why I don't that's why I don't judge anybody cuz I'll tell you what everyone's trying to get through the day to get to their goddamn Cove you a hundred percent Yeah right 100% right I agree with you so much but we live in a beautiful world where you don't have to choose between the food and the booze and I'll tell you what I'll tell you what what happen we do live I gotta tell you that you know we live in a fucking country where you can still to this day make your own shit happen yes which which most and look I'm an immigrant from but but I made my shit happen in this country and I gotta say it's the best country oil and there's a lot of countries out there we don't realize how fucked up they are and how bad shit is there and we should fucking say you know what you can do anything here in America so you should you know when you say that it has so much more weight than the average person including me saying at first of all cuz you've been everywhere and second of all because you came from another place you grew up in Canada so when you come over and you see this situation there's no question this is not perfect and what I think all agree on it I think it's fucking fantastic it's better it's better look then it's ever been what we were doing right now is we're we're figuring life out and we still have a lot of old standards and old traditions and old things that we abide by that don't make any sense and they trip us up we step on our own dicks but I think ultimately we're moving forward in a direction of progress as much as people like to be cynical about the possibilities of the future I think just where we are today in this country despite the eroding civil liberties all that that's all good on paper but the reality of the progression of information through the Internet is we're taking the world to a different place we're not cynical to criticize it's not your right and you know what America and democracy was based on honesty and being critical and being allowed to be critical because you couldn't say fuck the aristocrats fuck the king and all this should they cut your head off so democracy is based on people of gods sitting there going you know what the political system isn't right and guess what the political system will not change unless motherfuckers like us and everybody losing in this fucking podcast do something about it and that's what America is you 100% but more importantly the people who are in the positions of power it must be reinforced that we are all living in this temporary state and to make the most of your temporary state you can enjoy the bounty of your work in the fruits of your labor and the the the overwhelming a few affluence that you get from having successfully figured out capitalism but it's possible to do that in a way where you don't fuck people over and you promote freedom and love and for all of us in fact you have to and if you did you would be more happy and more than success half - you know I'm gonna tell just just one quick story but I was hanging out with a guy who inspired the shit out of me and he was he was the president of the Maldives it was a 35-year dictatorship there he got elected against all odds and he did all this shit like you know underwater cabinet meetings and stuff to bring awareness to global warming cuz his country is sinking and so he was gonna buy land in Australia or Sri Lanka or India because he doesn't not gonna have a country anymore and then the the ousted him and he has this flotilla going around the maldis which is actually like the size of Europe but like Islands so he's fishing boats and I went on this these these these fishing boats with the sky is called the the Mandela of the Maldives because he's been in jail most of his life and you know I was hanging out with this dude and you know one of the interesting things that this guy was doing is he's just saying look you're you have to you have to you know take individual control you have to say look unless we do it unless we as a community fucking say no to this shit it's gonna continue because people don't want it to fucking change right they just don't want it to change even in America they don't want it to change but the thing is is you think that people don't want to change the dock okay I'll tell you and so this is my second point is is you know for the people of the people by the people and you sit there and say the people this is the country the first country that was that was set up not for the Aerostar see before the people and the thing is I think that was forgotten because if you actually look at the people and what the people want and what the people can do people want a good life but they're willing to say you know what fuck I don't want to fucking have you know all this garbage or whatever the fucking radiation is I don't want to have that this this you know threat of nuclear war and all these things if you look at actually if you talk to regular people people are saying people are good actually when you were talking about it people actually if you hang out with your neighbors people are inherently good people are inherently fucking nice yet all this fucking bad shit happens right and you're saying why does that bet it should because people let it happen is it because people let it happen not necessarily because someone has to be initiating it I mean someone has to be willing to take it I lost the train of my thought because you guys are doing some weird shit I don't know I was get into some deep shit no no I'm sorry I really apologize distract you I thought you can keep your transfer I couldn't I'm a visual I'm a visual guy it's place oh there's roaches and all this well it's not yeah I think it's a moth ate my sweater sorry I'm sorry so what was your point what I will say is that I think fucking place is haunted I think because I think because of where we are with the the transference of information like we're doing advice or like you're doing your podcast shit that the government is willing to arrest people but that information gets out I gotta say information does get out WikiLeaks this that the other thing information gets out now and by the way that's what's keeping governments in check because mainstream media is not keeping fucking governments and check which is their fucking job and they're not doing it well as it's really interesting you just brought that up I was reading on Vice about the Bradley Manning testimony that you guys have released like what it what's going on with that what is that explain that well I think look the thing the thing that that that we're looking at is how much of media is actually you know so we actually did this story on Iraq recently that is the thermobaric weapons that were destroying you know so if you if you have to do house if you I'm doing it again it's like a pantomime motherfucker attached to my head with a ghost pantomime if you if Brian snuck out behind me he's very childish if you look at what happened in Iraq you know they had these thermobaric weapons with the throwing burglar it's if you do if you have to do house-to-house fighting which traditionally is the worst fighting you can do right I'm very difficult they have this weapon where they can it's called a small Emmy and what happens is they shoot it into a building right and it does a heat blast which which sort of takes all the oxygen out so it kills you right away and then it and then it has this massive heat blast and then it implodes the house right the problem is is it's suspected that this is a thermobaric weapon is made from depleted uranium so what happens is all that dust that goes out there becomes in radioactive radioactive or chemically Laden and that possibly is responsible for the first Gulf War Syndrome that no one really sort of figured out correctly correct and this huge increase in in in in in rare cancers and and and amongst veterans well well amongst veterans and also locals and so you know we you you have these sort of incredibly bad I don't even know what the fucks I'm just telling them no more we'd get away from me with the devil devil weed devil cabbage the devil's cabbage sorry so I forgot where I was do you remember what are you talking about this is really devolve a no no we're gonna get I'm having a great back I don't know what I'm talking about here's here's what here's what matters here's what you are saying what you are saying is that you are seeing the best and the worst aspects of humanity sir and you truly are seeing this oh that's what I was gonna say is that these thermobaric weapons have done these things in Iraq and you know what I'll tell you what is no one would have ever reported on that before why because they're you weren't you couldn't the were there weren't the actual tools to do that and for example us just having this discussion today and what we're talking about the like it didn't exist before yes because if you were you know the Washington Post even though they you know deep throat Nixon and all this business you know you because of your proximity to the Pentagon you can't lose your fucking seat at the fuckin White House table they'll tell you whatever now we can sit here and say okay those thermobaric weapons by the way the story was broken by a marine yeah Ross Caputi who's a marine who fought in Fallujah who saw the thermobaric weapons the Marine broke the story and said by the way this is what the fuck was going on and I'm breaking this story because I saw what happened in Fallujah this is a fucking Marine who's saying this and you sit there and you say because of the fucking movement of information and by the way we're on the cusp of this me and us we sit here and have a few drinks this is why this is why you have to be honest so to go back to the story now I've realized is if you look at WikiLeaks and you say okay his WikiLeaks good or bad I believe that the freedom of information is imperative to democracy unless you have transparency unless you have accountancy unless you have people who account ability not accountancy accountability unless you have people who are going to be held accountable for what the fuck they do then it's not democracy then it's not there's no different than here's what I go this is the number one most important thing there's no way they should have put that guy in solitary confinement there's no way they should have isolated that guy from the rest of the world there's no way they should have made that guy feel like he was going insane because he longed for the human touch and he knew that he is being punished for releasing information that's inhuman and that's unnecessary with a government that doesn't have anything to prove if a government is being honest and is not hiding anything it doesn't need to take a guy like Bradley Manning and put him in some horrifying state of detention where he has no rights there's no need for any justice unloving government to treat any of its citizens like that but let's be honest our government is not honest I understand that but that to their own self there's no benefit in behaving the way they're behaving and that's what needs to be reinforced is that I think they have this idea or I don't say they as in like some conspiratorial overlong what but I think some people who are scared of losing their position of dominance determine what they're afraid of is they're afraid that people are gonna understand what's going on and they're gonna take over and they're gonna lock them up and they're gonna isolate them from I've actually you know I said something in this podcast one time when I said if you ever go to a war zone I can't remember exactly but I said you cried and then he puke and then you freaked the fuck out and I had so many people respond to that and they were by and large I would say about 98% ex-military because if you if you if you talk to the people who go to these things they're like oh fuck I didn't know what the fuck I was getting into when I signed up for this fucking shit I did not have a fucking clue and you look at that and you say okay before we go to war before a government sends people to war before Dick Cheney sends people to war saying that it's you know al Qaeda is being sponsored by Iraq or Iraq is having weapons of mass destruction or all of which is completely made up and by the way made up by the government that the mainstream media then said by the way everybody who had half a brain knew that fucking the secular state of the bath party was totally against al-qaeda there's no way al-qaeda was doing anything you know but 9/11 was the fuckin you know the the sort of carte blanche to go in guess what these motherfuckers lost their lives they lost their limbs or fuckin you know pissing out of fuckin catheter bags now and when I said you know when I first saw a battlefield like fuckin cried my eyes out because it was the first benefit you saw the first real one was Afghanistan wait and and and when you see Afghanistan Afghanistan where were you in in in Kunar province and in on the Pakistani border and when you see it you just go okay this is the worst shit I've ever fucking seen in my whole life what did you say you see bad like okay you want to get into it there's guts coming out of cavities there's hands there's severed heads there's like the bodies are not even whether or not human beings anymore just it's like cow parts or some shit there's blood running into rivers there's but more that's the dead people aren't so bad it's the wounded because these fuckers aren't gonna walk again they're gonna be shitting out of a bag you know the young kids you know and this is the other thing I say is like I get we're sitting here debating well my Cove with my fat why nor would you have a steak or would you have a glass of but these fucking kids they're never gonna be normal again and you sit there and by the way I'm not I'm not I'm not saying you can't you you can't police the world and I'm not saying that there aren't bad people out there that have to be bucked out but I am saying if you do that you better fucking be cognizant of the fact that when you're sending our best and our brightest and our fucking nicest fucking kids out there that they're gonna be coming home with no legs and no arms and shitting out of a fucking bag unless we realize that then we should never go to fucking having having seen that is a perspective that very few people not a lot of people in the military know and the Khitan people in the military are coming back and it fucks them up so much they cannot re-enter into fucking society because when you see that shit it fucks your fuckin wiring up I think we're still operating under this this behavior pattern that was established before the kind of communication and understanding that we enjoy now exists that's exactly my point and my point is our job is to say guess what you know we're not sitting here saying don't go to war don't go what we're sitting here saying this is what happens when you go to you see the guys a lot of the guys in the MMA came out of the military I met a kid that had been pronounced dead I was it was multiple times I don't mean this guy was trying his friend was trying to explain to me the amount of times this kid had been pronounced dead and brought back to life and then he was it was unbelievable and then the amount of courage that he had shown he apparently jumped on a grenade yeah it was an intense intense intense conversation and all I could think of was this guy unquestionably was a hero from a Joseph Campbell story you know I mean I mean he there was a what what what's exhibited in a true hero yeah is beyond ideology yeah yond politics and political influence and beyond special interest groups and yeah what he exhibited is the thing that we aspire to the most the person is willing to literally sacrifice their own being for the the the health and the welfare of the whole he was willing to dive on a grenade for the rest of his crew mean that's an incredible ly incredibly honorable human well we have heroes we have real straight-up heroes but the whole thing is is you know what I don't want to send our heroes or or I don't think anyone in the world not even I don't think anyone in the world should send their heroes to fight a war that isn't philosophically correct that isn't back a ball very true you know and I think true heroes the real heroes should be guiding the rest of the heroes and we should figure out a way to make people exactly understand what war exactly the people who went and fought should be the fucking voices that we hear about next time we go and fight because they're the motherfuckers that know what fucking time it is and guess what no one listens to them and I'm gonna tell you one thing about this podcast is whenever I say you know what I fuckin saw that shit was bad the response I get from from people who have been there they're like exactly exactly as like and I agree with you 100% if we're going to go to war then we should listen to our fucking veterans because it is not fucking pretty and the people who make the decisions to go to war are not the people that ever have to go fight those fucking those are the only people that are gonna understand that reality that reality is so extreme that it can be sort of justified and glamorized and glossed over and a fictional sense by people who've never experienced it under the threat of their own life expiring and that's the reality that those people have experienced that no one who can make their decision from an air-conditioned room with a custom design suit should ever be allowed to do exactly the only people that are gonna understand that reality are the people that have experienced that reality and as a whole as an organism that respects itself and wants itself to evolve we should all collectively get together and say this is completely unnecessary for what we're all looking for and what we're all looking for is happiness and we can all compete and all of these needs to accomplish and conquer can all be satisfied in a very ethical way like this idea that we have to continue the Genghis Khan way it's nonsense and if if there is a war the people who are making that decision have to understand and have to talk to the people who have previously been there because if you talk to anybody who's gone to Vietnam if you talk to anyone who went to fuckin Korea you know during the Korean War if you talk to anybody from World War two World War one Afghanistan Iraq Bosnia anywhere they'll say don't fuckin do it yeah you're not fuckin fuckin do it because it's fuckin bad it's really fuckin but now are there bad people there of course they're bad fuckin motherfuckers out there is North Korea fuckin crazy fuckin do you have to buck them down of course you gotta give my hugs they need all colors they the North Korea needs the most hugs that anybody ever they need someone to take them and give them hugs and say listen man that's going down right now we're gonna be learning any any day now it you're gonna see I'm telling you North Korea if you listen to me please I know this sounds crazy but you've already accepted Dennis Rodman so I know you're over the d-list Kim you know Kim Jong whatever your name is sir love God I'll call you God listen he's monkey Todd on Twitter everybody knows everybody knows that you need a hug okay you know I know we all know let's accept that you're the dominant rule of your situation but you shouldn't because you would be way happier if you weren't it'd be way happier if you let all those people go you'd be way happier if you released all those political prisoners and slaves and whatever the fuck you've got going on there with your wacky laws and the people that we're in prison because they didn't cry long enough after your dad died if everybody was let out and everybody said all right settle everybody settle the fuck down let's vote on this shit mmm let's let's be cool with each other let's be nice to each other and the dominant person the dominant idea is the most accepted ideology will pretty much always rise to the top and the exceptional people that can influence the groups as long as they're doing it in an ethical way and as long as they're truly trying to advance their culture good but they all need to have a certain amount of of reality in their own head and a certain amount of humility in their own hat and a certain amount of experiences with dark situations or bad moments in life or understanding of failure or psychedelic experiences what or whatever the fuck it is but I would say for the first time and maybe I'm being naive but I would say for the first time in history because of the internet and and the freedom of movement of information that you have this this young you know population this huge massive global young population that most obviously is causing change in in you know Arab Spring like in these countries where you know Gaddafi was never gonna fuckin leave you know Mubarak was never gonna leave and forcing change and they're forcing change in Europe forcing change rather because young people are pissed off they're unhappy they're poor they're broke they don't have a lot of opportunities and they're sitting there saying we're gonna force change I think that that change is coming to Asia yes and I think that that changed you but I think that changes come is a global phenomenon the the world economic crisis has forced us to wake up and we're saying there's a lot of young people out there and they're fucking pissed off and they're gonna fuck shit up and they're either gonna fuck shit up in a good way and by the way I think Arab Spring is a positive thing there's gonna be an implosion in Europe if it hasn't already happened and we're just seeing the aftershocks there's even shit happening here in America which by the way I'm not afraid of cuz I like change I like things to be sort of D stratified and think because I don't think America if you look at right now what's happening in Congress I think Americans political system the America the political system in America is broken because you have Congress just fighting each other over things that are detrimental to what what's going on they all need mushrooms they need mushrooms everyone does it sounds like nonsense somebody needs to force them to say hey yo they need a mushroom you have to fucking work together for the betterment of this country the only way to do that is to take because because what they're doing is they're working against each other and their fucking shit salvia divinorum is legal in 36 states do it I'm reset it was I'm resetting Friday get a motel 6 in a bong and let's get this party started all you need as well as butane lighters you got to heat it to a certain temperature Shane do you know anything about dolphins because I'm swimming with one shadow day and I can top it can I can I tell you something yes I'm gonna tell you the truth all right so I went down to this dude I wish I'm not allowed to talk too much about what I'm gonna just say his name Johnny forgot seas island in in Panama and I was I was I was on a boat and I went to a super pod you know have you ever heard I've heard of those recently right I was on a super pod with 3,000 dolphins right 3,000 often 3003 thousand joking about that it's an orgy that's I saw on Craigslist easy so what happened is they gave me you know what a seat Bob is so I get James Bond motherfuckin thing it's a little jet engine that you can keep up with them because they don't they don't like you if you can't keep up with them seriously well they need to fucking get over that shit you can't judgmental picture so I had this see Bob and I'm you born with that fan is that some shit earned I was going on my see Bob and I was going with the super pod there's three thousand this is what I got shit on cuz they shit a lot I got pissed on I got come on I saw a baby dolphin being born there was orange stop right there which was always got you the most hard no but I gotta tell you what happened so so so I was on the see Bob thing and then eventually cuz the see Bob fucking ran into batteries I was holding onto the side of the boat with my thing in Brian you know snorkel my mask and that's when all the shitting in the pissing in the coming hats but because they're all fucking all the time yeah continue I'm shaving my back for this yesterday if they fuck they fuck - fucking they shouldn't they piss with and and in a super pod there's just all this matter there's all just kinds of like bits bits of shit shit going on everywhere they just come and so this this was me this was this was me being shit pissed and come on I was just going I was trying to Tommy oh yes I was trying to talk to them to my snorkel cuz it because they come close to you they come they come straight up to you and in fact don't let me tap out jar they have the shit on YouTube you'd like like these videos of all the mating cause I've been training for like two weeks and I can't kill it straight up - yeah they'll come like within two inches they'll check you out they'd like to give you the eyeball they want to check you these were spinners and spinners are the most right it's like it's like Koreans yeah I saw more fucking into the super pod then and and by the way I came out of that the wall I'm dad I came out of the water covered covered in shit piss and I've got it no no I gotta say it was fucking awesome it was fucking on because because because you're in the middle of you're in the middle of like they're doing some crazy shit in their society you don't understand what the fuck what is it all talking to each other they're all talking to each other what does it sound like there's like you can get there so nerdy Johnson they can talk to you how many dolphins are there in this super pod there is over 3,000 oh my god okay this is $3000 and this is just a wild fuck fest that's exactly so you're down there you got a scuba helmet on and I have a shave see Bob what a knee and it's basically just you in a wetsuit right no wetsuit you're no artist hard right no there's no pun you have a little engine that you push on the button like this okay tiny engine to keep you - you can't swim as fast they can surprise fuck but they do this the reason why they're called spinners is they do this thing where they're having sexual talks with and they spin up into the water so you see like hundreds of dolphins spinning up here but when you go down into the water there's thousands of the dolphins like like like fucking and and like you know having babies and shitting and pissing and everything and they're just dirt they're like actually just hanging out very good came along and stole all the tilapia I bet that shit was a party and a half I'll tell you what that's exactly what it is tilapia but tuna tuna whatever how long ago where dolphins have been the same state for a million plus years is that correct yeah and and that's the interesting thing about it they have language they have social norms they have all this evidence they have names names for each other yeah all this shit their cerebral cortex is 40% larger than a human being the hottest dolphin is the actually the pink dolphin it's the rarest one so that's like that's like a Japanese girl with the big tits - Lena Jolie is that a saltwater or a freshwater dolphin I think pink is Brazil right yeah of course the biggest ass they have the biggest ass but these asses on these dogs that's what I will say I will say I will say spinners are my particular force acceptable 90-pound free I've never been have never been happy until I was accepted by the spinner people never been happy finally have found out do you ever watch Saturday Night Live will you run and feta means Joe I'm doing Joe I'm doing this Saturday Saturday I'm swing with the dog I will say it's fucking awesome explain what you're doing it is fucking awesome it's they're putting me in what this guy has this like pool about the size of your pool it's like regular swimming like a regular swimming pool but he has like four dolphins that just shoves in there yeah and you just pretty much swim hard pool yeah it's like this yoga music on and you just fucking swim naked some sort of porn it's not important I don't think it's porn I really don't think it's porn they get horny you know that I know San Diego it's not like somebody's backyard he's getting he's gonna give me his address when I get there oh my god did you get a rape hold on hold on do that that sounds you to my lawyer what are you doing I've watched he's simply video links i watch for people at home going how fucking big is Rogen's pool it is a totally normal backyard pool I don't have a crazy pool at all it seems a lot smaller than it should be honestly it's a regular pool if anybody has four dolphins in my pool you're an asshole okay you don't need to congregate with those humans I will say this I have I have some proclivities to play cards and I went to Atlantis or play some cards and I swam with the dolphins in Atlantis you know you swim with them right there I had a good time there nice dolphins everybody's nice but I gotta tell you one thing when you go out when they're wild motherfuckers and the pods there they could fuck you up they could kill you by you fuck your in a second and you know what they want to do with you they want to play with you they want to talk to you they want to fucking hang out with you and then you realize these are nice nice dolphins the Sharks will fuck you up the Sharks will get you and they're looking for me they're looking to well there's a cleanup crew but they don't kill by the way dolphins eat meat dolphins eat meat the same as sharks do and dolphins will fuck a shark up but what the Dolphins for some fucking reason they have this weird affinity with humans they won't kill you they won't eat you they won't fuck you up they'll save you later the sailors always tell you know the fucking dolphins don't have it together either I don't know because I'll tell you one thing I've been I swam around sharks and I was shit scared yeah when I was swimming around dolphins I was not scared all day very nice nice showdown bitches they don't have thumbs and they know we have gone it's that simple they don't have thumbs and they know we have guns they're not stupid what's going on here is that they realized that evolution has blessed them with the ability to move through their waters as if they were flying through the fucking sky like superheroes and they don't have to breathe for minutes at a time they can always get to the surface unless some crafty Japanese dudes have manufactured some sort of a netting that traps them in the water I just like to say things are gonna blow it's a life-and-death struggle and the reason why dolphins are as ruthless as they are is because life demands that at the top of the pyramid of fucking craziness dolphins and sing about something we figured it out dolphins and sake was a dolphin werewolf yeah what about all that what about syphilis you're being rude you're being rude by eliminating a lot of my fears trying to categorize me some sort of a normal so I think I'm capable I think also my question of food versus booze has been answered thank you very much cardboard sandwich with a good yeah being several times I'm ready to kill a buffalo bitch I'm ready to go to Aubree's yeah I need a lot of red meat man it's very important it's imperative to keep my fucking I thought the red meat was the inflammatory shit nonsense not too real no it's the highest thing of cholesterol the real issue is Brian what is that word hey I'm trying hey I have to worry about you now you fart monk grass-fed bechamel ribs real inflammation as far as animal ooh there's a lot of it that's been correlated to cows eating corn my problem is I love it to be I love eating food I love doing here's a problem with corn-fed beef goddamn delicious okay a ribeye a solid you were talking you were talking about when you first saw Vice you're like I saw your chin no bullshit I say the first Rogan podcast ever heard was you know how much fucking shit it tastes because skirt steak or strip steak is strip steak you were talking about strip steak maybe was Anthony Bourdain but you were talking about a strip steak yeah and you were saying this fucking steak they take it out of the whole cow and this is a fucking thing and you put it on the goddamn barbecue and you whatever and I was sitting there and I was like why the fuck isn't he talking about a porterhouse cuz the porterhouse has the strip and and the filet you know with the bone so it's got the best of both worlds it's like a shemale it's got it's got the filet and drugs and the fucking foam and the fucking boat so anyways the first podcast I ever heard was talking about steak and that's when I film was it Anthony it's mutual I don't know how this feels like the marathon like let me our Park would suck okay if I loved him what he's done is awesome yes well who is he so he's so honest about his intentions if a guy who can take and fucking make it into what he did listen let me tell you something about how committed Anthony is to food he takes this drug so that he can still eat pork he takes some sort of was lipitor whatever the semantically they literally said to him you must change your diet you traveling all over the world you're eating because he's got too much cholesterol exactly cholesterol filled fatty foods red wine red wine make you decide you have to make a decision it's either lipitor or dense it's no foods you either take this drug he's like I want the Porsche yeah well pork yes well pork cuz if you go to any country beef generally sucks America the beef is fantastic but generally it sucks cuz beef is he needs a lot of you know grass and a lot of food and lower water so beef in most countries is shit but pork like when you have pork from a third-world country or or Yardbirds the best bird like a yard what I call those you know like a bird that lives in the yard pigeon no chicken chicken but they'll just like let's say you go to Jamaica right right they have a yard bird they just go out and kill it they take it and they cover it in chili and they barbeque the fuck out of it not jerk everyone always talked to a dirt chicken it's fucking barbecue chicken enjoying it and it's the best fucking thing you ever eat why cuz it's a a yard bird it's just been eating the fucking shit whatever same thing when you go anywhere else you say yeah well you kiddin people don't realize that like you can take like your scraps of your table scraps the same thing with pork yeah if you had a bunch of chickens you can throw them in the backyard and they can like live very well yard or apps yard birds are the most delicious motherfuckers you'll ever have in your fucking life what we have here is some Purdue genetically modified bullshit but if you ever have a yard bird just from anywhere like this wrote just really to put it on a grill do another fuck it it's the best you know you sit there you go what the fuck am i eating this is the best thing ever let me ask you this because I have I have to inclination and one inclination is to be in the woods on the top of a mountain right the well and experiencing nature and the other inclination is to be in the hive to be deep inside of Manhattan on 23 and I thank you for of on the mountain guide well yeah yes and no it's like I don't know what where's the gravity coming from is it coming from the masses of humanity who although imperfect at the moment might be trying harder to work shit out right or is it from this sort of reluctant agreement that the earth is much more powerful than the culture at this point in time it's better to just isolate yourself from all these idiots who haven't gotten the information yet and get your own water from a hole in the ground I think you know again that may be the quintessential question of the modern age you're in both spots yeah because you're in a guy yeah live in Manhattan you have children so you're on that next level of sensitivity but also I spend a majority of my time out there in the shit and I will tell you this when you actually have something like for example like you said if you kill a deer and you you you cooked that on an open fire nothing tastes better than that you're right however the thing is is this might be my paranoia you got your sinkholes and you're werewolves my what I think is happening is there's there's a global restructuring happening yeah there is there is a global restructuring happening that people are seeing they're calling the greatest recession since the depression they're saying well this is this and this is that I think this is the new normal so to be honest and I'm not necessarily proud of this what I love about New York City is I kind of feel like Nero as Rome is burning because I believe New York City is the greatest city in the world I believe it's a capital of the world culturally and economically and politically for that matter and you know when you go out in New York City you know it has the best restaurants in the world has the best nightlife in the world has the best I believe it has the best of everything in the world I'm a huge fan of New York City I'm not from New York City here's a problem well it does and so you can fuck off what I will say what I was is when you when you go out in New York City right now today and it might be Shanghai in ten years whatever but today New York is the global capital and you can go out in New York City and you can like me come as a penniless immigrant and become a fucking rich motherfucker who can go out and have the greatest food and by the way that food can be like a dollar spring raw the Vietnamese spice or the best steak at Peter Luger ever the fuck it is New York Peter look new New York will give you everything New York has everything it's fantastic goddamnit I'm moving to New York Brian pack your bag but we got BlueCross BlueShield what he's with us but where where are we going where are we going underground to a bunker with no akkad Isles where are we going is and where do I feel the happiest is I feel the happiest out of nature I feel the happiest at sea I feel the happiest in the forest I feel the happiest grilling meat over a grill you know all this shit ring Manhattan but forest but what I will tell you is I don't believe that the that the sort of Roman back an alien craziness that is New York today is going to be around that much longer I went back an alien well Roman like the end of Rome the Roman Empire and back an alien Bacchus the sort of the god of wine and drink and partying how obscure your references to ashes God a booze how do you know about these people I read books bitch okay I understand this man alien it means boozy it's been three times during this podcast at the MagSafe electrical cord connecting to my laptop has dropped off through my flailing hand that means it's a good'n dude you have a battery in last three hours you don't have to worry no no no I'm upset with Apple they change their charts all the time stop playing games no I okay right now I finally at 45 years of age I'm a part of an actual company that sells things and one of things that I realize is you can decide to make more money you fucks are you peeing no no hey I see I see the rapper we never came up with oh no off guard yeah of garden yeah just keep the camera off my man as he meditates into a trance a trap yeah I mean snap one off a Transcendental Meditation point where he understands the point of view that is in right now does not represent where he will be in infinity is if he is in fact a soul and if a soul transgresses from one point in history to another over and over and over until you get it right now that sounds like hippy bullshit but do you understand that Helio Gracie believed in this Helio Gracie said something wants if you don't know who he is his real name isn't Helio Gracie I say that for all you white people who don't understand how Brazilian people pronounce things but they pronounce the for whatever reason Helio Gracie hele Oh was pronounced le Oh Gracie that's how the Portuguese in Brazil used that that word Elio Gracie he said something once and he's the guy who trained Hickson Gracie and hoist Gracie the original winner of the UFC 1 and UFC 2 I mean hoist Gracie changed the entire face of martial wasn't he the dude who also said I'll take on all comers all weight classes and will will okay 10 or 100 grand or whatever is that the number changes but he said I'll take on any fighter any weight class and all fight them not only did Ilya Gracie do this he did this when he was a hundred and forty plus pounds it was like 145 he developed a method of using leverage and using technique to submit guys that were much much much larger than you okay he trained Hickson constrained hoist he trained some of the most influential martial artists in the history of the world yeah one of the things he said hold on a second one of the things he said is that you live this life and if you make even one mistake and you live this life incorrectly you will return and you will do it all over again until you get it right and that sounds crazy I heard about that I was like oh you motherfucker why you put on that bullshit on me there's no way anybody's never gonna live this life perfectly and get it and then I thought if anybody knows if anybody understands the path of man in its truest form without without hyperbole without directing other people's insecurities back on different folks to alleviate the pressure of reality if anybody's gonna understand who what the fuck is really going on it's gonna be a hundred and forty five pound man who's willing to take on the greatest fighters any but any fighter any fighter any style any way any weight or any fucking weight that's insane Kimura broke his arm with a Kimura it's a shoulder lock it's the cat wrestling guys call it a double restaurant a double wrist lock but this technique became known as a Kimura he broke his arm Aliya wouldn't tap out he let him break his own did you ever see the thing I did I went down to South Paulo and Rio and I hung out with the Gracie's and I hung out with the fighters down there the valley tudo guys they are the fucking toughest dudes in the fucking world these Divali tudo guys are fucking I know it's a crazy way to live now they're all fighting MMA they're all fighting UFC well they do that now because they realize this prosperity and that yeah they can they can get out of the better of the favelas but they are the toughest motherfuckers alive down yes what one of the most beautiful things about what a Leo said what ilio Gracie said when he said that he would like that that he literally had sort of figured out a way to test who you are and test what you could figure out and test what you could do and he truly believed in these most extreme of circumstances literally fighting these much larger much stronger men and letting them break his arms he believed that if you live this life that you must do it correctly and if you did anything wrong anything contrary to your spirit or contrary to the the soul or the collective idea of humanity as whole being of the utmost importance so you the one who is tested must represent humanity and in that saying that if you made any mistakes you would do it again I was so scared when I would I read that I was like that might be the one of the most frightening things I've ever read my life because he might be right right what if that guy in his battles literally almost to the death right he was fighting anybody modern day commits a bloodsport he was a small man exactly and he kicked the fuck out of it I weigh a hundred and ninety pounds that means this guy he was a hundred and forty five and he would take anybody more than me that's an insane amount of weight and this guy would take and I wouldn't take on anybody in the world he would take on big giant people and in throwing himself into the fire he had an understanding of human life and of human nature and he he sort of in some way relate that tonight can I give a shout out and kind of tell you one story are you giving a shot are you a black guy or a white rapper can I give this what's happening here I would like to give a shout out to one guy who I met he's a guy named Matt Ruskin right and he was in the Marines in Iraq and they had these fight clubs in Iraq and they would the Marines they were there for like Force Recon these were tough motherfuckers and he was doing this they had these fight clubs and they would fight the fucker and he he's like 200 pounds and he would fight guys or 250 he would fight guys or 150 he was fighting they would beat them all and he came back and he started doing MMA he started fighting MMA and he hooked up with this guy one of the Gracie's and and you taught him Brazilian jiu-jitsu of which he was I believe five-time world champion the Gracie which guy forgetting his fucking name like an amazing amazing guy Gracie yeah he's Gracie and I went down Roger Gracie well wait is he competed a heavyweight heavyweight he was heavy was five-time world Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion and well Rogers not quite a heavyweight he competes in MMA at 185 I don't think he fights this morning but he was he was used to Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion five times okay global champion anyway Matt Ruskin hooked me up with this guy who went down to to remember see Gracie but but he's a big big fucking heavyweight heavyweight yeah yeah heavyweight Gracie yeah I went down if you can look it up I went down with him on you shout out to echo shout out to heavyweight Gracie anyway but but I gotta say this Matt Ruskin the marine fought in Iraq came back started fighting with the Gracie's took me down there show me what the fuck was going on and I've got to say you know I learned the story of the Gracie's from the Gracie's when I was down there and that story of you know Brazilian jiu-jitsu and him sort of taking on all comers with with the bounty you know like if you can beat me I when I heard it was a million bucks but I think it was actually more like a hundred grand what years this is in like the 70s and 80s this is like the valley to toe times wait a minute a heavyweight Gracie from back there no no now then the Gracie that brought me down see I'm gonna call this I was great no Hollis Gracie is very famous but well Hollis of holes right it's Paul screams gonna get shit he's a real good-looking guy he was a model real good-looking guy Hickson this guy was actually a model in Brazil and Matt Ruskin if you can if you could tweet me as they yeah model and a great structure at Sears and five-time global your duty to champion we are now in a swamp of disinformation let's do know Wikipedia if someone could tweet us right now I'm gonna look at my phone I'm not I'm not mad Ruskin email me his name I'm sure Matt Ruskin has probably got a good Gator roll maybe an anaconda choke guard this guy was more of a jujitsu straight-up let me explain something no bullshit I've been doing jujitsu since 1998 and I've never heard of a Gracie heavyweight he seems like he's is that way he's a heavyweight who won world jiu-jitsu championship I understand okay go holler Gracie in MMA who was he beat Bob Sapp I think he's he fought in the UFC once he lost but I think it was more of a case of a when I when when a guy immediately gets thrown into the UFC there's a thing that happens causing it they called an adrenaline dump where you get in front of the the big cameras and you think about the hoist Gracie fights of 1993 and you panic it's like the overwhelming input of the the the moment is too much Matt how are you who's I'm here with Joe Rogan we're talking about the Gracie's meet artist and I'm saying who's Gracie Daniel Gracie well Daniel Daniel Gracie world you judge you champion how many times three times yeah so he's a global jiu-jitsu champion Daniel Gracie yeah I'm gonna put you on the rogen hold on st. talk to him by the way Matt Ruskin is fucking awesome dude and Matt what's up Matt well how do you know powerful Shane Smith from vice.com first of all how rude how about how about hey settle down first of all how about you tell them first and foremost that you love them you don't have to go right indeed you're you're a fat fucking you're gonna die he knows how much you love them you say that but is that to alleviate the only love I love it oh no gay stuff this is a late-night podcast there's a lot of dudes that are listening to this in the shower I'm sorry keep going Matt no gay stuff bro but we went tell me when we went down with Daniel grecia Daniel Grayson here's the thing about Daniel Gracie Daniel Gracie is a very very very talented brazilian jujitsu fighter but his real last name I don't believe was initially Gracie I think he sort of the Santos cousin yeah and I think his his mom's name was crazy but his dad's name and his birth name was not Gracie right yeah sky I believe this is what I believe I believe he's a very talented fighter but I believe this whole idea of connecting yourself to the word Gracie is is ultimately very self-defeating and and when a guy does that I almost want a poem Assad if Daniel you're a bad motherfucker whatever the fuck your last name is it doesn't matter you know you need to get your your head wrapped around the fact that that's all bullshit Gracie is a great name but in its 2013 and when he was competing eight nine ten whatever the fuck it was two thousand it doesn't matter what matters is how good you are and adopting the name Gracie almost makes people think like oh well this guy's trying to get a little extra attention for for no reason the world championships into the World Championship so you either mount a guy you take his back you tap them whatever you do you either do or you don't do and it doesn't matter if your name is marcelo garcia who's unbelievably respected I mean Marcel Garcia is the top of the pyramid when it comes to Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the world today in 2013 or gracie it doesn't matter so whatever his name was what was his real name man how many times you've been hiding your life don't lie to me have you been high in your life more than ten is it more than ten yes okay so we could probably go camping together how many times you eaten pot brownies and thought about chicks you fingered when you were 14 you were really upset like Kyra gate Gracie more than time that's why I love talking to you Matt let's keep it together Matt but there was a few guys that did that the Gracie thing where they used the word what I'm gonna say is Daniel Gracie's that me want to go what I'm gonna say he's a bad motherfucker but by the way he took us around Brazil he took us to the valley to do gyms he took us to the gyms he took us with Matt and I gotta say it was fucking I say you see a different level of shit down there then you will see anywhere else and you never end a story by saying like holy shit I was very good story I was with however you leave us I'm gonna say this give us a respective of the end I was I was with Matt on that and there was there was 14 year old kids don't lie to me Matt say yes okay listen bro I feel what you're saying and I was only fucking around I was feeling some dead space where we're trying to recalibrate our reality due to your circumstances and your story being paradigm shifting I'm not that fun listen I want to tell you bat man I'm giving you a shout-out I love you this guy fucking is an awesome guy ex-marine and a fighter I love you mad man I'm very sorry they got dragged into a podcast it was just a phone call for you and all of a sudden Shane Smith talking about some crazy shit and you're like god damn it I gotta tell the truth cuz I'm mad but but but then you're not Ruskin I don't give a fuck but Daniel Gracie is a badass motherfuckers yes unquestionably was his real name Matt Daniel Gracie what is his real name and I completely by the way I want to let everybody know there's no judgment involved Matt whatsoever I completely understand why someone who especially was in a situation where they were a very talented guy and they were trying to maximize the the sort of the the spread of their name as far as possible and the word Gracie because of hoist and because of Horry inand what they were they accomplished in UFC one it was one of the most important moments in the history of martial arts would you agree Matt it'sit's for people who don't know the history of it or weren't there when it's happening as martial artists it was one of the most important moments ever it's like all of a sudden we found out what really works right and those guys that named that Gracie named that shit's like q-tips or Kleenex you know it's synonymous I don't give a fuck about your tissues if you have tissues made by Kraft macaroni and cheese if they're right next to Kleenex I'm taking the Kleenex okay cuz they dominate as does the NFL they dominate as well you know I'm saying Matt Jesus Christ back me up 100% thank you man thank you in what way like Daniel Daniel was a you know why do you know why do you know why cuz they're smart motherfuckers cuz they're smart motherfuckers and they know how to make that paper son Matt don't don't freeze up on me now we're in the deep end of the pool Matt and we're not close to the lip hang in there are you with me buddy I'm sorry listen man I need to apologize to you as a human being you didn't know what the fuck was going on here you got dragged into this conversation Shane Smith calls you it's East Coast West Coast or Mountain Time what I'm just what I'm trying to say is Matt is an awesome dude do you hear this man he said Matt is it Shane Smith just said Matt is an awesome dude and then your grace he's an awesome and Daniel grace is awesome dude and what and what it showed me was almost credit we're not trying to discredit any of that Matt you understand this correct no not yet in three minutes listen what's important Matt is you understand that I respect and adore daniel Gracie and anybody gets in there I just think that if I could be have been there when hens Oh and all those other guys are trying to talk Daniel and you using the last name Gracie so let's think through so Wanderlei Silva they're pretty good with the name Silva

superfan I will say I will say one last thing cuz I this has been going on from 800 hours but I will say this how about fucking Joe Rogan Joe Rogan fucking shut up between Fear Factor and your UFC shit and all your other shit but the fucking podcast that you do and by the way I'm sitting here in a room with 700 cameras two red bandanas set up I was sitting here doing we're doing podcast with you the fact that you do these podcasts and you finance these podcasting do these podcast I've got to say I fucking hand it to you my friend I fucking hand it to you how about this you gotta take you got it if I say you're fucking awesome you have to fucking take it I understand sweetie pie but here's the problem with that you can never believe you again if you start talking to me in these crazy superlatives and tell me how awesome I am like this guy's basically full of shit I'm gonna tell you the truth lock it up and throw them in a dark place oh my oh now see now this is gonna be you in the back alley but I'm gonna tell you the truth is you don't have to do these fucking podcast you don't have to fucking sit here and deal with shitheads like me but I will tell you that's when you're wrong sir because what a factor money comes in a fine us us us us talking about this shit is because you fucking paid for this fucking room with all the cash in the fucking microphone is not for this room this is mostly Brian's the only thing I paid for with my iMac well I like thank you yes and I give kudos to you and if you don't take it then I'm gonna put this pan up yours okay this is you normally I would say thank you very much but this you you're absolutely allowed to but I have to tell you that in this particular situation since we're at the ice house this was 99% Brian's work which I give him fucking straight-up kudos well I'm trying to fucking buy fucking Footwear off of me won't give it no what I'm saying is that I although he's I gave him a strange situation but Brian and I have been friends and employees and I try to distance myself from the employee aspect as much as possible but he really created this whole room he decorated it he's a smart motherfucker our friend Brendan gave us that branch sure Brandon gave us that picture I asked him to put that up and that's it it's all Brian's you don't have to do these podcasts and the fact the fact that you do these podcasts no but the fact that you have Anthony Bourdain and the fact you have me the fact you have all these people on that is something special and I know we always get to this at the end of it but I gotta say what you're doing with with Brian and with yourself come on now at least accept the fact that that's an important fucking in this fucking thing and by the way if you don't accept it I will do something bad with this problem a t-shirt on I got my keys and my knuckles and I'm ready to fucking party Tania you're asking me to take the kool-aid and fucking brush my teeth with Joe Rogan amazing tonight Justin even though my gums have lacerations on them will allow the the the sacred liquid from the kool-aid to get into my bloodstream I'm not willing I'm not willing it's it's I want everyone in the Joe Rogan Universe to tweet the motherfuck out of him because Joe Rogan is the fucking man there's a lot of douche bags that are me 20 years from now they're gonna fuck that guy the reality I'm gonna say I like Joe Rogan I like red band death squad powerful I love all you guys I love you I love you very very unusual podcast but all podcast with my favorite one of all time yeah it

trying to do is what any cool person tries to do is you're trying to spread the love as far as possible to as many people's the PISA the people that listen to this fucking podcast are the people that I give a shit about and I don't give a shit about all these people that you give a shit about the don't listen to this because they don't know about it but the reality is that that the ethic of what Brian is trying to put forth and when I am and unquestionably without a shadow of a doubt in my heart what you're trying to put forward it is what resonates with a lot of the people that are sort of waking up in the middle of history and looking at this crazy world that is handicapped and sidetracked and and it hobbled by these ancient traditions that were written back when people couldn't even fly fucking planes and didn't even have printed type and there was no internet and unfortunately this distribution of information is far more Swift than the absorption of it amongst the people and the the altercation or the changing of the culture because of that information and your let me tell you you're in the front you have none of this I put Brian improve cloth dental I'm gonna tell you if we can finish with this one last thought all right you finish with this one last thought what is this one last thought why the rabbit you you can we just say Abba Dabba Shabbat Gazoo snow it's not as
