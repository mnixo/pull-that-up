the girag an experience when you were talking about to change the subject a little bit when you were talking about being honest and crazy I had a great acting teacher I think I can say his name cuz he actually talks about it he's a really good teacher he was a medic in Vietnam for two tours he's seen everything you know and he was like one of the first great people that somebody said to him in class you know we stay class from 7 to 12 I'll say because I love him his name is Richard Lawson he's a really special guy and he's got a great acting class and he said somebody said I never seen you yawn and he goes yeah because I don't put my attention on myself I put my attention out there I'm not thinking about being tired I don't focus on the fatigue and they were like what do you mean he goes I learned in Vietnam watching when a Vietcong when an American would get shot a lot of times they go into shock when you get shot you go oh my god I got shot and a lot of the time what caused you to go into shock is also a notion that you get shot in your heart starts beating really fast because you're terrified because you might die I mean you go into that notion the Vietcong they get shot in these horrific injuries and you could still interrogate them because they'd be putting their attention out there they would immediately start focusing and their whole way of thinking anyway was they were a leaf on a tree they weren't the tree so for whatever reason they wouldn't go into shock as quickly they would immediately put their attention on you know something in front of them so they weren't focusing on the wound and he said he used to see that when he was a medic taking care of people he saw such a fundamental striking difference in the mindset between the Vietcong and an American GI and he was so impressed with their ability to focus on anything but themselves they were not part of this equation they were very small part of the equation that he used it in his own life you know he would use this idea if he was tired or you know feeling sick that he would just literally put his mind over there off himself taking self I would actually watch himself move through what he had to get done I bet you probably get a lot more energy out of just doing that than opposed to like festering on the idea that you're tired of course which is I always found that the things that I just test the most and other people are the things I'm terrified of seeing in myself and a person that doesn't know how to like push through shit and get things done and just come on come on get up just yeah do it get done get it done guess I'm terrified at being that guy I'm terrified of not getting shit done yeah you know and it forces me to find it to be gross and other people you know right it's like one of the things that scares me about them taking a wrestling out of the Olympics ah that's the worst yeah it's crazy all the sport in the Olympics it's and the fact that it's not even in every high school I think there's some real lessons to be learned that a lot of people are never going to learn and those lessons are how to get through difficult shit how to get through physical difficulty and doing things physical which a lot of people are avoiding you get a more balanced mastery of your own mind and that's a fucking important aspect of being a human being a lot of people are skipping that step a lot of people are skipping that stuff I agree it can it can fuck you in the long run man it can give you the extra push towards saying something stupid it can give you the extra bad energy to take a well you know look to get good at anything you know let's take wrestling or judge it as an example if you're if you want to get good you better work it what you're bad at you better work into things you're bad at you can't go in there tap people out with it stuff that you constantly know because the guys that are working on the stuff they're not good at are gonna surpass you it did you just learn that the hard way if you're not careful and I think everything is that way you know you better you better work at what you are then you gain a lot of it a lot of that times I'll tell you you know hey you better music better than musical instrument learn how to do something what I like about doing playing the drums I got to learn how to do four different things with which each limb it's really difficult to do I gain a lot from just the practice and the stretch of trying to learn how to be have all four limbs doing something independent that's that's really interesting to me it actually changes my whole mindset I actually approach things very differently for the rest of my day it's really weird I can't explain how or define out but it does make a difference I think when you take on new activities your mind when it starts concentrating on some new thing whether it's playing drums or a new game you're trying to master or whatever the fuck it is when your mind gets really enthusiastic about things and starts trying to figure things out and working towards and achieving like little goals you get invigorated yeah it's this feeling of invigoration whenever you pursue anything that you find to be fun anything that you find to be stimulating but the real thing is like everybody's idea of what stimulating is different right just is a nod and the real problem is like that poor kid his fucking dad keeps pushed him into football and he really wants to suck cock and dance yes you know mean little dance might be the best dancing cocksucker like movie Billy Elliot remember Billy Elliot it's like ballet you do bot lacing yeah I didn't see the movie Billy Elliot yeah I'm a man he's a creep I'm an actual man that's what I need baby grinders kids for kid growing no he comes from a coal mining video with Billy Illinois because I'm a coal mining family and the guys like this hard-ass coal miner in the north of England like mine just lives in this movie it's about just an english movie from manchester and the kid wants to be an independent movie uh no it's really popular there but he wants to be a ballet dancer he's an amazing ballet dancer he's an incredible dancer his father's like Bali Bali like he can't believe he's so angry is like Bali my son's gonna do ballet not on my you know and it's just a disaster for him but that's what he is he's a fucking ballet dancer that's a great you gotta find out what you grow what your groove is what's your groove is it playing the drum goes back to the truth yeah what is your truth if you try to if you try to avoid it you're gonna get yourself in some foot you're gonna be on antidepressants you're gonna have to mask that that metric just do what you're supposed to it is amazing that there's no one that's ever come out with a really effective guidebook on how to live life in a successful direction like no one can ever tell you how to be successful yeah I mean what is successful to you is not successful someone else yes at or etc but to teach you how to manage the whole big package it's like the the the whole idea of managing the thoughts in your mind is just missing from school this did I have to decide that you're I'm laughing because when when people are self-conscious like in my class this guy Richard Lawson is acting did somebody was like whenever like this guy this guy was like embarrassed that he'd done something like I'm fine I'm just embarrassed by it my teacher goes like this because hey I fucked a pig I went what niggas yeah I fucked a pig I'm writing about it right now you don't think that's embarrassing I'll tell you everything about myself i fucked the pig when i was a kid how about that and everybody just stopped and they were like well you know what if you're going to admit that I can MIT I can admit fucking anything and it just liberate you when like somebody who's the leader in a group goes hey guys guys guys in case you guys can everybody stop acting like a fucking Puritan because we're all pretty fucked up and and and I'm the most fucked up bang you know so I don't know there was a point to that but but which is kind of piggybacking on what you're trying to say which is essentially you know just just whatever your fucking truth is just be honest with yourself and maybe with a couple your friends and then just fucking follow that
