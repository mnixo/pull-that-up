can I have your doe permit and I was like what he's like my brother had been getting a doe permit in my name for like 20 years oh really yeah yeah yet all these forged Oh permits he shot animals all year long he didn't really the game warden was bust into his home with a bolt cutter you know lock cutters and uh crack open his freezer and there'd be all this game out of season oh man he yeah but you know he ate it right but he yeah yeah he didn't abide by the rules well no no he did not abide by anyone's rules his his funeral was uh it was awesome and eclectic but there's two things someone should have given me a heads-up well first of all the couple of pallbearers were in camo really yeah yeah you're serious hunter Oh hunter biker where do you live central New York in Syracuse and in Rome and around but yeah I love my brother but he was wild and and then the other thing they probably should have given me a heads up that its friend a little Ricky was one of the pallbearers yeah he was uh it's like I'm I don't want to use the word I was gonna say he's like a munchkin good save I didn't want to use the other M word I mean he wasn't a tiny person it's a little person he wasn't a dwarf but cuz you write you know he was regular-sized almond I know he was tiny right but he didn't look you know I mean I get it but nobody said Ricky was going to be a pallbearer or give me a heads-up so I looked down the end of the church he's in the middle on one side of the casket and then middle yeah and I said to my daughter go looks like Ricky's riding a subway my dad is like I think you just got air and so the priest is going on about how my brother Tommy loved the outdoors and he loved animals and then I went on after the priest I go Father I don't want to be you know impolite but my my brother liked to kill animals I said there's a lot of deer right now in the woods going whoo-whoo upstate New York's a very dear rich place but you have a lot of Tolerance those animals a lot of yeah well are accidents well there's a lot and there's more now than when when I was a kid but when you know Tony v bosse and Kili so Tony I went out to visit my brother I'd given him some money to buy some windows for his house it's a long story but he lived this is what he's really out in the woods and we pull up to his yard and there's just um there's just corn growing like there's no rose it's his whole front and back yard of corn like there's like psycho corn there's no rose or anything right and and Tony didn't know my brother and he comes out and goes hey what's what's up with the corn he's like it's for the deer Bobby you know he's like until he's like oh you help them through the winters like no I'm gonna blast them my brother it's Tomatoes he just into your house
