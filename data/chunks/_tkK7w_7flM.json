hello freak bitches one of the most interesting things that I learned from the injury was was how how your physical health or well-being alters your perception of the world like I have you ever heard of this study they they do like the hot and cold cup study where they have someone come in to fill out a survey you know that's what they tell them and then a person gets in an elevator and they and there's a there's someone in there like Confederate an actor is in there that's like here I my hands are full could you hold this cup for me and it's either like a hot cup of coffee or whatever or a cold drink and person's like sure takes the drink goes up the elevator gets off gives it back to them you know says bye goes in takes a survey and then afterwards and this is what it's actually about afterwards they go did you meet anyone in the way in and actually someone I met someone in the elevator and then they'll be like so can you can you describe that person and if they had if they had the hot drink they'll they were more they would more often describe them as being like warm or friendly and if they had the cold drink they would they would describe them as like cold or dissin and and the idea is is that that that the the way our brains evolved kind of these these higher ideas of what like being distant as a personality trait or whatever means has to be built over this pre-existing kind of five senses kind of software and and so so there's all these metaphors for things so you call someone like bright or you say we're having a deep conversation or someone's shallow so a lot of these ways in which we describe life is is kind of used through these physical metaphors and I remember when I when I broke my feet I remember thinking the whole fucking world is broken like I remember thinking it like eyes on eyes going down this mountain for like 3 3 hours and I wasn't just worried about my feet ice also like in the fucking political system is it like everything just seemed broken like the whole world and then I also remember after I got the second surgery after the bone infection and stuff and having to change all this I remember feeling like like something like this nagging feeling that I couldn't get over I was like something's like missing from my life there's just this deep like hole like somewhere in my soul in my light and then one day I realize I'm like oh there's a fucking hole in my foot there's an actual hole in my foot that's what's missing and and just how much that that your your physical senses can alter what your perception of the world is the food denial floods and the food jumps out of the ground and under the under the with with this with a series of genuinely enlightened rulers or at least pretty close to enlightened rulers ruling them that all lasts for 3500 years and how did they live you see everything that they did intact until quite recently there were no such things as jobs there were trades and crafts and skills and arts and everybody I mean yes in Europe the combination of a repressive church and an oppressive nobility kept everybody you know and immersed in serfdom in one way or another but what people actually did with their lives was in some sense or another transformational all of it it takes a lot of smarts to be a good peasant all of these things that people used to do as a matter of course and in Egypt you see it really you see it carved into the walls and everyone thinks these are the scenes of daily life well they are scenes of daily life with the decodable as transformational activities so anything that you do where you're doing martial martial arts this is a highly developed skill you are somebody that you wouldn't be if you would didn't have that skill if you were doing a podcast and what you did for a living was flipping burgers at McDonald's you wouldn't be Joe Rogan do you you've you've you've been doing your homework without maybe even thinking that it was homework because anything that you're involved in that that you go at with a quest for perfection of whatever it is has this transformational value and when you recognize when you know it let's say when you know it intellectually when you can articulate it it doesn't it it implements the actually the activity itself so it's possible even to do that you could be an invert it you could be an enlightened burger flipper and the Sufis are very good at you know the Sufi is in life but not is in love I sorry is in life but not of it in other words you can you can practice waking up as it were in the midst of the most mundane thing you could be you could you could be an enlightened garbage raclette garbage collector as long as you knew what you were doing it's a totally different thing I would imagine I'm not a garbage collector that's a totally different thing to collect the garbage consciously than it is to just do it resentfully because that's the only job that you can get although right so when we're talking it's it's not as though this is it's not as though this is anything actually new it's is a that's the oldest idea that ever was and it's something that people have been doing for thousands and thousands of years I had hunted around that area previously you know so I knew there was elk in the area I just had never been that far back in before and I tell you to tell you the truth it are nearly completely failed on me because I went days and days without hearing or seeing an elk but the sign was there to say that or in in there it's just that the Grizzlies and the the wolves were hunting that area is so hard that it shut they walk up and pushed a lot of them out of the area mmm yeah and then I was nearly the new food source so Wow so when you get in there and you don't see anything for a couple of days like what is the mindset like what do you guys hate to doubt and there's always that it's like you second-guess yourself this was a stupid move you shouldn't have came in here you need to change spots but then it's like but at the same time you're experiencing this for a reason this is how hunting should be hunting should be hard shit hunting should never be unless you've done your research going into a place and there's just like game walking past area where there should always be because that's the hunt right finding it or going through the hardship to find it tracking it finding find them where's the better spot within that area so at the same time that when one is like you know you've made a bad decision this is a crap spot to be there's the whole experience of like nuts this is how hunting should be should be difficult you should have to work your ass off to try and find the animal and when you actually do find that animal how much better is it because you know it's just like if if you hunted for 11 months and you didn't see a ball you found the ball you had a shot in your missed but then the next one you get how good's that next one that you get you know if that was the case and it was very similar on this trick where I put in all that effort didn't see an animal one opportunity a bull comes in I end up calling that bull from like a mile away you could just hear him coming up this Canyon and I did that shot and dude i teed it up I was crying because I knew how much had gone into it you know and it's not just the effort but you know like obviously I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids I'm away from the kids for a month now there's all that sacrifice is all the hardship there's all the effort there's walking in there's putting up with that absolutely atrocious Weber and then finally one opportunity comes up and you kill that animal as well as kill an animal that's a hard thing to do man I balled up I was crying like I think I cried a dozen times every time I thought about it when I was standing over the ball I was crying Wow and I'm like that's why it's got to be that hard so you can appreciate the animal so you realize what has to go into the hunt to actually get something killed should I think everyone should be like that I hope they're not but there's a there's a lot of elk [Music]
