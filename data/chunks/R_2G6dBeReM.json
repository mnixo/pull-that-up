hello freak bitches you don't think of that as being a stress like they think of stress as being bills they think of stress as being traffic no stresses every all those things are stressed relationships friendships work conflict when you're at work all day and you hate your job that's stress that is stress that grinds on you yeah that feeling like when you get out of work at the end of the day and you have that weight lifted off your shoulders that means you're in a bad job you got to figure out a way where you don't have that if it's possible if it's possible fine that way that was

depressed on Friday because I knew Monday was coming yeah I know that feeling it was fucking it was goddamn hell but I was making a shitload of money my mom was so proud of me I had the 401k in the six weeks off vacation I was living quote the American dream I fucking hated myself i sat around I remember this is a turning point for me i sat around a boardroom table and I was a lot younger than my closest peer I'm looking at all these older dudes and we're all sitting there in suits and like we're so fucking important you know being those dickheads and they're all over waiting they're all they all have red faces and they're all talking about how they're gonna fucking you know sneak off to the bar before they go home because they don't wanna deal with the fucking family in the kids and all the fucking bullshit I did it fuck out here I have to get the fuck out of here or I'm gonna fucking die like this I gotta change my life and that's what we did and I kind of threw that away resign from the position took the job as the strength coach team quest up in a Portland Oregon moved across the country for fucking minimum-wage to clean toilets and left that job behind and I fucking loved it I loved scrubbing disgusting shitty gym mats at five o'clock in the morning and not sitting in a beautiful corner office you know for X amount of dollars per year because I was I was doing what I love and I gave myself the opportunity and a chance you know to do something with my life and get literate of the stress I think that's why I'm kind of you know veering well if that's what it was talking I was so stressed out yeah how's riding my bike fuck I remember it was freezing cold fucking raining and I'm riding my fucking stupid bike because we won vehicle yeah my wife had to go fucking work I'm riding my fucking bike six miles to the gym and I fucking loved it it was such a pure crisp cold morning and I was just so alive in life you know and it was everything was brand new again I was in my mid-twenties at that point made later 20s at that point fucking cool shit man but he gave me the best advice ever that ever got in comedy and I talk about this in my act a little bit like I tell the story but we were hanging out after we did a show one night in Cleveland at the at this big amphitheater and after the show I'm talking to these two girls you know like you're so funny and I'm like what you come back to the hoedown come hang out Dave might stop by you know pick up these chick he was gonna stop by though imagine if you were in the middle of boning her and she heard

you open to it it was so look at you you're close really it was nice it was really nice so I'm starting these two girls after one of the shows in Cleveland and uh and I'm like come back to the hotel and they're being wishy-washy and I'm like all right whatever and they take my number and I go backstage and I'm bitching to Dave and the the tour bus driver about these chicks and I'm like you know they fucking just being on wishy-washy and I don't know this I don't know it's just annoying just fucking hang out if you're gonna hang out and the bus driver goes Joe I'm gonna tell you what you need to do man you need to walk up to that girl look her dead in the eye and say do you want to suck my dick or nothing okay and I was like terrible advice I was like okay okay and and I was considering it for a second and then Chappelle goes don't do that shit man don't do it you're gonna fuck around Joe you're gonna get famous one of these days ten years from now that bitch will be on hard copy Joe DeRosa told me to suck his dick in Cleveland once and that's it that's how I grew up I mean mmm I would go out a lot of times during school and I'd just go up and sleep on the mountain come back do chores milk cows go to school you know go to football practice go home do chores go up on the mountain and sleep on the mountain come back home I mean that was kind of how how old my brothers and I grew up and it's just I mean I just have a yearning for the wild I mean there's some of the coolest experiences that I've had in life have been when I'm by myself and go and do something just so totally random that that nobody else would really even think about I say shit I shouldn't say nobody but it's like you know in college I'd drive home two hours to my folks house and I'd drive another hour up to the canyon by the time I get to the trailhead it's 11 o'clock at night hike in for three or four hours find somewhere sleep get up on top of the mountain and I'm sitting there as the sun's coming up and three Wolverines come up you know and circle the lake and it's like back then you know and then in the 90s there weren't Wolverines in Idaho they weren't supposed to be anyway I mean I was one of the very first or very few to actually see wild Wolverines in Idaho and it's like had I not been there by myself experiencing that in that Canyon you know if there's other people or other things those Wolverines might not have been as comfortable you know but because I was there by myself and I'm the only one there looking down over it I had that experience and there's there's a lot of opportunities like that that when you have someone else there you're focused on the group you're focused on your conversations your buddies your friends and everything you're not you're not really tuned in to what's around you you're not tuned in to your surroundings and so there's certain things that I think you miss out on when you've got other people there and that's not that I don't enjoy that sometimes but I feel like when I'm there like there's a connection you know there's a connection to the land there's a connection to the environment and you know you could bring all of into if you're if you're a hippie you know tree hugger voodoo type of person you bring in the nature and the gods and all that kind of stuff into the whole element but that really and truly is what is what it is is you're out there with no one but yourself and God in his creation I mean that's it it's all surrounding you yeah and being like that deep in nature where you're actually a part of it because you're not you're not talking to anyone so there's no there's no conversations going on plenty of conversations just with myself yeah but you don't I'm saying it's like you don't there's nothing no anchor that brings you back to civilization you're just seeing wild shit you're just seeing wildlife you're seeing animals that would exist that way regardless of whether or not you're there or not
