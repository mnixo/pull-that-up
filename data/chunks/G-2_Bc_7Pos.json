three to Jamie with the quick count Jimmy door we're long we're live Oh fantastic you use headsets or no headset talk to you I just feel lonely if I'm the only guy with headsets oh okay better well I guess I got the prime - you're what hey what time's it it's 1101 one minute after eleven fifty nine minutes from the top of 12 hours did you ever do that jeopardy like a regular radio show I had in college I had a radio show but it wasn't real it was just broadcast - no one actually it turned out we're supposed to be going out to the campus and then we found out about three months in it wasn't going out to anybody I always had dreams of doing a radio show but I always knew that I would fuck it up you know I'm like I'd get fired or something I never and I never thought anybody would hire me yeah I got in trouble for at that station for for playing the same song three times in a row it sounds so good yeah I liked it it was a song I don't even remember was like some off-brand I never heard of them beef like the Rivini brothers or like that's a fun saga they fired you from a college station fire me I came in and they yelled at me and I was like this doesn't even going out to anyone and if it was a nice day and I had to do my radio shift I would just come in in simulcast with the FM because I was on AM simulcast with the FM station because I wanted to go out and cry I want to sit next day I wonder if anybody has done this I mean I don't think you could do it and put ads on it but you could do it as just a fun project have your own radio show on a podcast we just play songs could you do that Jamie no I think because you can't give P if you give people a download of a song that's illegal yeah that's why yeah so you could stream it though maybe like stream it on YouTube maybe maybe but not but you'd still have to pay some kind of royalties for those songs I don't know what even if you weren't making any money off of it you'd have to pay I think so if someone's streaming near jokes they have to pay yeah but the thing is nobody wants to hear your jokes more than once that's the problem with jokes that's not true Joe really all right first of all let me blow smoke up your ass a little bit I'm not actually it's a sincere so I've seen you do comedy before I saw you we did the 2004 I think it was the Aspen we were on the opening night show at the wheeler Opera House and then I saw you do sets at The Improv and I always thought you were funny you know but I never remembered any of your jokes and then I saw you at the Comedy Store a couple weeks ago and I went doing your act ever since I've been telling your jokes everywhere I go to anybody who will listen and everybody falls down laughing those jokes that you have first of all the joke about Weinstein is just so goddamn funny and then the jokes about the wrestling god damn it you know and I it's it's hard for me to not say them right in your face right now I know it would be not good if I did your jokes right to you but I can't not do those are some of the funniest jokes I've heard in a long time and I know people are gonna be saying oh he's such a kiss-ass I'm not kidding I love comedy and I love jokes and I can remember jokes that I like and Mary White's thing that's so rushed to get that onto a Netflix special because I'm worried it's gonna get old yeah right right now you know it's like it happened a couple of months ago it's still okay and I'm recording an April and I'm like boy April is like the wire that's like under the wire yeah I think it'll be okay cuz there's not gonna be a bigger raper or whatever then Harvey Weinstein could come he's probably is a pinnacle right right like if you had a Cosby joke today it's still okay because he's such a raper that's right I forgot cause me your ID you forget did you see the recent shit where Cosby was at a barber shop there's videos of him hanging out at the barbershop talking about jazz trivia total the barbershop guys in Philly know yeah he actually performed recently at a jazz club yeah he showed up at this jazz club and performed and then announced that he was gonna perform at another place he's like he's back while he's in between trials Wow so see that's the weird thing I always wondered like he was still selling tickets yeah like people will still show up to see him well before the no one before anyone knew for sure what was going on there was a couple of accusations and everybody was like what is this like what what is this really is this real is this someone doing a shakedown and then the started they'll just the fucking tsunami of accusations started piling in which is really incredible when you think about how many years that guy was doing that it's unbelievable how you he could get away with that for so long and it's terrifying and then something and then now it's like you just go on a bad date in here you get in trouble like Aziz Ansari yes yeah well it's the pendulum swings you know I think it's it's it's kind of open season on men right now and it'll swing back around it'll be normal again and you know it makes sense you know you there's so many of these accusations that happen you know after a while they pile up and then there's just like anti-male resentment and then they'll swing back and normalize and people were sort of reacting Thea zis thing and they say well that went a little too far and then the woman who was in charge of the California woman who was a big me too supporter she got busted did you see that oh no yeah she was grabbing some dude's dick no she was drunk and she's she's a congresswoman no kidding yeah yeah you have ever girl do that too yeah yes been grabbed you know like bill burr said this famously in who's a hundred percent correct it's after shows drunk women in their 40s they get a little liquored up they get crazy and they just don't get a little grabby they grab that ass then go for it and you know did you did you feel violated no you know it's it's anybody who says it's not different for men is just a liar it's not physically scary it's like if my daughter comes and punches me and kicks me you know like she'll do that for fun just as a joke it's not threatening right it's fun that's silly but if you did it I'd be like hey man don't fucking hit me like a man hits you it's different like if a man is trying to grab a woman's ass you're talking about someone larger grabbing someone smaller it's scary it's dangerous the real threat of rape is actually right no 40 old ladies gonna rape me you know it's not gonna happen unless I want it to it's just not it's not gonna go down that way eally sick that's he's something really wrong with me well there was this guy and see this is behind like remembering jokes I haven't seen this guy probably tell jokes for 25 years his name is Paul Kelly and it was right in the in the 80s or at the end of eighties when when women were in the workforce and that was like one day to time remember that show it's all about and so things were weird in the workplace men didn't know how to talk to women and how to act and then they would go out she's just like one of the guys remember that they would say that that was the highest compliment you could give a woman she's like one of the guys we don't have to act weird around her and this guy Paul Kelly that's when people started to talk about sexual harassment and he said see men we don't understand what that is mm-hmm it's like oh wait a minute you mean you're gonna touch my dick while I type and I get insurance well we say that but dude my friend TJ do you know the amazing atheist do you know is oh I do know who he is I've seen his joke but I'm not you too very funny guy yeah he told me and he's kind of an introvert he told me that he was working in an office once in a woman who was his boss was sexually harassing him and it was completely unwanted and she would grab him and he would lock up the fries and be uncomfortable and and it was gross you know he said it was he was rude but he's up big guy I mean he wasn't physically in danger I'm sure it felt super uncomfortable but it's always gonna be a knotch several notches less scary well because she can't take out her dick and stick it than you there you go that's right the thing is the violation yeah that's like the fact that someone could physically hold you against your will and his penetrate menu yeah yeah take yeah get into your body yes inside inside of you yeah like a woman literally can't do that she can engulf you that could be scary because when engulfing you know Jesus go this doesn't seem as scary though what same violation what happened officer well he said he was engulfed he engulfed my dick with his ass he just took it over just tell you why it's not joke just tell it no it'll be on I'm recording in April so it's closed tell there were only two months so what have you done that wrestling joke on a special but now that's all all the stuffs new that's all the stuff is from my you know from my last special which was last year to now well you know I have been what it was it what makes I think that set stick in my mind also is that I've made me jealous right like you know when you I don't know if you get jealous I still get jealous when I see someone doing something better than me I want to do it and I'm like god damn it it made me want to get out and calm can I haven't been doing comedy as much and you know it's like a muscle I think Jerry Seinfeld said if I don't do comedy for about four days the I notice a difference and if I don't do comedy for five days they can notice so I haven't been since I started my youtube show it's uh I have them into a stand up as much as I should and I stopped touring like I should and and I miss it I want to do another special and watching and that night of comedy at The Comedy Store made me go goddamnit I gotta get out here it's the highest compliment you could pay a comic god damn it it was like out that many times you know that feeling of just being inspired so I go home and write yeah and I was you know I mean my set went fine but it wasn't I'm not on my game right now right now I have to really start working it again which I have started and I'm going out and it's it's my I forgot it's like this is all I ever wanted to do in my life was stand-up comedy and like being a stand-up comic to me was like being Ray Liotta in Goodfellas like you know I didn't wait in line I fucking what it's something I took it I said you know I don't fucking follow rules or listen to your bullshit I fucking do what I want I say what I want and they pay me for it and that's I just fucking love that shit and it and then I started doing the YouTube show and I it becomes a job right for me and it's a grind in a sense and dude comedy I so miss sleeping till noon and then getting up working out having all you had to do is figure out Who am I gonna have lunch with today I was my big decision right Who am I gonna have lunch with then I go home after the lunch I have a nap then I go on do a show it's bond was the greatest life in the world why did I fuck it but you must enjoy doing your YouTube show - I do because through but it helped me to discover who I am more because as a stand-up I I was like Bill Hicks was my favorite guy when I saw Bill Hicks in Chicago I almost quit because I was in comedy about three or four years and I was like I fucking know what I'm doing you know and everything before I got on stage that be like wait till they get a load of me you know I was like that guy fucking bad-ass Chicago and then everybody talked about this guy Bill Hicks right and I was like I'll go check this guy out so I sat down and he starts his set and about two minutes in I started drinking and then about five minutes and I started drinking more and about 10 minutes and I was convinced I was gonna quit comedy because my whole life you know I always thought like George Carlin was my hero and I was like you know if I do everything right I could maybe be like George Carlin for one special like maybe if I get everything right and I really work it and I saw Bill Hicks and I knew that I was and I was always gonna be competing for second place and so when he died it made me feel a lot better I was like I'll fuck I'm back now with the saddest thing when he died of course he was my hero and you know I didn't really know him I knew him tangentially and it was weird to feel that kind of sadness for someone who don't know personally and so that was a big deal to me watching Bill Hicks it totally changed my life and I tried to be like him of course like an idiot I tried to be like him and you can't right and and then one time I was dating this girl and might be my wife I don't know who told me this but she said you don't look like you where you come from because I come from the south side of Chicago grew up poor 12 kids drinking powdered milk you know and having the shit beat out of me from the fucking morning till night right because I went to Catholic school a tough neighborhood am i so and she's like you can't be angry like Bill Hicks because you look like you come from privileged money and you're dressed well I always like to dress nice because I grew up poor I always wanted to be and so that's when I had to buy pull back on the anger onstage and I was like if you watch my specials on Comedy Central I'm very not and doing the YouTube show is what let me connect with my anger which is always what drives me that's interesting that is what has connected with people and that's when I really started selling tickets and my everything you know everything I wanted to get from comedy in a sense I got from this YouTube show so now I can go wherever I want and do a show and just my fans will show up it's it's the greatest thing that ever happened in my life well you're very good on your YouTube show and you're also very fair you know one of the things that I really like about your show is you you are but you're obviously a left-leaning guy but you're very balanced in your criticism of the left and your criticism of criticism of the left and well if you have to lie to make your point you don't have a good point I agree with you a thousand percent so it's such an important thing that's being missed today yeah and I don't know that and I don't know I've gone back and forth on issues everybody I shouldn't be allowed to go back and forth on issues you know I was I was against gun control I was for gun control then I was against it again I mean you know right so it's the thing that people give me a lot of heart I get I get more of a hard time from people who consider themselves on the left then people who consider themselves on the right today right today this is a new thing though is in the last decade right it's because it'd be less than a decade well to me it's since it's it really started with Bill Clinton in 92 but it didn't get really ramped up until Barack Obama in like 2010 when it was clear that Barack Obama was a neoliberal corporatist who was going to do the bidding of the war machine and Wall Street and big pharma which is why when the Democrats got control of government they had the presidency the Senate filibuster proof Senate for a few months and they had the Congress and the house and they didn't pass single-payer or even a public option what do we get we got a right-wing healthcare plan anyway which is a giveaway to the pharma and health insurance companies that left out 28 million fucking babies and infuriated small business owners infuriated people that were that had a small practice that there were doctors and you know and all sorts of people that it was better than what we had it was a bad so it wasn't a solution what it was was a solution for the pharmaceutical companies in the health insurance company how was it better than what we had well because you before there was pre-existing conditions and you couldn't get coverage so then I suppose said so now you could always get coverage so that part was better though yeah you can get covered even if you had an issue right right so then you could go and you could go on in exchange and stuff like that I didn't ever had to do that always got through my wife's employer I'd always had my health insurance right and by the way having health insurance is doesn't really mean that much I got really sick and what you were talking about this before this was that's the dis the different thing but I got had a an illness so they couldn't diagnose for a few years and it almost killed me right and it wasn't it was called hypophosphatemia osteomalacia whoa it'll be on late-night TV like one of those commercials do you have Oscar think about it side effects on osius side-effects include death what is it that's a it's a bone disease so my bones were admitting I have the bottom line is my bones were just I was having a bone disintegration whoa so yeah I used to be much taller I know that sounds funny right it's actually true is that true when we met I was taller than you get the fuck outta here come on tell were you I was around five ten and you shrank to five eight I'm a little little under five eight wow that's crazy yeah so I know right and when that happened I was gonna kill myself try stretch yourself out yes yeah one of those things they use medieval torture devices so I'm one of those guys who if I want something no matter what price I have to pay physical whatever I'll pay it and I'll do and I'll get that thing I want right like I'll get it but this book Keeney you mind elaborating on this thing yeah so so I couldn't fix it by stretching it couldn't fix it just talking about that but but so what does it do to you it's making your bones shrink yes yes it gives you a steel per osis and then my bones got hollow like a whole lady Wow and then my spine collapsed when I stepped out fuck I stepped off a curb and too hard and they they didn't know what it was I like talking about too much but they told me all different kinds of things oh it's your muscles it's their nerves it's in your head it's in this and and I was limping for a few years and people were I was like how are you doing I'm like I'll be all right and you know cuz no one likes to hear about anybody else and so and then then when that happened they were like oh no it's your bones I was like you mother so everybody told me that you should go so I started going to bone doctors and everybody told me I should go see this guy dr. Charles Sharpe and I called him and he was expensive and he didn't take insurance and so I was like well I'll go to someone he trained so I would go to someone he trained I wouldn't get any better after six months I go to someone else he trained he wouldn't get any better so if I was just about to die and I went to hit to see him I like I'm just gonna pay the money and go see him and he figured out what it was like that and he says when he goes you know no one in the know where you go no one's gonna know where that what this is I go yeah I know I've already been everywhere and he said I only saw this once before in 1968 and he says and you have it yeah yeah so then he causes it it was just of my own they didn't know at the time he thought I was a tumor but they fix sense figured out it was just my own bones leaching of hormone that makes your body leach the chemicals that I need to make bone so anyway this is boring but no it's not boring at all so uh he fixed me and I start how did he fix you he just diagnosed me what was wrong and what I needed and so I need to take supplements right for my bones to make more like some people take calcium so I take this thing called phosphorus because you need phosphorus and calcium and vitamin D to make bone right so that we did that and it was amazingly you know he's just an amazing doctor and he's very right-wing as far as I can tell right we he doesn't like to talk politics but it comes up and he was in the military and all this stuff and he's just a great guy I just love he's so smart he's so smart and he fixed me so getting back to when I was gonna kill myself so when I left off the carbon I shrunk and I was shrunk even more they did an operation that gave me about an inch back I was even shorter right so I'm like holy fuck I'm like this is horn this is like I wanted to kill my I was literally gonna kill myself what was the operation that did they had to put some high force lasty mm-hmm so far some men they puff it up and then they stick some it in it oh wait but I saw I was serious I was like I cried one day I couldn't stop I didn't know how to stop and my eyes puffed up like I couldn't see almost and I was gonna do I was like I'll just kill myself and and the only thing that kept me from not killing myself was my manager called me and he said hey I go you got that hour special on Comedy Central and I was like saved your life I was like what talk about it was the best of times it was the worst of times I could not believe like what and then I just knew I had to do this special because I couldn't let all those motherfuckers who said I wouldn't move to LA and be it come I couldn't let them win it was about that it was about I'm gonna show everybody who doubted me and said I was crazy and good I'm gonna show that I'm gonna do this goddamn special it's gonna be fucking awesome and then I'll kill myself and by the time so I had to get this anyway long stories I had to get this operation in my leg it was the bo Jackson surgery you got a hip replacement it was a five bone was diet dad dying and I went to so my doctor sends me to this other doctor who vented the operation at USC and I walk into the office just like my doctor predicted he's looking at my chart and he looks up and he goes walked I've only seen this in books meaning what I have Wow and I was like that's what dr. Sharpe said and so he was gonna give me this operation he goes we're gonna take this bone out from your chin we're gonna put it in there and then you can't step on that foot for six months straight and I said I have a I have our special I'm taping in eight months I go so I can't do this operation he goes well you're the thigh could just snap at any moment I go I guess that's a chance I gotta take Oh if I can't do this special I'm gonna kill myself anyway yeah give a fuck right Wow so by the time we got to do the special eight months later dr. sharps treatment had kicked in and they didn't know it was gonna fix it but it fixed it they're like it fixed it holy shit you could have got that crazy operation nothing for nothing fuck man so his treatment is just supplements yeah yeah yeah and you take that to this day every day every time I eat I have to take too much did you alter your diet no he just he tells me to make sure I eat meat because I need the whatever it's in it I need the stuff yeah whatever whatever the good stuff is he'll look at me like he goes here from Chicago right and I know you eat meat like that fucking plant eveness like you're not one of those are you right and sad that I'm turning into one of those now goddamn it what plant eating asshole yeah well I saw this fucking video about cows I've seen those two work they no no not those so in and I don't know Norway or denim or somewhere over there they have a law that you have to let the cows out of the barn in the spring at the heinousness by this one day oh you're talking about the one with the cow jumps out so the bouncing around like a dog yeah so they all come out and they start jump around like dogs yeah and I was like oh my god I couldn't eat my dog right you know and that's what that was the first like GG's like oh Jesus and then I accidentally saw this thing of this video about a pig and I can't eat pigs anymore I can't work I can't and I'm that close to not eating meat but I eat a lot of pasta you know I like to eat I like to cook but your doctor said no pastas terrible for you you know right wheat pasta that's not better no no it's terrible for you holy pasta is the same amount of gluten in it it's the same amount of sugars in it it's not it's maybe slightly better than refined pasta like wheat bread is slightly better than white bread but it's all bullshit it's all just filler like nutrients but seven grain bread is better this horseshit man bread is horseshit it's not good for you don't do this to me it just is wheat is just not a good food it's an filler I mean if you're starving it'll keep you alive I mean that's literally what I they invented it for you know they ground-up wheat and figured out a way to cook it and and the wheat that we're eating today is not heirloom wheat it's all wheat that's been adjusted and genetically modified so that it has higher yield in smaller areas like there's a documentary called what's with wheat it's really fascinating really and they go over the details of like what happened with wheat but it's somewhere in the early 19th century or a 20th century rather than early 1900s they started altering wheat and they did it so that they can get higher yield in a smaller area but by doing that you you increase the amount of complex glutens in the weed makes it much more difficult for people to digest and then it was that's where you see like the elevation of all these gluten sensitivity issues and people like when I was a kid there was no gluten sensitivity first of all nobody knew what the fuck happened you got fat you had a heart attack and died they really didn't know they didn't they were wet much less aware of why people were fat but sugars wheat those are two of the biggest problems no kidding yeah it's terrible for you so when I went to this Chinese medicine doctor it was back when I was feeling sick and so I went to somebody recommended you should go to this Chinese but I'm like I'll try whatever so what he did was he changed my diet so he's guy got me off a white sugar dairy even brown sugars terrible for you and I'm sure you know and like and and carbs basically and he told me not to drink soda and I said well I drink diet he goes that's worse because of the chemicals in it yeah and so I was like holy shit like okay so then he sells you these herbs for 800 bucks and there are a month's supply so I realized that's all I ate when I got out of his office I like everytime I eat I'm eating white flour meeting bread or a pizza or a pasta or a cheese or everything everything he told me not to eat that's all I ate so I was like they go I remember my girlfriend said how long you gonna do this I go at least for a month because that's how much these herbs are in the 800 bucks I don't want so by this by day three I was leaping out of bed I could not get over how much energy I had yeah it's because you don't have that big insulin crash when you're eating all that sugar and all that bread your body's just fighting that shit all the time trying to process it and then there's just big crash boom yeah and then you have to take a nap what do you eat I mostly meat and avocados and healthy fats and vegetables but I hunt so everything I eat is wild so when I'm eating meat I'm eating elk or deer or something along those lines hey you you don't feel bad when you see the deer you just shot I do feel a sense of loss but I do also know that there's a wild animal that had no idea what was going on until an arrow hit it it's not like something that's living in some pen and being tortured and genetically modified and filled with antibiotics and hormones it's a wild animal and their life expectancy is very short they get taken out by bears and wolves and coyotes and Pumas they don't they're not making it none of them are making it zero zero percent they're starving to death they're freezing to death what you're doing is just dipping your foot in the wild world you are taking part in the cycle of life so here against factory farming 100 percent that's why I became a hunter I was gonna either gonna become a vegetarian or I was gonna hunt those are my two options I had to figure out what I was going to do and I experimented with vegetarian back when I was fighting to try to make a weight class and I didn't like it I just didn't feel good and then when I started eating meat I did it for like six months and then when I started eating meat I got way better like instantly like instantly started gaining muscle instantly was fighting better instantly competed better and I moved up a weight class and that's when I became my very best what's your weight class what did you fight at 154 s1 on what I moved up to I was trying to stay at 140 and this was I fought at 140 only for a year when I was 18 I just couldn't do it now did you bring your power with you Jeff Jo when you went up to 154 yes you know I was 18 I was still growing oh I'm still thinking oh that's young yeah okay so I was artificially keeping my body very very thin that was a very lean but my point is that I knew that there I want to watch too many of those videos factory farming videos factory farming should be mean fuck insider trading and all the other problems that we have in the world that's all terrible stuff right terrible stuff factory farming is a goddamn crime it's a horrible crime against life and the fact that we just do it and that we have AG gag laws yes that was quick that's what they're not saying yeah those laws are fucking criminal they're insane it's not America it's Nazi America I thought of I thought you know we're supposed to have a free press that's the equalizer that exact difference about us and now they gag the press you can't talk about Christ well they could they could sue you they could put you in jail if you feel if you feel the torture damn criminal if you film a crime right it's just so so they've made so what's there some famous saying well you know what is when exposing a crime is the crime you're ruled by criminals I don't know if that's something like them so we by the way we are being we're living in this a lawless time right so the old law only applies to the poor it does not apply to war criminals it doesn't apply to Wall Street it doesn't apply to anybody giant corporations have figured out a way skirt the law is money if you steal from rich people that they will get upset like Bernie Madoff that was even stole from rich people that was wrong he fucked up but if you're if you're Jamie Dimon or a fewer Goldman Sachs or if you and you steal from poor people or veterans or a lady that's fine that's fine that dunya becomes secretary of the Treasury XD minuchin minuchin is one of my favorite evil characters of the 21st century when you see the heart dude with his wife and his wife has gloves on and they're holding the money he's smiling and when she fucking tags like Gucci and Cartier and all these different like big-time companies and her Instagram post when she's stepping off of a fucking private jet like holy shit first of all the fact that she would fuck him that's a crime that woman is a thief that's the power of money yeah I mean but it's also prostitution that's that's a crime you don't think she's hot for him no I do not I'm dude I'm gonna be honest with you you know I think if you were there I'd say okay he's got a funny personalities good guys probably enjoys it you know it doesn't make any sense like let me let me just say this now Steve minuchin is horrible and he should probably be in jail but guess what he's not in jail cuz why cuz the Democrat didn't didn't prosecute him when she was supposed to that's Kamala yeah so she's corrupted by Wall Street too so you could point your finger at him you're like well the reason why he's there is because the Democratic Party is corrupted that's why he's there what did he do that he should have you so he well Kamala Harris is so he ran one West Bank and they inter investigated his bank and they found a thousand instances of criminality and they said if we end a thousand though that's what I said a thousand and anything less than a million instances like fuck it's water under the bridge can't be picky yeah you gotta break a few eggs man make omelets so they said and if we investigated we would find a thousand more instances of criminality she said don't that was that and she never had an answer for it so and now she's the darling of the corporate class the you know the same people who anointed Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are the same people who are anointing her so that's so that's the problem that's why I get so I mean if you bra Co bombers entire cabinet came from an email from Citigroup okay so people trying to say that somehow corruption started on January twentieth wouldn't that not 2017 are fooling themselves and that's what I'm fighting against yes on my car and you're one of the only people that are doing that you're one of the only people that are online that that you are you're not you're not obligated to to shill for the left you're right you're not doing it but everybody else seems to be I don't mean everybody else if you're one of the people that are not like fuck you Jerome there's just a handful of people who are not you're so few there's so few that are calling out people in the Democratic Party for what really is going on like I was infuriated when people that I knew that I was friends with were trying to tell me that that Hillary Clinton was a good choice and that's the same choice I'm like look I don't know if she's murdered people but I know that I worried that she's murdered people that's a real I've really wonder like that's rich shit I know for first of all this Lee you don't even need to go there you know there's so many other things there's so many other things that we know for a fact the Clinton Foundation for instance so the Iraq war I'm old enough Joe to remember one being for the Iraq war was a disqualifier in a Democratic primary that's that's where I'm from that's why she lost a Barack Obama the first goddamn time she ran and all the sudden we're supposed to now people like Joy Behar says that's a long time ago forget about it once you go tell that to soldiers to a mother who's got a dead soldier once you go tell them that it just died in a legal war why'd you go tell that to a couple hundred thousand Iraqis who are dead get over is a long time ago anyway so I remember when that that also the Bill Clinton was no friend to the working man in fact he was this demise starting of the demise of this country so at bill you know Ronald Reagan scared the shit out of the Democrats so much that he decided to become like them and so what Bill Clinton did was he got in bed with Wall Street the military-industrial complex big pharma health insurance and the Koch brothers he started a thing called the Democratic Leadership Council with Al Gore they had executives from the Koch brothers on the Democratic Leadership Council they completely turned their back on the working man and what happens when you have two parties that are in bed with management you get Donald Trump and that's exactly what happened they got it welfare at the same time they explored the prison population called black kids super predators at the same time they did NAFTA and then they deregulated Wall Street which crashed the economy within ten years that's what Democrats did Democrats did shit that Ronald Reagan could only fucking dream about in his wet dreams they couldn't pass a NAFTA George Bush couldn't pass a NAFTA it took Bill Clinton to do it Bill Clinton gave the cover to the other corporate Democrats to go along with it so that was the beginning of the end for the working class in America in fact now you know I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton and that's why a lot of people on the Left that came after me and they still do well it was confusing to me that you were saying hey if you want to vote for a real progressive what about Jill Stein yeah if you vote for a party both here's a pro program you actually agree with the grand new deal right so and we know it is like no that's what you're throwing away your vote like how are you throwing away your vote so we all know for a fact because of the WikiLeaks emails that Hillary Clinton had a thing called the Pied Piper strategy which was she told her minions in the press please prop up Donald Trump prop him up why did she want Donald Trump to be propped up because she wanted to run against Donald Trump because she knew that she was so repulsive to most of the country she needed someone who was more repulsive than her turns out that was a bad calculation this is heroin so that's called the Pied Piper strategy and everybody that's why that you turn on Chris Hayes and he would show Donald Trump's empty podium for an hour instead of a Bernie Sanders and then he wags his finger at people with no money and no power for not voting for a corporatist warmonger like Hillary Clinton who just why why do you think the people in Wisc Michigan wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton maybe because she would have them in fucking prison but because she passed NAFTA and Barack Obama was trying to sell TPP at the top of his lungs at the same time she was trying to get working people to vote for her they know what the fuck was going on and that's why half the country doesn't vote but you're gonna wag their finger at the people who actually do vote who come out and vote their conscience and they don't fucking prop up evil you know what the voting for lesser of two evils it's you Donald fucking Trump well there's also a really sneaky thing that happens where you have two parties and one of them you think of as this conservative war mongering party which automatically makes the other party the the enemy of that yeah but they're not they're not well we have to pro war parties and that's the proof there's not an opposition party they oppose Trump on the most ridiculous bullshit they just voted for an extra 160 billion dollars to go to the war machine 160 billion let's remember Bernie Sanders wanted to pay for a free college which was somewhere around 65 billion dollars so and everybody said he's fucking crazy how you gonna pay for that they just did that in a blink of an eye they passed 160 billion dollars to a war machine that we don't have an enemy to fight you know Russia spent 65 billion dollars a year on their military their a paper tiger we got no fucking enemies out there we have to keep inventing them in the last the less enemy they invented was Isis Isis I don't know you're supposed to shit our pants over them Joe because they have kitchen knives they'll cut your head off with a kitchen knife that's what I'm supposed to be afraid of what the fuck what it's it's it's amazing how they can keep us scared so they can keep perpetual war going this is an Orwellian nightmare and the Democrats right now should be screaming about the Pentagon budget but they're not screaming about it because they're complicit they're in it and that's what's wrong with this country that's why we can't have nice things so when what when they tell you that you were broke and we can't afford stuff they don't mean we can't afford trillion dollar wars trillion dollar bank bailout billion dollar oil subsidies and prison destruction that's not what they mean they mean we can't afford shit like health care or education or roads or bridges or firemen or libraries or anything that makes your fucking life better because whenever they need bombs they got it hey we're broke for Social Security we're both from Medicare how about for bombs oh we got bomb money we keep it right through our fuckin money because we're not really in a war in the sense of like World War 2 or World War 1 we're in this weird war of it's like a calculated they're all economic words you know they're all at so we went into Iraq for the further work oil Libya is because he wanted to go off the petro dollar but it is stunning how much funding this kind of war gets versus all the different social programs that we need in this country yeah it's the structured programs yes week and and people always think like well how are you gonna pay for that we don't have to spend any more money we can actually spend Len button less money we don't have to spend seven hundred fifty billion dollars a year on a military that's bloated we have thousand bases around the country are on the world we don't even know how many bases there are because lots of them are secret so what do you say to the argument that we need them in order to stay safe it's not sure that's the big argument right the big argument is this is the way we we've destroyed Isis because Isis was on their way to building up we we invited al-qaeda and then we invested Isis we certainly aided in their development their development and we then we directly funded them we don't know the whole Mujahideen story which was Osama bin Laden was our guy yes our guy he's our guy he was an anti-russian terror anti-russian freedom fighter is what they called Osama bin Laden yeah and then all of a sudden they didn't need him anymore so why and we're still in Afghanistan seventeen years later three more years that war gets a gold watch and what do they do I mean what what do they do to get us out of there I mean literally what is what is their distress there is no exit strategy strategy there's no exit strategy from the Mideast in fact they just announced we're gonna be permanently in Syria so and by the way the Syrian war is complete bullshit those gas attacks now have been completely debunked I didn't believe him the first time so what happened during those gas attacks so what that's called a false flag so what happens is they wanted the United States to come in on their side the bomb Assad to overthrow them right and so what they would do is if they would do a gas attack on their own people and then blame it on Assad and then this has been proven yes they did it yes and then was Christ and the first time was in I think 2013 and Barack Obama wanted to bomb and and I would I knew it was bullshit then do you remember when everybody freaked out about that yes and that he didn't bomb them yeah remember he didn't get to bomb them because nobody was like fuck you yes he was let's put it to a vote in the Congress and the people don't want war Joe so the people said fuck you and he was like hmm we're gonna do it anyway guess what they did it anyway they Bob David they dropped so many bombs on Syria they ran out of bombs that's its fact right so the air force was out of bomb which year was this the so was it 2015 they they've dropped so many bombs in the Mideast they ran out of bombs that's just a fucking fact look if you buy all these bombs you've gotta use use them I mean what are you gonna do with them they're just gonna sit around and what if somebody accidentally sets one off while they're on American soil I don't want that you can't have that happen so and here's the weird thing that the left is doing right now they're attacking Donald Trump from the right and what do I mean by that so when they want so they say Donald Trump is a Putin puppet and the only way you can prove you're not a Putin puppet is you got to bomb somebody you got a bomb Syria remember that they were like oh he's president today because he bombed Syria I remember that fucking Brian Williams almost nothing in his pants well he all he bombed was air strips so that's what they're saying so they go oh oh the bombed air strips oh you didn't you bomb the old planes and not the new planes so what that is you're attacking Donald Trump from the right because left people are supposed to be for day taunts and you're supposed to be anti-war and anti right so when you attack Donald Trump you know he didn't really bomb them you're attacking them from the right you're saying he should be more militaristic which is fucked up well it supports the argument that everything is circular right that as far right as you get as far left as you get you really come to some sort of strange ideological point like that zero point that can't be true but not in this instance because what's happening there is corporate right-wing Democrats are attacking Trump for not being right enough what you're talking about is where I'm at where I'm anti-war and then there's also anti-war anti interventionist people on the right so a lot of people voted Donald Trump because of that because he always said he was an anti interventionist he's gonna get us out of the Middle East it was crazy to be there and bring our boys home and all and that's why a lot of people did vote for Trump because of that right and and that's why a lot of people said they felt more comfortable voting for Trump because he was because Hillary actually promised more war in Syria than he did and we and and it's turning out to be true because she wanted a no-fly zone which means we're gonna shoot down a Russian jet are you fucking crazy right so I I'm on though I'm on the left anti war there's no anti-war movement in in the country that's represented by a political party right now do you think that this right though that what the way the left is attacking Donald Trump from the right as you say it don't you think it's just because they see an opening there to criticize and to point out his vulnerabilities II what they're doing this whole Russian narrative is the establishment not wanting to examine the system that gave us Donald Trump and so they want to distract you with Russia until we get to the next election it's working yes that's a very good way of putting it distract you from a system that's archaic and outdated and doesn't work why do people without asking the question anymore why do people vote for Donald Trump in fact the only time they asked it they took the shittiest answer was because racism really the same country that voted for Barack Obama twice somebody's just doubled down on that the other day so I'm saying are there racist news berg are there racists who voted for Donald Trump yeah of course so what you know if Alonzo Bodden said it best well he said not all Trump supporters a racist but all racists are Trump supporters fucking Alonso and and you know I went to a trump rally and it was discussing and scary and it was all xenophobia and it was all race it was worse than I thought it was gonna be what sound he tapped into that but what's interesting about him tapping into that is this is not something that he had been chiming about for years he was a Democrat yes this time he's not an ideologue which is you know I heard when he got into office he was like why don't we just give everybody Medicare which is of course the answer right just give everybody Medicare no it's the same money instead of food stamps as given food he's like we have this issue with people they buy cigarettes and booze and stuff with food stamps just let's just give them food it's not a bad idea that's not it's not a bad idea I mean if it's healthy good food no I have places where people can go and pick up healthy good food it might be a very good idea you know we need an infrastructure plan in the United States yes and you know FDR did that right he gave old people retirement he gave young people a job he put gave people dignity he gave him a job and he said if you're willing to work you'll have but remember that the old saying when I grew up was there gonna be a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage there was something like that something like that and they don't say that shit anymore right because the government is not there to help you anymore but the government does pretend that they are I mean yes one thing that Trump is going on about is how much job I mean how many more people are working today than before african-american unemployment is at the lowest point in 40 years the economy is booming all these different things the economy when they say the economy is booming they mean Wall Street is booming right there's no correlation between Wall Street and regular people's lives it's not well those stock market has been booming I remember I got called in to CNN to do a thing when it in the stock market crossed 13,000 now it's up 25,000 and that was a big watershed moment that was just like 8 years ago I got called in to do that at CNN that was like oh my god week so we've gone we've doubled the stock market people's paychecks have been doubled people's lives gotten worse actually but I have a problem with saying that because there's just too many people you're dealing with when you say people's lives have gotten worse like what people well I'll tell you too many people 63% of the country can't afford $1,000 emergency half the country right now is either poor or low-income 30 50 percent of all wage earners are in less than $30,000 a year in the richest country in the world Jack Ma who is the Jeff Bezos of Asia he runs the the Amazon of Asia and he said you know the problem with the United States isn't making money it's that you guys don't distribute it right well that's some communist shit coming over from China you're gonna let that slide but all those communist billionaires are buying up all our real estate fuck to the socialist country produce all those billionaires well go to well they as soon as they got into communism or into capitalism rather they they did in a very ruthless way I mean you look at what it's really kind of fucked up like what what's going on with some of the places where we buy our good it's like Fox cotton were they my phone yeah have nets around the building he keep it from fucking jumping off but when Trump has been in office for only a year he can't expect all those things to change but his argument has been that those things are improving do you think it's all it's all horseshit yes in fact why is african-american unemployment at the lowest rate that it's been in 40 years is that because it's unreported like people stopped looking for jobs they report they stop counting those as being unemployed so there's that yeah and they stop taking unemployment and they stop looking for jobs so they don't count them right they don't count them but they're still unemployed it's a real sneaky statistic yes also I really like it if someone was honest about that I would like it to like what's the real unemployment right that's what we want to know what's the real and employer would we find that out though I don't know maybe I notice a guy named Mark Blythe he would probably know what it is he's an economist he he coined it termed global trumpism and he has a great line he tells the elites about how we're running they're running the economy I'm of course I'm gonna butcher it but he says you know the Hamptons aren't the defensible position it's a low-lying area he's got a Scottish accent the Hamptons are the low-lying area that's a very bad area to be not a defensible position meaning when the fucking people come for you they're gonna you're dead you yeah sorry there's a military base in reactance right you're not a punishing people can get to you so lot of gold diggers so the job suck everybody's job sucks and we know we hollowed out the union's NAFTA was the crushing blow to the unions in this country and you know we needs unions is one of the one of the things that actually cushions the blow of the brutalities of a free market right so you have unions you have social programs because capitalism fucks everybody and so you have to have all these things in place to kind of cushion the blow of it and we get we got rid of them right Bill Clinton gutted welfare at the same time he did NAFTA I mean and then he exploded the prison population I mean but people that I know that we're in unions protect some friends that I have that were in the auto union were saying that it was getting completely bloated they were doing they're having two people doing a job that was only for one person and there was all this there was all this real wanton purposeful waste and this was all designed into certain contracts this is a buddy of mine that was an auto worker in Detroit he said we had shifts where there was supposed to be two people on the job but everybody knew it was a real simple thing you work a machine so I would work for hours and he would work for hours or I would work a day and he would work a day but we both punched in and that was just it was just common and there was several those and he goes and you were getting $100,000 a year $200,000 a year for some jobs just ridiculous amounts of money for jobs that really didn't warn that kind of income and he said this was all negotiated into the contract it's like it's a good thing to give fair wages and healthy wages and and health insurance and all these different things he said but it was unquestionably bloated which opened the door to all these factories going to Mexico and all these other places well would open the door for those factories going why I would say two things to that first of all it doesn't it's kind of anti logical to think that the union would say no we're not going to negotiate on this and go ahead and take our jobs both of those jobs to Mexico so what if you have a chance right number two is if you look at the strongest economies right you look at Germany they have strong unions Japan they have strong unions and by the way the unions sit on their boards well there's also it was a real problem in the 1980s and I guess a little bit in the late 70s when the oil crisis happened America was making dogshit cars they're not making terrible cars right and then Japanese were making these cars that were goddamn bulletproof right he could make it buy a Toyota Corolla and that fucking thing would go for hundred thousand five hundred thousand miles on a single problem you know you buy an Oldsmobile and that thing which shit the bed inside of a month and a half and he'd be fucking furious and everybody was like by American by American and a lot of people like well fuck you man you're making shitty cars he's goddamn me I bought a Dodge Daytona I had it for maybe three months and a handle fell off in my hand I went to open the door and it came off in my hand motherfucker and that was like what I think one of first car the first car I ever bought that's some ice well I was a road comic I'm like I have to buy a Honda I'm a road comment yeah I can't this has been early 90s I'm like I have to buy a car that I can rely on I the win second thing I had an accord yeah I had a Civic the best yeah it's it were they never break they never broke so so I would look at that unions it's not the problem the unions aren't the problem young fact unions are an answer to the problem and if you look at the economies everyone wants to be let like look at Germany and by the way the German unions just won the right for a 28 hour to work 28 hours a week and they got a four percent pay raise I would say that's eight hours too much I would agree I really think I was talking about this yesterday with Johann Hari who wrote a book on depression and one of the major causes being the way people live their lives without control doing things they don't want to do and he was saying that somewhere in the neighborhood of 87 percent of the people are doing things they don't want to be doing most of the time for a job and I was I was making the argument that we've set up this structure that's just completely ridiculous and we've stuck with it because it's just the way we've always done things it's 40-hour workweek plus overtime it's chaos you're losing your life and by the way we'd be working more if it wasn't for unions we have a weekend right because of unions goes back to the Foxconn thing they don't have unions and they have fucking nets around their building in dormitories where they where they work so that's some people say about Amazon - and my whole thing is like people's like why do you still you know you can't use Amazon you can't like you know it's so hard to live off the grid you know I mean it's like I Drive a car so I'm gonna have to buy gas from Exxon or shale all right so does that make me a bad lefty cuz I'm supporting an oil company supposed to get a Prius bro you know I mean you still put gas in a Prius that's right you got a Tesla yeah but then you're rich yeah Tesla 3 is a cheaper one right it's like 55 if you give the shit you want on it it's still gonna cost more you want to see what AC bitches electric win right what you got to do is you got to get an old car like an old Civic and then rebuild it yeah well they're at least now I don't buy cars that's a scam I think buying cars but anyway it is for the most part but not a few buy classic cars right oh that's different definitely if you're Jay Leno yeah and yeah I get you now what you do boy his new show is fantastic really good that car shows that that's the show I wish he would have been doing all the exact same are you kidding me yes I told you how much I liked it I like him I like him on that show well you know why it's because he's passionate it's like that's what really was you know when you would watch him interview someone you could tell he didn't give a fuck about the question he was asking you remember the Bill Hicks bit yeah Bill Hicks bit of course I'm interviewing hey Joey hey you got a car now you drive in you drive then he got a girlfriend yeah no yeah and then bill bill heck's would have Jay Leno reach into his drawer and pull out an Uzi and stick in his mouth I used to be a fucking and he blows his brains out and it forms an NBC Peacock and them on the wall on the wall behind him because he's a company man to the bitter end and I was reloading well that's the weirdest thing you know Jay Leno was again one of my one of my inspirations to become a comedian but as in the early day yeah and I would tell people that and they're like huh because they only knew him from The Tonight Show and I'm like I don't know what he's doing on that show but he's the funniest guy in the world it would be like if Dave Chappelle before he did Chappelle's Show decided to host a talk show and then completely stopped anything controversial and completely stopped having an opinion on anything if you look at that when Jay Leno used to go on David Letterman he was the guy oh it was a guy who's Reggie super edgy yeah he made fun of corporate America like nobody's business he was a sharp comic he was it was the I'm the best comic yeah and so that's why it was funny when he when he got The Tonight Show I just didn't think he showed off his talents no he but for him that was making it heed me that was in his head in his head that's it this is what's in our heads we were like what did you miss everything like what the fuck are you doing you don't I was on The Tonight Show and a couple times one time I was on in during the break ice out there with Jay and I I said I think was the first time I was on I said hey man I go what was up with that Bill Hicks bit I had to ask because I was like what are the odds I want to be on the show again I'm like come on once I think it was the fear factor days which is like in the early Fear Factor days I was 100% convinced that show was canceled at any second now so really isn't my one chance to get on the Jay Leno Show let me ask him some questions so he's like doing that job and yeah yeah it's not bad I go hey man let me ask you this I go what's up with that Bill Hicks thing right and his take on it was you know well I wanted to do jokes for everybody you know I wanted to do comedy for everybody and Bill just didn't believe in doing comedy for everybody I thought it was interesting he just I don't think he expected me to ask it to him you know I had him on the podcast and he was fucking fantastic cuz after he'd retired he told some stories about doing stand-up for mob people mm-hmm and about this guy fucking screaming at a priest you fucking motherfucker but the fucking and it was a hilarious thing to watch Jay Leno telling hilarious stories and swearing like a fucking longshoreman and I was like wow this is crazy or a regular guy like you've always been a regular guy you were just doing the Tonight Show thing and I heard stories about Jay that he he loved to watch hacky comedy and the reason why this stuck in my head was because I used to do that too with Todd glass we would we would if the what if the worst the comedian the better we happily have three specials lined up for a night we were like fuck this is gonna be great and I we found out after I found out that Jay Leno used to do the same thing when he would see a comic that he didn't think you know he thought was horrible he would hunt down a tape of it and then everyone would have to come over to his house and they'd watch it that's is this a story I heard so maybe this is Bob sure it's true okay I'm like holy fuck that's what I he do well he just turned everything mild you know he turned everything mild for many many years it just didn't it just wasn't who he was or what made me like him and it confused me and I felt personally let down by him I felt he left down comedy because now he was supposed to show the old people what the new people were doing in comedy and then he just kind of didn't but now you see him and he's like a very likeable person he's fun like his show is fun that's Joe look it's because exactly he's talking about shit he cares about that show was not made for him that Tonight Show you know he was the number one show so what do we know right it was still the number one show so maybe I'm wrong well it was a different thing you know because like Letterman seemed passionate like he seemed to be enjoying it and when he would say like witty things and sharp things to people he would you could tell he was getting like a little bit of a thrill out of it it was like there was some excitement to Letterman's position that you didn't sense with Jay Leno Jay Leno was just like well you know making everybody happy so the thing I liked about late-night shows when I was younger was that there was a sense of danger that anything could happen you didn't know it was gonna happen right right burn trails gonna come out drunk you know what I mean and they used to smoke yeah you know there was and they would talk about things they were talk to you they would actually talk about things and you know watch a Dick Cavett and he would I remember he had a Mort Sahl come out with Jane Fonda and Peter Fonda right after the Easy Rider came up and they're all talking like this is a fucking and that's counterculture it's right on and so it was really good that's when shows were good but now chosen now they're all fluff it's all fucking bullshit as well there was an outlet for that though and it was filled by comedy in podcasts yes so now podcasts are doing that and those late-night shows I have no idea what they're doing or why they even exist they're weird they're even Stephen Colbert like Stephen Colbert's show on Comedy Central just a brilliant brilliant show and now he quit to get way more money to do a more popular show that is way less relevant interesting or creative but it is funny when he fucking mocks Trump it's funny how hard he goes the fact that he said Trump's mouth but did he uses his mouth as Kooten Putin's cock holster the fact that they said that on CBS I was like wow this is what happens when you have to compete with the Internet who the fuck could have imagined leftie Canadians renewing McCarthy smears but no fucking thought TV but a joke like that a cock I get McCarthyism thing but the joke of a cock holster the president's mouth being used as Putin's cock holster that that would be on CBS I get that you're applauding that he broke a lug boundary well I'm not applauding it I'm just saying it's fascinating that we've changed what's the bar yeah what's with what you're allowed to do like you've changed ever and because it's Trump like if they said that about everybody else get a feeling like God if he said well cuz look at all this Russia dude dossier memo shit that's coming out I mean it turns out that a lot of this stuff is horseshit so a lot of people who weren't around for the first McCarthy shit they're getting to experience it now this is what it's like yeah this is what it's like and you're like what even the media's yeah and the media goes along yeah that's this is what it's like and you know I don't even I don't want to spend the to any amount of time talking about it but it's so unbelievable it's they forgot you're talking to a wall when you tell people just go oh I mean there was collusion I got what it what's collusion what does that mean collusion that Trump colluded with the the russians hacked into the john Podesta's emails and somehow they needed trump to help them what the fuck that's the cuz that's what they're saying exactly and that there's some kind of quid pro quo and that now Trump is a Manchurian Candidate and that he's Putin's puppet and but he noticed there's moving the goalposts every day so now it's oh no now he's he's in bed with Russian oligarchs doing money laundering well you don't know there's a sale of a home and it was a Russian bought it Russian so they've totally moved the goalposts from being treason to now he's just regular corrupt like everybody else because let me tell you something everybody else is regular corrupt like Trump but I don't even know if it's regular corrupt because we're talking about a sale of a house well they're quite a few years ago well that there's more that that's one thing but they're talking about lots of other things right and I say you want to talk about collusion he opened up eight businesses in Saudi Arabia during the goddamn campaign that there's your fucking collusion but nobody talks about that because Saudi Arabia's supposed to be on our side even though the repressive theocracy that beheads people in the streets but we like because it's a petrol dollar which no one ever talks about the petrodollar serving its top well that's what props up our dollar right now the economy so what people don't know is that in the early seventies Richard Nixon took our country off the gold standard and we went on the petrol dollar and what was that we promised Saudi Arabia the use of our military anywhere they wanted as long as they would convert every dollar of oil that someone bought for them in American dollars so if you want to buy oil from Saudi Arabia you first have to convert your currency into American dollars which is the real reason why we invaded Iraq the first time well it has a lot to do with it the pattern it's why we're in Yemen right now we're doing siege warfare in Yemen which is a war crime that guy just got convicted of it at The Hague so we're doing that in conjunction with Saudi Arabia and why are we doing that because of the petrol dollar that's what's and it's all about why are we in Africa it's every everything comes down to money and why are we in Syria they wanted to put a natural gas pipeline through Syria and Russia doesn't want because they want to sell the the natural gas to Europe that's what this is about so if there's and it's not about babies it's not about freedom it's not about liberty and you know we got us it clearly don't like country music country music what is real I like country like the outlaw to me Merle Haggard yeah I like that guy like you and Jennings yeah I like Willie Nelson and not these fucking pussies who want to be boy scouts and my momma and all that shit whoa what pussies I'm not supposed to say pussies well it's gonna be a time we can't say pussy shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits alright so a lot of people are trying to use hashtag me too for puritanical reasons and that's not what it's about hashtag me too is about fucking stopping men who use their power and station in life to hold it over women for sexual sexual purposes that's what that's about it's not about being a Puritan it's not about being anti porn it's nothing wrong with the lusting after a woman's tits and a woman's ass there's nothing wrong with that and there's nothing wrong with a woman wanting to be fucked by a man those are normal things there's soap that's okay and don't let people hijack that movement and try to use it for Puritanism because what a lot of people are doing shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits I'm triggered I hope you're triggered - yeah I mean absolutely I mean I think that what what we're dealing with is an exposure of sexual assault exposure of sexual harassment sexual assualt particularly in the workplace you know and this is a giant issue for people that have to work alongside men and women and they develop these little communities inside these little boxes that we call offices and things get really fucking weird if you have a boss it's a piece of shit and he's constantly harassing the women that worked there and it becomes a living hell with him the stress that going through I mean it is a crime yeah you're doing something to those people that work there you're you're you're you're putting these pressure on them you're fucking up their life could you imagine doing could eat the last thing I would ever want to do was impose myself sexually at a woman who don't want it yeah right well you're a healthy person like some people it's just about know we've all been into the end goal we've all been drunk right we've all been on a date where a woman didn't want to have sex and we did and we just the issue but you know I just can't imagine like I just never guy this guy I don't get that she doesn't like you oh I'm gonna make her go feel uncomfortable like what the fuck do you get out of that that's just weird well there's people that hate the opposite sex I mean and I say the opposite sex I don't mean just men who hate women there's women who hate men there's people who have associated the opposite sex with rejection and pain and frustration all of their life you look at a guy like Harvey Weinstein that is an ugly fat guy right there's no women who are lusting after him it was his power and his money that got him into a position where he could get some pussy and having power over all these actresses and then hearing whether it's uma Thurman or whatever you know famous actress Salma Hayek all these superstars who were fighting this guy off in hotel rooms I mean it's fucking crazy I mean he's a maniac but he's a disgusting guy who has no shot at getting someone to appreciate him physically they might like his personality but for someone to be physically attracted to he was almost impossible right I mean he's eaten himself into this disgusting shape unless you have a fetish or whatever yeah you might be just into getting fucked by Jabba the Hutt just big fat guy with pock marks skin shooting loads all over you there's no way it makes any sense but if it's gonna put you in Ocean's eleven you gotta do what you got to do well you know Matt Damon said what did Matt Damon say that they were trying to get him out of that new oceans movie well it didn't he say something about there's a kitchen continuum or something that that everything is Harvey Weinstein wasn't that it I don't remember the exact quote but it was something along the lines of we have to make a differentiation between sexual assault and and men hitting on women what's really interesting is seeing how they're acting about this in France in Europe a lot of women especially older actions did you see yes did you see that's wild I want men to be men and in France I mean if they're just France apart on they're just different over there this there they have a different attitude the same as Brazil my friend Tiago from Brazil told me once he's like man he goes if you're in Brazil and he goes if you're with a girl you don't try to fuck her she's like what the fuck is wrong with you like you're not even trying to fuck me like what the fuck is wrong with you still get mad at you like like they appreciate like in Brazil they're very aggressive I have a sexually aggressive place I have had I'll never forget I was working a comedy club and there was a girl there who was beautiful and she flirted with me and well III didn't know if she was flirting me because I was just she was beautiful and she talked to me so I'm like aha right and so but I wasn't gonna make a move it or because I'm I'm considering every comedian who comes in this club makes a move on this girl she's the prettiest girl around right so I didn't do anything cuz I want to be that guy right and then I have never forget by the end of the week it was the last night and she's like hey there was a party at my house tonight are you gonna come and I was like oh sure right so I went to there whatever cut to I'm leaving and she goes are you fucking kidding me and I go what she goes I threw a party just to get you to my apartment you're gonna leave and I was like oh really wanna and so we had sex yeah so that's so there was a woman who was but you didn't want to be the guy was super aggressive against a girl that was like hey I just like you yeah just fun got to hang out what does everything have to be sex and I know every guy in the world hit out her you you know what I honestly I mean I don't want to say this because it's almost like in this day and age you got to get to know someone forever before you have welcome I mean literally forever you gotta fuck my wife the first night we went out good for you and she wouldn't which has probably worked out because we're still together and but I kept did it in a charming way right right I would say honey I know can we ask you this why did you try to fuck her in the first night but it took you five nights for the waitress because I didn't want to be that guy at the club because it's a work environment yeah so you're the opposite of a sexual harasser I guess so I guess now that I look at it that way yeah yeah yeah you know sensitive nothing weren't attracted to her you just didn't want to be a dick yeah I didn't want to have that reputation of that guy and plus there's plenty of women in the audience so I would tell her I remember the first night we were together I was like hey um I know you I know you're gonna say you want me to go home but you're gonna worry that I'm too tired to drive and then I might get in an accident so you don't have to say that I'll just stay she's like no it's okay I go it's nice of you to say that you're strong you're brave but I know you're gonna worry so I'm just staying then I think I did end up staying but we didn't have sex right and like probably two more time two more times like that but also it's you don't really know someone's personality for a long time I mean that's part of the problem the problem is people have physical needs they get attracted to each other and the next scene oh look there's been many times in my life where I wound up having sex with somebody who turned out to be crazy and then you know you're one two dates in you like yeah she seems cool the next thing you know you're hanging out a week or two later and she does something completely fucking insane and then the crazy just starts leaking out of her pores and you're like oh well now what have I done I've entangled myself with some person who knows where I live and expects me to call them every day and we're gonna get together and I have to figure out a way to back out of this and then you try to back out of it and they get fucking angry at you but this is back in the old days people are actually Yury - yeah there was no tax message yes you just pick up the phone if someone starts yelling at you yeah where I would just duck them for a while until they found some new guy remember when people used to answer their phone yeah no one ever answers their phone well I get too many phone calls from people I don't know I just get phone calls from numbers I don't know Mike where's this guy get my fucking number from I have no idea I just look at it in my can you ever have I answered a call because I didn't cuz you know you're like oh maybe it's that business I just called her Connor you don't know right right so I took on one time and it was just a number it didn't come up and it was someone asking me for money to borrow the money it was just a person you know I knew tangentially in comedy and oh and I and I didn't say this and I was like do you know that your name is not even in my fucking phone book and you're asking for the money that's a desperate move that must be a person who's like a gambling addict or something that's what I thought right away but getting back to this the thing about the women you know one time I had a woman when I first moved to LA I was dating her and I went to her house and she was really creative and she was cute and she wrote songs and she would sing them for me I love that shit right and I remember she like we were gonna go have sex and she went and she was hanging on and she went took a drink well and I go what she goes do you want a drink I go no and she goes he'll on and she's like drinking and I go what are you doing cuz I have to have a couple drinks before and then it made me not want to have sex with her isn't that fucked up I was like wow you have to have you have to drink so you could feel comfortable I took it personal which of course it was just her it was she needed to relax yeah cuz she had fucked up prime or not oh boy she the issues or whatever right and so that was it I was I'm like I can't be with a girl has to drink that well is there anything too though when especially when you're young and single it's like you don't you don't want to get stuck in a bad situation you know like I'd seen a lot of bad situations when I was young my own parents and other people's parents so I'd see anything fucking sketchy and but ya know where this is going I don't want to deal with your problems you know I don't have those kind of problems so see yeah yeah I was the same way my I had a lot of bad examples of people yeah I have no idea why these people would be with the spouse there with like why would you do that maybe that's gonna happen to me because it's unconscious so I started reading self-help books and watching John Bradshaw video hosting I don't know if he knew that is John Bradshaw he invented that term inner child and all the inner child work and all that stuff so I think I fucked up a lot of people's heads um getting to doing your child bitch you're 40 but he was he would it was helpful to me because he broke up the family dynamic and he talked about how people act and fat come from a big family 12 kids and that you know how it's like it all balances out you'll have a bad kid and an angel right you know and all that and everything in between any talks of it and so it helped me understand myself a lot right right and where I wanted to understand my motivations so I didn't make bad choices in my life like I had seen people around me making right and cuz it's unconscious right so you just do what sit habit you know you don't you don't even know why you're doing what you're doing half the time you're not conscious of why you're acting the way you're acting or why you like what you like you just go I like that why well when I was struggling as a comic one thing that I definitely did is I only gave this I only gave a certain amount of room to relationships because I knew that I really had to concentrate on my career yes I'm like if I don't I will it will fall apart like there was a kid that I started out with we both started out together and he was pretty funny guy and he got this girlfriend that was just very demanding and he stopped doing stand-up less and less it was doing less and less sets then eventually he dropped out and then I ran into his son many years later and his son you know they they wound up having a baby and his son was saying this dad just really regretted not getting into comedy I'm sure he's happy he has a nice son and all that stuff and he had a family but it just attacked him you know though there's a saying I think it might have been Carl young who said nothing affects a child more than the unlived life of its parent so imagine I mean imagine being a father and you went after your dream and you gave it everything you can now you can impart that to your kid and your kid just absorbs it being around you now you didn't do that you have all that on you resentment or whatever you feel because you didn't live what your life you were supposed to and then you can't pass that off and your skate absorbs that time I knew it was so hard to do anyway it was gonna be so hard to make it and the odds are stacked against you you've seen everybody else drop off like flies you see guys can't get gigs they won't end up quitting they get a day job they work less and less and the next thing you know they're just completely stopped doing stand-up it's so common and so when I would see when I have relationships and I'd see those signs where girls are just demanding more and more of my time why do you have to go up tonight I'm like four or five nights a week I have to kidding ya I'm like you can come with me I've seen your act a hundred times well this is what I do this is what I do you know I can't I don't know what to tell you I die I meet guys who they they're their spouses or significant others aren't into their comedy no it's awful look it's awful it's what may that's the thing that's up what do you what what do you like about me my wife is I would say she's a she's a fan of comedy but she's been around me for a long time and she is she's hard like if she watched a stand-up and it's not good to like this sucks well that there's nothing wrong with that no it's good it's a good thing yeah you know she's she's got an eye for it she understands it but I have friends whose wives hate comedy and they do stand-up and that's great it's crazy and they associate comedy with like taking their boyfriend away or taking their husband away like this is that thing that takes away my time you know from me with him now he's off doing these joke things fucking bullshit mm-hmm so so it's super selfish Jesus you need a better woman and someone who's deeper well you just fucking settle they just settle they settle yes my what my anyway there's so many that have to I forget where I was Joe sometimes and he'll probably hear this and so when I started comedy I was dating this girl sweet sweet girl and she wanted to get married like like you would expect right so I was 24 at the time I was six years to get out of college and so she bought me a suit so I could go on interviews to get a job she want me to get a job soon and I had started doing comedy that the right then and so about six months into doing comedy I started getting Saturday night spots at a real Club they would let me go them up to ten minutes not paid but I could do it on the Regular Show guests set that's huge alright that's that my god are you kidding me it's a godsend so we go out loud apart yes so on a Saturday night I take her with me we're going to the comp this comic was called the comedy cottage and I do my set and there was lots of other like you know new comics like me and they were like haha Jimmy you know that was great it was a big deal it's a big deal for us like one of our own got on and and in the car ride home she's not saying anything and finally she just turns to me she goes you're really gonna do this aren't you yes did you just see what happened of course I'm doing this what does that mean that she was like she knew that I was gonna be a comedian and not married to her and that's what that meant Wow you couldn't be both mm-hmm not then I couldn't get married even I couldn't get married Jim Breuer is married to the same girl he's with when I met him I met Jim in 1991-92 Wow happy kids the whole deal super happy she's super nice I didn't so the problem with stand-up comedy is you don't know where you're gonna end up of course so when you start you don't know can I even do five minutes nothing like what can I do 15 can I get paid can I do an emcee can I be consistent in like middle can I head don't know can I work in a room can I get on TV you don't know you don't know you don't like if you go to any other job you go well if you do this this and this then you'll get the promotion and then you get that you have to meet your number and then you get okay I can meet my number right this is it there's no handbook not only that to this day like my my agent called me to schedule something in New York for November and I said I can't and I said I'm doing my special in April I don't know if I'm gonna have an hour by November I assume I will but I don't know I go I can't I'm not gonna fuck people over at some big fucking theater and not have an hour yet I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do my best but May June July August September October November seven months most likely I'll have a new hour most likely I only have a half-hour what if I only have a half-hour right fucking bomb what if I do a half an hour of good comedy but not the best and then have nothing I can't take that risk like when I'm ready I'll call you so when April rolls around after I'm done and I chuck everything aside I'm on a fucking rampage for like three four months of just doing 1015 minute spots writing a bunch of new shit and trying to piece together an hour then it's gonna take me a month or two to try to sort that our out you know to figure out where everything goes and what the punchlines are listening to recordings writing things down burning the midnight oil late at night this is if I could do it I mean I'm assuming she do it once i Chuck my act aside once the act that you saw the you thought was funny that fucking thing's go in the toilet it's over over baby uh I'm lucky in a sense that no one saw my last special so I get to do those jokes I get to keep doing what about your fans know so I did fuck this is funny right so I did to Comedy Central specials then I did my last one was for Hulu and it was in I think 2015 may be or 14:15 and so so because of my YouTube show I sell tickets now so people come out and so I got I was doing a show maybe six months ago and I do the opening joke from my special and it kills and I go you motherfuckers none of you saw my special do my own special and put it on my own thing because I don't know where that even like that Hulu special it's always it lives on Hulu somewhere is Hulu still a thing it's still a thing Hulu still I'm thinking of C so C so is not a thing anymore yeah I don't know he's so went under yeah that's where Stanhope at a special Diaz have a special really yeah a bunch of guys who are really funny people had specials on C so and now C so is not it doesn't exist oh yeah I've heard about that going under yeah they've tried that a bunch to see so was a Sony thing right wasn't it or is it NBC NBC I wouldn't be saying think you're right yeah now like Sony had crackle right that's just such a funny I was taking a call if Tompkins about crackles don't they go tonight crackle I can't remember how it went but oh if they called crack crackle be cute so funny I can remember it's so funny yeah well its are you happier now then I gotta tell you I was happier before what do you mean I was happier when my whole life was ahead of me and like when I first started hanging out a Largo and doing sets at the improv and being and and meeting all my heroes and comedy like to me that was ahead of your time now it's like I feel pressure to stay on stay where I'm at or beat success I don't know what it is I feel but it I feel like I'm working too hard and I'm not able to enjoy what I've accomplished and that's why I've been I've been trying to like I told you you showed me that that tank I've been trying to figure out how to stop my thoughts you can come in the tank anytime you want don't sit no don't come in the tank but you could because people do do that there's a tank center in place find out the name of that place give them a shout-out so the float lab in Venice is my spot that spot that built my tank they have a place in Westwood and they are the best in the world and they actually supply the tanks to the place in Pasadena the guy who put this my friend crash who put it in our studio just float just float is the place in Pasadena and I'm pretty sure it's the largest float center in the world so does that help you stop thinking no the opposite I think in there but I relax it's it's very relaxing physically because the water is warm and you float and you can do it after the show if you want I got another show that goes till 2:00 if you want okay you totally can I thank you for the oblem you could be the second person outside of me to be in there dan Harris from ABC Good Morning America it's the only other guy that's been in there dan is a big meditation proponent so I tried meditating and it just hurts my back and well that will be really good for your back because it's you become weightless you just float in there and the waters the same temperature is the surface of your skin so you don't feel the water after a while and you're you know you're in total darkness and total silence and you just chill out in there man well I'm gonna it still feels good I know that I got to do it I got to do something you know where I've heard this thing by Alan Watts and he talked about how we know we know how to prepare for life we don't know how to enjoy life once it gets here you gotta get good at that man that's that's a something that you really need to concentrate on that I don't you know I know you're doing really well right now and I'm a fan of yours so when you say you're not happy that bums me out I'm stressed yeah well you got to figure out a way to enjoy this I know that's what I'm trying to do smoke weed yes yeah well smoke a little bit more just just enjoy it a little bit more you know just like smoking weed in the morning and now I can't because I have to fuck and do stuff oh you definitely can yeah you'd have to trust me it could be done but then I can't do anything you can no you can't do you exercise no I can't exercise that's my problem I used to be like I used to love them see porn is all because you're gone but I don't know because of my bones I can't I every once awhile forget to do yoga or anything um no my doctor told me don't don't do anything your doctor told me to swim oh that's nice yes Swimming's great so he said I could swim oh okay so the most boring like swimming now I like getting high and swimming okay yeah it's feels good but you you can't actor ever exercise like lifting weights or anything along those lines because your bone issue but I would think that lifting weights would enhance your bone density it just hurts that's why can't I read I can't even pick up a suitcase really really fuck man have to be I forget often and I will then fuck and then my back hurts for the hold it back yeah so yeah cuz anyway but it's about becoming present and I listen this guy Eckhart Tolle a power of now oh did you yeah so that is really getting me he's still alive yeah yeah yeah so that's really getting me you know when things frustrate you I love what he says he goes the world isn't here to make you happy it's here to frustrate you so you wake up huh oh that wouldn't like oh so now you can use your frustrations as reminders to wake up hmm and so whenever something it's hard because you know I have a temper and I and that's the weird thing now I I hid my temper and my anger and through my stand-up and I was successful I had specials and everything but now I don't hide it and now I'm really sick now I'm selling tickets right because that's their ultimate goal is if you could sell tickets then you don't need anybody and I don't know why it's it seems like there's some sort of internal conflict between you getting angry and ranting and talking about things that are very important to you and then going on stage and doing stand-up I don't think that they should be mutually exclusive no I'm trying to bring them together now so now my wife would always tell me you got a rant on your sad upset you got a rant you got angry and I was like okay then I would never really do it well you just got to balance it out just gonna find out a way to make that rant funny and then you know find perspectives that are relatable where you you go into this rant but then bring it tease people in a digestible way you know yeah yeah what's happening is I'm showing videos now at my live show and those get me into that groove and I just dropped a video kind of videos like I just dropped a video about I did a live show at the flappers in Burbank and I did a I showed a video of Keith Olbermann apologizing to John McCain and George Bush on the view and that was yeah what is that so he I don't know he's trying to he was talking to Meghan McCain as recently this was a couple months ago is he going crazy because he retired from that show that he was doing in a basement so Trump excites the lizard brain of a certain kind of neoliberal and Olbermann certainly one of those guys he pretends all the problems in our country started on January 2017 and that's certainly not it like he was great he could just deconstruct what was wrong with Hillary Clinton back in 2008 when she was running as Obama yeah and he could deconstruct what was wrong with the Iraq war I was wrong with Bush and Cheney but I don't know what somehow all the sudden now he pretend it's like again he Trump excites his lizard brain and all his critical thinking skills go out the window and he pretends that all are dead Trump is the problem and not a symptom of the problem well it was like a scene in a movie when he was doing that it looked like a show in the basement somewhere with this weird background it was called the resistance so this is the resistance but he was also he didn't wasn't making connections like was that lit that really pretty conservative girl Tammy Lauren the after name she did a thing where she was covered in the American flag and he was talking about how hypocritical it is to be standing there holding draping yourself in the American flag and then Donald Trump jr. posts a picture of Tammy Lauren right next to him doing the same thing and Donald Trump jr. says it must be painful to be so stupid like and like well I don't even understand how he could have not known he took that picture did they say draped in it yes yeah like how could he not know that he took that picture so he admitted I'm so smart well that's the thing listen to me is incredibly articulate he's I love the skill in which he writes he's a great fraud I was just like Keith Norman that's the whole thing yeah I was a huge fan yeah it was great with sports he's sort of old-school II type delivery that I enjoy he's a great broadcaster and you always hear stories about his idiosyncrasies like he's a prick to work with and stuff and you go well fuck again what are you gonna do so who cares I don't I don't work with him oh I wanna watch it right well that's the truth with a lot of people that are apparently one of the things about being great at something is a lot of it you're fuckin fanatical about it yeah it crazy yeah absolutely obsessed and something is alleged yeah your people skills are out the window because you're so completely concentrated on something else yes yet so I could so he apologized he said that Donald Trump was worse than 9/11 and Megan McCain said do you really believe that in and his big comeback to that was your father was my favorite political figure of the 21st century and I'm like really who was the second Bernie Madoff are you fucking kidding me John McCain's a war monger who thrust him Sarah Palin on us and playing poker while they were trying to decide the fate of lives yeah with that that whole thing no talk to you murmurs that thing or John McCain they were in the middle of what was the exact scenario they were in the middle of some meeting in the Senate and they were deciding something incredibly important and they busted McCain planes Panos yeah it was about bombing Syria look at because he's four he doesn't do is it doesn't need to here look there is playing poker wargames McCain caught playing poker on iPhone during Syria debate just fucking imagine the type of person that could do that you're in the middle of talking about dropping bomb then are gonna kill people yeah they're absolutely gonna kill people they're gonna be come flying out of fucking high speed Jets yeah an easier play in poker this is boring I need to find out if I can get another ace ace in the hole baby suck on it I mean this is what I'm so and he called Rand Paul a Putin puppet because he was against Ukraine joining NATO I mean that's what javadekar kind of shit John McCain John McCain you know there might be bi I said this at a live show I go I don't disrespect his service nobody disrespects his service except the president desired state Trump which was the craziest thing ever I like people don't get caught I was like how the fuck can you say that so much of the shit that he has said just bounces off of him like I was that I was at the Comedy Store the other night and somebody was trying to say that that stormy weathers check is that her name yeah stormy weathers there was stormy Daniels sorry sorry stormy weathers do fuck was saying it was saying it I forget who said it but they were saying oh she's our Monica Lewinsky and I was like what the fuck are you talking about whoever's gonna that stormy Daniels is gonna tank trouble like you're out of your fucking mind I go it's gonna go right off his skin like a water on a duck it's not even gonna fit at all he's gonna say fake news never happened he's gonna keep moving and that's gonna be the end of it he's like no fucking way it's he's gonna get in trouble for that I'm like no he's not it's not gonna be anything you don't understand all the things that he's done so far grab him by the pussy all these different things it's like Charlie Sheen I read an article once it said when is the me to movement gonna hit Charlie Sheen I'll answer that fucking never you know why because you can't shame someone who doesn't have any shame right it doesn't work that's it if someone's not embarrassed you cannot embarrass them right you know I mean if someone says to you eh Jimmy door what are you a fucking comedian you're like yeah I'm a comedian yeah people called me dumb yeah I'm like I called myself dumb yeah that's not gonna get doesn't bother me you need some more than that Charlie she wouldn't go fucking whoremonger uh uh yeah yes I do it's well documented smoke crack and I bang horrors any other questions I got a go-bag horse that smoke crack I have time for this I have HIV and that's gotta go and that's all it's not gonna work you know Charlie Sheen is out there doing terrible things to women yeah you pays them that's what he does with all that fucking two and a Half Men money that's how I always felt about being a comedian like I I don't play by you don't get to judge me I fucking judge you like oh you're very aggressive you know you know like pointin and shit I never I never advocated for a war like the Washington Post New York Times MSNBC and CNN you can't you're gonna judge me over some fucking thing I said or did I never advocated for a war I never fired a guy who was speaking out against a war like MSNBC did in the New York Times who did MSNBC fire Phil Donahue Phil Tania at the number one show on the network at the time and they fired him because he was against the Iraq war that's recently fired and the first time Rachel Maddow or Chris Hayes says anything that costs MSNBC a nickel they will be fuckin fired just like and that's why they don't they don't and they're paid $30,000 a workday 30,000 yeah that's what she gets a workday yeah and you like her I used to think she was to dislike Leath Oberman they were fantastic and then Trump excites their lizard brain and she's lost her mind she's pushing a fucking Red Scare and McCarthyism and she should be a shit she should be shunned do you think that she's doing that rationally do you think that she is confused I've seen her being coerced and pushed into that certain direction I think she's being coerced and pushed but I think she goes along willingly and she's getting that 30 30 K a day she's not going to talk out against make a t-shirt she's okay they can have your way I mention it all the time like oh can I steal that crazy phrase okay I think I made my make their having a day and you can have your way the real problem is neoliberalism Joe the real problem is the system and they're never talked about that they want also tribalism write anything that opposes the other side must be good right and anything you can use on them must be good well that's what's happening right now with Trump and it's disgusting it's like there's a way to oppose Trump and it's not the way you're doing it the fucking fact the way they're doing it enhances Trump it makes him more powerful you keep coming at him that he all with his guy with the battered wife he gives up meanwhile they're spending 160 billion more dollars on bombs that nobody wants meanwhile half the country's poor or low-income 63% of Americans can't afford $1,000 emergency in the richest country the face of the earth has ever seen all the benefits of this recovery has gone to the upper 1 percent people haven't had a raise you know I just saw the afl-cio you know so Mike was telling you people give me shit because I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton right and I just saw the the afl-cio tweeted out last week that the the union unions have helped give democrats complete control of government four times in the last three decades and they have done nothing to help unions and they're saying vote third party they've got they got together with the teachers union and the postal union and they're like hey lesser of evil voting isn't working we have to somehow come up with a third party so they're there talking about it now so people who are wagging their finger at me I go hey even the union's agree with me now that we got to have a third party and if Bernie Sanders woulda went with a third party instead of propping up that corporatist warmonger like he did he could have really changed politics in America if Jill Stein in the green party would have got 10 or 15% of the vote or even 5% of the vote it would completely changed our politics in America because now the Democrats they wag their finger at their base and then they moved to the right like Hillary Clinton wagged her finger at the base and then picked Tim Kaine who was to the right of her right and so if if Bernie Sanders would have went with the greens and they would have made it showing now they can't do that they can't dismiss them anymore now they have to come together in a coalition right she but she was doing it in the calculated manner to try to get some Republicans and thought that Donald Trump was Republican they won't sue Oh know that Hillary Clinton their whole strategy was work fuck over working people are gonna try to get white-collar Republicans yeah that's not what your party is there's already a party for those people right there's a party's called the Republican Party you're supposed to be the party of fucking workers and that's why we don't have an opposition party in this country jail and we have to two parties that are Pro management you know that Nissan Nissan has 49 plants around the world three of them are not Union you know where those three plants are in the United fucking States so we got a broken system right our compare the problem is the Democrats are bought by the same people they're just a little you know and people go why do the Democrats keep caving why didn't they stand up against Trump for daca they're not caving they're standing up to you the voter and they're standing up to their donors their donors don't want the government shut down for one minute and that's what they're standing up for they could have stood up for the voters and and stood up for daca but they didn't they stood up for their donors so it's not like they're spineless they appeared spineless because they're you it looks like they're not doing what they're supposed to or what they stood or not and they're not doing what they said they would do which is stand up for the people but they're secretly standing up for their donors they have a steel spine when it comes to their donors which is why they just gave Trump 160 billion dollars could I make one last point about silent job so this shows you how they're full of shit when you say Donald Trump is an existential threat to our country and a maniac and he has his finger on the button and then you vote to give him 160 billion dollars more in bombs I think you're full of shit when you say he's accidential maniac when you say that this guy is unhinged and you can't be trusted and then you vote to expand his warrantless wiretapping and spying powers on his own enemies in the country that's what I know in you're full of shit because if they really wanted to check Trump they would check him on the military the Pentagon budget and his spying powers they've expanded all that stuff so if he's really a maniac those motherfuckers are the most irresponsible people in the world giving him all this extra power for the Pentagon and spying but they know the only reason they hate Trump because he ain't part of their fucking Club hmm Jimmy Dore just laid it down now you're gonna get hate mail from people that are Hillary Clinton supporters yeah come I hope you're ready yeah I but getting it my right since 2016 thing that always killed me about Hillary Clinton more than when I when I would talk to super Democrats like people that were just completely tribal there on the Democratic side no matter what I go you know she didn't support gay marriage until 2000 was the last one yeah she you know there was a sexual harasser on her campaign in 2008 and she didn't fire the fucking guy in fact she covered for him and anyone on to sexual harrass again and another organization tied to Hillary Clinton correct the record yeah well the problem is I think when you're close to her you find out all the dirty details what's going on behind the scenes and it's just a creepy creepy organization she was the word she was such a flawed a person for feminists to wrap their flag she's not the person there was another woman running in that race and it was Jill Stein I voted for her nobody cared about her though that was so it was a weird one because Trump is exactly what Hillary Clinton wanted the Pied Piper strategy you can't even entertain not voting for Hillary Clinton because of this existential threat of Trump and he's such an existential threat we're gonna vote to expand its buying powers and give him a bloated military budget well solve this hashtag I'm with her stuff to where they wanted to have one female president there would be a historical victory that's why so many people were crying on television I get that because they were watching in the vengers movie they weren't really involved in the actual political process itself they didn't understand what was happening and they didn't understand who she really was that's it from the beginning to the end if you go and there's just so much evidence remember that off-camera interview what she was talking about Qaddafi we Came we saw he died ha ha ha she's laughing like it's a psychopath what kind of a person is that that's a crazy person now Libya is a failed state exactly it's a failed state it's a horrifying haven for terrorists slavery's back yes you see that shit yes on YouTube you can watch slave trade yeah in Libya that's that's that's a success story yeah it's it's horrific but don't you let me ask you a question Joe I don't know if you like one of my big things is is the reason why I have a show is because mainstream news media suck so bad and the reason why you have this show is because late-night talk show sucks so bad right and and it's it's this that we're stuck they have commercials and and you know they have these things that they do and they have taught they never had this conversation no you would they would someone would come in Jimmy Joe listen you can't this is this is not the time you guys want to talk about this in your own time yeah time Hillary is this a lot of Hillary supporters on staff and they're very upset right now and they feel that you guys were misogynist see did you see Jimmy Fallon no I don't know Jimmy Fallon and when I've only bumped into him and he's always been a generous guy a gentleman and a nice guy and I couldn't nothing bad to say about Jimmy Fallon but they did a segment where they had Hillary Clinton and her writers and his writers came out and they all wrote thank-you notes and they read them to Hillary Clinton and at first I'm like this is gonna be hilarious and then it wasn't it was actually sincerely they were thanking her for what for being doing something and running for fucking grits the fact he guys shot him and left his wallet and his has watched their that was amazing that was a botched robbery Joe and yeah sure four o'clock in the morning did you see them took anything from him see Donna Brazile happened to leak so yeah she called him a fucking hero Donna Brazile said that that was scared that her to death she started pulling the blinds in her office she should so now the Washington Post this what I wanted to ask you they wrote a whole thing about how anybody who questions that the rich is crazy of course they do that they make you look like you're a fool because it's a conspiracy theory and can you say conspiracy theory conspiracy theorist in your whack job but what just the Russian thing is one big conspiracy theory right but just put it down on paper let's just look at what this look at real hard facts Seth rich was a Bernie Sanders supporter Seth rich was a patriot Seth which according to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks which have not been proven to be liars never had to retract anything they printed they've never had to do that he's saying that he leaked stuff to him there are consequences leaking stuff to WikiLeaks Seth rich was murdered at four o'clock in the morning shot in the back they said it was a botched robbery but no one took anything from him and there's never been anyone that's charged with it and there's no suspects I don't know I don't know what happened to him but that looks very suspiciously you're not even allowed to ask questions because I covered that story one day I covered it one day because that guy wheeler came out and he was saying he had all this he saw the computer and all this stuff so I covered that right and you're a piece of shit and in that in that video I did I literally said I don't know if this is true we're waiting for evidence unlike the mainstream news media with their Russia bullshit we're gonna wait for evidence right I literally said that inside that and then the next day I did another video which debunked that guy wheeler who was pushing that that story because he turned out he wasn't bullshit so what was a response though people still to this day he's fuckin smear me with that oh you pushed it I go I covered I would do a news show I covered a new show by the way why aren't you allowed to ask questions about an open murder investigation well not only that this is a relook this is a guy who was a real Bernie Sanders supporter open Bernie Sanders supporter who worked for the DNC the DNC absolutely rigged the primary against Bernie Sanders he was aware of this he was there while this was all going down so is Donna Brazile everyone was aware of it the guy got fucking murdered after he leaked information to WikiLeaks if you don't think that's a little weird what are you looking at what what what delusional rose-colored glasses are you looking at your party from but you think you're in some Julia Roberts movie from 1990 this is real shit some guy got killed he was 24 years old he was a young guy who was very optimistic and had this view of the world where he mean the kind of fucking war American flag pants and shirt there's a famous picture of him with a beer on he's a patriot in a lot of ways he wanted to be involved in the political process he was very idealistic because is he was probably shattered by finding out to the party that he was working for was corrupting the democratic process and because I've said this before you know I've been accused of helping Donald Trump win by really wacky people online like by pointing out all that flaws of Hillary Clinton like look man you can't ignore that shit because you want one side to win I've talked about all of his flaws too there's a lot of flawed human beings that run for president pretty much all of them I mean it's very rare you have someone who's not flawed right extremely flawed we're all flawed but extremely flawed who wants to be the fucking king of the world it's very rare well you know not to change subjects but Barack Obama everyone thinks is the greatest guy in the world you know in contrast to Donald Trump because he was polite he's a statesman he was he was like but at the end but he was polite at the same time he let cops crack the heads of peaceful protesters at Occupy Wall Street all across the country said he put on a soft shoe to stand up for unions he fucked over unions in Wisconsin when they took the teachers union away he opened the Arctic to drilling twice whenever shale oil wanted he said okay and he only closed it when they didn't want to do it anymore he took us from two wars to seven he cooked out five midpoint 1 million emily's are their homes instead of helping them and he made wall street whole while fucking over everybody else so this guy he and he made the Bush tax cuts permanent so there was what they say is that it looked like it was change on the outside continuity on the inside well the hope and change website had to be altered because there was all these things in there about whistleblowers about and then he prosecuted exactly anybody take he took it out of the website right he had all these segment sections in the website about offering protection for whistleblowers and and also they were like the worst when it came to the press no yes yes when I came to the press and people and freedom of the press and people getting in trouble for leaking information they were the worst the worst much Morriston brush they use the Espionage Act to prosecute journalists yes and their that's a fact and everyone turned their head you know Gregg Glenn Greenwald used to be a hero on the left until he started telling the truth about Barack Obama now he's a pariah right so up to the people I'll you know Thomas Frank I don't know if you know you would love that guy if you ever met him he wrote that book called what's the matter with Kansas which is examine what's wrong with conservatives and then he wrote a book called listen liberal which came out I think two years ago and he is persona non grata on MSNBC CNN nobody will talk to him because he critiqued the left and he just stepped out of line yeah UK no room for discourse he can't even get a job in the United States he has to write for the Guardian and that's a true story so I've had him on my show people love him and he comes out and he tells the truth about the the last Frank Thomas Frank he's got a great sense of humor too and he's real personable and he's he's an academic but he doesn't talk like one and his book is listen liberal is what radicalized me to not be able to vote for Hillary Clinton it opened my eyes to all the blah you know people still fucking blame Ralph Nader it's just unbelievable like you're allowed to participate in fucking democracy and Hillary Clinton was the only candidate in the history of politics who wasn't expected to garner votes by campaigning you just were supposed to owe her your fuckin votes if she doesn't have the votes you're supposed to go get the fucking votes yeah that's how it works is the first time ever I've ever seen she was poor health in solar shame she was having a really hard time Donna Brazile almost wanted to replace her she said in the book that it was all said her and her health was so bad they wanted to replace her because that was another thing that I got in trouble for not me you know for people saying like why do you keep talking about her health because it's a huge issue and also I happen to know a lot about brain trauma she had brain trauma and she passes out they said she was she was hot she didn't take her coat off listen I've been hot many times I go in the sauna all the time I never faint ok and I don't want to run for president listen you can't just fall asleep while you're standing up and be president that's not that's not in the books like I have a joke about in my act like I was like if that was my mom but like mom you can't be President you can't stand up fast and she'd fucking crack her head off the linoleum that's just a fact and but if you say that you're a misogynist you're you're alright I've been called alt-right for that like you're helping you're helping Toronto Trump win you're helping Trump this South Ridge thing is a real symptom and the ignoring of that case is a real symptom of what is wrong with this you can't isn't tribalism you can't discuss it listen that's crazy that you're even talking about it I can't believe that you talk about it so openly what do people people don't try to discredit you because of this it doesn't matter you can't what do I do I'm a Cagefighting commentator yeah go ahead I'm a pot addict I smoke the pot I got problems listen man I'm not a fucking reputable person that's what I tell my political ideologies I mean I'm just not I'm not that well-read when it comes to politics I have my opinions on things but when it comes to things that are rock solid and clear like that Seth Rich was murdered and people want to ignore it I'm like what the fuck do you think happened this has to be some sort of a disconnect here when a person is giving information to WikiLeaks that exposes corruption inside the very organization that's responsible for the fucking Democratic Party and he gets murdered and you're like oh the conspiracy theories no he got murdered there's no conspiracy it was a botched robbery says who says who where's his how come his wallet was there how come his watch was there how come they didn't take his phone what the fuck you talking about that I'm a conspiracy theorist when I just tell you the facts and that's this WikiLeaks thing with Julian Assange is the crazy shit ever when he said there's consequences to sharing information with us and everybody's like he works for Russia now he writes for Russia so is the darling of the left when Obama was in office oh isn't that amazing at that so Julian Assange he's just a great news guy with who's tough as nails who had dances creepy and might have fucked some girl while she was asleep that case was so fucked so far so fucked he's been so fucking it's because the CIA wants him so bad and they control everybody another truck they have influence over Ecuador and they're trying to fuck they're trying to get a Halliburton guy to be their new anyway they might just blow up that place no doubt a bright I wouldn't be surprised if shit like that have more stuff comes out like the seth rich stuff the amount of people and art this is where i leak any conspiracy theories the amount of people connected to hillary clinton organization to the clinton foundation to bill clinton the amount of people that have been iced is stunning but then some of them are bullshit and coincidental and you know people and they're in a weird job and people there's a lot of people but lot but don't you think i would i love when they talk about the uranium one story like it's debunked right bill clinton got a half a million dollars put directly in his pocket from a kremlin bank directly and then 142 million dollars flowed into the clinton foundation and it was fun to punch a bunch of motherfuckers surrounded a nuclear deal because they wanted to do charity so what's the argument that it was debunked they though they say they do few they say oh no this this is she was only one of nine things that had to sign off but there was all these other agencies that had to sign off on it and this and that it's all bullshit that was all influenced by AAHA date someone gave your clinton foundation 142 million dollars that's to buy influence and a half a million dollars in the bill clinton's pocket directly it's because they like how he talks pretty english in russia are you fucking kidding me so it's all bullshit so people know it's the bugs not the bunked it's not fucking you tell me why they gave 142 million dollars anonymously to a fucking clinton foundation that is such bullshit they're so corrupt if you believe is corrupt by doing deals with Oleg arcs this is Dylan Ratigan talking you have also have to believe that Hillary Clinton did arms deals around the country while personally enriching herself and Barack Obama is paid off by the Wall Street and of health insurance companies of big pharma so we don't have a functioning out of money sector or a health care sector it's hard to believe one and not believe the other too that's what Dylan Ratigan says and I believe that fucking guy he's an award-winning journalist and he said if you believe Trump is corrupt in this thing goes and it's easy to believe until no fucking prop but you also have to believe this you have to believe Hillary Clinton's at arms deals are all around the world enriching herself to the tunes of millions is the same thing with Barack Obama you can't believe one and not the other so my whole point is when people try to pretend that Trump is the problem they're missing the problem the problem is the neoliberal system that gave us trump that renders 63 percent of the population without a muff funds to handle a thousand dollar emergency in the richest country in the world that's the problem Jo and that's what people are if you think it's it's it's Trump Trump is a symptom of a bigger problem I don't even think that guy wants to be President he doesn't and I think he fucked up and I think he was running and people gross tastes like shit when these people hate him so much they want to they want to impeach him right my favorite parts in the election process was when he was saying I gave you money I gave you my fear I was like God it it who'd have thought it would be Trump to fucking out these people I know it has he did anything when Obama was mocking him at that a press junket thing what does that think yeah it was at the war correspondents yeah the Correspondents Dinner when he was mocking him he said one thing that I am that you'll never be President of the United States and and he see Trump's in there going oh yeah motherfucker and like that very well could have been like he was talking about running for president he eighties right but he never did never did I thought about in the 2004 election never did but that fucking Stross now and he's in it and we're on he did it and always knows in do you think that it's a good thing to have someone who's fucked up is he is like in terms of like how we view a president in terms of like all the by the pussy in the paying off a hundred women list all the crazy shit and all the lies like he gets caught in lies tell me what's worse Donald Trump says grab them by the pussy or Barack Obama says I'm gonna fix everything for you and then he kicks your family out of their house 5.1 million families out of their house while making Wall Street whole and then when he'll eat then he comes back in the public life after retiring the first thing he does is give half a million dollar speeches to banks you fucking tell me what's worse is that what he's doing now that's what he did yeah first when he worked he went windsurfing with Branson and then he came back and he gave speeches to the Carlyle Group and some other people out half a million bucks a crack Raisa Bosh and Chris Hedges says which tell us why I love Chris Hedges he was a guy who told the truth about the Iraq war and they New York Times fired him for it which is why the New York Times you can't fucking believe that you can't listen to these met establishment newspapers when they talk about war right so now I fucking forgot what I was saying god damn it um Obama coming back into office so Chris Hedges says they steal right out in the open now they don't even try to hide it and that's what that is well that was one of the funniest things about the Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton debates is like what'll Jude released the transcripts released a transcript must have been some kind of a speech six hundred thousand dollars I'd love to hear what you had to say yeah that was fuckin debbie Wasserman Schultz yeah yeah people keep we're so fucked up in this country Joe that we nominate the most repulsive neoliberal corporatist war monger in the history of the Democratic Party the most unpopular nominee ever she loses to a fucking game show host it doesn't even want to be President and what do we do we blame another country we talk about not wanting to examine the system that game is stay put and that's all they'll talk about is blaming another country and what is the big news of the week that we really concentrate on his hair flopping off in the breeze in France the hair opens up and you see the back of his head on that look at the comb over look at the comb-over look at it it's right there well it was new but it was dramatic the way in blue it was dramatic the way it blew open it was like a wing opened right it was like there it was like you seeing something you're not supposed to say yes like up a skirt it was like his head had an ass yes I heard that someone say that yes that's a good way of looking at it like this his his head was mooning us yeah yeah yeah it was and by the way people are gonna mistake everything I'm saying for defending Trump does he shave his head take it from a guy who's got his head shaved Donald now how long do you shave your head cuz I don't ever remember you're having however it's like you in my head 7 2011 maybe I think someone's so even like when I met you in 2004 whenever that was I just remember he was being bald and even though you weren't obviously now in my head yeah memories I do too I look at pictures of me from fear factor my odd hair you ever having hair hanging on one of those guys who can pull it I couldn't pull it off you could pull it off I don't you think you couldn't until you do it and then you realize it's some guys can just gray hair - I can't do great fucking drilling I can't do it I have to dye my hair all the time but when you let your hair grow gray you have that or of you know distinguished nests you're a distinguished gentleman you've you've aged and learned and yeah I don't need no you don't want to die I don't want to die and I don't need to be distinguished I want everyone to think I'm the you know Jerry Seinfeld when he was getting an award he said I don't like doing this I don't like getting awards I'd rather be saying in the corner making fun of the guy getting an award and that's exactly how I yeah that's me - I don't want an award I don't want to be in your club I don't wanna you know yeah what so what do you think about the Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos the richest guy in the world and fascinating and he sits on a pentagon board and he has a six hundred million dollar deal with the CIA and he runs the paper of no wait wait wait six hundred million dollar deal with the CIA yeah which is like something twice as not Alexis doing so it's not Alexis just gathering up information on everything you do yes it is fucking thing yeah yeah it's not good Jamie and I were just talking about that new Apple home thing which has the most amazing microphones Jamie was saying that while the music is blaring you could say hey Siri just real quiet hey Siri don't you suck my dick seriously I can't do that sir details about the CIA's deal with Amazon six hundred million dollar computing cloud built by an outside company is a radical departure from the risk-averse intelligence community now they're in bed with the Washington Post or Jeff Bezos and now he also sits on a pentagon board he's got so much money he's fascinating to me because like what how do you keep going when you have a hundred and five billion look what's getting you up in the morning so he's a megalomaniac right how do you accumulate more wealth than any person in the history of the world that means kings queens that's not necessarily true the reason why is we don't count the same kind of money that the oligarchs have like especially people that first of all people have said that it's very possible that Putin is the richest man alive because they're not counting how much money Putin is stolen from all the various companies that he's just sort of absorbed and that he owns all that stuff but also we don't count all these kings and these princes in the Middle East they're not publicly they're not public people okay so so let's say of all the people we can count he's the richest guy a billionaire friend of mine who's a legitimate billionaire who told me that it's entirely possible that some of these guys are trillionaires some of these middle-eastern guys he's like you've never seen wealth like this it's insane and you know in the United Arab Emirates they make it rain every week once a week they make it rain I mean they see the clouds really get rain yeah because they're in the desert and like yeah I don't like this I like it to rain so they fucking put all that shit that they have to put into the sky to make it rain which they've been doing forever cloud seeding but insanely expensive but they do it once a week so fifty-two times a year it rains there so what would you see you see a problem with the richest guy in the world owning the political paper of note and being in bed with the CIA and he's on a pentagon board ya know it's all spooky it's like some kind of Orwellian fucking nightmare it's got so much money and you can't criticize him in the paper they won't let their you know the people who write for that paper aren't going to Washington Post can't write anything bad about they're not gonna write they the wouldn't imagine they would even dare one guy wrote something bad about Amazon and The Huffington Post he got disciplined there was a guy who was a writer for The Washington Post wrote something in The Huffington Post that was critical of Amazon and he got disciplined at the Washington Post for doing that so that's the world we live in and then we have the government if you ever try to tell about a crime inside the government then the government will use the Espionage Act to crack down on you so we're again we're living in Oleg Archy Joe we our democracy has already been taken from us so you know that this isn't a democracy they've done studies this is provable what's the thing about that from the Huffington Post tell me dear Ellis but was it valid was it a valid criticism was it about he criticized about how Jeff Bezos treats his workers okay that has been an open area of discussion that they like I've talked to someone who actually worked there and they were saying that they get like a countdown so say an order comes in they literally have like a countdown on their tablet when the countdown says you know like I don't know what the net amount of time is but you have to run and find that fucking product and get it in the box and get shipped out inside a very small window of time you go so I'm literally running I go you run he goes yeah you literally run because if you don't meet your countdown he goes you could only like get away with that for a certain amount of times then you get in real trouble so they also have these new things the wrists the bands that they've just developed a shock you or that shock you know were you serious yeah I was joking they've I guess they just fucking shot you he'll pull it up they but they'll vibrate and if you're going if you're if you're moving the wrong way it'll shock you bad you know shock you back to the right does it hurt or is it like if you don't think of your new Cadillac yeah if the new Cadillacs if you if you go too close to the side it gives you a little gives you a little feeling Amazon parabens designed to track and trace dear employees movements so Jeff Bezos it's been reported it which is true is that he would rather that's not run and run so now there's plenty there's there's a couple different fixes for this the problem of the robots one of them would be unions right so I'm like my whole thing is you know why can't we unionize Amazon why can't we use a nice Walmart I know they make it hard Walmart literally shut down their meatpacking in Texas because of the meat packing group they unionized in Texas they fucking we're not gonna sell meat anymore in Texas that's how we'll fuck over the Union so but we got to figure out a way to get unions in there's another thing you know Teddy Roosevelt was a trust buster which was that he was a monopoly buster you know 50% of all online purchases go through amazon.com in the United States 50% yeah you know 51% of households in America have Amazon Prime only 49% have a landline so more people have Amazon Prime in the United States than have a fucking landline so why is that real so Teddy Roosevelt would come along and go we got to break this company up Wow he would say this is ant but first of all Jeff Bezos because he owns the paper he got the Trump was right when he said he's dared to get the tax in his favor because he was able to go around and hollow out economies of Main Street little small towns all around because he didn't have to play taxes income tax and for Amazon and so the brick-and-mortar places did he closed them down by undercutting them right because he and now he's opening up brick-and-mortar stores he closed down all the barns and nobles and the Borders Books and now he's opening up Amazon book stores did you know that no yes 6064 there you go 64 it's even up higher than four when I look to have Amazon Prime now how many of those people use it for television this is my question because I know that Amazon started to make apparently some very good shows but I don't hear anybody talking about watching them like apparently Billy Bob Thornton has a really good show on Amazon and I know there was that Jeffrey Tambor show that got tanked do you know that's an interesting need to story the the Jeffrey Tambor one the because he was he's playing a transvestite or transgendered and there was people and he's not transgender and there's people in the show apparently that were very upset that a transgender a non transgender person was playing a transgender person well it's acting yeah well they didn't like that and the this there was a lot of internal dispute because of that which may or may not have led to the accusations I used to be much cartilage I used to be harder on transgender when I say harder on transgender I mean a boner no I mean when I used to make I used to make jokes about them because I don't understand right I understand it was a real thing I thought it was just guys fucking having fun well some of them we all we all like to fuck it and feel a little weird I go but you know I mean I don't go out in public and so but then I realize this is actual thing with a lot of people that they're actually born they have the different feeling than their outside yeah then I realized it was a thing and so now I don't do that anymore it's gender dysmorphia you know it's there's there's definitely people that have issues in their mind where they wish that they were a different thing than what they are I think the thing that concerns me more about transgender people than anything is this acceptance of using hormone blockers for young children and I just think that is fucking insane and this is something that the liberal progressives are pushing at an alarming rate it's a terrifying idea you know there's there's plenty of discussion about this online there's plenty of people that think that age six is a fine year to start this yeah we've talked we've had people on the podcast who infiltrated this this transgender group and we're talking about their kid their kid identifies with a girl but the kid is six is this two year too young to start and you know then that their major is it's too young they were saying no it's not you know it's a studies show that that's the they're just horse shitting they want more people to do it so that they feel better okay you ever met a married guy that wants you to get married because they're fucking miserable as shit I don't want to call anybody out but famous guy have a conversation with famous guys tell me how great it is to be married Mel Gibson was with his wife yells at him tells him what to do and all this shit and he gets things done this way and I'm like what the fuck are you talking about he's now divorced I'm married okay this is many years ago this guy was fucking miserable but he was trying to tell me that it's a good thing to be married because when you're married you have to answer to someone that someone tells you what to do I go what he was telling me that his wife calls him a fucking asshole and it makes him more I go I go my friends don't call me that's all why unless I man if I if one of my friends calls me a fucking asshole I've made a huge mistake that's like living and married to your football coach yeah it wasn't me right what's to do that it's wrong bucket of Gatorade on your head like the whole thing's ridiculous but it was literally there's a misery loves company thing that happens so people who are married want you to be married to now I'm not saying that's absolutely what's going on with people who are transgender but they're most certainly in support of more people doing it and I don't know if that is why they would lean towards having six year olds take hormone blockers but if you criticize that in any way you were thought to be transphobic and this is a real issue today where people are bringing this up over and over again I don't know why anyone would think that it's a good idea to take a six year old and put them on hormone blockers but they don't know what the fuck is going on with the world their body is changing they're going through all this growth and development and for you to chemically hijack that for an ideology seems to me as an outsider to be fucking insane but to talk about it you run the risk of being thought of as being transphobic it's a very strange time to discuss things because you can't have an opinion about it because oh you're a cisgendered white man with all sorts of privilege look at you you macho piece of shit yeah people like to or they'll say you're mansplaining exactly it's like well I'm a guy and I have an opinion so I'm not allowed to have that opinion ever I mean I understand there's a there's a time and a place the same mansplaining door but I don't think there is there's a tell find a place to say that someone is talking down to people yeah happen to be a man that's fine yes the problem with the term mansplaining is that you know the man is correct if a woman is saying something that's incorrect and a man corrects her he's mansplaining yeah well that's ridiculous so that's what it's it that too often it's turned into that just like I said the hashtag me to we're all against sexual harassment at work but we're not for Puritanism exactly so it's when people hijacking certain things I think that what we're going what's going on with hashtag me too and a lot of things in this society is we're undergoing a radical cultural change and it's brought about by information I think we are way more aware of each other's feelings way more aware of what's okay way more aware of what we're willing to tolerate what we're not willing to tolerate and if you go back to the 1930s in the 1940s and watch old films where people smack the shit out of women and and rape them and do all kinds of crazy stuff and it was thought to be normal those are the heroes he had a woman right equation yes John Wayne would do that but how about that what's the guy I forget his name but he took the grapefruit right in her face yeah yeah what was that goes Adam John Wayne it was that's the short guy oh yeah fuck uh I can't make it Rooney no the other short guy was it Oh Jimmy James Cagney keep it I couldn't think of his name I couldn't either again I wish you were there well but I like a tie oh fuck at the N Sync yet what dick well it's kind of a nasty saying that it so she said that and he sticks the group to break the grapefruit right in her face oh wow that is kind of a meet that's a dick move back it's a ruthless fucking seen horrible ow I'll try to do that today maybe you know have some you know name a guy who's a Ryan swag Adler okay one of those guys when I'm handsome fellows do it do it to some beautiful young name a girl who's a good Hema stone yeah how about that sucks a grapefruit in her face people be like oh fuck movies and then she just kind of cried and she hasn't even reactor oh oh that man beat the fuck out of women back that was normal yeah yeah horrible so dead I think what those things represent right but what it also represents is what was acceptable culturally to witness in a film that is not acceptable culturally to witness in a film now especially from the fucking hero of the show I think today we're more aware than ever before of of how people feel of how people think of what's acceptable what's not and what was wrong with the way people used to behave whereas it was just we were operating on momentum in the 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s and 70s the internet came along and people are just sharing information of this unprecedented pace yeah yeah I just found out about John Lennon what about him that he admitted to beating his girls girlfriends really did you hurt you'll go or no sing you gotta you gotta give him cut him a break but it was what I guess it when he was younger and he said you know I have to make up for the things I can't deny what I did I have to make up for it I was like wow I'd you don't want to hear that right not about Hendricks to know yeah yeah yeah see if you can find that dude Hendricks Hendricks story is very disturbing because Hendricks might have been murdered it's very possible really murder you don't have to imagine John Lennon beat women and children it was just a fact a beat children who'd he be what children terrible things the famous asshole did during his lifetime written by a woman hashtag me too yeah it was a different time I bet I bet a lot of people did terrible things back then I guess he wasn't one of his kids he wasn't nice to I forget which one Julian or the other anyway it's tough it's not you don't wanna you know Steve Martin's dad might give a read his book he talked about how his dad hit him a little too hard one time when they were never friends after that Jesus and did you get hit as a kid growing up no no it didn't give really good your mother got hit yeah okay yeah my mother got hit but my dad but then she left my dad Oh your dad didn't hit you completely made up Jimi Hendrix Australian girlfriend savages new film which shows rockstar beating up her character okay all my sides inaccuracy has been criticized by Hendrix as friends his former girlfriend disgusted by scenes depicting domestic violence never consulted her about betrayal okay so that might not be true but there was there was another someone had said that there was a situation where Jimi was in the other room and he hit his girlfriend like someone was talking about it from a first-person perspective I don't know if that was the girlfriend the fascinating thing about Jimi was that he had this gangster manager who had him kidnapped his manager had him kidnapped so that he could release him so that he could rescue him so that he can't keep Jimi on as a client and this is all that came from a really recent book that was one of the gangster guys bodyguards like one of the people that worked for him so very fascinated so he was afraid that Jimi was going to get rid of him as a manager so he engineered a a kidnapping that he could solve Jimmy would feel indebted and bring among his manager and this guy who wrote this book I don't know how much of this is real and how much of it's bullshit but thinks that they murdered Jimmy Hendrix and then right after that the girlfriend of Jimmy Hendrix was thrown off of a roof yeah really yeah and they said she committed suicide but he says they threw her off a roof and she knew about Jimmy's murder really yeah I don't know I don't know I don't know I stranger things have happened than that Joe well that whole business in many way it should Knight write that whole business the music business has been run by gangsters for a long fuckin time look at Phil Spector right the guy who shot that woman in the face like he used to put guns in people's mouths all the time if that business was run by gangsters whatever so the idea of Jimi Hendrix manager being a gangsters is not outside the realm of possibility you go back to the syros nightclub days where it's the comedy stores today that was run by Bugsy Siegel it's a fucking gangster of joint well that's where they had musicians play and fucking Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin played there I mean oh really that was run by fucking murderers that was the one reason why everybody was willing to believe that the comedy store was haunted if you look at like the haunted you know dictionary of look places or the directory of places the comedy starts like one of the top places on the list in Hollywood there it is I'm pretty sure that's the fucking main room man I provide there I'm going there tonight I'll be standing right there that guy is I mean it's crazy that the store is essentially the same fucking place as it was then Wow yeah I believe it's haunted dude they killed a shitload of people in that place and there's a but that's the front door oh how nice that look it's an amazing yeah that's really dark and evil yeah meanwhile was evil er then now we're just telling jokes that was fun that night I haven't done many sets of the Comedy Store in Los Angeles the bet was it was a blast I really Sam Tripoli thanks for bringing me on that show doing his show tonight Oh a show tonight it's in the main room if the place is the best it's it's just it's soaked with history look at that hump we blow that my girlfriend the face with a grapefruit shake look at them cigarettes and cigarettes nobody worked out nope but you everybody looked like shit and you're Ronald Reagan yes Father Reagan who's the girl I don't know that state that's Dean Martin right Nancy Reagan that's Nancy no really dancing around Reagan wow she got one even bigger Martin Jeannie beer that's Dean Martin right Martin while Dean Martin looked weird too it's just a weird angle he's probably hammered so like I always wanted to be those guys like I wanted to be Dean Martin I wanted to be the Rat Pack I wanted to be I should be dreaming Jimmy do Leo let you have a good chance of being jimmy dore well I gotta it's hard to find out who that guy is oh I see but if you're on the outside maybe there's a kid right now listening going god damn it Jimmy door I want to be you I don't even know who the fuck you are well yet I hope you have you ever thought about this I've thought about it like this if I if somebody would have whispered in my ear when I was 18 years old you know you I had a lot of anxiety as a kid like what I'm gonna do with my life right I had no role models to do anything I grew up in this blue-collar neighborhood I didn't want to do anything anybody fucking did there me too same thing same story yeah that's crazy right so you become a comic yeah and that's how I became a comic and I if somebody would have whispered in my ear when I was younger like hey this is how it's gonna work out I'd have been a lot more relaxed yeah but then you would have made it probably not hate it know you had that anxiety is important that the heart the horrible feeling of insecurity it all pans out because that makes you work like you don't want to be comfortable you don't that's one of the things that I I'd like to do things that I'm not good at it's one of the reasons what I like to do yoga is one of the reasons why I like to run hills it's one of the reasons why I like to do things like archery and bow hunting and stuff like that it's fucking hard to do so it's humbling jiu-jitsu it's very humbling and in doing these humbling things you're always insecure you're always struggling you have to somehow or another constantly being a state of struggle but it doesn't mean you have to be in a state of struggle all day all your life but you have to understand what that feeling is because that feeling is the only way you progress it's the only way you advance suddenly you get better at things you get better at yourself you get better at life but you have to go through that all the time it's a muscle that has to constantly be exercised it's like you're talking about doing stand-up like Jerry Seinfeld saying take four days you feel it take fighters off people know it yeah that's the same thing with struggle you you got to constantly be engaged in improvement and trying to figure out how to improve things that's how you advance that's how you advance technique that's how you advance thought that's how you advance ideas and bits that's how they progress well you have to feel that fucking uncomfortable feeling that everybody wants to avoid everybody wants to feel comfortable well that call that so when I was on the road you know when you were talking about how putting together your next special on how you're gonna do it terrified and all you have to go through you know when I was on the road I remember like even in El Paso Texas I'd be working and I would do two shows and I would go home after we're after words to the condo and I would listen to both shows before I went to sleep you know now I know most guys didn't do that you know but I just had to do it and it was almost like I was embarrassed to let the other comics know I was listening to my set mmm but it was like just like that it's like I don't I don't want to be stuck here I want to be I have someplace I want to be right and I got to get there and if this helps me get there I want to get there I want to figure out what the fuck how do I get to be like that guy how do I get to be like Jerry Seinfeld how to be like Brian Regan how do I get to be like those people I want to be like and you know I just studied them and I just so it's that whole thing of you have to have a desire to be somewhere that you're not yeah well that's one way to look at it but for me that I feel like that takes care of itself if you continue to improve so my thought has always been on the thing itself like the craft the bits the chunks and there's some material from my past I'm embarrassed as fuck about I can't go like if I go on YouTube and I see some old thing from 1999 or so I'm like oh it's fucking death I can't look at that but what what I'm concerned with is like what I'm doing right now how do I get that better how do I tighten that up I'm not thinking one day I want to perform in this place and then I'll have truly made it that's a trap the but what's not a trap is making the work better like constantly improving the work and since I've been focusing on that the more I focused on that the better my act is got oh yeah definitely you're right about that to trap because well why do you think it's a trap when you say oh I want to play theaters you're still you somewhere yes with that same stupid yes that's right still bugs you and you think everything's gonna be different and it's like I'm stand and what I think fucks people up when they make it if they're like I feel exactly the same yeah and they don't know what to do with them so that that's kind of like where I got right like oh I can do whatever I want go wherever I want see and I still feel the same and that's when I started listening to Eckhart Tolle and I started to try to be present try to learn how to enjoy the moment more and the doing yeah right so when I'm undoing and that's what I realized also is that when I'm on stage I'm never more present than when I'm on stage right like I am that whatever that magic is to be present it and it gives you it's like when people say they meditate they have energy after I have so much energy after I get off stage even if it's a shitty show right because I'm just being present the whole time I'm not thinking about my bills or what happened yesterday I'm just thinking about right this fucking moment and it fuels me and that's why I just wanna go I want to figure out how I could go back to being a committee well you can be I mean you definitely did it the other night so yeah yes you just got to do it more I'm just pushing my song man pushing myself to get out there more and it happens to people where they get a television show and it happened to me when I Got News Radio I was doing very little comedy and I wasn't writing at all and my axe started to suck I was having this I had the same old stupid act that I had for years there was a period of like two years where I didn't write a fucking single joke I would just go up and do the same set I wasn't doing any TV sets and I just kept bombing and one time I bombed in front of some writers news radio and I realize like oh my god yeah I have to get back to work and then I really started dedicating myself and really started paying attention again I bought a recorder so I could record all my SATs or I even installed a DAT machine at the Comedy Store I bought it really tall it installed installed microphones yeah I changed the microphone I bought a whole new sound system for the Comedy Store really yeah yeah so I couldn't start recording my sets and listening to all of them fantastic yeah I just and now I just use my phone you know yeah iPhone it's amazing yeah but you gotta fucking you gotta be concentrating on the work that's the thing man and the more you concentrate on getting it better and the more you tighten it up and that's where the real happiness and performing is isn't doing a great job it's not unlike the places that you go I still get nervous like it was some some places I'll get nervous you know like I did the theater at Madison Square Garden that made me nervous I was like holy shit I'm performing at the fucking garden but then after the shows I was like well that was a show so normal shows ran everything was great went well but it was fucking weird man isn't it Wendy hi cuz you're just mind fucking yourself it's the same jokes as sane people it's just a different brand so I used to work this club in Chicago called the funny firm which was a 400-seat room right downtown Chicago was great room around the corner was the improv and they made it really hard to play the improv if you lived in Chicago and so I remember I had a god I got a shot to do a set there and I was freaked out I'd have a good set and I came off and my friend Steve see Gringo's he goes it's the same fucking people that are around the corner Jimmy they're right here it's the same fucking people yeah and that's like I know he's right I know he's right and but I still fall into that but if you went up a week later you probably find yeah yeah it's just it it more often it's against it's the newness of the situation and don't you feel like that's a problem with filming a special you film a special it's like here it is ready go cameras on oh my god relaxed normal I have one chain what I did my hour special for Comedy Central I thought we'd shoot two and then we put it together but for whatever reason we only had enough money to shoot one I was like what I should for oh really yep not you before but I could have used the first one you know why because I knew I had four barrels I knew I had four shots and when I did it before what I had two I did Denver I had two and the first one a lady heckled me I was like oh no now we have one it's terrible right something like he got out four and you know four I was relaxed like I did the Fillmore in San Francisco for my last one and it felt like regular activity it was normal that's great place yeah that's why I did my hour special was at the Fillmore was a really grateful great place but I'd done that place before I was comfortable I love San Francisco I worked there all the time so everything just sat right in but I knew I had four shows like I feel like too many people put too much pressure on themselves to do one and remember about Hicks when Hicks did relentless he did it in in the UK and he did one big show and it just was flat it just seemed flat he didn't seem loose it wasn't it was like he was just going through these motions that he had done before that were funny but he wasn't connected to it you could feel a tension of doing one show and I had seen him many many times and I remember I watched it with this girl that I was dating it she goes he's really interesting but he's not funny that's what she said I was like damn bitch Wow you know it's tough dead don't you know that how about you shut the fuck up you probably read in her face no a Kiwi I always thought it was that Bill Hicks it just it's hard to capture someone on film as a stand-up it's hard to capture that like Dennis Miller's black-and-white that was I think the greatest example of capturing that and but bill I just thought it was like well Bill's funny in person but he doesn't transfer to TV that well cuz it his specials didn't come anywhere close to being how funny he wasn't I think he just never they never got it right I think they needed to get him at a club yeah hey man you ever cease saying my ass yes that captured him exactly yeah did that at the Houston laughs stop he did himself right yeah see that's but when you do that then you're getting you know a bunch of different sets you find the right one but and you do it at a comedy club where it's comfortable I think more people should do sets at comedy clubs and and film specials at comedy clubs I have a couple different theories for why but one of the big ones is when you're at home you're in a living room it's intimate you want your couch TVs just right there it's not fucking a million miles away on a giant big-ass screen so it feels weird to watch something on you know the big-ass giant place 50,000 people at Kevin Hart did is special I think that that it's funny you know obviously the materials great great delivering everything that but I think everything is enhanced more with an intimate environment my favorites about one of my favorite specials that I did I did at the Comedy Works in Denver it's like I think it's what does that place Sunnyview 300 people on things really might be 300 I just saw Judah Friedlander and he did his all in the Comedy Cellar I think I'm perfect and it was all a bunch of different from over like a couple months so he just you know he would just put his camera Grantland it was and he did it in black and white Oh see if you do that man you get it you get the right show yeah he did it when you're trying to capture one moment one night what are the odds that it's gonna be perfect right so much pressure on you you're right I never thought about that that you're in this big huge thing and people are watching it in the room and it makes sense yeah I definitely want to do my next special in a club did you see Dave Chappelle's new Netflix special the one that he did at The Comedy Store belly room he did two of them he did one in a good size place in DC things like a couple thousand people and then he did another one at the belly room which was like 70 people and I was there for that one really yeah wow this is interesting that he's like it's so conversational but like when you're at home it's great because it's like he's right there you see the people or literally as close to him as you are to me and then you're right there too like you're in the more the room with them I'll check that out now I have hymns intimate you feel it you know and how is it funny it's fucking hilarious okay the one indc's genius oh yeah the one in the belly room is great too but in a different way because it's like it's more like really current event stuff like he's talking about louis c.k like there he is up there so it's like louis c.k and Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey is a big part of the material that he was talking about so and it was right after it happened he filmed this in November so it was just a couple of months ago and it was out in New Year's New Year's Day oh I'll check it out definitely I haven't thought you know I have Amazon Prime I don't like to brag oh you and 65 fucking million what is it 64 percent 64 percent 60 64 percent of the country I wonder how many of those people are watching it on TV though that's the thing Amazon Prime just for the TV part I mean how many of them are using the TV part of prime how many even watching because I have Amazon Prime I know I never remembered he I never used it for TV no I've never do you still have old-time cable I have DIRECTV oh so that's old-time cable yeah I still have it I'd like to flip through that I like cooking shows and I like watching boxing and you yeah but sports it's great for lives yeah yeah but I don't really I don't watch the footballs too much anymore it's just you know I did watch the Super Bowl it was even though I loved watching New England lose I didn't it didn't really the game just doesn't excite me anymore just just a bunch of fucking millionaires and that's kind of you know once they get younger than you - it's hard to get excited it was all these different things all right I don't know is that stupid I mean it's always do but if it's stupid to you okay I mean it just was a lot and now and when I move help from Chicago to LA I just sports just seemed so much less interesting now I like watching sports like I like boxing because it's very much like stand-up comedy there's no hiding right you know you reveal who you are in the ring right and just like as a stand-up there's no writing there's no fucking light show or music underneath they're fucking dancing girls it's just fucking you and your ideas and so that's why I like boxing and I oh and I've realized again it's uh people are thinking I'm blowing smoke up your ass but I don't like to watch I like to watch UFC I like to watch the fighting but only if you're announcing it because I like the back stories and all that shit that you give to it that no one else seems to be able to do it just kind of rolls all right off of you it just falls out of your mouth other people or noun sirs just it's not just boring so I don't watch well thanks very nice to you but it's just because I care about it you can sell it's been a part of my life since I was a little kid and so for me it's very important when I'm watching this and explaining what's happening like physically like to lurk to understand what the Gracie brothers and what their what they did yeah and it's like that's interesting right that's that's what heightens everything you know when you're watching and and that's why I like to watch boxing because those guys stories they're always these unbelievable his mother abandoned me was eight he walked brazil for three years so that's like that's the it's a do or die and it's one-on-one and that's why I love Bob well it's what we were talking about earlier when we were talking about Jay Leno's new show is that he's actually passionate about it someone's passionate about something it comes through when it's real when it's genuine and they if they can articulate it it comes through and I think if you're not doing something you're passionate about understand that watching someone who is doing something that like the jll show or anything along those lines when you see someone you go oh that's that feeling that's that magic that's that thing where someone's like really excited about it like it's legit like it's in their bones and if it's not in your bones man you better find what it is because you're missing out on you know you're only getting to seven life goes to ten and you're not you're not ever hitting the high spots you know you might be fine being staying at seven forever I've been attend to many times you like being at ten that's the problem most people never get to five it's amazing most people most people I grew up with and stuff is just it's system you know comedy opened my you know I grew up on the south side of Chicago we could see I could see the Sears Tower in the John Hancock building which were the two biggest buildings in sugar you could see downtown from where I live nobody ever went there you know it was like I guess I guess if you grew up in the Bronx you could see Manhattan you never went right so but and then comedy kind of open that up for me I went into those neighborhoods and I under and I was like this is awesome yeah I fucking love this city the whole thing it was suck X I said it was such a heady experience for me and think my whole life was ahead of me and no matter who you are if you kill if you're a stand-up and you kill I don't care if you kill at Zanies is 150 people or if you kill a Madison Square Garden it's still killing the same feelings 10 it's 10 you hit 10 you hit a joke and boom when you hear the roar like that's 10 and if there's nothing no um my brother I remember the first time I got a paid gig it was in Wheaton or Wheeling Illinois anyway was $50 and I was tell him I had to drive 50 miles to go make $50 to do comedy which to me was a victory right yeah and he he worked for the power company in Chicago Commonwealth us and he goes they'd have to pay me $50 just to drive there right and I'm like yeah but when you get there you have to go to fucking work when I get there I'm the center of attention it's there's a party happening and I'm the guest of honor and I'm gonna get a blowjob afterwards whoa which I did that night in the church parking lot it was fantastic a church bar yeah I was like weird a parking lot of a church anyway so that's the so that's why I loved stand-up comedy it's like there's nothing like it everywhere you go you're the guest of honor at a party that's another thing that people probably never totally understand about stand up that haven't done it is you become attractive whereas you're just a guy all right before right you're just a guy there's a guy right now you're a guy and girls are going after you yeah like what is happening I remember the first time that happened I was in I was stunned like I'd come off stage I killed and this girl came right up to me she want to talk to me I'm like is this a trick like it's some girl in Connecticut I'll never forget it she put her hand on my chest and she was talking me you are so funny how long have you been doing this oh my god you're hilarious you're kidding I was like what is going on here this is fake this girl what is she gonna do to me she's just someone around gonna rob me like what's happening it was so weird even when afterwards her and I had sex I was like this seems fake doesn't seem real first time that happened to me I was I was working at Zanies thought maybe I should too late and I was I come offstage and this woman came up to me and she says where you go and I go I'm going to the bathroom and she says do you need any help and and at that club there's just one it's not a big bathroom it's one stall right so you get your own room right and I go I don't know if my if the my boss would appreciate that or something like that and she says well I'm here with the boss's wife which I don't know if she was or not and so she follows me into the bathroom and gave me a blowjob it was I was like I just gotta I had to go up and bring up the middle it was fucking awesome it was always I'm like this is I love comedy it's a weird shifting of roles you know yeah it was I remember my back hurt at the time I just have a bad back when I was starting comedy and I remember I had to like sit on the sink cuz Michael my back and I said it was so funny I love car rolls don't get that thing from comedy though it's a funny thing that Ali Wong has she's like she's like Road pussy is amazing she goes Road dick is I don't want to do her bit I don't want to ruin her yeah essentially she's yeah it's not the same yeah I don't want to ruin her material yeah essentially that's what she's saying it's like it's not a good deal for gals it must be different you know one time I remember I have a big mouth and everything and so when I started comedy there was this girl and she was pretty and I guess I must have told people I'd like to get around I can't wait to work the room with her so I can fuck her right that's horrible so people hearing that now today the right that wasn't me whore you're a piece of shit so I don't know if I don't even know if I said what how I said or whatever but so that I get confronted by her at a comedy club this girl comes up to me and I I didn't know she was gonna say she goes hi Jimmy and I go hi how you doing she goes I heard you said you can't wait to work the road because you wanted to fuck me oh and she goes she goes did you say that I go sounds like something I would say and she goes she goes don't you want to know who told me I go could be anybody [Laughter] things to say yes and then she goes well why did you say that I go because you're really pretty and I'm attracted to you and she totally changed she was like oh well that's okay totally change and we're friends till this day never had sex we'd write an article for some one of them online rags you're right I would get in trouble for that piece of shit but I was a kid I was just starting comedy I didn't know him and my asshole from a hole in the ground right and I didn't know anything about that and when she said she was why did you set them free why did you say that and I just decided to be honest I go cuz you're pretty and I'm attracted to you she's like oh that's okay I think she thought I thought I was saying she was a slut and that's not what I was saying that's not what I was saying I was saying she's fucking chance with you and we like a chance with her that's what I was saying she took it I was saying she was a whore so that's not what I was saying so she totally it was that that's the only experience I have like that yeah it's gonna be a weird time if we remove flirting and clumsy attempt sets yeah sex and there's a there's a lot of that stuff that turns out to be fun it's it's funny too they're like one thing that you could say to one person is highly offensive and you could say it to another person is exactly what they wanted to hear it's like and you really don't know until you essentially you say it or do it and you read it written on papers like yeah it sounds terrible but in the right circumstance that's thing to say nobody wants to admit that like I dated his girl once he's seen every when it's read back to you in court it sounds horrible but in the mob go ahead there was a girl that I dated once and we're making out and and you know we're getting into it hot and heavy she grabs my dick and I said I want you to get on my knees get on your knees and suck my cock she goes I've always wanted no kid she's ROPS down to her knees and like she's fucking going at it but when she looked at me she goes I've always wanted someone said to me I'm like what some girls like no like all right that's the whole you say like you don't know it in the moment like I just like it was a hot and heavy and crazy quick and I was like I'm just gonna roll the dice let's just see let's pull up let's go for three lemons see what the fuck happens you never know if you know it'll make any calls you have any sales but this is 1993 ya know try doing that in 2018 well in real trouble you know I just talked to a guy and he made it he owns a bar and he was we're talking about hash tag me too and he says you know the thing is that women don't have to hit on men men are always the aggressor right and so that causes a lot of problems you know like a guy will see a guy what did this group of friends and he'll slink over to try to talk to this girl and he's nervous and he says hey can you want to dance and she'll shut him down and he'll walk back over and like oh that fucking bitch and then he cuz that's what's it cuz he's got a safe face and really don't know what that's like and I was the one attacking women do though I mean one of them one of the things that you see from the same people whether it's men or women is people that are constantly shut down and ridiculed and mocked by the opposite sex become very bitter and angry you see it sometimes from unattractive women who have been shit on by men and you see it from Owen tractive men who've been shit on by women they develop this animosity towards the opposite sex it's very unfortunate and a lot of it comes from that feeling that you just get from someone when you make it advance you become vulnerable and look if you're a guy not not a good-looking guy and take a chance some girl which she's with her friends at a bar she might mock you openly in front of her friends and it's ruthlessly painful and she's just not acta - she wants to shut down any possibility that you might have in your head you go back over there and this happens time and time again you could easily develop animosity towards women or develop a very bad association with the opposite sex you see that from women there's a lot of women that I know that have real issues with men and they're very unattractive and they'll say really gross generalizing things about men they would make these grossed men or this and men suck and men aren't funny and men aren't this and men are that and then you look at them you're like oh well you're obese you're you're unattractive and your experiences with men have probably largely been of rejection and and bad things on top of all the realities of what men are capable of and a horrible things that men absolutely do no denying that but to have this gross generalization about an entire gender based on what well a lot of it is based on their own life experiences meanwhile you go to some really attractive girl who's like go to you know fill in the blank some really attractive girl who's always had men hit on her she might be all men are gross men are disgusting I'm just waiting for the right guy she's not lumping all men into this group but many women that are unattractive and had a hard time with men have the same response towards men that many unattractive men have towards women it's a real it's a fucking hard roll that dice to be born in a way that's just without any doing of your own completely outside of your control you're just not sexually attractive to the opposite sex so you know what I didn't realize that men had this kind of anger towards women I didn't realize meant women had it towards men and like but porn I went oh it turns me off a lot most of it is like this anger yeah like I'm forcing and jamming the cock and the on your ear and all this and spitting in there I'm like what the fuck is going on so this is I don't know what that is I I like when I have sex I like to please a woman you know I like her to be happy and comfortable and I don't that hole ain't so that's when I realized oh there's a bunch of fucking dudes who hate women and angry and they get off I'm like humiliating them like I don't get yeah there's definitely that there's a you know I had a friend and he was an unattractive guy and I watched him go from being sort of having these idealistic ideas about the one get one day he's kind like he had a girlfriend at the time and turn though his girlfriend was cheating on them and then you know you had other girls and they were trying to get his money and then he just became this bitter fucking guy I go over the time that I knew him he just became a woman hater I mean straight up woman hater he'd hit on girls and they would turn him down like fucking dykes he'd just be angry like angry at women like he associated and I watched it from afar he associated women with negative feelings he associated them with rejection he associated them with callousness that they they and I and I have a friend who's overweight and she feels like that about men sometimes so like man or shit and you know they're insulting and they're this now like some some are yes some some people are terrible some males and females are terrible and when you're picking I'm on Team penis and you're on Team vagina we've all lost cuz you're crazy you're what you're gonna align yourself with a hundred and fifty million people that you how many do you know do you know a hundred and fifty of those hundred fifty million people because that's a lot you know you probably don't even know 100 you don't robably don't even have an intimate relationship with 150 men so you're gonna lump all 150 million into the same group that you're against and 150 million women into the group that you're with that's crazy we're humans we're supposed to be on Team human and we're supposed to all figure out how to get along but along the way we're trying to find mates and we're trying to find companionship and the reality of that is it is a messy proposition and some people get left out and some people get shoved aside and some people get attacked and some people get diminished and some people feel terrible about the experience and some people aren't good at it and some people are better at it than others and some people use money and influence and some people use their looks and the whole thing is just it's not perfect this is not some egalitarian adventure so I never watched Sex in the City but my wife did good for you and she good for you she talks I watched it once cuz Bryan Callen was on I was like don't give up it's definitely a show for women wait a minute what are you saying he is sexist God but my wife says about that show because it was honor once she's watched and she's like you know these women all got laid and it was all about them wanting to get laid and they had resiliency and they weren't snowflakes and they were and certainly and these women could fucking run in heels and eat all this they were that grit right and it's just like what she doesn't feel that that's what's happening today well there's certainly no role models like that but you know what's really interesting Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall fucking hated each other no I'm kidding yeah there was a thing to yesterday with Kim Cattrall say she's not my friend never but I don't want your sympathy cuz Kim Cattrall was her brother died someone on her family died and she said her best wishes and she's like she's not my friend she's never been my friend I don't like her you know and apparently they were just yeah and she said you know she's a shitty person and she said all this really hyped up stuff about her like right after her brother died it was like Jesus Wow what Dean thought it was her brother yeah yeah like the whole thing is just like oh so this whole thing about this camaraderie and this this union of women all together and fighting against ah that's not horseshit yeah horseshit people hate each other it's like the rock and Tyrese and fast and furious they didn't really like each other it's a scam that's fascinating she's married to that Matthew Broderick right yeah yeah he was yeah okay yeah I don't follow that stuff but whatever that's a good point I think my wife made yeah there's a good point that women with grit yeah I mean you don't get whatever the role models that you have the Kardashians you have Sex and the City I mean what does that housewives real house car dad how did Kim Kardashian get famous sucking dick it was a it was a porn tape right yeah yeah she released a sex tape that was apparently was engineered by her family that's why her too crazy but it's not if you see what that lady's done like how she's organized it look it's been very successful and yeah if you look at it in terms of a financial venture oh my god a windfall it's unbelievable evil amazing successful but chaos in a sense they're a type of a royalty in a lot of ways no doubt modern plastic royalty yes it's the the culture of nothing yeah culture of fake asses and nonsense but they're talented I'm sure no no the talented at doing that I mean it's not a talent but it's uh they've been wise strategically yeah in keeping themselves out in the public eye I mean I don't I'm not a a I don't I'm not a Kim Kardashian or a Kardashian family hater by any stretch of the imagination I've had a couple of bits about them where I kind of mocked them but uh I don't hate them I mean I don't think wrong with others know I know a lot of people that are way dumber than them that I don't hate why don't you say hate them cuz they're famous like that doesn't make any sense no I don't hate them at all I mean I don't even know them or watch their shows I think the Kim is really pretty but I just think what it says about the culture right so the code makes you like you remind you hey your culture is vapid yeah well part of our culture is that and I think they came along at an amazing time the time of social media where it's just all about like sand but pictures that have been doctored up by Photoshop and yet so the whole thing is really fascinating yeah and then you know the father is like well I'm not getting enough attention as a guy fuck it I'm gonna be a chick and then it gets amazing amounts of attention I mean it's the I mean you could say that I'm being callous and but that's what happened that's what happened and so funny I never thought of it 100% he's a male Kardashian yeah he became a Kardashian that's an amazing way to look at it I had a bit about it in my last special my my my last pet oh yeah you get in trouble no I didn't I covered all my bases but it was basically about I can't do the bit but okay I'll tell you about it afterwards no people eat son triggered on Netflix go watch
