as soon as we got a lot five seconds now Josh was just telling me about how he's gonna start his own cult yeah for sure absolutely you know everything else just seems like fucking work to me so yeah starting your own cult if you could pull it off the key is to not take it too far don't get too crazy you know I don't know if I have that ability though man right so you're wearing you know black metal t-shirts and you know listen to the crazy-ass music I don't I think taking it too far is it's kind of in my nature you're still driving the muscle car oh yeah everyday men all about muscle cars yeah all muscle car plus in this traffic still drives a manual yeah that's got a six-speed is that your method of your number one method of transportation if you're driving am at respect you have a manual transmission fuck in Orange County you still in Orange County no no no I've been out of Orange County for a while yeah I was in downtown for a while and then another Hollywood like a vampire kind of also getting a lot of extra sparring in you know with hobos and knives and stuff like that were you in like the bad area of downtown is there well you know what here's the thing about the bad area of downtown it doesn't stay in the bad area of downtown you know it's like oh this is a really nice oh we got our quaint little lofts and la-dee-da it's like by the way you see that schizophrenic crackhead he's gonna fuck your shit up you know it's like Hancock Park Hancock Park is fucking amazing it's like one of the most beautiful but you can go two blocks down you got gang graffiti yeah like like two blocks down you're in some sketchy area like soon as you get out and you start going east further like you get some fucking sketchy neighborhoods within a mile of these like 1920s mansions of old Hollywood money mean those things are incredible right and to me it's just like wow it's the most fantastic tourist guide ever like hey come to LA you might get fucked or you might not please roll the dice let's see how this works out yeah if you're gonna walk through downtown LA you could you could take a wrong turn in a Walking Dead episode you could be just strolling down 7th everything's looking great you're passing 7 grand Malo and all this stuff and then all of a sudden oh shit where the hell am i that guy's got a tent but I don't really think he's camping you people who think that they're downtown is fucked up you don't even know what fucked up is you need to see Skid Row like people don't see I've shown people Skid Row and they go that's not real yeah that's what it looks it looks fake as fuck it looks like an episode of The Walking Dead now the first time I drove through it and there was like some and I'm seeing all these just people just just milling about and it must have been later in the night like not super late but getting to probably six or seven or it's because at some point there there's this mission or something down there and it's got this gated courtyard and at some point they closed that gate and there was just people inside the courtyard and there were people outside of the courtyard it was like clamoring again into this thing and it was just insanity I go fuck man this is straight out of like some sort of Dawn of the Dead was happy like you if you get in by a certain amount of time you lock you can stay in there yeah I guess whatever shit so like some people like they got to get away from the crazy people on the street I guess or yeah probably get some place to sleep and you eat and what have you you know I'm you know I tell each other Psalms isn't it weird that we look at people like daemul go yeah you're you're a loser like all you people are not gonna help you it's easy to do that because to look at the situation on a far more complex level you know looking for what all the issues that can write into this I mean a majority of these people are probably mental health you know issues patients also yeah they're crazy to simplify it and then they get into these you know that let's say drugs come to play other things I mean they just they need help right yeah and there are some people there that maybe they are just total fucking down and outers that they just gave up on life in one way or another got hooked on something or hooked on something else but I mean at the end of the day it's it's to eat it's it's much easier for people to just look at it as like these guys are losers there's losers of the system and we're I'm some sort of a winner but I mean they in a way some of these people were born losers then I guess because they didn't get to choose to be born with schizophrenia or any of these other sort of things of childhood there's a whole host of factors the plays into someone being like that but it's weird how we get to someone gets to a certain age like you're 35 and you're homeless first re dude can't help you feel like 10 if you're 10 on the street come on buddy your little guy looks cam yeah who's just who's his parents left him and he didn't have any food he's got a really cute newsboy cap it just seems so scrappy you know I think I'd like to make him my sidekick and we're gonna travel around the world with him everywhere he's got a bag on the end of a stick yeah yeah look at that bindle man he's been places that was the move that they had here's this is real we're looking at video right now on it what's the name of this video like Skid Row well it says homeless on Skid Row in Los Angeles all in caps and it's fucking crazy it's a whole series of homemade tents that these people put together they've created these like little apartments a little structures and they're on the street and there's I mean this is a pretty good video of it just shows you how weird it is but it's way crazier at night well it's even might this just shows you we're just looking at one Street yeah well I'm looking at like a few structure it's like a little square radius yeah of streets that encapsulate this this area and you know I mean some people are like well oh yeah it's not really that dangerous and like LA I guess it really depends on the person I personally I wouldn't stroll around down there I feel like I'll be all right but why increase my likelihood you know having some sort of issue especially if somebody is literally crazy it's it's really not a matter of whether they're a jerk or whatever it's just they're operating in an unstable irrational way so there's no way to to negotiate that very no way to negotiate it no way to even know if it's gonna happen right and when someone's completely bonkers just some guy doing it on his bike whoa that dude's got skills let's get some bike skills legs on that shit bike dad si si what's up Jake oh the bunny pegs in the front so maybe he could how you could pick up a guy I grabbed one homeless Dulce the front that's is that not impressive that handlebar thing he just did that shit's incredible Bart it's just it's not incredible no I can't do it but what is that like a standard move Josh Barnett yeah you know I do know how to ride a bicycle probably not to the level of this guy doing that flip in the bar around that's fucking that's pretty wild it's it's like having a fidget spinner you're falling down you're just eating shit and losing teeth yeah I don't ride bikes much like that damn that's it's incredible isn't it to camera at it - it sure is Wow whee oh that's pretty slick yeah it's a it's an interesting dynamic and then it's not a simple situation to solve either right you know it's like some people would easily just look at like ah let's get rid of them it's like well you can't just do that with somebody I mean that's not the way to do it is there a way to reprogram someone would think you forget who that quote was by some famous dude Frederick Douglass but he said it's it's much easier to raise good children than the repair broken men I can believe that yeah you know we have it's it's always harder to take a fighter with a bunch of bad habits and try to cure them of that or re-establish new good habits than it is to just start off teaching them something correct from the from the fucking get-go yeah you always see that for whatever reason with kicking technique kicking technique like a lot of guys that come from like bad backgrounds have a really hard time train like maybe karate - muy Thai real hard time transitioning over and like I would see it even in Taekwondo guys who came from a karate background didn't understand the importance of raising the knee up above the hip it's like when things got weird they couldn't pick their knee up for shrink well and it also I guess it would depend a lot on my style of karate so like one of my guys show hey Yamamoto is a he's a junior world champion and killke shin he was the youngest ever to compete in the world open weight tournament at 18 years old and and he was like a hundred and ninety pounds when he did it 180 and 18 years old was fighting holy shit you know like your Glover Teixeira is and those guys like that yeah the keoki shit's crazy - and you watch those guys punch full blast the body but kick to the head like not punching to the face I don't know what where that really came about necessarily but yeah yeah you can kick them full on in the Faye's knee him in the face crazy things like that but don't don't throw a punch to the face but it's like his kicks are pretty oh it's like the next level of Taekwondo it's like Taekwondo they said you couldn't punch to the face but you could kick above the waist how about we kick the legs too and elbow and elbow stops as much even though Taekwondo is supposed to be continuous like Olympic style challenge yeah they clinch or a point gets scored and the ref will kind of you know there's always these little breaks that seem to happen yeah you know yeah it's it's interesting because I always feel like for little kids especially what's really good about Taekwondo is the same thing that's really good about gymnastics and even like yes cheer body control and flexibility and yeah there's all kinds of readers right I think Taekwondo can be really great for that as well yeah I think a lot of if you're gonna do Taekwondo or really any a lot of these traditional martial arts it really depends on that teacher I think that makes it or breaks it I mean you could have like some old take young like gnarly old Korean dude who's gonna teach you how to punch the face and throw people and all kinds of stuff but maybe gear your competition training towards the rule set that's allowable but or you could just have some do they just want you to flip around and scream to get your points which is the most ridiculous almost up there with like flopping in soccer like flopping in soccers hit some new levels literally people think they know that I think it's hilarious or some dude sent me one and the guy doesn't even get hit the other guy like throws his hand back it doesn't even come near and the guy launches himself through here I've never seen anything like it what is it that how does one graduate to that position you know here I'm out here I'm playing a sport at let's say the highest level and I'm competing against credit other incredible athletes and we train our asses off and we develop all these skill sets and we get so good at handling a ball with our feet and not even for foot fetish stuff but but just to play this game and I'm gonna now concede and suchlike completely destroy all the toughness all the grit all the work all all the things that I've developed mentally to be able to run and can do all this stuff and build up with all these wind sprints and then I'm just gonna see a guy SWAT his hand at me and then i'ma fling myself in the ground and scream bloody murder they would they flap like fish I don't they flap around the ground and twist and writhe in agony there has there's like a mental disconnect that has to happen like you must just like I'm gonna bitch myself out right now I'm gonna completely just destroy every element of toughness within me I think they just will do anything to get some sort of an advantage I know I don't understand soccer I don't know the rules so I don't know what kind of an advantage you would get if Pendleton shots penalty shop yeah so you would get like pretty close to the goal yeah they get to they get to take a shot on goal or something that's pretty sweet it is that's too much persuasion do it couldn't do it I think it's worth too much I think what you got to do is if somebody does value if somebody like actually fouls you that guy just gets removed and they bring in a new player like it seems pretty simple like well yeah I've reduced the the element there and in terms of what what the reward is the risk yeah or you see people flopping like penalize them right a hundred percent yeah that guy's he for a year yeah you're slowing the game down and you're making us look like shit so stop your people are talking about you on podcast bro have no idea what happened in that game that might that game I've been in for the championship of the world between the two greatest teams of all time I don't know about that nah I just know that dude flopping around we saw get the fuck out of here do they call it flopping are we making that up they call the flopping in soccer they should call it taking a dive oh alright alright oh oh no way oh my god that is hilarious are you kidding the rahu my god watch this one oh I'm so hurt Oh God and the guy standing right there that is Dino the ref has to just which needed to grab did he grab the grab this right Lenny or now now they fly right do you land on his right knee okay that guy might a blowing his knee out hold on go back to the ref because the ref might have blown his knee out because I'm looking at the way Falls like watch to it not this guy the next guy that guy here watch this now he's standing around then he just he leaps onto the ground one more time oh no I think he's grabbing his knee he's fucking bullshit these guys got flops out of a huddle that's ridiculous it's almost as if these guys are so so attuned to any touch that once they feel it they immediately just did they dive they fall down they cry tripping if it's in that box that's where you get the penalty shot and that can literally change the whole game just fell on his own right next to him oh so they just try to fall down get hurt oh that's hilarious so was that the guy just stopped and the other guy used him as like a tripping mechanism because if you can get the right card you can get a guy taken out of the game and then you're at a huge advantage for the rest of the game like if you could manipulate a ref and the in an MMA fight which you kind of can't I suppose but like you can't get the other guy just eacute all the time there's definitely rules for that and here you just got a trick a guy did you see that it's like there's like a understood of like yeah we're fucking with the game right now we're pretending to be hurt all the time what is the name of this video James just like best flops or funny dives of 2017 2017 funny dives and simulations just this year oh that's hilarious we'll see some of them they're exaggerating this is not the best edit because some of these guys are just getting tripped I mean they're just falling like that guys just falling like this is a stupid edit these are also the best athletes of all time like this right you just falling oh okay I see are you saying there yeah but people fall you know I mean the other ones there's so many of these that are so like that that shit is so ridiculous look oh my god I can't take it I mean that shit is so funny it's like there's a culture of falling and pretending you're hurt there's a little it could be I mean I don't know if they really are because the probably takes away from their stature as an athlete but getting in these videos where you just get shown all over the internet honestly a couple of these were guys doing goofy stuff and then laughing about it as like nah ha ha ha I guess this is what we do we pretend to be heard all the time and so it's some sort of an accepted culture with dad just falls down it's accepted within the culture of playing the game as much as I can understand now that guy taken a dive made sense because you saw the other day but no that's great just touch faces and then fell to the ground like they get hit with meteors they just fall down like in agony I look at this guy's like look at this guy just falling down what do you doing you're doing that thing stop doing that god it's so they have to revamp their rules yeah clearly they've they started finding people that were doing it but I think they sort of cut back on the fines it tried to make it monetarily not a good thing to do I know Ian Edwards loved soccer and our love Ian and he's trying to get me to do a soccer companion but I feel like about soccer what I do about like speaking Latin like it's just some shit that's just left over from a long-ass time ago I learned we still remember how to do it so we don't we don't want to not know what Latin is and like help with the work we don't want to get so confused that we think this is like some forgotten language Cherokee but especially since it's within all of our scientific texts and all that but it's nonsense yeah that's nonsense I would rather learn Latin then learn how to flop out of fake injuries I just I don't know about that but you respect an actual skillful soccer player those guys are awesome athlete Thanks actually what what what makes it so disappointing yeah I know how good those dudes are I know that they must be super talented and great very skillful and in great shape to then take to get yourself to that level to let's say elite level right at your sport at your skill set you never see Aldo who josée Jose Aldo play soccer oh not surprised amazing yeah I bet like professional level do you think he would flop nope I cannot see that happening I don't think so that's probably what held him back too busy throwing low kicks instead of instead of kicking the ball he's just chopping people's legs out from under him yeah there's some video of him playing and moving around and he's fucking really good which where's Aldo that bought him didn't the ball flip oh yeah it watch this look at that well really that's not one of the best players in the world he did it against Neymar now do you think they're just playing and having a good time in charity match right but still look at this I don't think it was just like okay I'm running for real dude actual games to play I'm not blowing out my ACL like trying not to get Punk'd by an MMA fighter right exactly it's like okay you can have this moment but I've seen videos of him practicing and playing he's like like a real professional soccer player you're looking at me like wow yeah it didn't surprise me in the least I was at Jose yeah he Joe's a just he's kicking three-pointers in or he's trying at least I would never happen for me never I played like little intramural soccer in college for a second just like these pickup games with all the international kids I just thought it'd be a good way to get in shape I didn't know really much about playing soccer so are you too big um I don't know if there's really a too big fun line around that much well there's also that not good enough there's that part too these dudes from like Scotland and Argentina and all over who would play like all they're like triple-a leagues and stuff I'm out there playing defense and I could hustle I had quick feet and I wasn't movable so that was kind of good but uh you know at one point they keep my team kept trying to get it I get an opportunity for me to score on goal and I'm like no no quit you know I got good enough to dribble and pass it away a little bit don't fucking ask me to kick this thing it's never gonna go where I wanted to and you know it's just careening off everywhere at Plus this dude from Argentina was just all over me every single time I'm like everyone else is like how it'd be funny if he could be great if he could get a shot and this guy's like fuck that I'm gonna fucking I'm on him like stink on shit am I wrong in thinking that there's like a build that would excel at football which I think so I could think so and I would think that soccer would require because you've run so much I would think tall and lanky would be good for soccer or even maybe just a long leg short torso yeah put that Messi guys like really small right that's like super fast just looking very quick yeah it's being very quick and very agile and being able but I was just thinking tall cuz then you could more headers more body up up top let me ask you this as a proponent of violence huh why how come rugby never took off here that seems to me to be the real sport ah you know I don't really know why I think because American football is American football maybe maybe that's why it seems kind of stupid in a way because you have a helmet on your pads and you're running into each other and we already know that that's not a good idea it isn't it actually makes it way worse right you can get harder they've figured out some new technology which I know they're working on some interact resistant helmets and things that which that kind of changes everything if they do that and they get it to the point where guys can collide heads and actually be okay I don't know I don't really think I just they're they can get these these helmets are gonna take the impact and reduce it and all that but I just once you're a 300-pound dude running a four seven smashing into another 300-pound dude I just don't you know it's just like I was getting the arguments with the with like these kids at the University of Montana rugby team was like he should come out play rugby you should play rugby I'm like no I want to fight and you know rugby that seems fun and all that but and then all woods did you play football yeah I played football his way tougher I go uh hold on uh you the pool you're drawing from I'm sure there's some good athletes the pool we were drawing from when I'm going to University of Washington football camp but when I'm playing against you know nationally ranked teams like O'Day you this is different yeah who they're drawn from is a much much bigger pool the stakes for them are much much bigger than you and your college team floating around and then drinking beers after your games this is not like that this is a different story Yesha Lee someone that has a potential NFL career and they're like super focused you know if you look at some the super athletes that you get that enter the NFL today that just the sheer size and speed that these guys have and it's only so much that can be genetics you've got like some serious training involve and dedication yeah they know how much money's involved exactly and there are people that are grooming these athletes from a super young age to meet these requirements and so I was like look rugby is super awesome it's tough it's a great sport I like rugby league way better than rugby union because unions got all the scrumming and all that it's slow so parents League is seven tackles I believe it's how you get that's all you get and but you you it's constant you're constantly moving up the field what if you'll go more than seven like what do you don't wait if once you get seven you have to drop the ball and then if they change is over oh but it moves super fast and it's very aggressive and it's just you know caught it's like watching people play wishbone the whole time they're just constantly taking each other down yeah and so you know they're hitting boom this tackle happens and they're gonna try and shuttle the ball back to their other teammate and shove it shove the ball down the line again and keep it moving until they can finally break through yeah we're watching the other one to me it slows down way too much so I don't really enjoy it which you know that's kind of the argument with American football is that it slows down and to me I'm like American football I was like watching two armies go at it mm-hmm you said you have your your skirmish you regroup you skirmish again you regroup you skirmish again and by the end of this all these skirmishes the war is either is won or lost by this team yeah that's the way I look at it but well you know that was designed to sort of placate people well that's all games are designed to be a diminishing aspect of war but American football in particular we actually literally like systematically designed like we know the time that it happened there's a whole Radiolab podcast okay it's pretty fascinating that and about how they ran into problems when they let American Indians play with white kids oh yeah just fucking all the white kids up that's some brutal ass games the natives did not really shit did they eat their hearts I don't know what the problem was but it was an issue it was an issue it's I would I would have loved you know had Steve Rinella on Reese he was talking about the guys who killed Custer and Little Bighorn and one of these guys was just this massive guy was in a mall that they called them Gul Gul and he went on to I think I read that book while the company was a Conan book writer called a conqueror yeah right but this guy was apparently just massive and I mean I would have loved to like seeing that with my own eyes like what it looks like to be like a direct lineage of warrior culture like if that guy was living in the 1800s like he is directly from the original Native Americans that came here from Siberia you know whatever thousands and thousands of years ago that would be something fuck yeah chief Seattle which my fucking phone don't work fuck it he had some quote about being at a football game at the University of Washington he was and I can't for the life of me remember exactly how it goes but it was just like oh it's not a lot of white men fight each other today I don't know why the hell you guys are into this but whatever yeah they didn't really have like like that kind of a game there's something uniquely brutal about American football there is but when I look at rugby I'm like okay that to me seems more realistic it is more realistic I think in some ways it's even it's more brutal in some and less than others like I said like MMA versus maybe kickboxing yeah well and the thing is that one of my organs with the rugby kids is like dude you you don't get hit as hard as you do in American football as you're doing here in rugby you just you're not right Plus the athletes are smaller and you know go do a kick off guys they talk about fucking insane but what do you think would happen it's like what if by some crazy reason people decided hey look we're gonna no longer do American football we're gonna do rugby right which is open lake I don't totally understand the difference between the two of them I would have to watch a few games I guess but those guys who dominating football wouldn't you think there would be the guys who dominate in rugby yeah I do everybody would just get bigger and faster and stronger yeah we'd be just like American level football players pretty much because the the and that everybody would switch over to rugby that means all these rugby teams and the league and all that would then be the ones with all the big merchandise deals and the TV deals and all that all the money would funnel into it and therefore the potential prosperity of it would drive the interest for people to try and apply their wares at being not only a part of that hero myth that would come with being a champion football team player you know our rugby team player but also with the hero myth of just being a part of that within you know your normal society or of this your elite exceptional exceptional status this thing that stands alone that it seems a bit foreign to your normal person but also the money and the success that comes from that kind of notoriety and the doors that it opens in terms of you know to use a overused word the privilege of being at that level at within that inner circle of exceptional or seen as exceptional people anyways do you think what's the short drive it what's this you've had a long career in MMA when a long successful career but it's very rare yeah it's very rare for someone to be operating the same level you're seven years is like the cutoff like when she's about seven everything starts to just rapidly decline like you just fall to shit do you think it's an injury thing is it a training thing is it just a life thing they didn't they didn't or at least they weren't able to single out any particular factor in in general but you know there was a lot of theories as to why that might be but they were able to track professional fighters careers over length of time I think they had some metro do the study I don't remember but it's on the it's on the internet it they I do believe that they accounted they were able to account for number of fights - and send way that against that metric and see how that may influence things but seven years was this magic number like six seven years and once you start going over seven years you're your success your percentage of success started just crumbling like it was dramatic about how a guy would be like thirteen and three and he'd get to seven years and all of a sudden it's like thirteen 6:13 7:13 he just starts losing just about everything hmm yeah BJ pens good example that right you know like there's certain there's a certain drop-off where the person just looks totally different well and and you know we could honestly look it would be we would have to isolate a lot of different factors to figure out any one particular thing but there's so many elements that go into being a professional fighter and being successful at that and so for let's say we'll take BJ you know maybe it is physicality maybe he's lost a little bit of a step his reactions are a little slower through any number of reasons why maybe his his strength has diminished maybe slightly or as flexibility maybe certain physical elements regardless of injury or not have diminished enough that and that where they used to be it was an edge where it is now is is evened out or is or is below what is necessary for him and how he fights to be successful maybe could be beyond physical deterioration maybe it's just mental evasion yeah exactly so maybe he's just not as motivated to push in the same ways that he was or maybe he's not able to I don't know recognize things that he was five years ago six years ago and seeing those opportunities and being able to react on them quicker there's a number of things and especially when it comes to mental now now you're getting into such a subjective area that you know go pull that apart yeah that's a really good point the mental aspect is a really good point because who knows the only only the person that's competing those really never have any idea how what's going on inside a person's head I mean for me I decided to take a break after my arlovski fight and that was somewhat physically based but most of it was mental i I just didn't I had no interest to go into any kind of training camp to put myself through all that again to then to fight again you know it's just for one when you start off fighting and what those goals are to as you get further in and further in and further in and you know getting it twenty years of being a professional fighter and being a top ten heavyweight and arguably in top five most of the time for shit 16 of them something like that and high-level competition yeah and it's just and youngest-ever UFC heavyweight champion that's right I was that son-of-a-bitch John Jones came and beat me out by a few months that talented bastard the youngest ever yeah just heavyweight champion instead of the youngest ever UFC champion but it's it got to a point where it's just like well you know my reasons for fighting are essentially still the same but oh I don't have the same motivation to go out there and be like oh I'm gonna conquer the whole world I'm fine I could beat that guy could be that I know I could beat guys like it doesn't I don't I'm not trying to prove it to myself anymore you know but that fire that wants to fight still exists I'm just like well you know what I'm gonna take some time to work on some of the other stuff that is gonna be more of my life after this because fighting is going to end sooner then this stuff is how old you know 39 now when you think about do you have like a number in your head like when I hit 42 no no no I don't have anything set like that I just figure that if I'm being honest with myself and self-aware that I'll know when that time has come when that that moment is is getting to that that edge where if you keep going it's gonna fucking it's gonna go downhill versus okay you've got right to that point call it fucking good move on and there's still athletic windows open to me with grappling and maybe a few other in professional wrestling but fighting is gonna be a much shorter window in the fact that I got 20 years out of it or however long that I take this to is gonna be pretty phenomenal yeah it's pretty incredible are you thinking about doing some more grappling yeah yeah I mean I've been approached by a few things but either dollar-wise just really hasn't made sense or mainly that's just it and it's I feel like it's just one thing that people have to figure out is super popular and get it on tell or super exciting rather than get it on television somebody watch like your match with Lister you know you're the first guy to tap out Dean Lister how many years like 17 years at 15 years something crazy and you caught him a scarf old boom judo style yeah it's fuckin badass here's the thing I had seen that the last time he'd been subbed was that really yeah so I already knew that and I'm like well I'm gonna put this in my back pocket if I need it later on in the match and after I've been riding him and grinding on him and beating on him once he's huffing and puffing I can get it no no it's gonna be real hard for him to stop this and so sure enough I look up it's like oh shit I don't have a lot of time left boom hit it go and it worked yeah and then here on Gracie was a big feather in your cap too because here on is what one of the most respected young Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt guys out there like he's super respected he's and offensively like really very tough defensively you know got out didn't couldn't tap him he all those guys like here on Halleck Henner they were all very successful when they were competitors yeah I know people yeah they were they were kicking butt in fact I was a tenor tapped Jeff Monson back in the day I think it wasn't a triangle so when he ron was the only guy that how it could get to step up and wrestle me that was that was the option there was all these heavy weights and all these dudes and I'm like I've found a bunch of guy that had recently competed and won belts and stuff or won one tournament like hey pick what about that guy now looks like he won't do it that guy won't do it that guy won't do it the a whole bunch won't be like well they won't do without the guy and I'm like okay well that's you know that's not an option so why even bring it up so that was some really high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu world champion guy who wanted to get in there with you there have been but well no I well there are a few like cyborg wanted to do it you know but then that's an interesting he got he got interest he got injured yeah so then it was like well how do we fill that gap what kind of energy do you have do you know rib I think I didn't really look into it too much for me beast it was just a matter of that match isn't happening right move on you know try to salvage this thing I like to see that match though in the future though I think that would be really interesting it could happen yeah it could happen I trained for it I felt real confident going into it I really wanted it to because every he was like as soon as I beat Dean well the first thing was oh what an idiot he's wearing shoes oh that's the dumbest thing he's gonna get his leg tore off well how he's so dumb and then I went it's like what a cheater he wore shoes gave him such an advantage he had so much grip oh that's bullshit which is it oh he was 270 and Dean was 185 pounds like what are you talking about I was like 50 and Dean was like 230 the guy was a big massive what and people forget he's pretty thick dude I remember giving him a hug at the quote unquote weigh-ins I mean we didn't weigh in and I'm like right now he's huge yeah he's a fucking massive guy he's strong and counted too and so I'm like extremely tucked right very and and you know to to me I'm seeing all all the blue belts going nuts out there I'm like well he's a he was a heavyweight ooh yo I didn't just go out there and outsize him you know I used my game on him and yeah I wrote him heavy you know butch is a skill to develop but you know you don't see Dean making excuses I mean we just went out there and gave it our best and I was able to beat him that day well Dean is one of the best leg lockers in the country yeah I mean really it's like super knowledgeable and when it comes to any aspect of jiu-jitsu but in particular leg locks and he spent a bunch of time on the East Coast that hen's those plays and Eddie Bravo said that's sort of where hen's owes plays became like this leglock mecca you think I like Gary Tuchman isn't John Danaher like yeah his his like what teachings that he lent in over there sort of spread since Danaher was a real wizards since spread it into his own sort of ideas and philosophies that's the thing you just never know what can come of any even the smallest to largest influence yeah allowing that that seed can take place anywhere but someone may tend that garden and all of a sudden boom you know a big Expo a big expansion from that idea can come from it and that's you know one of the great things that's one of the things that people like about you is that you're you most the time you're going old school I mean you're doing catch wrestling stuff I mean you're doing like the shit that Karl Gotch and all those dudes from those old school wrestling catch wrestling books like a lot of those submissions you're approving those things to be 100% legit yes and you know I understood I understand completely the some of the incredulous looking at that and being like that doesn't fucking work because you think well if it did it would be everywhere right but for one it's just there's just not enough people teaching it so that's really diminishes the ability to expand it although like myself and all the people from the Japanese shoot wrestling side that has come from like Sakuraba and might Fujiwara I mean there's yeah explain that connection because it's really kind of fascinating that who went over there was it Antonio Inoki to create the New Japan Pro Wrestling dojo and teach all of his student all of all the wrestlers how to be catch wrestlers and to give them a foundation and basically shooting which is real fighting so then they could go out there and work these matches but keep the intensity the realism the it's like the difference between you know I know you're not the biggest fan of professional wrestling how dare you how dare you I dare I dare if I had a gauntlet I would throw it I'm sure there's a gauntlet in here somewhere look at this yeah but you know I also understand some of the gripe with looking at like where the way wrestling has been for quite a while now it's like also it got outed right so everybody knows it's worked so people operate on this premise that it's fake so whatever like why bother make it real anymore let's just fake it up all the way and then people would open up skills and it would be like if if all magicians were just like hey look all of our tricks they're not real they're not real magic here's how you do them all and I'm going to open up schools and just teach everyone you know just pay me 500 bucks for three months and now you too can be a magician and it's just like well uh oh man that would ruin going to magic shows it would just make it so shitty but you know that's how a lot of these these guys get into wrestling now that would never be wrestlers like to be Resler back even in say the 70s early 80s you had to be a fucking tough guy like dusty road you look at him you're like that guy's not tough no actually he was recruited by the fucking Miami Dolphins and he was like I think I can make more money being arrested that I can't be in a football player back then you know or Ric Flair was like a all-american or college big-time college football player and he went and trained under Verne Gagne and Billy Robinson at the at this barn out in Minnesota somewhere and they would have to run miles and lift weights and do squats and wrestle each other for real and it's just like all these dudes you think it's like oh yeah whoo like that these motherfuckers had to go through some real shit and they had to prove themselves to be legitimately tough enough to be even a professional wrestler to work matches and they used to hold do things like hold tryouts and people had come down they paying their money then these wrestlers would just run them into the ground and then alright whoever's left whoever you know could get through the endurance part of this okay now you're gonna get in the ring with some dude and then they would just get the shit tortured out of them the at you know just totally ripped apart and then like alright cool bye you didn't make it because that's just the way it was when did it become worked right cuz it used to be it was on point Tom it was like they would do like my mandibles thirty's like a farmer Burns day right exactly so originally professional wrestling catch catch-as-catch-can was 100% real like these guys this is how people would travel the world this is how mitsuo my ADA the judoka Jiu Jitsu guy ended up in Brazil doing catch wrestling pro wrestling matches and then ended up staying and teaching judo and Jiu Jitsu and catch wrestling through the Gracie's the the actual birth of brazilian jiu-jitsu which is amazing i could trace it yes started his catch service Jetta started judo and catch wrestling and made me pull up because it burns hanging himself oh yeah the hangman trick he used his neck was so strong that he would do this trick where he would put a noose around his neck and drop and hang from his men and support it and he was probably about 170 pounds I'm like doesn't like that yeah and it would hang from his neck and not die yes which most of us how do you even get to that point honey test that theory do you like ease into it it isn't off ever I was doing that I hope so what a wasted opportunity maybe David Carradine children guys to fucking hang himself go go to the one where you see his full body the far left there yeah look at that I mean the guy had a neck that was so fucking strong he literally could hang himself I mean he had his hands-free so you could reach up and grab the rope I guess but I mean I wonder how long you would survive doing that I don't know I could make it hard to give a blowjob afterwards yeah for sure there's certain dudes that like you look at him today and you don't think of them as being like 20 inch neck on 165 pounds amazing I need any whistles Yankee Doodle oh Jesus Christ whistles Yankee Doodle well we can be dropped from 6 feet what what what drop from 6 feet so he probably wasn't even 6 feet tall so he's dropping it from his own height and catching with his fucking neck and then he whistles yeah okay for pay pro bodybuilders as well be a male prostitute a gay for pay hey what are those little things that they put on CNN stuff like that like miracle weight-loss cure and there you go pay dad like believe what she looks like today yeah you're running that through a CNN through ICANN accredited news website yeah yeah this is the kind of stuff that people did in the late 1900s for fun because there wasn't anything like TV no internet so what do you do you end up hanging yourself from sin scene if you could drop from 6 feet I wonder how many people tried to emulate that and it just didn't work out talk about Darwinism oh there had to be a lot right now for sure it is there's gotta be some dummy look snap yeah all for sure oh man I bet there was a lot that died because there wasn't a whole lot entertainment back there let's get a tour get dysentery there's a crazy story going around some YouTube couple did some stunts where the other girl shot the guy right yeah and killed on the pedia Oh Tyler Peavy was thick enough to stop a bullet no and what what kind of a round what because uh really a nine-millimeter even a low not not like not a hot load one not even a real like I said like a personal defense round or whatever it will Pierce phone books no no problems yeah what the fuck they were thinking you imagine just having trust in encyclopedias well bully they even test that out they put an encyclopedia on the ground and shoot it first at this crazy bitch probably should probably put some Kevlar in a book and said look honey even the littlest book will stop a bullet and then she gave him the book with no keV warm Wow well I don't really believe that folks this is just joke don't sue me women women and men man they can they figure out how to wait to be tricky all the time or stupid as fuck the figure dumb as fuck there's a lot of dumbest fuck out there it's just a matter of whether or not you can survive it dude I've been trolling for the past day on Instagram putting up these posts about bears yeah so many people think I'm serious dude I wrote about forest rangers infiltrating bear I thought I read that and he's will try to find it on that people are so fucking stupid it's like what we're talking about before the podcast started about yeah until the forum cults and right of course it's this the diminishing element of half of critical thinking it's not just about the reduction of critical thinking in today's society it is the effort that it takes to be a critical thinker and for I would classify under the this under the this this concept I have that I've been working with call the human entropy so entropy is the in physics it's things returning simply put it's things going to their load of state of energy and human beings human entropy will go to their lowest state of energy given an opportunity and to the point where you see Wally if you've seen that movie and all the big you know fat out just gnarly people just floating around on hover beds being fed and taken care of and having zero strife in their life that we will do that if given the opportunity and so not having to think critically finding a group identity of some sort even as crazy as a cult or which I would argue that there's a lot of ideologies around nowadays that are just as cult-like is as Scientology or you know Heaven's Gate stuff it helps a lot of people but to be to belong in one of these groups to be a part of that identity means that you no longer have to take as much responsibility for your own actions because this group has decided your your value system how you're going to operate your ethics also I mean there's some philosophical arguments that part of that also Altima talese Thames from I think is from Ernest Becker it stems from fear of death and having to mitigate the the anxiety and nihilism that could come with confronting and accepting the fact that you're gonna die and everything that you did is going to die with you essentially like your your lack of existence is coming around the corner not if you put on the purple Nikes and cut your balls off wait for the comment that's right you drink the kool-aid did you hear how the guy he saw everybody dying horribly and he's like Jonestown yeah well fuck I'm not gonna drink that pleased you know do something else instead like shoot me I don't wanna I don't want to take the drink I'm sure didn't they kill like nine hundred people or something saying yeah yeah it's just it's very interesting watching people just give in to the influence of the hive of course whatever hive that is yes it's a religious hive I'm fast operates on the same principles you know whether it be religion and you can tell people of course to me religion is kind of one of the ultimate ones because the everything we do has is measured against a wager you know if we talking from from games so what what's at stake increases the importance or the you know of the game itself so fighting increases that that threshold so much higher because the more greater potential for death or her pain whatever right you're fighting somebody and as you go down the lines but you know poker is is popular because the raised stakes the money and that as at play and the reward that could come with it and a potential that you could lose from it so everything has this the some value there's this measure against what your what your potentially giving up and what's it what's it hazard so with religion what's it hazard your eternal soul something that is so high value that you can't oh fuck I can't risk that so fuck I guess I better you know I mean it that's why it's so powerful but also it is it is a panacea for death because like Nietzsche will talk about the concept of true world values this is not the true world this other thing is the true world so all this suffering and strife and difficulty and any like bullshit that happens to meet all of this in the end there really isn't going to matter because eventually I'm going to go to this true world and this is the real world and this is the my payoff for all of the all the shit I had to go through down here and so for a lot of people the concept of having meaning for their difficulty for their struggle is absolutely important because otherwise why am I doing this you know to take your own existence your own being in the world and take it on to yourself and have all your own accountability and look at it as I'm here living the best life I can because I need to live the glass best life I can because it's the only life I will ever live yeah that is a lot of weight and you know the anxiety of people dealing with that trying to really take that on face on with death and their their their lack of permanence in this world that's the argument is that was where nihilism can come from and then with nihilism it's like well nothing matters so if nothing matters and you're not you're not able to to operate anymore you know you're just like right what's the point yeah the moment matters though of course it to all of it everything matters yeah well see it's up to you to assign your values as to what you're doing anyways and why you're doing it but again that involves taking responsibility for those values and carrying those though that burden of what that may be on your own shoulders and that's one of this is one of the reasons why learning some kind of a discipline at an early age it's probably really important for people I think so I mean I think for me a lot of it came from being ostracized as a kid and being someone that was not of hive mentality and out of herd mentality and how did ostracize for what because was just uh for for one it was being bigger and for all the things that I was interested in all the dorky stuff or weird stuff also play dungeon dragons I would if I had the time I would play dungeon dragons I would play Warhammer 40k I would I still play Magic the Gathering from time to time are you kidding me I tap that man a motherfucker yeah but you know for being into that kind of stuff but also just for being just for just being different and some of it was like big brother syndrome stuff so it's like oh well you fuck with big brother because it's fun and eventually he gets mad and he finds you and beat you up and you cry and yeah but you do it again the next day anyway so for me it's like oh here's this big kid and he's gonna get upset if you start fucking with them and it's funny ha ha ha ha ha until I get a hold of you and then it's like oh you just beat me up that's fucked up and I said well I didn't I didn't want to beat anybody up until you started fucking ridiculing me in the first place so but when you're a little child you don't understand regulation of emotions as well you also don't understand the social parameters in which all this stuff is functioning anyways you just don't have that kind of insight and so you know it'd be like nowadays someone could walk in here and be like fuck you you suck and I look at him and I would laugh about it is that ever happen to you cuz we were talking about this yesterday I was saying that I saw it happen Chuck Liddell I've saw people try to pick fights at Chuck Liddell and it's hilarious it's like yeah why are you talking suicide no no no I have never had anyone really tried to pick a fight with me I had a guy at a concert once they get all get all butthurt about me not letting him pass in between me and this girl they were standing with me because people kept trying to cut through to get for it was that anthrax and he wanted to get and I'm just like fuck this why do people keep trying to walk between us like Jesus just go around so eventually I'm like now I'm not letting by so I got my elbows out and people would bump into it and then go around well this guy he just kept going kept capping it's like man fuck you dude I'm standing here with a girl go away he was try to get between you and your girl like a dick rub like maybe I mean if he'd asked nicely maybe he would have got one well I don't know it's a bold ass but you know what though fortune favors the bold and I'm a kind human being maybe he didn't want me to rub his dick but that's what he would've got he got that so the guy comes around he finally goes around us and then he's just he looks at me he's like hey man I was trying to get through and I go look I'm standing here with this girl like you know ya go somewhat you just go around and he's getting all he's get pissed about it because I'm dismissing him you know I was like just you know let's go oh let's walk away now that gets his fucking hackles up he's all mad he's he's looking at me like you this and that I started laughing at him I go oh you wanna you want a scrap because you can't get through here is that is that it is this what you want to do and he's just like well well I go ok ok he'll just move on oh fucking chest up even bigger and it's just like he looks like he's gonna walk away whatever I'm saying alright you know ok do your own thing he's like he's just getting even more worked up and fight he points his finger out and I'm laughing at him and the girl who uh who was I did jujitsu was a fighter she reaches out and grabs a hole this guy's wrist and pulls his hand out she's like don't you don't want to do that and then he looks at her and he looks at me and I'm just smiling and he pulls his hand back and I go I know what must have gone through his head is just like this girl's grip is serious and she's telling me don't fucking do it it's probably a good idea not to fucking do it probably exactly but other times there have been like you know I'm not impervious to getting in a mood and so sometimes I've been out and about and someone's being a dickhead and I see it and it's like ok this guy's he's clearly trying to egg something on somehow and so maybe I you know add a little something to that scene I feel if he'll feel bite and just will happen you know or I've had some people go oh yeah of course no one's gonna fight you then who you are I'm like are you fucking kidding me I'm some sort of d-list celebrity nobody knows who the fuck I am so get away with a lot I think and the thing is if a guy knew how to fight who would know who you are or forgot as a fan of fighting he would know sure and those guys would be way less likely to pick a fight in the first there was one dude who is at this bar in Fullerton and he's being just belligerent he's being an asshole in this place and and my buddy hammer he was the door guy at the time and this other and they're like come on and he this guy's fucking getting all riled up and I'm standing there with hammer and just looking at this dude and picture the other torque high comes over he's like hey you fucking dumbass you're wearing the fucking t-shirt of that guy right there so maybe you might want to shut the fuck up and so this guy's wearing one of my affliction shirts and the guy looks at the shirt and he looks at me he's like oh shit getting your ass kicked because you picked a fight with a guy whose shirt you have on like you you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt and you don't know who Josh Barnett is well it's some a lot of this shit comes from people putting themselves into situations where they have up the ante tour where for them not to follow through is is gonna bring about like a huge internal conflict with them you know they're gonna know that they they raised the stakes and then they had to back down which i think is really hard for just about anybody to deal with to get yourself to a point where you're like yeah you know I'm in the right and then to dial that back I mean people don't even want to really apologize for anything let alone have to admit that they took something too far it got to a point where they weren't willing to go any further and they realize they fucked up and then to fucking tuck tuck tail and leave again and back down and there's a lot of insecurity involved in that there was a lot of insecurity probably to get to that point in the first place which is why people that really know how to fight don't have to go out there and try to prove to somebody else that they are capable or that look at hey everybody look at how how badass I am so you know win it for me I just I don't start fights you know I mean barring that maybe that occasional moment where someone I thought was being an asshole I thought they were being a shitty person the reason they're being a shitty person is because they thought that no one would call them on it you know and for me to call them on it is more about there doesn't need to be any conflict here tonight but you want to create it because you're an insecure little prick so I'll be your huckleberry all right now that you see that somebody was willing now how much is it worth to you and of course it's almost it's never worth it to them and even people that have you know been all fucking fired up and you know of course they're operating off of anger and emotion and and of upping something to a point where they don't feel that they can back down because if you give someone an out especially in these kind of things 90% of the time they take it but it's not always that last word thing that everybody wants yes they want to winning the right to a lot of dickheads but you know when you sometimes you turn to somebody to go you don't know anybody that knows anybody that knows anybody that knows anybody that can kick my ass so I don't know what you're gonna do right now or who you're gonna call but it ain't gonna fucking work or it's just you know turn to somebody how many friends you got with you that ain't enough you know go get more cuz I don't know which one you guys want to get involved but the first one that I can get my hands on to I'm a fucking cripple you I'm a fuck you up I'm a fuck you up I don't know if you guys can take me but I want to know how many of you I'm gonna take with me first or my favorite is people nowadays don't really so everything is the reduction to violence essentially everything everything is a reduction to violence at the base level the final element is violence so what I'm saying is that so we create all the we create laws we create social norms we create all the customs and things - honestly to avoid things getting to violence but even your simplest law is essentially rooted in the element of violence so okay you you will use some some law right like a ticket of some sort and it's like whoa I'm gonna find you for the thing I'm not gonna pay it okay well then we're gonna find you some more I'm not gonna pay that we're gonna do I'm not gonna do that well okay then if you're not gonna pay the thing you're not gonna you're not gonna do this and you're not gonna let you're not gonna oh well then what we're gonna do is we're gonna arrest you no you're not at some point it reduces down to violence so we're using violence all the time to or at least the convey a lot of things for pretty much everything you know in terms of social controls eventually if someone doesn't want to adhere to those controls in some way violence is the final solution it's what it's what it boils down to it is the basis for for all of our police and military and even honestly it still exists within all of us on a social level it's just that we have managed to take that concept and put it onto something else the law right police something like that but the reality is that if some guy just at some point says you know I don't really give a fuck and you were an asshole and I'm just gonna wreck you okay you can sue them you can do this you can call the cops on them you can whatever but violence is going to happen whether you want to or not and whether this person was in the right because that's another thing is like violence in and of itself even if you're the winner like well I had to remember what philosopher was said you know winning the duel doesn't mean that you were correct it just means that you won you know that's a good point so duels yeah but uh so all these things are you know customs norms all a lot of this stuff is to avoid anything breaking down to violence because you know you bump into someone you spill their drink and they turn you in to go hey man well I was fucked up and you turned oh man you go you know what it was I'm sorry or you could turn to me like you know what fuck you fuck me you spilled my drink i I'm taking offense to this I now don't have my drink who's gonna make this right I don't really give a shit huh that everything starts to escalate and as soon as one person takes a stand and of if that other person rises to that to that next level - and then and they rise it again eventually you get to a certain point it's like okay what where are we going with this where is the solution where does this lie and it's you've you've stripped down all other options until you got to a point where all you got allowed yourselves was violence or to completely pull yourself entirely out of that situation which a lot of people aren't necessarily if it really really really got to that point they're not willing to do because now motional maturity they've made a mistake or to just not engage and not want to be a part of it yeah but then that there's that psychological thing of wanting to win whatever weird battle of words right well then there's there's other complex things like if it was males you know there's social hierarchy stuff if it was females their social hierarchy our stuff between that if it's male and female it could be you know well there's always a societal if you're really super concerned about what other people think or how you're gonna be perceived by others in a group setting you know that could also play into a factor which happens you know out and about on the town or whatever your buddies always see you in this situation or other people everyone okay you got their attention not what are you gonna do and so if they see you completely retreat everyone's like uh-huh all right well that guy really wasn't what he said he was like his right right right yeah you're not down man did you ever see that thing work Sean Connery is talking to Barbara Walters and she asked him about hitting chicks yeah I've seen it and he's like sometimes she gives him the last word Dustin or good enough they have to say more when you try careful mantra for Mack I never fuck yeah it's just that it was just like uh she didn't know what the fuck what she thought she had him yeah she thought it was over and he dug his heels and he's impervious I guess you know but uh I had no cum in his body because you probably fucked 15 different women that day right and he was just like a kind of non trench conversation or we're having yeah do I need to smack you Barbara I'm fucking Sean Connery look at the smile on his face Paul look at my mustache I'm bald I don't care I'm a man's man let's play can we play it without getting pulled off youtube do it with an open hand remember I haven't changed my opinion no I don't think it's good I don't think it's that bad I think that it depends entirely on the circumstances and if it merits it what would merit it well if you have tried everything else and women are pretty good at this they can't leave it alone they don't the one I had but the last word and you give them the laughs last word but they're not happy with the last one they want to say it again and and get into a really provocative situation then I think it's absolutely right Wow oh boy oh that's people get Sean Connery being rude and aggressive play that up next what is what is he getting rude and aggressive about are you winning a jockstrap or what I'm not not tonight okay that's why you're smiling I haven't he's too tight the director isn't here tonight any particular reason they probably knew you were going to be here would you make another film with director again if you had the chance would you do another interview with me yeah well how would you do a film with him thank you Sean Connery how are you I thought if that was proper white yes right next to it's ready to take some dick that honestly didn't seem that rude or aggressive no just didn't like the question any fucked with them about it yeah well click but in any ways I personally do not put hands on women I'm not in not into that I also try to hit you though yeah are you kidding me I've been I've been chin-checked while driving once I was like snack that was cool the you know each other now is that what to get fucked ha you know fucking hard enough Josh apparently not yeah put your boots on those wrestling shoes you won't put some some some tackle on my arms you know make sure to get a good grip you might want to throw the mattress on the ground right you know so you could really like dig in sort of thing yeah really bottom that thing out yeah man like you push up against a wall and your feet just on hardwood for that yeah right you're just planking and just you know driving actually balls carpeting that's if you had your bedroom like the stuff is stain resistant yeah it's got that grip on it for gripping girls like what the fuck is this like what why is your carpet shop or this is gonna get real real in a second but you're gonna love them for it no I've been I've been hit I I'm not gonna I'm not like oh you've been in abusive relationships not like that I mean it's just people it's frustrations and people not being able to manage those I remember one this gal she trained she fought and at one point and she used to do all kinds of shit right go you know what that is the most fucked-up shit you're really abusing the fact you know your your gender and that you know that you're a woman so I'm not gonna do anything but you're gonna do shit to me that if you were a man I would just knock all your teeth out like you crossed so many lines right and been so disrespectful and and done things that are you know an invasion of personal space and respect it's just like man that's just too much like you meant violence like yeah yeah what if you went out badda been hilarious and you know what the person well this one wasn't the one that punched me while I was driving didn't know how to fight but uh yeah well you know it's like they say - but the drunk guy passes out he's always the one that doesn't get hurt right so out of him like and then the car was cheap anyway so I wouldn't cared and she probably would have got tossed through the window but but I just remember her saying to me this one time that's the one that did train she's like you know what you know fucking kills me I could I could just hit you as hard as I wanted to I could do whatever and it wouldn't fucking matter cuz you know cuz you're you and I by now you're just I'm just like Jesus fuck why is that my fucking fault right you know we're having we have an argument about something and you escalate it and and then you're mad at me because you couldn't beat me up at the end of it you got so mad you can't kick my ass and now that makes you matter let me play armchair psychologist cuz I'm good at this mmm what I would think is that a gal like that first of all she probably enjoys having a certain amount of physical power over people and when shit escalates she wants that violence to be real she wants it to be a real threat coming from her which is why she probably started fighting in the first place now what she's fighting when she's arguing with you all of a sudden she's in this fucked up situation where which she's worked for her whole life is to become the scary girl a girl could fuck people up a girl who's like literally a threat physically she could probably knock a lot of dudes out right but she's confronted with a giant former UFC heavyweight champion and she's like god damn it well that psychology can absolutely hold true for this one particular girl for her I think it was a matter of not being able to you know having this frustration about not being able to get the outcome that they wanted and having what they would feel is no recourse to get me to to come to term to them come to their terms and way but she uses physical time no no this where I never used physical violence this girl never worried about that then uh no you know what insecurity its insecurity and it was just like how is that even why for one you know this this was this girl I was with her for a long time this you know I haven't this one was a long time ago my most recent one on the other hand that one I've actually seen huge violence before and it's just like how to me it's just like even with with arguing we would get into these arguments and someone would make you know statement a and I'd say okay well I don't think statement a holds true because of these reasons and then we'd start going and then all of a sudden statement a is get straw man into something else and then no no you can't leave statement a because you're basing your arguments on that we're not talking about statement B that's that's a whole different scenario altogether this argument isn't is going nowhere now now it's getting circular and you keep taking me away from the original argument to begin with they start hitting you with six years ago you said this to me stuff like that it would be it would be something on I don't know she turned into a gigantic Marxist SJW so really yeah while you were dating her yes she turned sjw social justice warrior ladies and gentlemen if you're and it would just be like whoa that okay hold on that doesn't make sense yeah I don't I don't feel your logic here I I don't think Falls you know in being correct turned into this like I didn't start out doing I think it existed you know she's from she might to Berkeley so it wasn't something that I ever saw especially to begin with it didn't seem like that was what I was in store for until one day you know I look over and I'm like huh Das Kapital well yeah I think we reading Marx is interesting and I think it's worthwhile to understand some of his his arguments and I think he's got some interesting critiques of capitalism especially back in its day with with this industrialism industrial society at that time but he doesn't understand people at all his solutions are fuck hackneyed and you know he's coming from a very interesting position because he doesn't even he as a person doesn't even stick to his own his own shit you know but in anyways so we're having these arguments and then it would turn it up pejorative and I'm like well okay why are you attacking me I'm not attacking you I'm not even being angry about your statement I just you you made statement a so I don't believe in it I don't I don't think that that's correct so we're having a discussion but now it became a personal attack and now once it even gets to that let alone someone even back in the day talking about what really upsets me that no matter how angry you no matter whatever if I hit you or did this it wouldn't matter because you're you it's like well both of these statements come from the same same both of those scenarios come from the same place it's like well now you're trying you're attacking me the individual because if you're gonna do that you aren't thinking about me as the person that no no I got your back through heaven and hell I will kick the gates of hell down and kill everyone there if I got to there for you yet there they wanted the value they wanted to value me the person because they feel attacked in some way they feel like they're they're so attached to their to their statement to whatever that may be which has some attachment to maybe what they feel is their existence that to change that is dangerous to call it outright wrong would be an even bigger problem and I mean you know it's just like this stuff would start showing up at the house and so I'm like alright I'm gonna start doing research on marks and angles and all this different stuff and and then as I would go further and further and further down the rabbit hole I come back and I go oh okay so this argument stems from this and this and this and this and this and they're like no it doesn't like well okay what why do you think people operate like what do you think their whole reasoning is you know we can do these arguments about capitalism like capitalism's and neutral so let me ask you this what is it about social justice warriors or left-wing people that wear Marxism is so attractive to them well for one it's it's this idea of equity like this sameness like well everybody nobody is being left behind and no one is be coming greater than anybody else right it's also the idea I like to think of it in I think a lot of these young people look at it as mom's house mom and dad's house so when your mom and dad's house someone does your laundry someone cooks your food you know you always just show up you got a place to live you know the TV turns on and there's a the government should become mom and dad one exactly so they want mom and dad's house to exist forever so it's it's like they can run off and do whatever they want to get food there's plenty of money for shelter you just need to spend it right the redistribution of wealth right exactly because if you exceed that system to more than they deem that you should have then you should give it to somebody else and it's like well how do you think I got this oh my god how many I'm sorry two in right because it's just like how do you think I got this people could say well it was you got it through you inherited it okay that does happen I could also got it through hard work and dedication and some some guile and some smarts and made it happen for myself does that somehow mean that I had to do it at the expense of someone else yeah that's really shitty argument right that's but that's the argument that the question is but if you're successful you did it on them it's all grano it's all grift yeah what do you think this is what I want to ask is an interesting thing too it's like if someone agrees to do a job if their skill set is limited in such a way that they were owned that they were capable of doing this job at this moment now of course if you're asking me they probably they have a potential to do more than that as long as they're willing to invest back in themselves and find another skill or expand that skill you know there's always possibility for growth within a human being within their lot in life whatever that is and that that could be transferred into work could be transferred into personal goals I mean it's all about how you value things also so this person gets into this job working making widgets for this guy who invented this widget this guy invented the widget the argument of that okay the worker deserves just as much as the guy that invented it it's like well hold on without the guy that invented the widget you have no job like all these people that are working out on it working underneath them it would have nothing they would have zero there would be no widget to build and the guy that made the widget also has the most responsibility because he had to come up with the money to produce the widget to be able to hire the people to make the widget to then market the widget to do all these things to the widget to get it out there to make it successful enough to then support more people and that doesn't necessarily mean it's on the back of that other person because you could also say well is everything on the back of the guy that made the widget I mean you just his idea is not worth is not can't be belonged to him because he created it we should take it for us even though we never we did not come up with it we never created it we even have the facilities to make any created and didn't invent it are the ones who want to define how much this guy should get for inventing it versus how much they sure and I would get into arguments with my ex about she's like oh I think all businesses should be coops and my thing like what does that mean well like cooperative where everybody is getting an unequal share and and into the business itself businesses yeah that's what it is hilarious also because I would say all businesses can be coops there is no one stopping a business from being a co-op we know what stops businesses from being a co-op if someone doesn't want it to be a co-op or someone decides well that doesn't I can't do it that way so it won't make as much sense for me to create a co-op situation as it would to not or a co-op sounds nice an enforce co-op does not sound nice well of course co-op sounds nice if like safe you and I live on a block and we said hey let's we got this fucking patch of land let's start a garden start a little small farm correct we'll just have a little co-op here right all right cool great yeah beautiful my choice volunteer and says Josh Barnett is this the Josh Barnett farm yeah well you're gonna have to turn this into a co-op and you're like well fuck I am well we're gonna put you in jail exactly and that's and then it comes back down to violence here's the question this is what I want to kept meaning to ask before I forget do you think that the what do you think the numbers are of the people that are involved in these ideas that have never competed in anything now that's my ex-girlfriend is a professional fighter and she fights in Bellator however the idea of the meritocracy of being a fighter seems it's not I don't think it's lost on her I just she she doesn't like the way it's worked out for her and that makes her an upset whereas for me I found success as being a fighter and it sometimes it would it would appear that she would be she would be upset at me for what I was able to do and somehow think that maybe I was less deserving or somehow I mean it's an exception that who knows what but the reality is like I can sit back and go oh Mark Hunt just made $800,000 her thought might it might be more less safe we're just I'm making this up I'm not from this she said this you know she's like well why does he deserve $800,000 why I make $4,000 or $5,000 or whatever I've seen people say that right it's just like okay well I could think of all plenty of reasons I go he draws more tickets he's got a better record he's won he's a k1 champ or what you know at the end of the day if in New Zealand right right and if he's selling more tickets than you are then he gives it he deserves a greater percentage of that money now now you come to me and I feel like why beat mark hunt right what's her argument for that when you say that uh her argument for that would be that you know this other person isn't any more deserving than this everybody she uh paid the same so Jon Jones fights Daniel Cormier huge fight everybody on the undercard gets a fair share well either that or just like well I deserve more than this and it's and my argument would always be it went when when she was upset about what she may be getting paid here there and some of this I'd go we'll look you know for for this for what we're trying to accomplish and for what what is available in these markets that's not a bad payday well that sucks no I agree with you you should make more money but we can't and it's not available so we have to deal with what we have for me and then I would look at something like Mark Hunt and be like well I beat my compass so what I'm more glad that Mark Hunt was able to create an opportunity to make $100,000 so therefore if he can make eight hundred thousand dollars now the potential for me to do that exists as well and it's just similar to like the old Gina Carano thing where everyone got on the train about Wanda beat Gina Carano fucking or Carla she's not even that good and bla bla but all this hate at gina carano when the reality is like okay well II if you beat gina carano you're not gonna get what gina carano gets you're not gonna get then people aren't gonna like you just as much or more it's really not about any of that the only thing you can control is yourself at the end of the day you can only control yourself you can you only you can can work to try and increase it or you're in determine your value in terms of what you're trying to sell but isn't part of selling today at least talking shit some of it seems to be like because of your honor yeah his proficiency at it yeah and his massive financial success but he wins - yeah he wins all the time he won belts he made very bold statements and then went out and won yeah another person could then go and talk shit maybe they'd win and people still don't care as much right now you can't force people to care and what makes them care is a metric that you just can't define you know there's one way of doing it is to make them all hate you but when you lose you you're what's gonna happen is you're gonna drop off often everything that you gained will be lost but as they hate you as you continue to win they're gonna be more incited to watch you fight they're gonna be more interested to watch you fight or you could be a guy like Randy Couture everybody loves and when he loses everybody loves in the same sure and and you know how that combination comes about is it's magic well I think with Randy it's sincerity but I think look look at Kevin Lee and michael Chiesa from this past weekend perfect example of like a few these guys put together talking shit to each other at a press conference they get in a scuffle at a press conference and all sudden everybody cares yeah about the result of this fight and then the fight has a controversial injure and now it's even more crazy here and now there's a lot of eyes on Kevin Lee and michael Chiesa that 3-4 months ago just I've been saying guys are super talented chef guys have some really good wins and I think Kevin Lee's got some real fuckin potential but people weren't really talking about in the way they are now so a lot of other fighters are gonna look at that and go yeah that's what I do I go talk shit on gina carano or I gotta talk shit on well it's a lot of that is what with the gina carano thing that was in security and that was also well she was a superstar and the oh she was and people wanted they thought that they could have witch she had by taking it from her and it's like well that's not actually how it works right you can you can beat her and that will definitely do something for you and by fighting her it's gonna elevate your status but not the same status I know Holly Holm you're your own cents out Ronda sure I mean she devastated Ronda right she was the first one ride his undefeated looks like a tank coming at her and Holly wines have had kicking her and knocking her out I mean Holly is still a really highly respected professional fighter but I mean it's not the same doesn't have the same well it also did something for her her accolades coming in so she's this heavily touted boxing champion yeah that boxing championship looks more interesting now after she goes and she wins the MMA belt too let me ask you this why don't they set up cyborg versus her isn't that the fight cyborg vs Holly Holm Ronda me I don't know a lot of people thought of Holly Holm should have won that fight it was a very close fight and the random II definitely hit her twice real really significant yes and should have been a penalty so why the fuck isn't Holly fighting I know she just fought bets go hyah but as soon as Megan Anderson dropped off yeah if Holly could take it I mean she didn't have 11 she's not injured and maybe she is who knows she might be managers yeah who knows hookers who know who knows what but that's the fight that's an interesting fight Holly vs. cyborg is the fucking fight would be a great fight I think people would be interested to watch it but for sure not the fight that's being made you say we have Tonya average err is stepping up and fighting cyborg and Stan yeah and short notice you know but Tonya's a gamer she's very tough yeah she will fight anybody well that's a highlight the fight because of that because she's so tough yeah that's what makes it exciting but you know sabor is a giant person she is massive she's super explosive which to me explosiveness in women's MMA is a massive difference between success and and not like if you're high if you're super explosive like that usually makes a massive a big difference in terms of your success right did you see cyborgs barn with lots of shields and time Olympic gold medal in boxing and hanging in there man and she's a box for sure but not by much she landed some good shots she still game and moving forward fighting and throwing stuff dangerous yeah and dangerous against a super high-level boxer a girl it's even arguably sleeps bigger than her - yeah and lightning fast but watching shields like set things up and use that jab dude I just want sprawl specialization you know that's the thing about boxing and the the Conor and Mayweather fight is it's the specialization of a boxer vers in the MMA person I would say the MMA fighter is the superior fighter right Ronny when you start to me the most open Andy the most even playing field is the one that has the least rules yeah but by funneling that down to those specific skill sets with boxing you create a specialized athlete while there are skills within boxing that will transfer to MMA even just in terms of boxing the the timing and the footwork that you might use in boxing isn't necessarily what you would use in MMA and and vice-versa short distance right but so I see that you know it would be great if Connor goes out there and wins it would make MMA look that much bigger you know but and he's got the power and he's a great athlete and he's got good timing and accuracy I just don't see him being able to get flush on Mayweather the way that's gonna be needed it seems highly unlikely unless he old-school Bernard Hopkins ins you know remember Bernard used to fight he's to clinch guys and just Saoirse off muffin clinch and they're outside he was just straight defensive but do you really think that boxing referees are gonna let that out I don't know and there's gonna be even more eyeballs on Conor to diminish that aspect because they're gonna be expecting him to do stuff like that anyway they're you know there's I'm sure there's already I've heard that there are elements in the contract about kicks and things like that they have to put that in there I'll haul off and kick in then that's it you lose all your money yeah that makes sense but I feel like if you if you looked at Conor and like his skill set like what's what he's capable of doing like overall I could see how he would think like man it's just striking I feel like I could probably get close enough I can get off on anybody sure but that level that Floyd Mayweather's that like to have zero professional boxing fight spar with him and you know also from Connors perspective he's thinking this is a chance to be a hero this is another opportunity to be a hero I have hardly anything to lose if at all and all to gain potential of winning I also have a big payday win or lose so everything works out towards a win-win situation for him you know would have been great if Connor could get to get this stipulation we'll only box but we wear MMA gloves had issues with his hands in the house which is why he almost exclusively wears winning gloves in the ring so that would never hurt him thick fat gray and I think they're fighting with ten ounce gloves too it's a big glove tends not eight no I don't think so I think they'd agreed upon weight was ten see if that's not the case is that case yeah I'm surprised interesting I would have thought eight yeah they're like 140 some pounds or if they're gonna fight 55 okay and I think I thought 60 was the cutoff but I'm 168 or 185 yeah where they go to ten huh but uh either way much bigger than four which is what geez a custom - yeah and I feel like if but like man it's still you know I had a conversation with a buddy of mine he's a really good jiu-jitsu blackbelt he was gonna fight an MMA and he had very little sparring in terms of like MMA sparring or very little kickboxing sparring almost no striking and I say you know how you can do things to be able on the ground or you get some guy who does nobody's doing you just do whatever the fuck you want to him I know this guy's I can do that too standing up like you got to be careful like you can't get this in your head that you're awesome at something so you're awesome at everything right because the the type of mentality that a person has to become whether it's a championship level MMA fighter or boxers that that focus that intense focus like sometimes guys get twisted and they think that because I'm a Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion I could be a kickboxing champion I could be an MMA champion I'd do whatever the fuck I want to do but the road is long man the road is long people forget all that they went through to acquire such a a set of skills you know to get there in the first place and I understand that a highly highly specialized jujitsu a wrestler can go out there and experience success in MMA right away however like you said they might come across that guy who is so good on their feet that they can do the whatever they want to to that guy and just leave them clueless and when or you can take them down yeah or there's that were that there's that person that you're just not able you take them down once twice but they could keep you back to their feet now all of a sudden you're tired you've been pushing so much harder to because you can't fight a plan B or or in this other plane you have to fight within the plane that you're an expert yeah because you put all your marbles in one basket you're not a Mighty Mouse to kind of do it all in any forum you're a Demian Maia who's learned how to kickbox yes got really good at it but when you fight Demian Maia you know real clear what his plan is for sure and even still Demian Maia has has learned to create striking that helps mitigate other people striking so he can get his best game off yeah so that's still that's a type of stand up work that he's working on within that has been specialized for MMA as he fights in the UFC do you agree though that a guy like Conor McGregor would have way more like I feel like the odds of Floyd beating Conor are extremely high in a boxing match they're on the ninth high 90% sure right but the odds of Conor beating Floyd in MMA match are 100 pretty much pretty much a hundred 99.999999 Conor would have to like really fuck up he'd have to get you know chin-checked yeah doing something stupid me which is not kicking right yeah he would kick the shit out of his leg this isn't this isn't the fight about who's a better fighter right this is a fight about who's a better boxer yeah and the idea that Conor is gonna step in and just clang Floyd with a straight left is almost as ridiculous as the idea that Floyd's going to step into an MMA fight and catch Conor with a big punch and knock him out Ray Mercer tim tim sylvia style i say it's more like Floyd Mayweather jumping in that cage and armbar in corner you know it's like that yeah yeah catching him in a fucking rolling guillotine yeah I can Victor roll into a kneebar hit him with an M Inori spin them crazy hooks well you know Floyd in his heel hooks yeah well when that was one of the crazy things with James Toney fought Randy Couture like there's all these people speculating like where's James Tony's been training MMA and you got to see him do some stuff for like an MMA trainer you're like oh okay he's not barely doing this he's barely doing this he's not he's tough he doesn't know anything this is crazy and then Randy just goes out there ya know single ankle poof just falls over in that end of that night yeah low single Randy on top that's a wrap Brandi was merciful though I mean punched him a few times and then just choked him yeah yeah Randy isn't really he wasn't known for being a particularly vicious competitor you have a feeling you probably would have treated that situation slightly differently yeah I would have tried to tear him absolutely limb from limb not not not because of any particular personal animosity just because I go out there to wreck people because I want to make sure that if I'm winning I'm winning well if you had a guy like like a James Toney on the ground who came in from professional boxing knowing me fights would you have it in your mind that you need to prove a point now if you haven't you might just finish him when you can smash him any way possible you know I chop his leg whatever shoot a double blow through them get on top and then just start doing whatever is available for such a nice guy and such a well-spoken guy you enjoy hurting people in a very disturbing way that's what I'm good at it's what I was it's what I learned at an early age that it was something that I excelled at I asked you all just partly to see you response because I knew that you're gonna get worked up about it and you think about smashing them and like what you would do I get seen your eyes thinking about taking them down I love that's part of the reason why i leaving fighting I know it's gonna be tough not competing because I love going out there and in some way it is I was explaining this I was actually at a philosophical lecture the other night and I'm a big fan of philosophy the philosophical well this this lecture was on a 16 part series on America and it was this last one this friend of mine hit me up she goes hey things going down at this this this school so hey why won't we go check it out alright cool and so it had something to do with futurism and I forget what else but as the lecture was going on people would chime in and say stuff and so at one point I'm listening to some of these these arguments some of it I'm just going back you just don't really you don't understand people that whale I mean every a lot of these arguments always come from some idea of a base motivation from somebody like the idea that all capitalism is theft it's like well you know you don't have to be a horrible person to operate successfully within a capitalist system just as much as just because you create a communist system doesn't necessarily make you benevolent because as you will look you know in the Soviet Union and as you've had Robert R Jordan Peterson on here and he'll tell you all of the elements of the brutality of communist systems and then of course i marrying in the 80s and even seeing slides from one of my teachers who was over in the soviet union and sneaking photos out of the USSR because they didn't want any photos of living conditions and all these sort of things bread lines all that stuff brought back to the western world because they felt it would make them look bad well of course because it did you know and people were entrenched in these systems and abusing these systems to their benefit just like paul our politicians abused our system to their benefit just like all human beings will abuse a system to its benefit when given the chance to do so either out of selfishness to the point of maliciousness or even just direct maliciousness so the human element is the the key process in all systems they're they're pretty much the cause of all systems failing and they always will be but when you try to create some other roundabout idea you try to assign you know these other crazy concepts as to why or you know you create these micro group ideologies and you distill in distill in distill and you constantly create like with with Marxism it's a conflict theory so there's always has to be some sort of oppressor there always has to be a conflict you know a lot of human beings aren't out there trying to oppress people they're just trying to get theirs right and or you know creating their little tribes and creating what they you know to use a overused word safe space for themselves that which they understand this area they understand these demarcations about this group and these people and this thing and even this area of land at which you live in you know the idea of going I don't going off on a tangent here from our original discussion but the idea of like personal property and you know you have your fence lying around let's say a piece of property I was walking through Joshua Tree and looking at all this stuff and pondering some things and and you know that property line isn't just about me owning this and keeping other people out and being in looking at and someone wants to say oh you just want to be selfish and own and be greedy in' and dominate something and i will actually think about it this way that line is the same as an extension from my own personal space you know i know you so you know you can get right in my personal space and I don't care because we've already vetted each other we've already had a relationship well I have a good understanding of who you are as joe rogan and and your being in the world and you understand me to a degree as well as josh barnett versus some guy just shows up at your house versus some guy some things some anything that you don't know you don't know verses so you have this fence line is is what you're doing is you're creating this space that is just and a person it's just an extension of your own personal bubble of your own personal safe space and so within that you feel like you've vetted it you know these rocks you know these plants you understand the the plusses and minuses of this area that exists and so within this place of existence you can be your most authentic self without any concern of the rest of the world now if somebody something was to come and want to cross that that line you'd want to say well I don't know what it is yet so I want to vet that source and then say ok yeah it's ok I'll allow you into my into my space into my area and so now you too can also be open to the vulnerability that I'm giving you because that's what it is you know our personal space is about our vulnerability about the ability for someone else to you know interact with us physically as well as emotionally and so even just having your little cabin with your little fence can't have that right Marxist ideas of no probably it's an acre yeah there's a lot of full-on old-school Marxist anymore they're all pretty much neo-marxist from me as as Peterson and other people have described from the frankfurt schools you know permeating into the academia and and going after the the superstructure instead of the base I think this is undeniable aspect you talked about before where with your ex-girlfriend at least or with some people like that we don't have to single out her that people that are not successful in in this in the competition of life yeah seek to diminish the success of those around them and yes yeah also it's it's the other thing about that is the value that you create where what is your values where what is your value system and and how is that going to influence you so if you if your value system is based on external elements like Nietzsche talks about there the danger of unchecked Envy you know as Envy being a life-affirming element you know if I envy Jill Rogan and his podcast which I do I can see that well Joe was able to create this podcast so the possibility exists so for for a person to create a podcast and be successful with and expand from there on out so that envy can drive me to then work towards it because I know it's a possibility having unchecked envy would be to be angry at you for having that podcast and thinking that well you know he's got this thing and I want that thing how do I deserve it too or even deserve it burn it to the ground why because you're so upset about it that's the lowest of self esteems right the people that not only do they not think they can't compete they don't want anyone successful because they don't think they're ever gonna play and everyday without social but through throughout social media people are seeing manufactured manicured interpretations of life and thinking and weighing themselves against that so that's just one example of how you are using these external forces to determine your value systems or putting value on things that are beyond your control or putting value in areas that are unnecessary that are actually harmful to you and so people if I had to just walk away from everything like my muscle cars and all that stuff and I know I know it's a horrible thought I have a have some projects and that are gonna be to completion here assume that I'm just so looking forward to you driving the Challenger though that's my daily driver but I'm replacing it with a 75 formula Firebird with a 455 that I punched out to 470 automatic overdrive transactions suspension will with brakes all the way around on it it's gonna be fucking great nine-inch board in the back speaking of which Gabriel Iglesias was just on Jalen ROG yeah and he's got a dope Burt Reynolds fucking smoking the bandit Trans Am yeah they do build them up new Camaros is that what his from oh yeah one of the no thought the new Camaro I just saw the picture of him with standing with J next to the car the car looks it is it's a sweet car I've seen it at SEMA this is a car that doesn't impress girls at all that's only that fuckin thing so that's based on the one on the left but one on the left is a real 7700 70 so one on the right is a brand new one holy shit so there's two oh my god so they put a front new new nose piece on and they put the shaker scoop they put it and this one they put an ls3 and cano doesn't even get any more that one if they could do that with the zl1 that no one they can do it with anyway you know that zeal one of the fastest cars to ever lap the Nurburgring yes after than the Corvette zo6 faster than anything it's incredible with what we're doing with cars but shit alright now if I have to give all this shit up I would hate it that's amazing I would love it yeah it's a Burt Burt Reynold's edition holy shit he signed it yeah so but if I did truth be told look at the her shifter as hard as a rock truth truth be told I can I can get rid of all these things I can be free of all of that stuff and still have a life that makes me highly happy substantial I know I don't wanna I don't want to get crazy I'm dementia extreme those Marxists are fucking with your head man I'm not changing your value I know they want to take my Firebird my gt500 and all this no but you know I can't help it that my car has more boost than yours yeah you can but the thing is is that it's where I put my values what what is valuable to me and what's valuable and living and being so for someone else they they put these things on other stuff and they they give responsibily what they end up doing is transferring that power to external sources and when you start working off of external sources as your your value is your value system then you've taken away that power from yourself all right and so well there's also the rejection I have a rejection the idea that you can't enjoy people's creations I think of a car as a creation yeah I'm gonna think of it a lot of ways is like a mass-produced piece of art sure you know what if someone's done in creating like that that new what is it the demon yeah dodge demon right that challenger that will go 960s it goes zero to 60 in less than three seconds yeah and it's a production car and I can't drive it if it's colder than 15 degrees out you can't drive it's like it's such a such a fucked up car but like that to me is I'm fascinated as someone chose to make it I liked if I I look at that the same way I look at them doing space exploration like oh that's all gonna trickle down to regular cars sure you know they're gonna figure out how to make Tang out of this sure and and that's the thing is that these things wouldn't exist if people weren't driven to to express their will to power and grow to want to be their greatest version of themselves to create a greater thing than the last thing to to push that envelope well it's not always going to be successful it's the idea of creating something greater and greater greater now I mean there's an argument with with science that there's always the you know is it shoulda or coulda right now of course there's there is an element of ethics that has to play into that I think there you need to be aware of and it's also with object you don't want to get obsessed and fixated on the projects by direct it doesn't mean you can't enjoy a new laptop right well and I think that a lot of these these new like champagne socialist type folks they enjoy they enjoy these the new laptops and the new iPhones all that stuff is it's they love all the modern conveniences of the capitalist country that we live in and you know if someone wanted to sit down and talk to me about the the danger the the elements of our society of our capitalist economy and how it it is in is in issue the issues within it now totally I get it no our system is fucked up in a lot of ways don't get me wrong but by replacing it with with you know some sort of a Marxist system now you're just asking for I mean we already have enough trouble with people in power being unsuitable in a sense like us being having a very ineffective way of really affecting our political system and creating change within it and having things you know taken away new laws created altered like it's so impossible right but it's like it's a system that works outside of us even though we're supposedly the ones that can can control it but you create a communist system right you create a full States secured system you really have no ability to affect that right without some sort of a you know violent revolution which doesn't not probably in your best interest with the way technology and military and all that stuff I mean just I mean no one wants the things to get to that point and so so there's always a preach a ramp down version of it though because like the well there's never any true by the way there's never been a true a true communist system or there never been true Marxism it's always the fucking no true Scotsman fallacy it's like it never happened this never happened yet it's like what the fuck do you think the the Soviets were doing what do you think that the Mao is they all thought they were doing it right you know but it and even then when you go to look at China nowadays well think on all these capitalist elements within it that are making their economy just fucking flush with money so flush with money that they're they're like I don't want to give to the government so they send it all over to Vancouver and buy up all these houses and stuff like this and then they're like teenage kid lived there all over Hollywood even bel-air right a lot of a lot of Asian money sure money from Saudi Arabia as well right and you know Saudi Arabia are you talking theocracy mm-hmm yeah and they're worried about their money getting taken away over there so they're i buy real estate over here yeah and also it's very valuable it like keeps going up it's a good investment and when you're making trillions of dollars by sucking oil out of the ground sure sure sure and you know at the end of the day the thing about all this stuff is that that that when the if you give people the most opportunity to be free you're also giving the most opportunity to be shitty yeah and you have to accept that you just have to accept that some people are just gonna be fucking assholes some people are gonna be shitty some people are gonna try and create a system that that you're not gonna like that's gonna reward others for things you don't think it should but you're always gonna get those hedge fund dudes you're always gonna get those guys who have those gigantic estates and the Hamptons and yeah fuck people you know and graduated with a with a physics degree didn't use it okay fine but you spent all this money to go to that school and should it have cost that much money should should the rates on loans be with you I don't think so I think that's that's a real scam you you know you didn't probably understand they were ill-equipped to understand like all of us were when it came to school yeah when you're 18 you know what the fuck I mean we didn't really understand how what a racket it was at the time so I you know I totally feel for her there and then so then she goes she gets a different job doing something else but made her great money but she hated it didn't like it what didn't want to be in that all right so then chose to fight and do like you know personal trainer stuff and then would always gripe about how she didn't make enough money and it's like well you could do okay well then how about this you you charge X amount per hour normally well how about you set a limit to where you get to X amount of people and then once you go over that now you double the fee because it's not really worth it to you anymore is it so you create an increase and you see what your what your minimum is and then over that and if people are willing to pay it then they pay it well I couldn't do that that would be that would be unethical to charge these people double what I'm charging these people or whatever it's like well okay then how about you create a class schedule setup and you earn out some time here instead of specific here instead of teaching one person you teach five people but then you charge them you know two-thirds we charge you know it's just like well like it's like well okay if you at the end of the day we have to do what we need to do to pay our bills and do these things to do whatever but we also have to determine how we acquire those bills to what what our expenses are gonna be and if we can't create a system that supports that then we have to re-evaluate that and then change appropriately the one thing we can't do is just be upset you know and that's what people like to do of course because they would like it to be oh well I can do this or I can do I should be able to do this I should be able to do that it's like well nobody can you can't fish you can pitch and just chase their tail and go around in circles freedom being truly free and let's just say an existential sense means that you have to take responsibility for all these actions but it's also all on you to find your own success and that means you're gonna fail that means you're gonna struggle that means all these difficulties gonna happen but yeah I personally believe it through struggle and and these difficulties that's where growth comes as well well the question is what's the alternative the alternatives what you sit around complain whenever someone else is more successful than you sit around and complain that you're not making enough money you sit around and complain dat the deck deck is stacked against you sit around complaining you didn't use your education sit around complain that in your field of choice I didn't succeed well here's the other thing a lot of people then want to find somebody who is the reason for their downfall yeah this thing is what's keeping me from being successful as the boyfriend I wasn't you know I everything I did was to help you know I did as much as I too big too much shit too smart tired of them yeah I I I put it you know at the end of the day you know fuck I got yeah I got completely betrayed and cheated on for months in the end of it so it's just like well you know I put all this investment into trying to help this other person and create a life with them only to get completely screwed over in the end but I'm just on a date a lot that boy again personally er yeah it's true but but what it comes down to also is that when you look at these kind of things you have to say well okay well what would I have done differently and you should be like for the most part you shouldn't have done anything differently you know when you invest in somebody else when you do for somebody else you don't do it for the return or for what you think you're gonna get out of them you do it because you're doing it because it is what you believe is the right thing to do and then to be you know you can be upset about other the way things have turned out you can be upset about like well you know ethically I think you did this you did that and you can be upset about those things but then too it's just like it whenever you come across that person that just has nothing but shitty things to say about their ex like it's probably you oh dude you know for me I could be like nah I thought my ex was the greatest woman I've ever met and she absolutely possessed qualities that aligned with that but she also had some really terrible ones that ended up being you know whenever you meet someone and all they do is complain about their exes it's usually there's very little of them and what they're saying but see that that's just you know this is just human beings in their own existence and so be it their relationship be it their business be it you know all these things are all stemming from the same elements within themselves now they are subject to others very specific elements to like things there's a relationship like what kind of elements well okay when it comes to your point - like what's the foremost people like what's the the big factor and not getting their shit together the big factor not getting the shit together is not coming to terms with their own inefficiency failures or inability to accomplish a certain task and looking outside of that for a reason versus looking internally to see like I didn't have enough skill to do X Y to do this thing or I didn't put in enough time to acquire the skill to do that or I made a mistake here that cost this when it comes to a relationship you know it's there what where it lives were the difficulty lies there can be specific to different emotional elements but you know versus your work versus how you even find time to make the most out of your your leisure time you know these are the every every situation has its own subjectivity to it based on these other external factors that change from each situation but ultimately everything stemming from you anyways so your way of approaching these things and dealing with these problems and how you let them affect you and I'm not just talking about being a complete stoic and being just cold and on a feeling unaffected and unfeeling it's just about having these things happen and then what do you do about it you know how do you also how do you measure that metric if you have the greatest earier life and then you have you know an hour that's super shitty in traffic did that become and that really stuck with you and someone hit your car and you're you know my challengers got a dent in it and it's like oh did I really have the worst day ever or did I just have an hour of an aggravation that sucked but ultimately how can that if I allow that to take away from everything that happened up to that point then you know I just assigned all this value into this one moment right that really no it's not necessary you trained a lot of Fighters yeah you work with do you do sit down and talk to them about this kind of shit as well 100 percent is this a big part of like how you like think about it as a program for sure because whoever I take under my wing I don't just train people to train them I don't them being fighters is one piece of their life one element one's honestly eventually it'll be it'll be a small element but it but it has a lot of impact and meaning I mentor people when I work with them I'm trying to help them visualize and achieve their greatest state of being from what they can get now fighting may be a vehicle to help try to achieve that but ultimately they're living their life and they have a they have something that they're trying to accomplish with that and so for me I'm trying to help them realize what that is and that's gonna be different from up for other people just as much as you can't coach everyone this same way everybody needs something a little different in terms of what they're trying to achieve and people want to achieve different things of course they've got this they have this element of fighting and success within fighting that that is a bond that is a similarity amongst the rest of them and even amongst me but beyond that that changes from there on out so you know just recently I've been working with Travis brown you know people are like holy fuck you guys are your homies what the hell happened and it's just this the thing was is that Travis was had tried to get in touch with me through marina before okay you'd really like to he wants to talk to you I was like okay I already wants to talk about and this is like over a year ago I think and then but for one reason the other we weren't able to ever cross paths but through that time it would keep coming back he really wants to you really like to me really I do really like to see not just text you not just chat with you on the phone but actually see you okay you know that already says something to me that that I already has a lot more meaning and so sure enough I meet up with them this this one time with a coffee shop and he just wanted to sit down man-to-man eye-to-eye and just go over like any of the beef that we had had and and make his statements any apologies and anything that I might have to say in any apologies and I was like holy fuck you know a man that I used man I'm not trying to be specific but any person that is willing to sit down and be accountable and hear somebody else's side and just show up and be like look man I'm not looking for something from you but I'm trying to be open and and deal with whatever this this is out here put it to bed yeah that's very admirable exactly it is such a rare commodity and how long would this happen uh maybe about six months ago I just got a fight scheduled that's right well maybe he's even a little more than six months ago he's fighting uh Alexei Olynyk and so he hits me up he goes hey I would love it if you could help me out so for me it was a no brainer like fuck yeah I'll be there alright so I drove out to Vegas with one of my guys Shohei Yamamoto who was getting ready for his at the kill King kid he's fighting locally here in cxf so I'm like I'm gonna finish this kid's camp out here away from everybody else and I'm gonna help you out at the same time cool cool so he put us up in his place we would go and we train twice a day I would work with him on grappling I would spar with him and you know just take on that role of coach alongside Ricky Lyndell and Ray Sefo and he's a fantastic student when did you start working with Ray I think he's been working with Ray for about a year now about a year I think that's a good move he's kicking again thank the Romneys which is great yeah guy six foot seven six week seven and moves like Dominick Cruz yeah and when he was not sorry Dominick but I mean when he was at his best for a heavyweight there's no one who moves like him he was he's very agile on his feet he's got great great quickness good and he's got great reach good power hell I should know and the thing is he he was having he just didn't feel that he was getting what he best needed so he made a change and even still for fighting someone like Alexei he felt like oh well having a guy that was a good grappler and also good at that had an arm position which Alexei likes to have someone come in here and work with him in these very specific areas but you know for me it's like well if you want me to be here I'll be here and I'll help you in any way I can and so I would work with him while we're sparring we would do situational stuff and you know he was just like a sponge I'm watching him get better every day and having some other guys around to help and be bodies too and it ended up being great it also was great for shohaib because I was able to put him in a very isolated environment and keep his focus so razor sharp and he went and knocked his guy out in 22 seconds it was undefeated that's awesome so so now it's you know Travis is in town doing some press stuff and I'm gonna try and link up with him as much as possible and just keep working with him and the thing is he's the guys like that I mean they're already physical they already have fights under their belt they already accomplished it with them it's about nuance so you're gonna be like his head coach there's discussion of that yeah maybe just I mean but the reality is is that I just need to do whatever it is I can do to help him and his team and be a part of all that and you know whether I'm a head coach or a persistent coach I don't I don't really care it doesn't matter what the title is I just I just need to be in there in the trenches with these guys putting our heads together and and helping Travis be the best he can be as a fighter and even then well through these training sessions you know you're teaching somebody about getting out of a move you're teaching somebody about doing a move but wrapped in that whole bubble is okay you're having a hard time right now yeah yeah okay that's okay because you're still moving forward don't worry about how difficult it is that sometimes this is gonna be hard as shit other times things will work just like that it doesn't matter the matter is you got to keep going you got to keep moving forward you got to keep fighting you got to keep working and you then what you know from from one position it's like well you can't afford to be here at all so no matter how hard it is you got to get out you but you can rest over here or it's like you know this this training session was super fucking hard that's great if you're not pushing yourself into your absolute exhaustion now how do you think you're gonna perform when it's at its utmost so it wasn't getting that no no I think it's just I'm just throwing out examples but I feel about working with him on a mental level too and getting his mind in that best state to then best use those physical capabilities because ultimately in my opinion mental is the most important aspect when it comes to fighting how you approaches things your mentality towards each individual skirmish within that that fight that eventually leads to either your success or your failure and that is always that's always the thing it's like whether I could teach someone to throw a kick this way or kick that way or you know there's always a way to make something work you know maybe there are some techniques that are more low-percentage than others especially but there'll always be a guy that can make it work you know however your mental the way you approach a fight mentally is the fucking thing that is the hardest thing to hone the hardest thing just to change over the hardest realizations to create is all in terms of how you mentally to fight how to control your nerves or how to over look at your writing this outlook as a book yeah I do I think about writing I think about writing I think in terms of fighting I think about writing in terms of philosophy I think about maybe doing speaking engagement stuff like that you know talking about if you sat down and came up with like sort of a comprehensive step-by-step for young fighters they'll be like super value maybe I don't know I guess if you if you come at work sure you could do that and which of course is going to be just like you said framework yeah give them tools to fall back on if they're in a certain situation this is something you can call on this is something you can think about if you find yourself stuck this is the mindset instead of just swimming out there sure freaking out treading water and trying to figure out how long and you do it for have a very specific mindset that you adopt or that you take on when you're in a bad spot sure and and a lot of drills and things that I'll create for fighters are based on creating comforts and and familiarity to where things get to a point where you're not thinking about it anymore but you're so comfortable and in that moment in that space that you can react and act easily the most easily as possible and also once you end up in a position that is even that is a negative to you that is detrimental how to then work your way through it and still do so with comfort like I loved watching Liz Carmouche on Rhonda's back because Rhonda states so so calm that that's how she was able to work her way through it fight that arm off her head keep in good position and eventually work her way out of it instead of seizing up and possibly you know locking in place and then Liz being able to finish that face lock or that choke what did you think about that Kevin leaked he has a fight I didn't watch it you didn't watch it now how dare you I I know I'm a fighter that doesn't really watch fight he's a crazy ending so I heard yeah Kevin Lee took PS his back which is casas thing right yeah and he took his back sunk the choke in guess a fought her off he went palm to palm chiesa like was trying to gut it out he says and Mario Yamasaki steps in and stops it before he taps I wouldn't done that no one does that especially do a choke it's one thing if a guy's arm is snapped and you see it broken Brennan and you call the fight right but this is not that this is any same that he thought he went out it's just a hundred percent poor officiating I mean I haven't certain seen any tournament from anybody on the rights imeem on in terms of people that are either work for the UFC trainers fighters even jujitsu athletes yeah everybody's gotta let him go out it's a great it's not a bad thing but people don't know it's not you don't get it's not like getting knocked out yeah he could have been shut off being with two chicks yeah it doesn't it doesn't hurt you is my point for people who don't understand what we're advocating it's not like let a guy get knocked out well we get knocked out it's not good but when you get choked out it's almost nothing it literally is almost nothing pretty much it's it tells you you're next gonna be sore yeah for sure yeah I know Mario I've known him for a long time and it's made a mistake I and that's the thing you know referees are human they all looked it's a fuckin very hard job he probably thought chiesa went out he thought he saw here we can get take a look at it here let's let play the whole thing back from the beginning Jimmy so you can see that I can I get ok just ok good from there okay so he's get it yeah he locks it on the neck sure he's got the bloody strike no kisses fighting it peels it off and then Kevin locks the body tried trial triangle down tighter I see it yeah yeah gets that palm to palm and look at this see he's fighting it off and look he's not out at all I didn't tap what the fuck I didn't tap I think that's a bullshit stoppage and it's not much you know look Mario made a mistake but it's a bullshit stoppage 100% I can't even imagine anybody defending that stoppage there's no reason well solve it because if you don't defend your that making that stoppage he's crazy well understand that but but people don't want to didn't want to didn't want to accept any blame swatching blame me he's in he's gotten it out yeah he's gotten it out man look people don't realize takes a lot of effort to squeeze that pom-pom particularly using a lot of muscle there's not a whole lot of it's not the same kind of leverage that you get when you do these hands kind of you know in the air but I mean you can still grab you could touch the guy's arm yeah yeah and they're they're stiff yeah he's still resisting and you'd you don't have to it's not like strikes well you have to have your hands up covering yourself like to resist it he can resist by just really flexing his neck it's not smart and tyron woodley had the best commentary on this honestly he was on that a UFC panel show here and he's like look you shouldn't he goes you shouldn't be in that position in the first place you shouldn't be defending it like that with your hands like that and you shouldn't have let that guy get his arm under your chin like that all those things are bad technique and he's dead right yeah he's dead right the whole thing is kind of crazy I mean yeah I mean it was he took a beating before that this is one of the things you don't get in the context of this as he was getting shellacked yes cuz Kevin Lee had his back and while he had his back see if he can find that I mean I can see that he's cut oh he's been bleeding he's back and he was beating the fuck out of him from behind with his back just bang bang bang while he's back riding him he'd beat the shit out of him before that so he's probably stunned and you know I'm also of the sort that sees guys that are getting hit and the four-point position turtle position you know guys are swinging on them and they've got their arms up and they're covered often a lot of times I just keep let it go okay you're not getting through but wrestle see like oh it looks bad we're stopping it's like but he's not really getting hit I agree with you 100% I think there's been many fights where fights were stopped quick when a guy was covered up where there's nothing else you could do cover up what else is he gonna do yeah guys swinging on him but he can't can't land a successful so the only reason that guy is flurrying so hard really I mean well not the only but the main reason is probably because he thinks the reps gonna stop it exactly on that he wouldn't put that kind of effort into it unless he's just completely losing his shit mean like he's not thinking about it which could come back to haunt him like I've seen a lot of times the old old school fights guys even in mouth just try unload on a guy and the guy survives it reverses it and eventually he gets his and it's done you know Arwen Brock Lesnar yeah perfect example yeah Shane Carwin beat the fucking shit out of Brock Lesnar for a full round got on top of them full mount yep dropping bombs on them yeah somehow or another Brock Lesnar survives take Shane down the SAC around submit some quick yep it happens you gotta let fights play out but I think in that situation it's easy there's no argument for stopping the fight because it's not like strikes like there could be an argument where Brock Lesnar is on the bottom and he's not moving enough and maybe some people a little bit more cautious might stop that fight but there's no argument to stop that I don't think that the fight should have been stopped yes it needs to do a better job of not letting guys get under his chin yeah what do you do about that if you're the commissioner if you're the king of the world do your commissioner you I don't know I kind of feel like you have to keep him given the win it's hard to reverse up like that it's a mistake that the referee fucked up for sure he stopped the fight but he stopped the fight based on a this is where I'm gonna go against myself a very advantageous position that was as close to finalizing and finishing as you can discern where guys no longer defending with his hands he's hanging that mean I think Mario fucked up cuz he didn't let it get to ten but he'd let it get to nine it got to nine yeah yeah that's the thing too he was so locked into that joke can't take his victory away I feel like you can't take Kevin Lee's victory away me too it's just no good there's no good that comes of ass not good but give them an immediate rematch I think that's the move that's yeah I could see that if their but here's the thing you know this is price fighting right is there the interest all right anything to make it happen I think then make it happen cuz you mention the promoters gotta make money on it yeah I think that's a good fight to have in Detroit because I think they're gonna do a UFC in Detroit I heard I'm scheduled to do a UFC isn't Detroit having a UFC basically every night I think it's different it's like it's more like a battle cade old school chum already just hanging around hey alright so sexy this is sexy choke he's riding him like no idea oh I I have party with John Peretti that is I love John Brady's commentary oh it's how it's nice enjoy him it's fantastic I mean and you know him he brought a lot of really good fighters to the world of him he did he had a great eye for picking talent he's the guy the fine found Andrei Arlovski he tours in novi every Mario Maurice Smith Maurice Smith yeah Matt Hume yeah well I was gonna bring up Sakuraba like when Sakuraba fought Conan in the UFC those the first time we saw Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt gets submitted right we're like hole we thought they were invulnerable well and up to that and the fight before that he Clips sock Rob with a good shot Sakuraba drops in on a single and then Big John accident would stop the fight right but then they let him fight again yes which is the craziest fucking thing ever like they would never do that no never that's crazy I forgot about that that is a very very I know that very night Randy Couture beat Murray Smith for the UFC heavyweight title and as his tights got torn so you could see his is like speedos underneath that Randy was wearing when Frank Shamrock also beat Kevin Jackson yep armbar it's been like 20 seconds with shoes on yep yeah old-school man I loved it that was the first year that's when I quit I quit of that UFC I'm like I'm not going to Japan that's why I quit the back in the old days when the post fight interview did we do one back in the day on the unlike the graffiti brick wall yeah we did something man yeah yeah that was you know what when you won the title I was there but I wasn't working for the UFC I was just watching and that was back when I was just friends with Dana and I was uh I was just going to the events and enjoying them I watched you fight Randy from like I think I was like six feet away I think I was like front row back in the day Josh Barnett back in the fucking baby-faced assassin with less stars and a lot less gray hair dude I remember you fighting in Hawaii yep SuperBrawl yeah Dan Severn and that eight-man tournament that I won that had all those dudes in Abu Dhabi champion Rico Rodriguez and John Marsh Travis Fulton I think he only had like a hundred and fifteen fights at that point how much does Travis have now doesn't have like three hundred five I don't know something insane Jeremy horn I always thought was insane cuz he had like 150 and then you find out about Travis dance everyone's got like a hundred does he yeah like a hundred victories or he's still fighting I don't think so you've been doing a little bit of pro wrestling but no fighting he had a very gray blue line between fighting and Pro Wrestling to put it charitably there was like some there was a couple that people had called it into question a couple of takata's in there hmm yeah well it's amazing that he kept it up as long as he did but that was because of his solid wrestling you know real serious competitor ya know he had that competition streak that would allow him to continue to drive and and perform like that but as he got older you know the wrong matchups could be a guy he'd never even heard of and it's like oh shit Dan Severn just got shellacked yeah well when you look back at your initial fights in in MMA like in SuperBrawl and then entering into the UFC which is like when was your first right knee what year uh 2001 yeah see that was when our mm not working with them yet that was when I was usually 28 yeah gamm McGee then UFC 30 was Peter his Oh 32 as some shell 34 was Bobby Hoffman 30s you fought Pedro Hisle when Pedro his it was Pedro his oh yeah do that we showed a clip yesterday if Pedro his old leg kicking some guy and making him fly through the air some journalist holds the pad on his leg and Pedro leg kicks him and the guy's legs literally go upside down where his legs are above his head goes flying he's such a cool dude man it's just like seeing him over all over all the years training at his gym in in Brazil when I was down there he can pick me up picked up me and my action we we went out there trained with this guy master late thou who is one of the was this before after your second fight after our second fight oh wow yeah we were down there me and my ex and and we're down there to help corner Shaina and her last fight in the UFC it was in Brazil against a new and while we're down there it's like hey I still want to get in training and I want training with all the loot le Verrier like catched arrived guys that I can and so yeah what we trained with master lay tile for a while and Pedro's let us use his gym and we would sit there and talking to him you know one of the things about Pedro I go he he taught me how to throw the counter right hand even better than that I'd ever known and that pivot step and they hit it from the other angle because he knocked me the fuck out with it and it was so beautiful in the replay like oh I need to learn that I learned that that's - and Pedro just laugh about it and goes oh well you know you got me a go who gives a shit man we were too busy having fun would you caught him on the left hook right I caught him with a counter right hand did you over his jab and I saw him stumble a little bit and I charged forward and then with a running left hook yeah because I saw the window of opportunity to get to get in there I'd already stunned him and so to a degree I'm like thanks Pedro thank you he have the hardest leg kicks you've ever felt cro cop cro cop really yeah wow that's crazy well I would I would imagine I mean if anybody it's just a cro cop story so it's me and Mirko and Eric Paulson and we're training in Vegas I think that I don't know if I was doing commentary on that show if I was fighting hobble not sulla either way we're training at this gym in Vegas and miracle came out so we're rolling around and training together and have a good time and and I think I was fighting and so on Paulson's holding pads for me and miracles like ah do this with your left hook and said alright how about now it's not it no no here let me show you here you hold the pad so Paulson's got this full-on typepad leather tie pad and he's holding it for Mirko right look since you know we're talking lead hook essentially right so America was like no I want you to do this you know you you're doing it like X so I need you to do it like this so watch uh-huh and he hits this heat'll right hooks this pad this TypePad it goes it tears the straps off of Paulson's arm and it goes flying across the room and hits the wall and bounces off the wall and falls on the fucking ground and everyone's just like and Paulson's just his hand is still like this he looks at me and he looks at America and America yeah and I just everybody's just it's just silence Wham flap but I am I sweat see I I took that that that's what I was getting hit with and I still managed to stay on my feet cuz I'm an idiot yeah that's what I was thinking how the fuck this guy's just at his best it's just absolute pure explosive power just just destruction yeah well you know Bob saps eyeball hey one fight remember that yeah dude he'd crush people with with those high kicks his middle kick was so dangerous to me as middle as locate were the most dangerous because I felt like you could you could you could see you could more read the high kick but if you read the high kick or if you were to to to set up to defend the high kick if he ripped you in your body that's your ribs we chopped egg Heath Herring versus cro cop or crow cops kicking him in the body and crow cops shin is like halfway to his spine I think he was only one kick - yeah one kick and it was a boom but it's when you see the penetration of that cake you realize like that's insane and he had a Taekwondo background that helped him to but you know a guy like that you could've gave him fuckin he could've had him doing anything and he's just gonna be released you know he are just such ferocious ferocious explosive power remember his stare down with Vandelay probably the best stare down of all time first time Vanderley got out stared you know he's Wanderlei it's like doing the crazy eyes and mirko's just staring out i'm like a fucking evil predator the two of them look at each other I'm like I gotta give that one to cro cop I can't believe this well think about cro cop cop look at that kick oh fuck Jesus Christ I mean that is deep into his body and the right right where his liver is that's a insane power kick that's that left leg yep and he was the first one a flatline Vandelay to remember that when he had kicked vandala yeah because I was I was watching that fight because my next because I was gonna go fight Nogueira after that so I'm sitting here hoping that these guys beat the shit out of each other and he goes out there and just fucking crushes them so now I'm just sitting think god damn it that dude spent two minutes of beating the hell out of this guy and now I gotta go out and fight Nogueira how crazy is the chin on Mark Hunt he gets fucking head kick full-on he goes down and gets right back up oh it was a novia here's the Vandal a one climb yeah ridiculous speed and power and because of the fact that he had that traditional martial arts background he didn't step before he threw that kick a lot of times he just threw it and you didn't see it coming that one just goes over the top of the glove and that's right leg yeah that's right Lake Hospital left like so much old body ya done dude now in that fight I remember he hit Mark Hunt with it a couple times yeah just well he dropped him with it in one of the fights and k1 k1 fight yeah not not in the in the MMA fight Mark Hunt actually won that one yeah oh well that was Minotauro - yeah on the chin that doesn't know Darwin no wait Waterman Broadwater Blanc boink Minotauro was one of those guys it was almost like too tough for his own good when he was younger well that's why whoo axe kick that's why when he got towards the end of his career he was just getting knocked out left and right yeah and he had taken he had lived on his chin for so long that he could no longer take a shot yeah anymore and that's honestly it's not that uncommon ooh we didn't need is he got a core easy highlight reel you forget sometimes how insane the highlight reel of Mirko Cro Cop is well people in the Alexander people in the UFC never really saw they didn't see this guy know you know what I mean no he was in Pride well I still maintain to this day that like pride was some of the most exciting and spectacular fights in the early days of MMA by far there were some insane matchups and especially because it was a big percentage of it was the heavyweight division was a huge percentage of what and the stage that they set for us to compete on wasn't rousing people's like talent Super Arena oh it was fighting in front of I mean I was fighting in front of here like 40,000 people every time I went out there wish it could have maintained I think I was a fan of it when when I was even working for the UFC I was always a big pride fan I'm like look this room for everybody of course you know interesting is there people that were by having pride it opened up eyes I would always say like having another company with a different flavor maybe it'll draw in other other fans that would maybe necessarily be a fan of the UFC but they like the way that pride did it and so that would get them interested in MMA and therefore then they might also okay well maybe I will give this UFC stuff a try maybe well I like this one fighter so I'll watch when he's on you know it's just yeah it expands the market it doesn't diminish it I think that's the same thing with Bellator yeah I really do I mean I think that what what's good about Bellator is that they're developing real world-class talent now Michael Chandler you know Michael venom page now Rory's over there there's world-class talent there it's true and you know you had Mitrione fight fyodor which you know crazy math you had double knock down that was now gets up first it's crazy crazy thing you can't can't plan for so a guy like phaidor when you see him at this stage of his life and you see him getting Kayode again what what are your thoughts on that you watch it sucks to see that that's the case I mean I love Matt Mitrione two men he's if he's a great dude I trained him when I can and I see him you know get that victory it's a massive victory as was i but i'm a friend and i have been a friend of yours for such a long time it's it's it sucks to see him not doing well you even saying his name right it's a big commitment yeah it's like everybody else has phaidor yeah fancy on us right like dos is key it's shorter yes not fade or well what does everybody say instead of Dostoevsky D was the correct pronunciation dos dos cesky Dostoevsky Dostoevsky it's all those tits isn't a weird how languages like developed like the totally different kind of sounds like you know English a certain sound sure Russian has these like very specific noises that you have to and then you go to like tonal languages like Thai or Vietnamese oh man or Chinese yeah crazy so interesting you know and I Steve Rinella again was here and he had been in Guiana and they had these interviews they did with these local people that were speaking in their native tongue and it's like this really strange ancient language doesn't sound like anything else it's really cool to hear it's like wow you this might be like what Mayans sounded la ha yeah really freaky well when I was in Romania they were something some of that I don't know I don't know the truth on this stuff I haven't done the research so it up to your listeners to go follow up that they were saying the remainings has said that they have found texts and and and archaeological findings that would show a language that was not a Romance language that still possessed words that existed in modern day Romanian and that the idea that perhaps that wrote the Romanian language was older than Latin whoa but they also had the also went to the palace of live the Impaler and in the middle of Bucharest which was awesome Wow you got to see that guy's house yeah yeah it's all dug underground and certain is so that you know to keep it cool for people who knew Vlad the Impaler was he was a guy who literally put put people on sticks and then eat in front of them he would stick sticks through their assholes out there the one strikes out their mouth and then have them all lined up around him while he sat down and ate he also took the the merchants or the these guys that he felt had been cheating and scamming the warlockian the area that he was in in Romania well akia they're the people and really getting super rich off their backs in a way that they you know didn't have an option and so he went and grabbed their them in their kit there and would have them build they were building the steps up to this to his to this castle or whatever and if that if the dad died they would just take the kid and put him in his place it's like this is gonna get until this is completely done you know your debt still exists whoa Jesus Christ little dude brutal times that's the guy that Mary Shelley bitten all that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Mary Shelley's Frankenstein but bucks his name we wrote Bram Stoker Bram Stoker yeah kind of based it a lot of some of that yeah well and also like this trigga which is a undead creature in romania yeah which is actually a really pretty funny romanian movie called Strigoi which is like a it's a comedy horror thing really yeah yeah yeah that's the name they use in that TV show to the strain oh really yeah steady boy yeah these that term a lot haha have you seen that moat that show no I don't have cable or anything like that I fact since I moved out I haven't into my own place I hadn't had time to really set up my TV and all that kind of shit so you just live in like a wild person kind of yeah email though right I have email I have internet I have my laptop so I'm watching Netflix like on the laptop still watch like documentaries or something I don't you don't I'm always out and about I just got back from Seattle I was in Vegas helping Travis and it was my fighter show Hey then I had to go to the fights for my guys show hay and AJ they both fought on that night corner them shit when I was I went to Japan and pro wrestled in June but I was also there again in March she just a rambling man basically after the dissolution of all that I had been putting all my efforts into for four years we got past that right move right but this was this was very therapeutic well all right no matter what you know don't have a lot anymore we're not we're not go we're just saying that that you know it's just like moving into you know I had all these things that I was trying to accomplish and so it's just like alright well I since I'm not putting energies in these areas then I'm gonna take those that energy and put it somewhere else I'm gonna make make use of it that's good don't suppress and sit around get bummed out at life no one send your own advice there's lots of shit to get bummed out about not even be beyond even that thing that we're not talking about doing your podcast I wish I hate to say it but Fox really dropped the ball big time on it and the people that were working on the podcast just completely shit the bed to the point of like I had Renato and Scotty Epstein on and we're sitting there 15 minutes before we're gonna go on just chatting whatever and then it's like alright guys we're gonna go we're gonna film now alright three two all right boom do our thing nobody even pays attention to look at the front of the footage and cut it from what's not supposed to be aired and then they just throw it up there raw still Rahsaan cannot throw is being rasaan and doing our stuff and then I get this email or something dude what the fuck dude you know I do a character and they go what are you talking about I go look I didn't edit it didn't edit it oh and there were stuff like hey I know you're gonna be on vacation but I'm gonna do a on location interview with this Benko tour I'm gonna get it all I'll get all the NP I'll just send it to you can someone edit it oh I'm off on vacation I can't help to put there's fucking nobody there there's zero there's no one so then I had to go and reach out to another friend be like hey man you have some time to fucking chop this up for me and just make a few edits yeah yeah I can do that and then you know put that up and then it was another thing like okay well hey guys if I'm gonna do this podcast I want to have music in it I want to have bands that I know and love and whatever I want to play there have rights for their music that's a nightmare right well so I said do you have some legal forms that we can put together some boiler plates that we can do and have this happen oh we don't need that you don't need that it's not being okay so I go and I get the management the artist everybody's on boards this person that said that this is okay this guy's a young guy worked there there was not know anything like a tech guy I there were these two dudes there's one guy that was like he was a part of the head of the division or whatever in there and there was another dude it was a producer of sorts who I got along with great but when it came to getting it all done obviously fucking it didn't work but the guy that was above him was unable to take blame for anything and and own up to any like fuck-ups and so it wasn't like I was asking for much from him I'm just like we'll tell me what we're dealing with here so I can know how to appropriately you know react and then you know getting this this whole okay about musics all right so I go and I do all the legwork get everybody to agree have my guest on we play some music to start it off we played music you know while they're there while he's there I'm being an asshole moshing around the room having fun you're joking around and then I watched the video of it and it's like silence the fuck I look I'm just stomping around a room to silence what the hell is going on oh yeah legal wouldn't clear the music cool and why the fuck are we dealing with this now when I asked you before we even did podcast one the before we ended the first episode why did we not get that out of the way because you told me we didn't need it's just like shit like that and so we're now like look we're not even doing it for money right now we're just doing it to just to establish a relationship and this is already gone sour stop it why do you why are you doing it with a person was that a network what you doing because they came to me you could do it on your own they came to me listen all you need is that phone right there and a fucking microphone that plugs into it it's like I use this one for a podcast that I did recently this is not an endorsement I'm just anybody it's simple this microphone right here no endorsement I have to say the name of it but okay it's a blue all right okay this microphone works on a cord that plugs directly into your phone yeah set that bitch up like that you stick this in bang stick that in your phone press record it's that simple and I've done actual podcasts that millions of people listen to with this thing that sits in my hand I closed that bitch up like that put it back in this little bag stick it in my laptop take it anywhere you go it's it works on USB uh-huh it takes no energy super easy to do and then you just have to upload that somewhere and you could at you could figure out how to edit simple stuff like that audio sure you're not talking about like making records you know a simple audio file and I hear you there I also realized that you know for me doing a podcast mean meta had to be like the amount of effort I was gonna put into it was gonna be equal to the kind of product I wanted so I started yeah but don't get confused about this right no I hear you they're like this is very they're the effort is in your mind and in your thoughts and what you're trying to put out there and that's you're really good at that that's what I'm saying that you don't need some network you just need an account with like libsyn or one of these podcast host they upload it to iTunes that's it you're done you know people find out about they like it they get addicted to it they start downloading it more and more you know I mean you're really good at this to get connected to something like Fox and have someone who's non motivated sure well they could they came to me and it sounded like alright well we could probably monetize this in some way and it was just during the fighter in the kid days early early yeah see they thought that they were doing something and then now they've completely changed their tune they've decided to the only people that they're investing their time and now are people they have exclusive relationships with there are their thoughts about the fighter and the kid were and Brendan shared them with me some article that they were talking about him in where the fighter and the kid they feel like rode on the Fox name and then became really popular and then made it it's a delusional perspective sure I mean they don't understand what happened what happened is there's an entertaining show and two guys are really good and then another entertaining show like mine has them on and then millions of people find out about it and when they go on other entertaining shows like whether it is fucking jason Ellis or whether it's whatever they're doing yeah and then this build-up the same thing that happened to Tom Segura and christina pazsitzky and Bert Kreischer and all these popular podcasts people find out about them and sure it has nothing to do with Fox zero right so they did their host at the end of the day I mean Fox isn't the one creating the content Fox is the one that has the ID is Fox into one crack in the joke Zack telling the stories or hurt doesn't hurt being connected to Fox not it's definitely legitimate right and I even said stuff like hey I want to have whatever I want on this podcast no problem I go no no I want to have whatever I want on this pot I want to talk about anything no problem there is no so pussy farts with Josh porn pussy farts with Josh Barnett if that's uh you know where we wanted to go with it but one of the things I said only go hey I want to talk about that fucking insane Nazi occult division I want to talk about all that crazy shit that they did and I found this guy who's an expert and we could talk about all the weird stuff occult division yeah they had an occult division a the Nazis oh okay you said extreme Nazi no no no no I said the extreme crazy share of the Nazi occult division how they would go around trying to find the spear of destiny or the Ark of the Covenant right I mean that's why we have Raiders of the Lost Ark and all the really cool movies would you have on did it because I go I'm gonna bring this guy on to talk about this stuff and they're like can't have Nazis on like I don't know no I'm not I don't worry I'm not talking about Nazis I'm not this isn't he a hot guy she's like you couldn't have a history professor maybe wrote a book on Hitler come on and talk about Nazis oh yeah you don't need them Zack this was years ago and so after that was like all this stuff was was was adding up like fuck and this sucks it's not even their fault man they're stuck in this old way and they think this old which works for television shows their old way works great for television show they control the advertising they secure the town was Fox itself I don't know if like the Machine Fox was really paying that much attention I think it was really just the main dude who was above who was in charge of this shit who was fucking it up and didn't want to put the effort in and didn't want to you know and it got the noise from the last the last podcast I did they didn't even put the video portion up it took them weeks to but it's just like wow okay I guess you don't have any contract with them none and everything on your own yeah I could I could still people still have episode we'd like you you know we'd love it if you do a podcast again I'm do it just do it dude you're really good at this it's easy easy for you people can get mad at me like goddamn it Joe Rogan you always try to get people to do podcast I would listen to your podcast if you had a podcast I'd listen to it I have I have lots of things to talk about I do like to talk to a broad variety of people I love from the fact that you're bringing on guys Jordan Peterson or Sam Harris or God's odd you know interesting guys to talk about interesting stuff I'm sure possible getting into scraps of crowder over here which I'm like that's hilarious yeah I like Crowder I mean see him is like an aggregator aggravator just kind of like like Milo like Milo might say something interesting but then he's couch all this stuff and trying to like create shit with people because it's part of how they get a lot of attention in popularity but I think he puts out funny stuff too man he he did some funny things where he he's done a bunch of like funny sketches where he goes undercover as different people is this like a communist French character that he goes undercover as and no no Crowder does crowder there's a lot of funny shit people that get mad at me for saying that he's funny I think he's funny I think he does funny shit he's he's done some really hilarious social justice warrior things where he showed up at like some well he definitely dressed as a trans person for a while was trying to like push the boundaries of what what like when can you decide that your transition how do you know whether or not someone has decided that they're transitioning or whether or not they're hoaxing you know like who are you to say with that I'm not really trans like so you went to like one of those all women's gyms and said that he was trans and then they let him in at first and then after a while they like what the fuck yeah I'm they kicked him out I don't think it was an all woman's gym in fact I think he just went to a gym that said they accept trans Jerell and then when he went in he wanted to a shower in the women's room but he was like you know I had like a fucking five o'clock shadow right it's the sincerity of it is almost what that comes down to like well you're not sincere about being trans so as that would have come to its but he's pointing out like how crazy these lines are and like where are they whether not you agree that people should be able to do whatever they want to which I do maybe there is a real hysteria involved in this there's something very odd about these arbitrary lines well we decide we had a guy that we were watching a videotape yesterday that identifies as a six year old girl oh the German guy no he's is he German he's definitely foreign right it was all in sometimes there were you had a wife and kids and all that and then he's like I'm a six-year-old girl like what the fuck but you have to include that so then it's because then it gets too well can you be transracial can you be like Rachel Dolezal is that okay right can you I don't know why not look everybody came from Africa originally if you identify more with African Americans than you do as I say polish Americans why not that I don't well Ben Shapiro has argued that that's less preposterous than changing your gender and then you like why can't you do that if you can change your gender like why wouldn't appear oh he's an interesting one because I like how hardcore and how like straight to the point he brings great argument very smart I can tell that he's that dude that just fucking he just he doesn't hardly get along probably with anyone he just got laid aside well one of those those personalities is just not good at socializing in any way like he's it's very rigid very smart yeah he seems like a toad a little prick yeah but an alright dude in his own way I guess and you know what's funny is it's I I always talk to people about left left his immerses right isn't like well you know it's pretty easy most the time to look at the right when they're being idiotic because it's so preposterous like you know theologically based arguments or you know if you're going to I mean that's really what it comes to stuff like that or like how they will take this whole stance of like no you just you get what you can get but if you fucking fuck up fuck you you know like these really extreme conservative arguments usually just are like well that's non compassion right yeah I know you know it's both but then you go to the left and it's like everything is couched in this like oh no no no no we're good this is all for the good look at how nice we're being like well you're just as fascist as this other guy but you you couch it into a under a different thing you do things like use postmodernist philosophical arguments to then take the word racism and redefine it so then it works for your benefit and that only works against black rival it doesn't work against white people white people yeah people get weird with their arguments and it ultimately becomes about control sure of course in its length or power it's creating power for a person to to affect that against someone else is in creating or it's also creating moral high-ground yeah so you can feel as if that you're in the right to say this or that and because you are supported by all these other people around you yeah I tried about I'm trying to balance it out I should say but people get mad at me when I have too many right-wing people on in a row they start thinking oh I've been accused of being like FoxNews Mike come on man I have lefties on all the time just not paying attention whether it's Julie Kedzie or Abby Martin or what is it Pete Holmes is a super super lefty Judd Apatow is a super lefty he was on last week I try to have as many left he's on as possible but they don't get mad at that they only get mad when I have like super righties on when I have super righties on then they're like oh your shows like Fox News like well culturally you know it's just like well we could this this this argument we'll listen to but not this one all right but at the end of the day what really sucks is that when it came to you know I was in such a I had gotten so into politics because of my living situation I as I'm looking at all this stuff trying to understand the currents of what's going on I'd find I'd have to go read like the most crazy leftist stuff and then I'd have to go find some gnarly alt-right garbage and have to go there and read all these preposterous arguments racist shitty arguments on both sides just ridiculous stuff to them because even amongst some crazy racist or some some crazy you know communist either way there's gonna be some truth there that they figure is useful to their argument that may be different from the other but it still doesn't change it from being true it's like you can't the truth doesn't change from place to place you can't so you can't change it anymore and you can salt salt said by Cormac McCarthy mmm and it's like well I have to now go outside of this because I can't find anyone new source is going to be completely honest with me so then I have to look in all these places and then try to piece this whole story together based on what truth I can find and honestly it got to be so tiring and reading just crazy shit on each side and having to it's just like well some of this stuff is just so fucking fucked up and it's not like I needed a trigger warning or something like that but it's just it just gets tiring it didn't also think like people coming up with like racial IQ things trying to create some some idea there - my fuck man this is people believe this it's like trying to to navigate flat earth shit and stuff like that and go come on III hear it the first time I read I'm like okay whatever you just don't get it but then when I see that there's even some small amount of traction it's just fucking disappointed it's very disappointing yeah well it's too easy to get by today and there's a lot of dummies that have gotten that's right that's one of my arguments is that this is a softest easiest fucking way of living we've ever had now I understand there are difficulties but aren't difficult even our poor are still more wealthy than like the 90% of the world or something like that it's crazy yeah if you make more than thirty four thousand dollars a year you were in the top 1% of the world yeah and we don't we don't see it that way no you know we're too busy thinking about what we don't have or what we should have or what how we deserve more than this person or that person or how you know you know if you want to argue about the difficulty it is to buy a home nowadays I'm totally willing to listen if you want to argue about the the shady aspects of banks I'm there with you you know what I mean yeah but if you just want to start trying to cut me down into some specific class and minimal and to minimize me and then devalue my opinion or Who I am it's like I'm not gonna I understand the the biological potential for tribalism and the fear of the thing that is the unknown being maybe too much of a risk so if you look at wild animals they don't really get into fights all that much if they can help it because the risk of being injured maimed or dead potentially is just too much so most the time they get in their little scraps and they disperse right and if you're a full-on alpha normally don't get into any fucking fights whatsoever it's the beta is always trying to like Peck their way up and maybe eventually find an alpha that's that they might perceive having a weakness but once they finally get to that point that they're gonna really fucking full-on fight it means everything because everything is at risk well you know you look at some cave people it's probably the same way the first time you know one group sees someone that looks completely different from them they're like oh what the fuck is that can I risk it is it gonna destroy my community is it gonna be damaging to you know it's like caveman shit because they don't understand until somebody creates an understanding so I but it's very hard for people to accept other people's ideas of course your ideas are different and then there are you want their ideas to align with yours and in the case what we're talking about with a lot of these people they're trying to enforce right ideas on other people you will now obey and go along with my standards of behavior and thought it's insecurity and it's fear yeah and but to me I'm like okay I can understand that on that base element but we have the ability to overcome that to be greater than that to be better than that to not to not sit there and and value people on all these the surface level shit you know I mean you can you could stereotype things all you want and be like oh well this looks like a duck and quacks like a duck and this looks like a goosing cause like whatever fine but if you try to continue to keep people in these places you're you're diminishing who they are you're also you're creating this this element of prejudice you're creating those barriers for for that - not for that interaction to not happen you're the one that that's helping create that that tribalistic element and so as you continue to widdle these people down to more and more groups but you know with them that now when you couch that in with this neo-marxist elements it's like well now you need the more tiny or the group you get the more you get to be oppressed the more you're a victim of something and so yeah and if you it's a good market share and being a victim we got to get out of here man I gotta end this Josh Barnett so what's the future right now no fight scheduled no fight actually I'm still dealing with my you sada stuff we have to my understanding my management's saying is that you sada - completely satisfied with understanding that that this supplement that I took was tainted and they even went out and after they tested the one that I gave them they went out and bought a whole brand new bottle unopened tested that one again laced with the same shit and they had already you know they'd tested me not even that that much in between are they testing me in-between layer there was barely any time in between tests anyways so my managers telling me that the guy at the lab is going well this is such a negligible amount that it looks like you've been the the whatever you took was tainted in the first place so because there's no reason why a guy your size would even bother to have such a negligible amount of whatever the shit is in your system and I'm like especially since to explain that between the last test and this test yes there's you at it would be such a small amount right that there's no way that you were on something and you cycled off exactly it didn't make it they have you suspended tell I don't know the thing is is that we've gone through I've spent like two grand having supplements tested because I would keep bits of everything that I would take just in case and keep them around and Christ well you know and I this was a brand I'd taken before this was a supplement that had been an ingredient other stuff I've never had a
