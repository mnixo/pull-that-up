the Joe Rogan experience well you can learn the fundamentals the right way to hit a ball learning how to do things with a ball bearing Hannah move the ball correctly leg shot like this most people have no idea where well I'm gonna catch one from there to the four ball so I want to get on here so you have to hit the 4 ball the four balls next oh shit after three after three I got to get into position for the floor so I hit it flat so it slides out I owe geometry it's all about you don't want to be over here you want to be able to hear because the natural progression is here to slide down here for this ball so when I hit this ball and now wave it on you're gonna hit that paint ball into that pocket yes so now I'm not thinking about that that's easy what's important is getting in a good position for this ball and just speaking you've got to hit that ball there right there around there right why I have to hit it exactly right here because that's the only way you're gonna make it if you draw a line to where the ball where well there's a lot of it's instinctive because I understand where the contact point is and I'm gonna hit it with which was left hand English wanna spin okay yeah what the fuck is that see how the Sharks like to perform I'll post right now what you're gonna do now I'm gonna pocket that again this is really awesome this yep talk about in that corner that that's that feels like it's no that goes right by but the most important thing is getting out here it's about getting out here for the side pocket because this is what's important but not just here the down we can't be up table because then you got to do all this you want to hit that white ball you want to get a position where where do you want a second ball so I want to make sure that I have an angle in the seven ball so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit it low and just slide nauseous so now from here this is pretty easy my only concern is I don't get stuck behind the 10th off I get stuck behind the 10 ball then I don't have a shot at the 8th so I want to play towards the danger zone which is like this side rail so I don't want to I don't want to scratch but I don't like it stuck behind the 10th see how close I am myself I can't see it I was worried about that I really wanted to land like right here perfect but see like that kind of position that takes fucking years to learn how to do to learn how how hard you're supposed to be hitting the ball to make it react like that if you don't have that kind of pinpoint precision the ability to so frozen one like to tales of conversation to the best guys can build ten tenten yeah especially in practice when there's no money on the line there's just nothing there just having a good time and they can run fucking terrorizing crazy shit I've run for broken run for rocks in the run of nine ball which is way harder than a blow well night no nine ball is is a rotation then eight ball you have a bunch of different choices you can choose to shoot you know any color or a solid or any strike rather a solid but whereas in nine ball you're playing the rotation so every shot there's no options no no your nine ball is you're shooting the balls one through nine one two three four five six seven eight nine you get the nine you win whereas with eight ball you're either solids or stripes you get a lot more options you can take your shots still it doesn't even fit two balls in out this is a very very tight table so this is a protein much more it's more tighten up rotatable practice time yeah well it's like a table for people that you know any bullshit you don't want to waltz up bobble in you know if you look amazing you didn't pick up golf you would have never scare us careful that's not too many people so I'm too many people just picked us golf and then became fucking nuts yeah they would just play all day and it takes too much you got damn time yeah like you could go play pool for an hour you can't play golf for an hour playing golf you're playing all day yeah it's like that shit so we'll do the top pool guy make it that is a problem dog shit right even though the number one no one got in the world like make a quarter bunny bucks and there's not that much those guys travel that they lost whatever like remaining respect I happen and I lost when they published this [Music] justification for drones are working they than other forms of warfare and it read like a PR piece is like to paint like which defense contractor paid for this bullshit because it's just totally demented what's the source of the motivation to do a story you know after you hear about amber Lyons experience of seeing how much singing on television and reading in the newspaper is filtered through propaganda probably quite a bit yeah I was watching part of the Kimmel last night yeah Johnny Depp on so think about how that format is just that's what most people are consuming and it's so weird if you have somebody there for five or six minutes they don't share anything that's important like you never see even though I think it was the best way by those I do too you never see like so funny what's the meaning of life like what I try to do it it's like meaningless bullshit that I've already forgotten Brian he flies back to South France or wherever he's from that's it like yeah that's to promote his new movie and you don't learn anything more about what he believes about the world or politics that's a good points like the whole format was created before the much better format that we have now yeah and then the whole commercials we'll be right back where are you going you got on right there fucking talk to him like everyone knows a conversation sort of ramps up like you know conversate you sit down and then you get loose and after a while then you start really it has a flow to it and that flow is completely interrupted if you start doing a commercial every 7 minutes whatever it is we'll go with that format Kimmel does a great job because you can tell me he's really smart really that's the feeling I get maybe that's just his personality but it's like you can go a lot further you can push things further you don't have to and you don't mean it's the fucking Tonight Show I mean I know he's not Jay Leno but it's still it's a nice show yeah the people watching it now we have no problem watching it on YouTube the next day yeah but doing all these things for this hypothetical old lady in the Midwest I think you're right in some ways but the bottom line is there are revenues directly related to their the ratings and so thinking that OH most people going to watch on YouTube that doesn't translate financially yeah still that's the main motivation is still fine Automation they don't look they look at those numbers were fuck will calm they they have fuckin detailed by the minute analysis breakdown when Kimmel started talking about tomatoes people don't care about Tomatoes don't talk about Tomatoes yeah look we dropped off 1% you know when you turn you know they they have that they have like these number bean counter dudes to really concerned about they do yeah well even some of the big YouTube channels and friends with the guy the video doesn't do as well as they expected and that rarely happens because they know so well and their audience wants at this point what kind of videos do they make we do like news entertainment two minute long clips but two minute long toes [Music]
