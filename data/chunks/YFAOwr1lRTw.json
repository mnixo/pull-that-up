to go off yeah crazy shit everybody's so goddamn scared of repercussions of being protested I mean everybody's being hashtag called out I know and it's just like it immobilizes people it's like that's why I like uh season to this season of stranger things you watching that mm-hmm I like I like hopper like the cop cuz he'll get pissed and be like sorry it's because I just care so damn much you could do that shit in the 80s that is marijuana in 31 days oh that's nice how's it feel it's good to be back it feels good I missed it I tell you what though I enjoyed being sober not that I needed to be sober not like I was a junkie with the problem but it's nice to take a reset I'm gonna do it every year I'm gonna do sober October every year there you heard it's good so give yourselves up ladies and gentlemen eleven months from now join on in maybe you own maybe you own Walt yeah what do you think no I'm in man let's do it I'll do sober october cuz this year i I just hit my foot with an axe you're such a you so are living in the boonies man I don't know anybody in LA that could tell me that where I wouldn't call the police and say I don't know why the fuck he's swinging an axe well yeah cuz my brother does tree work so I usually wear the good boots you know right but I we fire we have fires every every night and I really like like a tinkering to make the fire good and then I you know crack some beers and then my family hangs out and then they go inside and I crack more beers and I had to chop some more wood and I didn't put on the good boots and my axe just careened off off it and hit me in the foot so and I didn't I didn't have time to get stitches so I just put a maxi pad on it and it worked how big was the cut it's pretty legit they say you should use whenever possible if you can't get anywhere you could use Krazy Glue I never try that but I know a lot of people who have and I know fighters who have gotten cut in camp and just used Krazy Glue crazy glued up the cut and then made it to the fight I didn't let anybody know that they had a pre-existing injury those guys are hard as nails there's a lot of them that they'll go into the Octagon with some crazy shit what is this philemon happened to him flea plays doctor with superglue Wow most people cut themselves ballet head to the emergency room but when Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist flea cut his thumb open aggressively strumming his guitar during a show he didn't have time for surgery so keeping a crafty picked up bottle superglue sealed the cut like any good shirtless rock star would hmm yeah I would do that in a heartbeat like like cuts are like wounds I'm all about just like doing shit like that it's like broken bones yeah that's when I know I gotta set it or so yeah that seems like a flee move he seems like a psycho yeah he pulled it out of his sock aiya I remember they did an article once he was talking about is how important is pre performance shits are and I was like yeah they are important but why is everybody why are we ashamed of bowel movements why are we ashamed of potty I don't know and we should be honored to get rid of toxins Jamie and I were talking about it openly because you got some new bathrooms for the studio that have those Japanese toilets that shoot hot water up your butt oh yeah and they're warm so you sit in the toilet it's heated like right away it's a warm comforting like coming come in and chick come in and just release relax those bowels and let it go let it go it's awesome man I'm real meat and potatoes with my shits I just I get it I get out but you know if there's another level to it like what you're describing I want in sometimes I'm disturbed though after it shoots hot water up my ass for five minutes and then I use toilet paper and white it down and still I see poo Oh Mike well what the hell right I haven't had any of those yet it's been all clean everything is there like a lot of water is it like you can move it around yeah you can like five different conditions that can spread wider like shit or is it like oh it's just right it's just perfect yeah it's all over the place I forget bazaars have more than one can aim to more than one spot like with a button yeah yeah you can move it but it's the same jet right but then there's also a friendship which is obviously women but for children know where that hammer your balls you could do a ball shot I saw some dude on TV that got hit no on the internet rather a video clip of someone who the guy in front of who's catcher and the guy in front of him just barely clipped the ball and it careened perfectly into his nutsack can you see this fastball as hard as ball just target his nutsack and bang and even though it's a like an animated gift it's only a couple seconds long as soon as that ball hits the ground you see his body just giving like music precision like I played a little cross and that happens oh that's not it no oh well I should have said I should have retweeted I was being selfish with it salvage with a ball hit no sometimes I don't read tweet things even though they're good and then I go why didn't I retweet that and then I kill try go back and find them and they're just lost yeah see of replies @replies where they just get I can't here it is I think this is it yep that's it watch this see BAM I mean it doesn't get any more perfect cuz it hits side dick see if you get hit with today's cups are so much better than the cups we haven't we were kids because the cups we had if you play did you play any contests yeah Krauss so when they have to put those cups in the jockstrap those fuckers kind of floated around a little bit oh they were terrible yeah I don't even wear one half the time I came across I stopped wearing a cup because it was because I would just they would just start hurting my balls just like that little line part of it like the edge would sometimes just get above the ball and then one time I got hit by like a 90 mile an hour shot the ball goes 90 miles an hour yeah and it's just hard rubber 90 miles I do not use those things from massage they're crazy yeah you take one of those lacrosse balls you lie on your back folks if anybody if you have like back soreness and like especially if you don't want to pay someone to massage you if you can take the pain you can do it yourself yeah take a look cross ball we have those other balls they what do they may who make some row yes rogue makes them rogue athletics makes them did they're fucking awesome they're called WOD supernovas yeah Jaime goo crap one of those we got it like right outside the door do you know what that thing is do these guys can throw like 120 I they're out of their mind oh it's it's psychotic is it got the leverage of it and it's also a sport where you get super good at and then what you don't even have a fucking career totally if that guy I mean there's guys that are probably like just fucking aces at that shit but they can't go into the NL NHL or the I mean there's nothing there for nothing not there Jamie anyway so they make them I think Kelly starred invented it but they I'm sorry if that's not correct but they I know Kelly start was the one of the first guys to suggest using a lacrosse ball and you take this lacrosse ball that's the wad supernova but you can use it across ball I use one all the time I take it with me on the road cuz it's super little but you take one of those hard little fuckers and just lay it on the ground and then bridge over it yeah like a wrestling bridge just put all your weight into that lucasz ball and just roll it up and down like any kind of knot you have in your back as painful as fuck yeah man I need some backs there like that's the the the six seven back is not fun after a certain age right she starts backs are temporary they're like tires yeah those fuckers out you have to be careful and you have to do maintenance work like backs are like one of the most common things that people injure and it change their life like if you hurt your hand it sucks but it probably isn't gonna change your life like a back thing will yeah if you break your hand ever broken a hand it's weird yeah I broke my arm once I remember I was a little kid I had a cast oh my god I don't learn how to write with my left hand there really sunk in my head for strokes though if you if you're ambidextrous it lowers your chance of having a stroke really yes my my uncle is an anesthetist or anesthesiologist and he was like dude just write your name with your left hand a lot I mean he said that there's something about that that keeps the neuroplasticity better is it only writing your name there's only writing or other things as well I think it's just having the skill hand switch yeah that's funny either said because they say that that's one of the best ways to get good at a skill is to practice it with your opposite side interesting yeah like um they say that with striking that when you learn how to strike say like if you stand Orthodox means your left hand is forward I'm when I say striking I mean martial arts yeah when you stand with your left hand forward usually guys do that because they're powerful in their right hand but if they switched it like if you're a right-handed person and you put the power the backhand in the left side it comes out super awkward like to me to this day I've been doing martial arts most of my life in my left hand is just straight dog shit looks so awkward and clunky but my right hand is priests out I thought yeah for piano it's like that with uh the melody I think I try to play songs with the melodies on the left hand and it's so hard that I have to almost relearn piano mm-hmm I would imagine yeah I mean because like you're thinking in a language right you almost don't think it's all I played since I was so young and it's so fast you can't possibly think and so then like sometimes I'll forget the way like a box songs going and it's almost like that South Park with Cartman like you have to start from the beginning yeah cuz I don't know how to just jump in because I don't it's just it's just instinct I don't even know what I'm doing well you're the only are the only argument for keeping the piano onstage The Improv in Craig Robinson sometimes brings keyboards with them places that's a good point you're not really a bring a keyboard on the road guy are you if they don't have a piano no usually they provide it but every now and then they just won't they're like they just you rent one when you're in town or how do you how do you work it like The Improv some funny bones usually do that but if I'm doing like an obscure club they'll be like well it's a contract you know and uh and I don't mind because I just I usually go to like Best Buy or something and then I'll either return it or like give it to a kid or something it's funny when someone just doesn't honor our contracts I had a guy once I think for it yeah yeah I had a club once and like specifically we laid out that everyone has to have a seat you can't have standing room like in the back of this place and he was like well then you're gonna make less money I'm like that's okay because this way at least I know the show will be good like I went to see Doug Stanhope me and a couple friends and it was a place where I had to stand long time ago and I remember going oh this blows right like this isn't even half as good as sitting down it's terrible so from then on like I used to go to House of Blues those were infamous for they'd have a big seating area in the front and then to the sides that have this open bar area and you would just go on stage like talking at a bar I mean it was like people were just talking and they're moving they're standing look and you can do that by the way you can get into that Road gig mentality and go up there but it's a different thing the road gig meant hell you got to be prepared for the road gig you have to be prepared for not getting crowd consent you know and I like a lot of crowd consent where I'm like this and you got a kiss back a we can't do doggy you also have to you have to understand that there's gonna be like randoms John you want a beer you want shot todo gonna hear that you're gonna hear that in the middle of punchlines setups if there's anything that requires quiet like there's any like weird bit we have like a long pause like throw that bed out right nuance ain't gonna work but you could do it but anyway this guy he just said well I can sell more tickets this way I got there we make this work work out right sign the contracts the whole deal I get there people are standing I mean that got hundreds of people yeah how'd I go what the fuck dude and goes well you know when bla bla bla please here you know she always lets people stand in the back what does that mean we have a contract I could you know we had a contract right he just looks at me and I go come on man what the laws is excuse is like money he just looked at me he's like we're here we're doing the show this is what we did I sold extra tickets I fucked you it's like oh you motherfucker like I'm not motivated by the same shit as you man I want the audience to have a good experience you just want more cash it was still made plenty money it's we're still we're talking about the difference between like I think it was like 300 to 500 seats so 300 seats eating or you can do 500 yes to understanding yeah but they filled the whole back of this area because it a big bar area like a big long area a whole back area to it to it's mostly a place they have bands right you know so I've eaten shit with a standing only because I wasn't I didn't make the adjustment pre-show you know so in my mind I'm like I'm doing stand-up comedy and I go out there and I'm like I should be a Pink Floyd cover band tonight let's hear the wall you gotta have a different kind of energy you have like almost like a carnival barker energy yeah you know I mean like you got to get those people interested in paying attention yeah like when I was a Renaissance Fair heckler in high school that was my job like gonna in a stock and people would pay money for tomatoes at me so it's all just figuring out what someone's vulnerability was and just exploiting it and just it was carnival barking to it I was working with only the guys name was boob and he was a boob full name who Eagle I think and he was a UH just gypsies they're all gypsies and I was just trying to beat the the joust and I get big crowds because it was all about letting them win occasionally cuz you couldn't just be like oh that tomato didn't hurt you have to be like humiliated right right right even play it up right dude I get hammered and let him slap me in the face for like 20 bucks yeah 17 I drink Mead and just be out did you get hurt that way I know dude knows how to slap good well there was this one yeah levels that slap game but there's yeah like there'd be like a biker I'd be like now I'm gonna throw a rock and I'm like shit and I'd run in the cornfield ooh guys talk to some people can knock you the fuck out with a slap we used to have like just some dick that day that's true that's true that's super day like the Diaz brothers like you're like oh you're a normal guy oh you're the toughest dude in the world yeah you do not want them slapping you right especially if they know they're gonna slap you it's sounding like an instinct like in the middle you said something stupid to them they're like what I'll see if they line up but if they like line up and get ready what is this guy doing he's letting the guys slap him are they having a slap office yeah oh come on these go are pretty big on in and oh my god everyone gets knocked you know people get knocked the fuck out that guy just got Kayode cuz this guy hit him right on the jaw yeah oh wait a minute so this is the gift if that was this was first I couldn't persuade and so the second the second guy ko'd him yeah that's even more impressive he took his shot watch this oh my god that dude's out fucking cold I hope there was a mat behind him or someone to catch him is that less a drama just cuz it's the little button no it still shakes the brain yeah that's terrible like that guy's brain got jolted there his neck spun around his brain sloshed back and forth and said I'm screwed I'm gonna get all that shit when I'm alder from the tomatoes you probably will little for real ya know because my toes do you think hit you a thousand a day boo oh no didn't miss a lot that somebody was thrown I was hit hard maybe but I never got knocked out I want to talk to you about this do you think that that might have something to do with why you're impulsive you're very impulsive I think a good way I think you're hilarious but you you you say some shit online on Twitter you're fucking super impulsive I like I laugh at I'm like this dude just goes for it I don't know man I think it's just like the art of I don't know yeah there is an art to saying fucked up shit and that's one of the things I really appreciate you about you you're a very smart guy but you also appreciate the art of saying fucked up shit yeah it's one of the things that we do and there's but it doesn't get respected enough like because especially today man you are fucking dancing a fine line between razor blades and crocodiles right like who you offend today people are just super super Holley Audi and I just got a bullhorn sometimes I just felt like I don't know I just wanted I just wanted to keep comedy going man for myself I didn't want to I just think our job is to not have a line you know I try to be kind I don't want to like but at the same time it's like I have to figure our job is hyperbole like we work in a like truth dungeon and it's like my thing is I might be wrong but I'm not lying and I'm wrong a lot but in the moment yeah I think what's super important is that you've made a real good distinction that you try not to be cruel and exactly that's I do too and sometimes you miss right that's another thing about this working without a net yet boy sometimes you miss for sure something you shouldn't have said especially in live shows you try you just the impulse comes in your mind and you go for it but under careful consideration if you sat down and thought about it for a few minutes like oh no I can't do this bit yeah this and that what if people misconstrue what if someone took it out a contest what if someone does understand that this is what I'm doing I'm just pushing buttons to people who know I'm pushing buttons I'm not trying to be cruel you're like they're in the game versus just random casualties and also I think that the outrage ponzi-scheme people I don't even care I don't even care like I think a lot of people feign outrage because they don't understand but they still want to retain power but then there's people that actually like I'll hurt them and that's when I'm like oh no did I because my problem is every now and then I'll reverse virtue signaling where it's almost like I'll go farther intense that I normally would have because I'm trying to counteract virtue signaling and then I'm like well I'm throwing a punch it's someone that other people don't even might not see and then now I just am a crazy look yes whoo progressive yeah I've been talking about that a lot about Trump that I think that all these people attacking Trump in many ways they actually kind of ramped up his behavior yeah it's it's the if you read up black redneck white a liberal by Thomas ol no it's unbelievable we bring this up the lot and what I feel maybe I think if someone else did well Callen recommended it to me yeah so I just like one of the most read well-read guys it's unreal he's just always reading books yeah and he's getting into wine which is one of the hardest hobbies I can't do that I can't there's not enough time I'm like this tastes like PBR shit my foot fucking axe but PBR has a wonderful flavor of its own lucky if PBR was like really respected as some like light ale from like Germany like if you got a good batch of PBR you're like wow it's got a weird sort of aluminum meat taste it sounds like it spells like they do like the kind of sending pronunciation like they know it mark listen Pabst Blue Ribbon with some fucking stone crabs and some butter and maybe some fries with a lot of salt on them come on son there's nothing better I mean look it's not the same kind of beer people it's if people are flavor snobs like they want you to be into IPAs are you know IPAs can you handle the bitter yeah what about caviar don't you like stuff the taste oh shit yeah and they used to feed lobsters to prisoners like not that long ago well dude lobsters goddamn delicious they are delicious but it's like who gets to make the call well you know what the difference is lobsters with and without butter that's the difference a lottery with butter and lobster this like butter makes some shit just way better and one of the things that makes way better is lobster for sure there's no goddamn question and lobsters are you know it's essentially a bug it's a big old bug that's a giant feed on us that's this shit eating beetle they're not much different than bugs that walk around the surface of the earth they're just water bugs and I think we also like the task of like cracking and splitting it's you know it's like artichokes take some deliciousness right there Oh crabs what kind of grabs those Jamie you look goddamn good collecting PBR and crabs that's it a Pabst Blue Ribbon can there's nothing that crabs with spice on the outside and lemon Wow an IPA can take you for a turn like my wife this is like you're up some art cuz yeah I usually come in like if I if I get a little buzzed I'll come in you know what she want to hang and I'm out there just just drinking and staring at her fire and she gave me this IPA called dogfish and it's 18% alcohol and like three beers in I'm like blacked out cuz I was just drinking him like beers and I'm like Oh three beers now come in that's so unnecessary and it was like they do that to people I don't know it was like it's like spiking some wine now it's like roofied these here's the thing like it's you can't this is one of my had a bit about this about my problem pot gummy bears he said one of the problems is it looks like a regular fucking gummy bear and my brain thinks oh I could just fucking eat the shit out of those yeah I got gummy bears I get five or ten of them false representation I could just Jack your world there's a video I put on Instagram of Lisa at have you seen that video one by one design put it up and he's got a video that they took from Joey Diaz the Church of what's happening now and Lisa is literally the physical example that you would use of someone who's too high I'm surprised what's too hot you like this this is too high like look at him there he's got his eyes closed give me some volume Jamie they're all talking they're playing some music and look at him look at him look at his eyes fade man out by the way he knew he was supposed to be at the podcast I like it woke him up to do a podcast he left the camera on himself - yeah yeah he's just he's so paranoid he's freaking the fuck out look he trusts his head back we said Jesus I can't do this anymore cos he's just taking out demons just waiting for him to close his eyes and go to sleep I can't I can't give into the demons see them over here just scratching at the ceiling just waiting for the lights to turn out and his eyelids to close and they're gonna go through his fucking mouth penetrate his body and I've been that exact guy on that exact podcast yeah I just I couldn't handle it man he's a different animal I love that dude he's the best but he's a different animal you can't you know don't don't try to outdo him ever I was just trying to hang he was he had mercy on me which I thought was incredible because I'm like yeah let me just grab another world stars done he's like no way doc yeah you're gonna fucking be nice to you but like what you said about the gummi bears it's like it's almost like the false representation is the thing I don't like more than the representation itself yeah and that's why I get like so pissed about certain scandals cuz someone's a hypocrite versus other ones where I'm like oh man I feel bad for that guy right I know what you're saying yeah yeah yeah you see the here the podcast and the other day with Jamie kills teen yes he's a good dude man the way he came clean about all that stuff and just talked about how it all got away from him that's like a social justice warrior and ascribing and like really honest and I think super brave the way he described like this charge that he would get after going after someone and calling someone a racist and getting other people to go after him I'm trying to get him fired to to give me a good perspective on myself it's like the concept of the attack dog where it's this like understood thing where you're gonna attack for the group and then it's like then you start seeking approval from strangers and how much of it is actually your own opinion at that point and that's a very very profound thing to think about we we have a series our brain is filled with like the series of reward systems that are in place right like there's there's a need for approval from the tribe there's the need for you know sexually reproduced there's the need to accomplish tasks as a need to avoid predation and we have all these reward systems right we're like your body and your your organism will reward you with a positive feeling for reinforcing some of the patterns of behavior that are necessary for survival right right like the ability to run away from something when you're scared will you get scared and you freaked out that is a jolt of Go juice right you'll buy that guy coinsurance fuck you ready to run man have you ever been like legitimately scared for your life and have that feeling fuck yeah man it's terrifying and that's more powerful than than desire and I think that's one thing we're facing right now as a society cuz it's like just plains of Africa running from a lion versus towards a banana like what's what's crazier so I think that that's a way to it like supercharged a population into buying a bunch of dumb shit well I think this is a very important point that I think a lot of us it takes a long time to realize is that these reward systems that we have set up right like these that feel good to follow through with like you know the way we handle conflict and especially the need to push yourself and stress yourself out like some sort of physical exercise I really feel like that those things like if you can help them like if you could give them their fuel in a positive way you you don't get any of the negative aspects of it but you get the positive aspects of it because like especially that the physical one I really believe this from my own experiences we all have physical requirements for movement and we don't we don't give those physical requirements we don't feed the body correctly with those movements and what happens is it gets angst and it gets weird yeah your body gets freaked out and it starts getting fat it starts feeling like shit and one of the reasons why it's not functioning right is because we didn't properly manage movement like making sure your body is getting exercise like put some stress on it so that it can recover and be stronger and maintain a certain level of strength because if you don't put any stress on it it stops working and if it stops working you start your you start sagging and deteriorating and here's the big one maybe you're an intellectual maybe you'd want to have anything to do with physical stuff because you don't think you think of it as a base thing that fucking body has a giant influence in your mind a abs no separation there's no separation it is all that and it is just a discipline issue and there's nothing else it's I'm not saying you should be a bodybuilder I'm not saying you should go out there and fucking run marathons or do anything even that are super stressful but do some sit-ups do some push-ups do some chin-ups if you can do some some running up hills pick up some heavy stuff move it around and do it regularly do it all the time and even if you have no desire whatsoever to look good naked just do it to make your body last longer yes it's natural antidepressant like I used to live in the Czech Republic and there's no gems there we doing there studying history and and there's no gems and I would like I didn't feel safe in certain areas jogging cuz it was just just intense so I would just jump up and down I would play like disco or something and just manically jump up and down and I'd feel awesome I had this dumb idea once a few years back I was like well if you just jumped all the time and you kept jumping wouldn't you get better at jumping like wouldn't you like you get stronger at stuff it's a matter of like how many reps you do like how high could you wind up jumping is there a point of no return dude you're talking to a 6 7 guy who can't dunk who's jumped a lot to try and get up there there's it I think I can get really good at long-distance running but I don't have the twitch to go up and I've tried man well I don't like a cement potato I can't jump at all I can't forget my hairy little ups no you know I could endorse all video yesterday of the highest jump I've ever seen by a guy that didn't look that tall his top of his head you know the the vertical thing he had the top one video yeah I've saw this one dude that was practicing on those you ever see those the plyo bags they're the they're plyo boxes but the top of them is like a very soft foam oh yeah yeah yeah this guy was jumping those and it looked like there was like there was wires attached to his hips I'm like what are they doing they're yanking him up to the sky yeah I could see he was jumping like six feet straight up in the air and landing on these things like wait a minute you can people can do that it's like you have jump privilege oh look at this guy whoa I almost feel so awesome that guy is that's a 4 foot vertical right is that a 4 foot vertical not sure I don't know the exact height of the top of the backboard no the highest vertical than anybody's ever jumped if you had a guess let's take 51 inches that's a good guess I'll say 53 just for the fuck of it but just based on your guess being really good an awesome thing you do for people is you motivate people to learn new shit which is crucial for neuroplasticity I'm very happy that I do that but I only do it because I'm interested in it myself dude you got me in the show I'm like yeah look at this dude 60 he's got it you got a bra Dan ice Leonel Marshall he's a Cuban professional volleyball player and is said to have a 50 vertical jump the next guy is the doors eonni he's a professional dunker with slam nation didn't know it exists and is set to hold the world record in the vertical at sixty inches okay here's what I don't like is said his set is used twice it's like legend has it that's either some shitty journalism or you're not telling me the truth you're just telling me some rumor bullshit here's a as a matter of getting on on tape I guess so here's a 63 whatever the fuck it is man I don't don't diminish this man's accomplished no I'm not but I mean shut up Jamie I wanna see this guy do it hold on I will see this guy do it this is insane he's really gonna jump that high that's over his head 63 inches that's fucking dude you know you know you're good at something when you're when you're like you have a crowd for like a gym movement here he goes oh my god oh my god that's fucking insane what's that dude's name Ryan Moody or is he no Evan Unger 60 3.5 inch box John world record hold on go back please May 13 2016 that dudes a beast that's ridiculous by the way put that energy into some positive Sun just jumping up on rubber tires you keep in the CEO of a billion dollar company kid you get some serious focus said you're putting your all your interest on jumping high it's like a little crop your life it's across everyone jump highest okay you did it you've proven now move forth and yeah there's no strolling there's no Pro and box jumping to the cross look man you're talking to a dude spent most of his young days doing taekwondo there's very few things if you got that came to us kicked torque yeah but I'm saying like as far as like putting your energy into something that you could do with your life right history major I'm a guy how I have is like kind of like Constantine can get more drinks how's that giving I always loved those guys at the bar that know way more than me like what hold on what book always like some obscure bartender who could tell you some crazy shit about Napoleon you're like wait a minute like we were talking about Napoleon before like polian wasn't short he was short like for today but he's a he's an inch shorter than me he's five seven which is very tall for a person who's starving to death everybody was back then yeah like nobody got good food cuz like North Korea is now it's like South Korea and North Korea the height difference is like massive it's so sad man you said all those little people from like the Civil War days you know Civil War days an average man was like 130 pounds yeah they're little tiny fellas yeah you see that the uniforms in like a museum and it just looks like Smurfs yeah man you know that's all it's all just about food you know nutrients you know it's it's a dark thing to think of that this is Cheers my brother once man thanks for having me bro thank you thanks for being man it's a dark thing to think that like nutrients held back like the physical development of people like they have so little food that they weren't growing right yeah that's so crazy it's not like they were you know like they were supposed to be that small oh my god this guy's a giant the common soldier look at this according to historian Bell eye Wylie who pioneered the study of the Civil War common soldier the average yank or Reb was a white native-born farmer protested single between 1829 he stood about 5 foot 8 inches tall weighed 143 pounds okay that's not as small as I thought because that's average now 5 5 and I think that they were saying that the average weight was like 125 pounds with the average height was like much smaller maybe wasn't a civil war he was the war of 1812 I think Civil War I mean we're on a dollar a day and today's money until like eighteen ninety that's idea were broke man I mean my mom her parents had a dirt floor it's like dirt my parents were born in America but my grandparents came over to America from Italy when they were really young like I think my grandpa was before the teenage years you know he was telling me about the brutality of life on a farm when you're poured during the Depression yeah you know about how how we learn to kill rabbits with his bare hands you know how like you would explain to me any snap a rabbit's neck and you're looking in the guy's eyes that didn't know whether or not members of his family would starve to death exactly like this there was a different world back then man stakes yeah you know ones worried about pronouns my grandfather was a very kind and gentle man sort of bolide like almost the rest of my family and and and his his start in life because he you know he was born during a very very very difficult time and he was just a really kind man who liked to read books he was like the gentle one of my fan it's so cool he was like I lived with him when I was a kid when I was just moving to New York when I had to leave Boston and I got a manager and my manager lived in New York who I'm still with this day and I was like barely out of the open mic days yeah and I couldn't afford to live in New York by myself I tried to figure it out like how much money I had like very little saved up and I basically just went to New York with my car and some clothes and my grandpa let me stay at his place and it was weird man because my grandmother was dying she had a stroke and they gave her 72 hours and she lived for 12 years nice they thought she was gonna be dead they're like you say your good-byes get the family to fly to her you know she really had a bad aneurysm and she lived forever it's crazy so your grandpa took care of her he took care of her and I was living with the two of them while that was going on so like while I was going this transition in my life like the most exciting thing like literally it's ever happened to me I get this like real legit manager and I start thinking maybe I can actually do this like maybe I can actually be a comic because like when I was living in Boston I was like doing all sorts of other jobs and that was never like a professional I never had a full like I never had enough work where I could 100% be a comic I'd only been doing it for like three years alright so I was just grind and constantly grinding doing a bunch of different date jobs and so when this opportunity came I was like holy shit I can't believe this is real and as like my life was starting to go into this crazy place I a good solid three months maybe for living with my grandfather while my grandmother was dying and that's where I live so I'd come home with them and talk to them all the time and they lived in a neighborhood that used to be a predominantly italian-american neighborhood in Newark but it deteriorated slowly but surely until it was like a really it went from black people it's just like they did a thing called blockbusting you've heard that story you know a block yeah yeah they're trying to get them out yeah they're trying to they did that where they would move into neighborhoods and I don't know like whether or not it was true or there was doing they were doing it to capitalize on something that was true or whether they instigated it but they would essentially go door-to-door and they would say black people are moving in sell your house now and most of my grandparents families around them sold their house and my grandfather was like I like black people fuck off totally that's awesome man my grandfather was one of those guys as long as he has a gate and there's a lock on the gate like everything's good in the world and he had like so when I would visit him like he had neighbors like the next-door neighbor right next door got arrested for selling crack this kid had an Audi parked in the driveway they broke to his house with a battering ram that was like right before I moved in yeah well this is awesome man yeah but I was watching their transition to death essentially well in my transition to life at the same time yeah I had some somewhat similar I mean that that's to me right now like that's so profound because like now that I'm like I have a family and thinking about my wife and you watch the notebook and you're like oh shit but like my best friend died on my birthday like the the year I was out here uh snowboarding and it was right as I got like punked and she liked to show Punk'd and he like is the one who got me in a stand up and it was like that was so bittersweet man it was like it was like that the fragility of life as you're given this weird ego shot just just was like it it was so intense yeah a good friend of mine died of an overdose same thing I'm a died of an overdose like really I said I gotta say I was out here maybe three or four years he died maybe five at the most I spent New Year's Eve y2k on the phone with him because we were wondering whether or not the world will then we're just having fun laughing and then he died he died of a drug overdose and I found out about it like secondhand somebody found out about it through somebody else and they called me up and they asked me if I heard and I said what happened are you sure and they said yeah they found his body in a hotel rolling on Oh unreal yike rough it was rough that was the hardest one next to my grandpa that was that was the hardest one well Phil Hartman was pretty goddamn hard too that was a hard one that was a hard one I've recently lost I got a heroin he was a vet and it was like and you saw it coming but it was tragic cuz his PTSD was so fab he was like - this story was a he was a d1 baseball player at everything going for him his dad dies he wants to join the Marines he's unbelievable at being a sniper you know they go through hell in Afghanistan he gets on heroin ends up in my town we become like best friends who and my brother cuz like a lot of vets want to do tree work cuz they need that every man needs a purpose you know and it's like a lack of purpose for like true warrior hero types is death right and so like that extreme nature of climbing up trees and hauling lumber and stuff we'd all do it together and and that's why they also like calm because the honesty of it you know the dudes shot tons and tons of people so it's like that that feeling of constant judgment and guilt and pride and guilt comedy was like a relief for him and then he just died of heroin man it was like you get the this cuz you know I got him a gym membership and all this shit and we were all like rooting for him because he's this beautiful man but like that there's just morale injuries that just can take a toll and I was that was brutal yeah there's some injuries of the mind that are probably more devastating than injuries to the body you know and I think that's uh that's one of the things that we overlooked what we can't see we think about what we can see like oh that guy got shot in his shoulder but we don't look at Olin watch 10 people died in a fire you know like we don't think of that as an injury but I mean think about like I've had some friends are paramedics they'll tell you like accents they roll up on suicides that they roll up on and just after a while you're like oh my god you feel so vulnerable and one of the things that he said is like a lot of people that do that work or like very sexually promiscuous they just don't give a fuck yeah and they also in the development work to develop dark humour gallows humor yeah you know like my buddy Quinn from the Impractical Jokers used to be a New York City firefighter and so we did one of my podcasts together I mean we've been friends since myspace I mean these guys are salt of the earth man they're the fucking greatest dudes like seven good friends it's MySpace legit we used to write each other about our sketches and shit and it's like that dude has seen just kids torched you know and and he's like and they had to joke about if not you're gonna just blow your brains out so and then you come home to your own family you know yeah it's like look at England after World War two it's like that's I think that's what spawned so much great music so much great artists you know you know their dads all died man and it's like four and they're their cities are getting bombed and out of that comes this like desire to live in the moment and to just be able to say and do whatever the fuck you can before you die I think you're totally right I think that's the case with Roman art as well right I mean why was there so much artistic expression back then why were people so determined to put their emotions down on canvas those emotions were like hurricane swirling in your brain visions of people getting cut in half by swords and arrows piercing sternums yeah well Joe can you death are on their own blood and fucking hordes of barbarians coming over the top of the hill with horses swinging axes like whoa that was real shit back there and I'm like someone with a boot check mark is mad at me in fact and people just getting fucking heads could chopped off and you know I've been thinking about this a lot lately with this Kevin Spacey thing this that pedophilia is horrific with all agree it's it's terrifying it's it's it's so devastating because as we were talking about before someone gets shot you could see the wound if someone gets raped by an actor when they're 12 years old like how do you fix that right what what is that what kind of psychic wound is that and what I was thinking is it's it's really fascinating to me that we've pretty much acknowledged that pederasts or commonplace in like the 15th century the 12th century the 13th century the 14th century this like way way into the 1800s and then when you go with the Catholic Church I mean it is if you're Catholic shut your fucking iPhone off right now you know what I'm saying nobody knows well don't get your panties in a bundle it is a religion built on kid fucking it is a religion dude it's all about as a giant history of that it's because they wouldn't let the priests have families based on land ownership and some of these moves can take a beautiful religion and make it really dark well there was more than that it wasn't just that they didn't let him they didn't let him fuck women because they were goddamn rock stars the guys who held the Bible and could literally read it right the average person could read Latin they're all reading German and all these different language like wouldn't Martin Luther have you ever heard the prophets of film yes operative dome Dan Carlin is one of my favorite fucking human beings has ever lived and his podcast hardcore history is a national treasure because I've learned more about history and more about like the Mongols and World War wolfing and fucking everything but his podcast on Martin Luther and the trend the first literal translations of the Bible that regular common folk could read they lost their mind so like Jesus was poor - yeah you guys the peasant war has killed hundreds of thousands of people she imagined a world folks where until what was like the 1500s yeah mid 15s it was around Gutenberg so that was like fifteen hundreds v mid-50s find out when Martin Luther was 95 feet slam dick but the bottom line is what he had done was translate the five but he's slang a lot of dick guarantee was doing this because just wanted people to be free this is October 31st so oh Jesus Christ was yesterday this is crazy to do is after uh sober October yeah five hundred years ago I'm feeling toasty I feel so good right now feel right back I was worried man I was worried that if I smoked a joint I would be like oh my god a worm of paranoia thinking about girls I fingered in high school ah for me it's the edibles man I like smoke every down that if like there's someone I trust I know as good we were like it's the edibles that I'm like this is just flesh like that shit Oh makes me like it's real so this was the 1500s fifteen fifteen I was just said fifteen seventeen so think about that like before then that we're only talking that we're literally only talking about five hundred years ago yeah exactly there's the last informations over logs so think about five hundred years in terms of the life of the human species is mere a mere blip and one of the reasons why the Catholic Church was able to get away with just translating things to people where they couldn't read it is cuz that's how fucking everybody did it they all did it that way you would go to some place and some guy would tell you what the sacred stuff would be and you'd be like okay cool like how many people actually got a hold of it and read it all day and studied it and made sure there was no contradictions is why does guy keep fucking my wife for Jesus yeah that the Catholics are like the BuzzFeed they were banging everybody I guarantee you they had money they were allowed to have wives like did you know that like early popes ran armies oh yeah dude there were nuts they had to go to France for a little while to like you know cuz they had so much heat on them because it's wet fuse with Cod City it's when it fused with the Roman Empire you got that Empire shake because Christianity is a beautiful religion is more like mellow and peaceful and and then you got Constantine and that you know the Roman Empire is falling apart and they wanted to get you know more favored the people's they just fused the two together and they're like you know they got that the Pope's going and crazy did they ran armies that was one of the the things that happened apparently there was a conflict I hope I'm not fucking this up it was from hardcore history that there was a conflict where one of the earlier popes didn't want to send troops to fight Genghis Khan like there was a lot of confusion in the early days of Genghis Khan because before King goddamn it I've said it in the past have you heard in the past I apologize for repeating myself but the Wrath of Khan wrath of the Khan series of Dan Carlton real streaks unreal one of my favorite pieces of work whether it's a comedy a movie one of my favorite creations ever it's unreal it's amazing it literally changed my life it's like I got like a Harvard education after paying for a state education game and then if you you want to get the wrath of the cons you can just buy it on iTunes it's a dollar a show that's it it's so worth it and I think it's like each one of them is at least an hour and a half long some are five like didn't get their blows the Blitz are sick to get all of us the whole series right the series is 5 but not an individual podcast no like that the recent Blitz was over five about nuclear war and the whole podcast by itself is yeah yeah and then he just had the Gothic genocide of the Gothic Holocaust i was another fiver he's so gangster and he by the way he does it all himself folks he edits it all himself so like that dollar is so worth it and in my opinion he's like one of them look people just don't know you know you're not hearing about this on CNN you're not hear about this on Fox News and it is a travesty it is one of the best ways for you to learn about history because you learn about it he gives you a broad detailed sense of the time he does it in a very entertaining way that you want to keep tuning in and yeah that those memories stick to your brain it's done well there's an art to saying things interesting and he has that old time you get the whole series for 10 bucks it's so worth it that's one and a half beers guys that's so worth where is that there's website Dan Carlin doc okay but you can also order it on iTunes if you have I don't have an Android phone but if you have an I do but I don't use it but if you an iPhone you could order it on iTunes and it'll go straight to your podcasts yeah and there's another one that goes to the austere front mmm oh and it's like and he also has that old-timey voice almost like the Joker or he keeps you in here he's like what is a monument yes he's a great combination of entertainment information and humility like he's really humble he's like I'm not a historian but most of us think that the real and then I'll just the Anabaptist you know clearly when they purged not as a wizard wizard some what's so important and I mean I've talked about him many times in the past the point where I backed off go my god talk about Dan Carla too much that was Brian read bands and want to got me into it I'd the only podcast I listened to yours like maybe five four years ago like that was the only one I really had and and I'm like yo red band what else should I listen to he just goes and I think it was just so fucked up he's like like that just it just just set me off a journey you know what another great one is Daniela bellies history on fire listen that walk that's good plus you get a fantastic accent and when Danielle Ebola Ally his is his accent he's like got like a super Italian accent I know I'm like this is kind of sexy so much that Weka after this I'm not even gay at all but that's why people with day in the Roman guys because they all talked like that for each other we kind of wig rent around that but it's stunning to me that what we were originally talking about was like how common being a pedophile was yeah I was like super common that until there is history on fire professor Daniel I believe he's a type of Spartacus he's exploring kids he's a beautiful person - I love that guy yeah and great dude but it's it's amazing how recent it was where that was taboo where you weren't where people like hey maybe we should stop fucking kids that's my that's my one like I have a few rules in life but the number one is don't fuck the kids this was a hundred percent number one don't hurt the children don't hurt the children physically don't hurt him sexually don't hurt him mentally don't hurt the kids that's number one feed protect and teach yeah what you are is the the the result of some crazy shit that happened to you and some awesome shit that happened to you yeah and your ability to manage that fucking the the land in between the two that causes depression yeah between chaos and order how could I um Peter yeah yeah I mean that's what our job is is to figure out a way to make the best people we can and raise those people so that those people going to impact as many people as they can in a positive way and if this can be done look you got to realize that the people of today we're we're basically biologically the same as the people that live in the Genghis Khan days but we have to be further apart in terms of the way we look at the world there's software programming yeah exactly think about how you are how Jamie is how most people we know are and then think about Genghis Khan's mob of savages that were just eating people they're like Assyria Carlin gets into that it's a judgment at Nineveh it's it's like these people were like public's skinning Xand burnings and because it was just all about but just a yoke of oppression you know every and your life was just pain and you wanted to can inflict that pain on other people so you agreed to like there was like there's like almost like some sort of an evolutionary basis and staying as close to people as you can while agreeing with his little evidence as possible to murder them all like witch trials and did one of the things that freaked me out about Dan Carlin's history of the Mongols thing was he started talking about how there's speculation that decimation like the term decimation came from like if there's a hundred they would eat one of them oh no way they did wine would eat one there was speculation some of the Mongols like decimation like who does know decimated it's like destroying but what it really is is like a decimal like there's ten people you kill one right run out of supplies yeah but that the Mongols would pick one amongst them and they would eat them so that the rest of the troops had survived I was like that is so crazy and the guy was pretty high 'test like if you were above a wagon wheel he just cut your fucking hat off here's what estimation means the killing of one in every 10 of a group of people as a punishment for the whole group but that was just the punishment what Dan Carlin was talking about is there's some people and maybe he doesn't agree with them or maybe does but some people who believe it's possible the Mongols did this practice in order to stay alive they definitely did they just suck the blood other horses and they would add milk to it yeah they're just like they're hungry they're like I'm just gonna suck some blow out this horse yeah that's how they stayed alive they would cut the blood like cut an artery feel like a jug with blood and then they would milk them and mix the blood and the milk together and they would eat that and then their kids start getting soft because they became quote/unquote Chinese so like they like a Kublai Khan those guys they used to have to send him back to the step to keep their edge Jesus Christ you know it's like because I feel like it's like when I call some like a lay people in some New York people I come how uh indoor cats or Houska Hanson uh-huh it's like it's like the difference we tune in and like bird-of-paradise with the big plumes because they don't have any fucking predators Moshe kasher is a housecat big-time yeah totally yeah Savior I think combos with it but then I'll get into like all this shit where I'm like it's all social justice award like you don't have any natural predators you're not around bears son yeah you don't hang out with vets as you drop trees and if I can try to stay off heroin I would like to take Moshe kasher bear hunting that'd be hilarious take them into Alberta and let him see a grizzly lock eyes the grizzly for the first time that grizzly doesn't give a fuck about diversity it's like a motion that's patriarchy a thousand-pound thing that just needs to eat how much does a grizzly bear need to eat agait a day a gay let's guess the only gays I bet they eat a lot of games screaming they'll eat you yeah yeah that guy was gay yeah Oh full-blown hundred percent yeah grizzly man the number one greatest unintentional comedy human beings have ever ever said it beats Roadhouse it beats showgirls it beats everything that is awesome but still sucks at the same time did i watch the road how's that once a year van I love Road house I went on a tirade one night on Twitter I was high as fuck and I was watching Road house and it was just so ridiculous how gay it was like I like how did I miss this and so I went on this hole I went on like a series of Twitter posts of the Dalton and what isn't that the guy's name Sam yeah yeah Eliot Sam Elliot and Dalton hanging out together I'm like this is the gay shit how did I miss this yeah and he never really wanted to get with that chick he always just want to be like shirtless and look cool in like doorways and shed pain don't hurt yeah yeah he just wanted to look tough and cool to her it's amazing I know and like in like it was the worst bouncer in history like you're supposed to de-escalate and he's like oh you spill a drink I'm gonna beat the fuck out of 30 people a bear must eat 90 pounds of food each day yeah if you were telling what fuck they may in take one Ali Wong per day they during the winter when food is scarce oh my god no no grizzly bears are specialized to adapt during warmer months to eat a massive amounts of food so they can live off during the body fat during the winter when food is scarce so yeah they don't eat during the winter most the time they just hibernate so they get like super super fat through May intake 40 kilograms 90 pounds of food a day that's Ali well you were talking about on a podcast about when they blueberries it's an interesting flavor yeah I never experienced it but apparently that's what everybody says and Steve Rinella had a show about it where he shot a bear on a blueberry patch and then when he's opening the bear up but you see purple you see like a purple yeah it's funny my new specials literally called feed the bear yeah I saw that yeah this is what you decide to call it that cuz like when I get hammered I get like pretty happy and and sometimes and occasionally on several occasions I've been like pretty blacked out just been I feed the bear of it feed the bear whether that's about like sex with my wife or more beers or I'm just like yeah feed the bear here come on feed that bear for the big ol bear it's good good name for specials any feed the bear yeah why not yeah I'm horrible at titling shit I like I'll come up with like 50 and just have no fucking idea and I just have to pick something yeah they're tough it's tough like do you be Blackey DB self-indulgent to be precise Janie put on the on-air light it's bothering me that the on-air light is off I feel like doesn't need to be official this new studio watch that bang that's awesome I he's my dick just moved a little bit mine too nice I feel better I don't know why I need to see that I need to shut it off turn it on when I walk in the room um but yeah man bears fuck bears fuck him it's a reason why we had to build houses yeah I know I'll be living in tents if there's no mountain lions and bears and shit and black bears or everyone says Oh cuz we have a bunch of black bears and I always say I like harmless they are but they're definitely not we can still fuck you out kid got killed last year in Alaska during a road rage race road rage kid was in a road race he was 16 years old and he was running and he called his mom to say that a bear was following him and they might be in trouble the bear killed him I'm a sad bear when the park rangers showed up the bear was trying to shoo them away from his cache because he had buried the kid I pulled the kid's body into the forest and was covering up with leaves and shit and they came he was defending his kill yeah so that's the high stakes shit fuck bears bears bears are not yogi I'm not saying we should eliminate them I'm not saying we should kill them all and make them extinct but don't put them above people you're a goddamn crazy person if they if you think about your children think about your mother think about people that you love that could easily have been eaten by this bear and understand that these are these things are a consequence of the natural world that we engage with and you cannot put them above people it's just you are a traitor to your species 100% yeah of course you're missing the whole lesson that was learned by civilization and we miss it too the people that the only think that civilization is the key and that fuck the animals they miss it too but the people that don't understand what the animals actually are like you you're missing a giant wolves will eat your family there's a lot of herbivores well it's like what you were talking about with with the people that used to have to break a rabbit snack too you know like Maya my monk Ulm I'm AAM's brother they were so poor that he used to hunt for their food and then he became wealthy and now he goes to Africa to hunt you know the Broncos and Cape Buffalo's and you know and the Cape Buffalo's are really dangerous if they call them the Black Death yeah though I guess they're more dangerous than like lions and shit they litter can rip you apart thousands of pounds yeah they're enormous animals and they you know like even Lions have a hard time taking those fucking things out there's a there's a documentary called relentless enemies and it's about this one area of Africa that something happened in the river shifted course and when the river shifted course created an island a very large island but on this island was lions and buffalo and the Lions had to get bigger because all they could kill was the Buffalo so these Lions they it's a really fascinating thing because they think it only happened man I don't want to talk about school because I always do but I think it was like 200 years ago I think it was like a real recent amount of time and in that time these lads had developed like hulk-like bodies they look freakish the average female lion is as big as the average male lion on mainland Africa it's crazy how fast evolution moves it's like there's this type of moth in England that was white and it used to hide on the white on the birch and then when the Industrial Revolution kicked off uh it made everything City in the end the fucking moth was black in like 30 years because the birds just kept picking off all the white ones and then like the only three that were black or getting all the pussy that's crazy yeah it's like they say a white person becomes black if they have to live in African lifestyle sub-saharan in 20,000 years like you're totally black yeah well that's what white is well white is a solar panel for vitamin D totally that's all it is yeah we're just fucking snow monkeys everybody is everybody's the same we would have been way better off we only looked we would all look the same and the only thing that separate us we're how fucking stupid you were we've been way better off I'd be lame unbelievable yeah we'd be able to categorize people in like effective ways but instead you get these white people that are only into other white people like a fuck heads the least effective category so that's such a bad category like put dummies versus Smarties that's a good categories credit category same with like you know I judge people based on like pleated pants whether you can keep a secret keep a secret is massive I keep a secret is huge that's why it's like I'll get on board sir like I'll get on board with some shit's moving around but I don't wanna I'm not a big reveal guy I think that shit's for the birds big reveal guy like God when people just talk shit about people or its I guess what I now like I know I'm not like distraction you like if you don't have to do that you shouldn't do that but the only reason why you want to do that it's one we want to create some excitement outside of what you're actually doing to progress the the life that you livin right yeah unless you like calling someone out like someone committed a crime or something like that we're not talking about that but it's like this idea I'm just saying I could keep a secret with a crime - if you ever I can - the instinct the instinct to engage in that is all it's all negative you know and and and I think it goes back to that whole reward system thing where I think in a lot of ways we're very programmed to not just accept but even seek out conflict and to be upset about things and to like look for those things in the news look for those things because we don't how often you see conflict with humans you know like if you see like Manhattan right you see all these people that are driving their cars walk in get on the bus get on the train the vast majority show no conflict with each other the absolute vast majority it's actually amazing it's fuck Mary ships like we're so peaceful compared to what we could be but now compare that to the vast majority of interactions online oh no comparison the online might be 50% conflict yeah yeah and it's absurd conflict yeah okay I'm gonna fuck your mouth with a gun I'm like I thought we talked about healthcare wait a minute you can't even do that does someone explain to you what fuck is one on the chalkboard if you fuck my mouse with a gun yeah it's like when you reveal that you don't know something based on an intense insult did you see that thing that someone wrote about Ivanka Trump all the different words that she's is wrong and like this she doesn't understand English [Music] cuz I mean look man how old is she like 30 I know she's not she's not old right now for sure yeah for sure don't 36 36 mm-hmm look at her past so she's 38 just you know this most people don't know how to use words correctly and then also in your fucking death the present you're like wait I thought you were a reality show host right I think I thought it easy road here what the fuck I'm Donna would never reach the public eye I'd be fucking flying private jets to Israel every year like now I need to know what magnanimity means yeah but what about the yacht on the Caribbean that's hilarious that's what I was preparing my 35 years for and all of a sudden I have to figure out the correct use of words dude I got a massive verbal skills and horrible spelling I've like this weird like my ability to hear words remember words my vocabulary's huge but I spell like a fucking idiot my Spelling's atrocious like horrible yeah I rely on that squiggly line that red squiggly line that's so critical for me but what about no suggestions I don't play that game man that's like you know like swinging an axe well steel toed boots but so that's a I don't realize it's in Spanish oh yeah it's like as I you know I'm flying you know it's on my late-night rants that's why my thumb's are flying thumbs so you do everything a hundred percent from your phone everything responds a stronger edition because you're not even pretending you might get some productivity done I give you if you're on your laptop and you got Microsoft Word open yeah check Twitter like what bitch you don't know shit about Beethoven right well I'm trying to wind down which is crazy because it's like the worst way to wind down is just like cyber conflict that's not a way to water down that's not the way to one cuz my wife of all asleep before me and then you know I don't want to watch TV and be loud and then sometimes I'll go in other rooms shit but you know well I think I mean this is very pretentious to say but but but it is true so I think that all of us who are having a chance to talk about our experiences in this life are influencing each other that includes you that includes everybody I know that cludes Ari Shaffir and Tom Segura and Duncan we're all influencing each other and we we're all in some way helping each other like mitigate all the weird influences that we experienced yeah and there's a big one the big one is our addiction to information and that the addiction to information can overwhelm your ability to process the information like if you're just reading shit about like world news and a breaking news and all the craziness yeah you're doing that all day while you're awake like I say if you gave your phone like if somebody had a phone and they have on the Mophie packs so they can keep that bitch running internet all day at the end of the day what have you have you even taken the time to momentarily reflect about what any of this means or are you just taking a fucking guy with the truck killed bikers you know oh wait wait fuck guys guy OH Dustin Hoffman's piece of shit to retweet how much time are you spending where you're thinking about life yourself the world around you what are the motivations for all this like this kid that ran over these people in New York what's his motivation who is he who did the most awful job ever of parenting this fucking monster right I think that Allah wants him to stomp on the gas and run over a bunch of that guy was so dark because I like I was just on that bike path with my son and I just I'm trying to stay objective sometimes and I'm like yeah and then I'm like fuck you it's like emotions man cuz Petersen talks about how the the need for information is the same part of the brain for foraging food yeah and now that we have all this food we're forging other shit and I think it's like all think that's a really good point yeah stressed enough now that we have all this food we're foraging other shit yeah yeah we're foraging outraged we're forging the need for reform or forging this violent interaction between cultures were forging all this fucking craziness online like every day you're seeing more and more craziness people telling people they can't wear braids people talk you know like people to tell us your appropriation is the most insane it's a psychotic thing and it's getting worse but not my Twitter timeline I think Jamie kills teen did us all a giant favor I'm not being disingenuous I think he did and I don't hate that guy look I've had I've met bad moments of my life when I've made dumb decisions owning up to those dumb decisions makes you a real character like someone of of real character to me I want to say I was gonna say a real man but it applies to women as well like owning up to those fuck-ups is so goddamn huge and Jamie did it and I think we need to understand like when someone does do something like that you gotta you gotta stand out the fucking Golf Club you gotta you gotta you gotta you gotta let people know that and there's a lot of other people that also could have these revelations in these moments to stand up and and and be real with you and then all of us would recognize those moments and those feelings in our own self and we can move on better we did better than we're doing what Jamie did by coming on this podcast and talking about his life as a social justice warrior and all the nuttiness that he was involved in and all the rules and regulations what you could and couldn't say and how he knew it and even though he thought things were wrong couldn't express himself because it would be outside of the progressive doctrine that they had to all follow by right that's giant man that's giant for all of us cuz just like Jordan Peterson has expressed that we could all be Nazis if we were that person for sure circumstance with those you know those stresses and pressures that's what terrifies us about all this stuff that you could be that person that if you were born in Uzbekistan or wherever the fuck this terrorist was born that ran over these people that have all the terrible things that happened to him happened to you you that guy was hitting that gas right there's no difference between you and me and Jamie and everybody listening we're all just people and we're a combination of biology or a combination of life experiences and our community and our circumstances and what we've learned that's that we have to recognize that instead of like trying to appear to have moral superiority over everybody above you because you haven't committed murder yet or you haven't run a red light we're wound up killing someone because you have an impulsive desire to get to work on time or you haven't drove home drunk because you made a mistake and your girlfriend left the party and you were fucking pissed you got in your car and you plowed into a car all those things we wanna we want to demonize people because we're scared to death but you're seeing those ideas in ourselves or seeing those actions in ourselves yeah and that and that soul Janet's in line there's the line between good and evil is right down the middle of a person's heart you know that we have that none of us are just good or bad and we can't just just proclaim someone as bad and us good unfairly those are the people that root against it's not it's not the flawed humans that make mistakes and and just are human it's the people that demonize everyone but them and you see that they're almost just it's projecting it's like the biggest homophobe is the gay guy you know yes and and that's and and that's what gets me angry and it's like when you're trying to get social like what happened to me with the with the define that kid situation where it's like well explain that because most people don't know what you're talking about people don't know the circumstances so there's this this guy and who has a three year he had a three year old boy that he claimed was transgendered and identified as a girl and I started you know putting dresses on the kid and treating him like a girl and I was planning on giving him hormone therapy so they don't go through puberty and this dude that's like power in Hollywood you know and and and I just called him out and I got swarmed and I just didn't stop because I'm like I'll die on this hill yeah that's a hill to die on when you're deciding that a three-year-old is done developing and understands when you're talking to is akin to like a seance where you find out that you were a Roman Emperor from 1700 that fucking three-year-old barely understands how to express himself the the idea that a three-year-old can give you a complex definition of their sexual and gender identity at 3:00 and that this isn't so that you should go in and chemically influence that kids their omega me eunuch yes and it's like an it's a projecting instead it's a projection of the father's ego it's not even like is it up yeah the virtue say oh it's just a coincidence that it's a san francisco like NPR guy that like everyone in Hollywood as is back for some fucking reason even as a child it's like it's it's circumstances explain what what so this dude John Hodgman who I thought I was cool with I met him doing a morning radio show and he was like when Mel Brooks said PC shit's ruining comedy or something all these comedians were like going against Mel Brooks and I'm like wait a minute are we the bad guys now what comedians oh uh Paul F Kampf Tom Ken was talking yeah and I was like dude you're like the bad guy from Footloose now huh and and so I'm just being very open about this because my land and you know it's like there's there's a few things I'll stand behind free speech don't fuck the kids you know don't hurt the kids don't hurt the kids yeah like yeah just just be good to the kids you know it's like is that's you see that's you I mean that's what every every child is you all of us I know especially when you're a little tiny person you you have this insane responsibility as a big person when you're dealing with a little tiny person now that I have a tiny person that's what yeah it made me more of a man and an adult like I I just felt so much more responsibility good-hearted person on the job too you learned on the job like you realize along the way like oh I'm like literally dealing with a blank slate and I can't even process this that my fucking bizarre ridiculous life of telling jokes and in your case playing songs with pianos and ridiculous shit these say on Twitter this somehow or another qualifies you to raise a human being it's so intense it's so and also it's like I uh I've always thought I was a good guy but not like I ever thought I was like deserving of anything special you know but then once you see a kid you like he's fuckin pure still man you know I'm like I've done some shit you know so that's why I think just as myself younger I wouldn't have been quite as like into I've always stuck up for the underdog and people being abused and shit but now I'm like I have to be better for like the next generation because I see him look at me like humans can be good he's like dad dad dad dad you know what I'm like holy fuck dad as a good guy ya know and like I never really knew if I was good guy right and this is a good experience between you and him he's enjoying it immensely oh you know a giant and it's just like he watches me watches me hit my foot with my ax and as I going through it do you ever think about the fact that and this is a conflict that I've discussed ad nauseam with some of my friends and every one of my friends that I know came from a fucked up place right all the people that I'm friends with risk Allen or Joey Diaz or anybody read ban or Duncan although their childhood was fucking chaos right Ari Shaffir like everybody's childhood it was a mess yeah I think it's a I think it's a to make a good comic that's still good dude I think it said it's a combo of like love like your grandfather and chaos yeah it's almost like a or else we're just killers right that's the problem right I think that goddamn comedy and murder are so closely related I know and we're just killing yeah okay that is literally why they call it killer because my mom listened to our last podcast and she was like I love that you're friends with Joe like you guys both have like you're kind of fucked up a good guys and it's like you experienced these like traumatic events and and you experienced damage you know and then you have paths in life and you're like I'm gonna seek the good in this but we're still you know low impulse control comedians but still you know we're not just killers but we're actually nice people but we're realizing were nice people in the middle of all like a lie for the tremendous amount of momentum of chaos behind chaos and also like whoa okay you're like belly the beasts shit man you know it's like I might as well have had a Viking ship for the last ten years or he's just Viking it up and it's like yeah and then you see that the order you need the cast in order you know and you see the order with a child and then you see these people trying to exploit children and I was just awake you know I'm just like you know what fuck you I'm like I'll but I don't and then people in LA that I thought were my friends not good friends not like comics but like middle management that's what the evil is well you know what it is man it's like the supporting transgender rights eclipses all the logic involved and subtle nuances of human behavior and sexuality and the idea that a three-year-old could have any any notion of like what its gonna be like to be eight or what its gonna be like to be 16 or whether or not hormonal changes is going are going to affect the way expresses himself so and also you're looking at this kid and you're deciding that this kid because they're three is going to be transgender and you want to turn them into a girl what if this kid decides he's a gay man in five years they kill themselves right what it will what if they decide that they're bisexual in 20 years you know it can't if you kill if you care about that child you don't interfere that with that process because I'm not the same thing that I was when I was three and you're not either No so to inject hormones and chemicals and even surgery that we really have a very limited understanding about how much this interaction between a scalpel and a baby body there how much of the impact that has you you're giving someone the green light is that they're talking about like making this kid a eunuch well yeah they won't go through puberty and so then it's like they saying no what are they saying they won't it's called hormone blockers and I kept ask him directly I'm like say yes or no are you gonna give him hormone blockers because it's fine if he wants to wear a dress have some fun playtime fine but you're gonna tell him he's a girl but here's the thing it's not even playtime it's like what if the kid like feels better when he wears a dress fine like we're all just that we've all decided that pants and a shirt is the way to go if you don't wear pants nice shirt I know you're a homo like if you were sitting there wearing a big-girl skirt right and what do I give a fuck if you exactly kilt and I'm like I love Scotland right wouldn't care but if you my brother's to piss out of each other well start I shouldn't said that a lot I've Loras thing implicate Doug Stanhope pissed on Ari Shaffir last week like a couple of days ago on a podcast that's awesome yeah pissing happens I didn't mean to cut you off your talk about the Scottish yeah I mean who gives a shit if you dress like a girl what I give a shit is if you step in and you in any way interfere with the physical sexual biological development of a child because you think it's the right weight thing to do progressively do you think it's the right way right thing to do the right way to approach a fucking three-year-old like you are the problem you're on my god there's not this is we're not talking about one plus one equals two we're talking about a super complex very nuanced issue and if this child decides when it's X amount years old whatever we decide 30 whatever the fuck we decide to take the decision to to get gender reassignment that's a hundred percent cool with me course have no problem with that but that's a person who understands who they are as a fully developed organism not a fucking baby 3 that's a baby dude and part of me it's like this like I see myself in the in the kid round like a horse that's like classical piano and I knitted like I used to like knit cloth I so weave the thing we be your piano teacher yeah yeah like my P odd like my dad is like a my parents are married to have a great marriage but it's like almost like a reverse gender marriage in a way where my dad's like a flamboyant opera singer professor and my mom like 6/1 love sports wear sweat pants you know like my first bit was I was the only guy in the straight closet you know I used to be like my dad would be like let's go see rent again son and I'm like I want to play catch with mom you know that's a lyric so I I played piano as a kid I thought about your piano - yeah when I was 11 my piano teacher became a dude and and the bit I tried to work on the people don't believe like some of the best by the way that's a long time ago how old you know oh I'm 37 thousand ninety one that was Oh geesh that's that's OG surgery oh that's and do my pee on T's right now it's like Owens totally trans friendly like we're friends but I don't think he realizes what's it become you know cuz it's like now it's like oh you don't believe in making a three-year-old a eunuch your father a yeah this is this is not wise because if you just look at it and not in terms of like how a child should identify but in terms of like the biological process of a developing human being it's very very touch-and-go we don't really understand what it is this is what you try to do with a kid you try to give them nutrients you should try to give them love and try to give them safety and try to give them challenges makes it totally man has to get over but but the idea that you are gonna decide by your conversation with someone who just started talking 12 months ago they're still shitting themselves don't know how to talk yet they shit in their pants but they literally don't know how to talk yet I know it's like I identify it's like how does that work you want to be a girl okay like my son's dances he's always dancing and shit he loves the piano he does with dad that does and it's like this kids probably trying to impress his dad and his dad's this fucking asshole it's like all being trans is brave dad right and then they're gonna make they're gonna make moves where the kid can't go back can't go back its life is over you literally turned their life down a dark path because here's the thing and this is super unpopular side but the bottom line whether you decide to become a transgender person whether you decide to you know just suppress those ideas it is at this current stage of our understanding of medical science impossible to actually turn you into a woman of course X X X Y right so what we're gonna do is have some reasonable facsimile and it's gonna be more reasonable in different people and some people they have a slender frame you know some people have built like David Tua and it's just like whoa let's girl okay go yeah like you know David Tua was big-time heavyweight boxer from the 90s and you've touched on our body dysmorphia with like weight lifters where it's like you know there's certain people that just aren't comfortable in their own skin and want to alter it like with like fucking rather that's bigger or cutting your wiener office and shit and and as a very big personal liberty guy I'm all about you doing that but you don't make that decision for the kids you don't make the decision for anyone that's under and the age of comprehension and here's the thing like what is that age because they say that the frontal lobe doesn't really fully develop 225 ya ask Geico yeah yeah they won't yeah that won't insure you as a male the insurance is up until you're 25 because you're not developed but about a girl I think it's a little earlier I think girls develop little earlier and now I now fucking pissed I'm calling some sort of red pill organization and so long story short I make these problematic statements and then my agent drops me and how did your agent drop you for saying a three-year-old shouldn't be given chemicals then kill his dick and ball because I was rocking the boat man imagine if you just put it that way so what you are is pro giving kids dick killing chemicals is that what you are just let me know right it's kind of like when it's like words or violence you hold up your fists and you go word or violence like that it immediately cuts through the shit but for some reason it's not these days words are violence I mean that's a big thing now and it's like this college you can't drop me out of like a good gig and they said that because your views we can't you can't work here and then did they specifically talk about which views yeah I even tweeted the email cuz I have a sick of this shit man views the trans kids it's only trans kids that's my whole thing but it's trans babies dude it's hot they're toddlers they're like three dude it's and and I'll die in the hill man I even asked my brother out like my buddy died on my buddy mica Mike blew Mike from a sword and scale-like dude I literally was like I'm I'm unemployed and he had me like read uh-huh that's when you know your friends are man he's like yo will you read this you can be like a da in this fucking murder podcast I was that great he's like I throw some cash I thought I was out I'm like brother can I do some more tree work he's like 20 an hour you got boots I'm like fuck yeah dude I was prepared man but think about that that you as a guy who I've known for a long time it's been a successful professional comedian are really always that close to being pushed aside and not given work anymore over something that's totally Lodge okay I just gotten a development deal like truTV and shit it's not even like I was doing badly did they the truTV keep the development deal today but did not even have wraps anymore but do you talk to truTV so I know they're cool people I just had I've just been so like so the reps all abandoned you by saying that you don't think three-year-olds well yeah and then trannies yeah and also I guess I was I was saying it promised it was like problematic you know I was uh I was I was too many too much I was just I was poking people that aren't allowed to be poked at this these powerful middle managers you know what were you doing just saying you're wrong dude well they're like are you poking them about what that shit like that's what oh yet man any of that shit like I don't do we tweets man and then the Shaun King shit where I'm like making a joke that I think be hilarious if slavery came back because uh he'd have to admit he's white and that's fuckin funny man I'm not gonna back down on humor I'm just not and he calls me a white supremacist actual people with like blue checkmarks are like I never knew your arrest I'm like you know I'm not man you know it's a joke about him lying about who he is and uh and I'm not gonna explain to people who he is and what that whole story is I don't know whether it's true or not but I know what I've seen online and I know what a lot of my low exposed but if I was Rachel Dolezal right now I'd be fucking pissed ohto it dude and it's like even if I'm wrong let's say he is a black guy with like well even if he is let's be honest like I am he's not I'm not Irish but I'm a quarter Irish right but if you look at me I look like a Guinea look like an Italian you know why because I'm 3/4 Irish or 3/4 of time so if I had to if someone says are you Irish if I was going on TV identified as Irish man right what people that we get infinitely more part Irish how much our Irish are you I mean people would say that's disingenuous because no one could tell nor does anyone care right about the distinction between Irish an Italian you just a European here you are in America you know third generation no big deal yeah but there's a reality to that because like what percentage blacked you have to be what you say I'm a black man well because he wants the points that's why it's not even about pride and you don't hurry up you don't write there you don't choose to be trans black it chooses you this is my life my struggle is real hashtag wrong skin yeah is that real okay that's real well that is okay she talks about oh that's a real tweet it's from Owens thing that's I was looking okay about why someone could create that it was a guy there was a guy that I was following for a while that had a parody account and he was going by hashtag wrong skin he was a comedian yeah and he was always talking about himself as being trans racial but he was doing it like completely preposterous and he would be like who take like the ultra progressive really ridiculous approach to like almost every argument and then always right like hashtag wrong skin hilarious cuz it all started because that dude poked at me because I had this bit that I want to be a progressive slave owner where I'm like I'm like the reason slavery is wrong is because it's only black people that's not right that's racism I want all the people and I'm like if you can't outrun the nets and the harpoons yeah welcome to the club and that's a joke about the absurdity of certain progressive ideals and then he poked at me somehow and I was like this guy's fucking well if I could be really honest about that I saw it and I was like mmm I see your point but I think that's like a first draft of an idea of course of like because I bailed on the joke because it doesn't it only works in certain cities so this is but this is why I mean this is how I felt I'm like okay no because I don't want anybody to be slaves like so like the joke is like it's kind of cruel in a way like we're not talking about real people of course what's the sentiment behind it is people who run slow anybody who can't get away should be a slave no no but you don't really feel that way you're saying that because you want to poke people well it was extremely not honestly of course I don't want any slaves of course it was the upside down it was it was upside down satire words because that was I was I know it was but it wasn't right it wasn't quite there it was like you you were in the neighborhood but that's what our job is yes you know that's the whole thing it's like everyone thinks that you can you start knowing the bit you know freedom of speech is all about way over shooting then pulling back then fine you know and I was over shooting like that's why I do why don't they laugh where it's like look at how this one phrase hurts people and then how you make it not hurt people based on information I didn't previously know yeah you know and it's like um like my wife gave me an info about I was doing some bit about how vampires or cultural appropriation for Romanians and I I don't even understand what the point was but it's something to do with hairy Mexicans women what is this Jamie was trying to find it he was when I'm looking for it he apparently had hit it or deleted those tweets now Shaun King is cranking out a boatload of original tweets in a continued effort to dilute last week's hashtag trans black and hashtag wrong skin tweets oh so you like got a bad response people tweeting about that whole thing for weeks going on into 2016 in a bunch you know I don't give a fuck man if you want to feel the same literally the same way as you feeling that you are a woman or you feeling or anything anything but the real problem is like the insisting on that definition in a very specific manner that's disingenuous with your actual background because everyone is essentially we all came from Africa that was the original human beings and like we said before being white is solar panels for vitamin D that's all it is it's we moved to a place that a lot of clouds and wasn't anything like Africa and slowly over who knows how many fucking years people changed and you develop paler and paler skin that's it yeah so it doesn't matter I don't care but just here's here's a better way to do it just act the way you feel like you like to act and don't lie about with your background now totally and you could be the exact same person no one will give a fuck and the irony is is he's trying to get victim status when he's not part of a group and because there is the reason American slavery is so fucking Ark is because it was one of the only slave systems based on one race right and that's why like Carlin did an unbelievable everything's car like dude Garland's covered it he has a blitz episode called addicted to bondage Jan Carlin yeah but like Dan Carlin addicted to bondage we're all related to slaves and slave owners it's like it was it was actually progressive because of genocide yeah that's the irony it's like back in the day an army wins they kill everyone and then some Bernie Sanders guy was like let's keep some alive and I was like you're such a fuckin lefty you know and and so we grew out of that thank God of course I don't like slavery I think I'm I'm almost in this position we're like I'm a little freaked out that some Givens aren't given any more like what like like that Hitler is bad or I don't like slavery where I'm like oh it's just a given it's a given right like who the fuck like slavery it's like there's something a human there's still a bunch of retards out there that think it's a good idea to be a white nationalist right yeah right like charlottesville like when you see that guy I got pepper-sprayed takes his shirt off you see a swastika on his chest like okay what about the Nazis is awesome to you is it just fucking gassing random children like sit down tell me yeah a bad war plan in Russia the idea that are you so fucking stupid that you really think the only people of merit have genetics that come from a certain patch of dirt because that was one of the that's one of the most toxic ideas so toxic man share and it's it's toxic in the same way that some of the left shit is toxic to it they both have this toxic element were like unless you look at merit and character you're fucked yeah like if you're like um whether or not you think white people are special and then you should keep them down or boost them up it's both toxic I think like when it comes to Rachel Dolezal like her problem is not that she wants to be black and she's not her problem is that people give a fuck about what she wants she just didn't have that Lange I just didn't like imagine her whole world could be exactly the same the way she behaves could be exactly the same the way she dresses her actions everything if she didn't utter a few were like I'm actually black and people like wait what like and then they go into her history no no you lied you wanted to be black but you were black look right we haven't in posture and that's just quick quick quick it's his eyeballs Shaun King I mean he was a part of black lives matter obviously he wanted to do good obviously wanted to spread good ideas and help people the people that he really identified with if those tweets are real and I don't know if they are hashtag wrong skin and hash tag transracial and all that stuff and that's literally how he felt he didn't feel it because he hated those people he felt it because he identified with them and they're more attractive to him than than what he actually was so if he just paul walden and never said I mean paul wall right though the rapper with the grill I mean isn't that essentially he's he's they have a deep love of black American culture right there's a lot of people that just would just be themselves and go in just go in this is what I appreciate more there's a lot of black people at golf clubs with fucking polo shirts on right yeah why because they identify with that culture it's appealing to them what just let people fucking cultures everything man that people be and the irony is is like Joey Diaz he's gonna get us grills you heard about that and the irony is is like inner-city black culture like think like comes to my shows and thinks I'm funny yeah because they like that crazy shit right like man you fucking fine you happy to talk about things right they just think it's funny I think I last a day it's annoying cuz it's like of course not all black people find money but like that culture that black redneck white liberal culture it's like I'm from a culture that's more similar to American southern or urban black culture than a lot of the Liberals calling me names and it's just a type of culture that bonds through shit talking and I'm like Boston where it's like if you talk shit someone's like oh you're dead you're dead X like a home on my grease my dad's didn't kill himself you know and then your friend cuz it's like you've hit the darkest shit right and then you're like I will make it through a winner yeah a winner is a big thing to make it through I think the people in the West Coast have like a way easier like the idea of what the possibilities are then the people in the East Coast right people in the East Coast are ghuli confronted with potential death if they're dressed wrong dude I live in the Adirondack Mountains man it's like dude and that's like CLAT class doesn't exist in my town it's you got a fucking shovel yeah what time like what time of the year does it get to where you could die outside like haha by December January you know we had negative 40 yeah no minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit which is exactly the same as 40 degrees Celsius that's where it comes to its clients yeah and it's like that's where they embrace and do we have this tiny town and like where they do they get mad no we build ice palaces and shit dude a stock up on firewood in July in August and September and there's none of this PC shit it's like except for one issue I got a little piss in my town about cuz like this year the Winter Carnival was going to be Fiesta themed about Hispanics but there's like oh the only Hispanics are my wife and child you know and then they're like oh no we don't want to like be bitch right I'm like it's offensive not to you know I'm like we could do a lumberjack theme you fucking idiots right fucking exactly there's no Nev I Kings me you could shine on Vikings all day long all day long nobody cares did you a big fucking helmet big horns nobody took calls you a cultural appropriator if you wear like viking garb or like a st. Patty's Day it's a midget looking for a rainbow trying to get gold yeah no kind of flight everybody you can wear green all day on st. Patrick's Day what else well this well the sombrero for me is like oh he's got an NFL tattoo on his bicep that guy's pretty intense lose that guy - I shot someone Oh as a fan because jacked it guys do it right - fanatical he works out all year just for that fucking scene yeah you could be a Minnesota Viking and nobody gives a shit but the Cleveland Indians everybody's like just as the end of civilization I know and Vikings were like worse than Isis like they would show up and just kill and fuck and bail they were the wrong thing to see if you went to the beach to try to catch some fish and you saw a boat pull up there was no satellite radio back then now I didn't know what was coming if you saw a boat in the distance and that boat in a dragon head at the front of it and you're like oh fuck it's like dude they just wrote across an ocean and they were giant giant do it mainly time yeah my ancestors probably a little small exiting get proper food right like I bet a giant back then was like 6 - I did breastfeed for a while that was the thing about a Jack Johnson like Jack Johnson who was the Galveston giant that's what they called him but you find out Jack Johnson's actual height he was the heavyweight champion where the first black heavyweight boxing champion the world I don't think he was any taller than 6 3 well that's a way better height I was posing six one six I think that's the best nail height because six seven blows yeah but the Galveston giant think about that think about calling a guy a giant who's only 6 1 but in 1878 he was a fucking giant yeah it's almost like that the Middle Ages professor is like the guy that can read one word he had three wives even back in the day go go go back to that please look at that back to the wives where's his Wikipedia page you just had it you go to his whatever it was just if you just go back it showed that the three wives there it goes okay yeah see spouses he got tired of giving the dick to Irene and then he moved out of the lease Lucille and they're all white ladies by the way get tired give the dick to her moved on to Etta gave the dick to her so he's like an LL Cool J song BAM that's crazy I was looking for overlap hole not go back please Jaime's just a clicking fiend he loves clicking look at that the the last one is Irene was the last one I guess 1946 didn't how did he die he died in some strange way but uh he was only 200 pounds - that was a giant back then imagine that that's so intense yeah that's nuts I mean you got to be like 240 right how much you weigh 250 I'm like I'm like 15 over took is the beers and the fires beers and fires because they work out everybody fire doesn't put weight on you I know but if you drink the beers okay it also makes me cook a lot of meat with like fucked up sauces it's a house he died does it say his death is a really interesting thing because it's pretty widely believed that he took a dive when he lost the title and that he was just tired of getting arrested constantly and harassed and he just wanted out he was sick of crushing sick of white people you know he's banging a lot of white chicks do that that was some heat that was some heat back then to it I could get you killed that was way before black comm have you banging what is it he died in a car crash on the US Highway one near Franklinton North Carolina Wow after racing angrily from a diner that refused to serve him good for was good pissed dude he's like doctoral closest black Hospital sake Saint Agnes Hospital in Raleigh and he was 68 years of of age at the time of his death he was buried near at who's I guess his last woman his grave was initially unmarked but a stone that bears only named Johnson now stands above the plots of Jack Etta and Irene Wow this dark man it's really crazy I mean that guy was just born in the wrong fucking time - that was bane man that guy was born in darkness like imagine being black in the fucking early 20th century like holy shit and he just rose him a champion he became the champion and an interesting style if you watch the way he fought he fought different he fought different than other people what do you do well I just had he just had a long reach and he had really good power for the time and he was just very smart he knew that drag guys as a deep-water and beat the fuck out of him but he fought like a murderous puncher who's a middleweight champion named Stanley Ketchel it's a fascinating fight because Stanley Ketchel only weighed like a hundred and sixty pounds it's his tiny little dude but just a little Savage Stanley Ketchel Jack Johnson on the chin and fucking dropped him and it was like a big deal at the time because everybody wanted a white guy to beat the heavyweight title holder and the white guy was way smaller look how small catch I mean he's fucking way smaller than Jack Johnson but Jack Johnson overestimated him and Stanley Ketchel caught him with a murderous right hand Stanley Ketchel was a savage he was the middleweight champion the world's lightest in him sorry I says Tom Burns totally I think Mike Tyson's punch I'll beat the shit out of Tommy Burns go see if you can fight any he slowly tortured him and beat him up see fine Stanley Ketchel Stanley Ketchel was the guy who's the middleweight champion and [Music] there's a really interesting thing because I Jack Johnson seems like he's taking it easy with him for a little bit and then Ketchel catches him of the bomb oh is that it this is like look they had like warm-up stuff they were warming up and they showed him training like how they would train back then it's really interesting nobody knew what the fuck do down just run through the streets and shit like should we run that's awesome they're just trying to figure it out yeah that's Stanley Ketchel way smaller just way smaller than Jack Johnson I mean Johnson might have been thirty pounds heavier than him maybe even more do you think like a Mighty Mouse could take that dude around oh yeah for sure no no I mean he wasn't not boxing but an MMA you would never hit him he was I mean unless he figured out some way to stop him from moving and him in he's so fast he would anticipate your movement and he would just slowly drag these fucking guys to the ground music Neil for matrix it's like I started watching a bunch of clips based on your endure like talking about you were talking about how I was like pound for pound just the crazies fighter ever so I got best yeah he's the it's not the craziest because he doesn't he doesn't fight crazy fight smart you know see if he could find where Ketchel drops him because it's a big deal because nobody expected it I think this is already what cackles getting fucked up you see his face is all oh look at that well he got jacked just back it up just Hey just a hair so we could watch that again this is a back of the time this is a giant deal because Stanley Ketchel was a white guy I think I were like finally we got a black guy down on the ground and it wasn't even a big white guy that did it you know and everybody wanted Jack Jack Dempsey to come back there was still in denial at the point they're like Blackie oh that's a serious right hand no I think Jack Dempsey actually was after this know that I'm thinking about I'm like I'm wrong they wanted Jim Jefferies I think know who the fuck was it that they want he beat who did he beat towards the end of his title reign man my boxing history's terrible dude after he got knocked down it was almost like he was like oh fuck this and they just he just went crazy and just took him out looking he was going down before he got hit I was weird because show that again it might have been that he got caught with his legs tied up watch this step on the foot no hmm one more time more time please watch the step forward he yeah he was almost like going down because he knew the power of the punch he definitely got clipped though as well as also ducking his head and got clipped on the way down but he was ducking way down where he might have fallen down or at least fallen off balance even if he didn't get hit but whose is uh who's the the main dude that he went back and forth with go to the web to his Wikipedia me I think it is James Jeffries yeah but at the time when you know this was going on to have a black heavyweight champion I mean I don't think we can even fathom the level of racism this guy experienced unreal I mean literally every day worrying for his life meanwhile throwing hot dick at white chicks but it's almost like the gang is kinda James Caan thing where it's like that environment of just darkness made him such a fucking diamond James and he still lived 20 years old and Ralphie May as a farmer man I was a good dude he wasn't good dude what I mean think about the life of a person that lived back then he made it to 68 and died in a car crash because he was mad that a waitress wouldn't serve him it's a good way to go out though I guess it's not the worst way it's quick it's better than being hung by some racist for sure I do being hung would suck that sucks if you're gonna be executed what do you pick are we really doing this constant what do you want to talk to them that guys come on try to hang people what's the worst no how would you want to go out like let's say you're actually your set agenda quick you want a quick bullets are quick I go bullets for sure I used to want to say lethal injection but that shit's all bullets if someone knows what they're doing you know get someone to shoot you that actually knows how to shoot people what if you just get hit in the deck and then go Stan that's bad way to Dan to end like that catcher yeah just get hit right in the deck like the head of the deck not even like the ball is just no more dick how long is gonna be a before if you got shot in the foot your foot blows off they could take you to a lab and they grow you a new foot I think it's soon I feel like it's soon I feel like it's within 20 years I feel like within 20 years they're gonna be like you you if your hand got mashed and some sort of a vise they're gonna be able to give you a new hand I think it might even be sooner you might be but I'm giving 20 years so I look smart when it comes true yeah like you called it you're like yeah I feel like in 20 years but yeah you called it for more I'm all about brains where it's like I just don't want to go crazy yeah well they well not only that we want to be able to repair people that have been injured like car accidents yeah do you know the story of Sam Kinison yeah yeah yeah about how yeah go tell the story that well he he was one way as a child and then his mom says that he got hit by a car and then after that he was wild just crazy I mean he really got hit like to the point of you know they were worried he's gonna live he survived and he became a fuckin maniac and this world's talking about you with tomatoes he got on Twitter and just lost his representation no but I think that I I think that about myself a lot of times because I got hit in the head a lot when I was young and I'm like how much that affect me yeah I said affect my rational thinking how much did affect my ability to control my impulses you know like um I was um on a flight once with Michael Irvin Michael Irvin who's a really good guy was talking to me about kids who grow up in terrible environments in that these kids if they're in the room the womb and their mother is experiencing violence or stress or domestic violence or you know she sees crazy shit that those impulses go through her body and they directly affect the way the fetus develops and the children who grow up with violence around them like literally they're conceived and they have they develop inside the womb of a mother is experiencing on that they have a higher propensity for violence a shorter fuse they're more worried about things going badly inviting that there's more intense more quick to pull the trigger and that all of that is a direct response like a biological support system like your body's trying to keep you alive and that the more you encounter that sort of reinforces like the more times you get hit the more times things hit you the more times you get hurt the more times you know you crash heads as a football player or you get punched in the face as a boxer the more times a tomato hits your fucking dome at 90 miles an hour by some kid who thinks it's funny but whatever it is like what whatever things that are rattling your skull yeah those things reinforce your brains idea that violence can come at any moment and you have to be prepared and that's the quick switch you live it's the Scorpion the Frog shed it's like your nature keeps you alive and that quick trigger I think translates to various aspects of your life not just the things where there's a real situation where you have to deal with like you know you have to be able to react quickly because your body's programmed to be oh I get hit a lot I'm ready when things come to me I'm gonna fucking fight them off I'm gonna fight him ah I'm ready yeah or somebody talks to me shit on Twitter I'm gonna say shit to you who fuck you piece of shit I'm gonna say something that's gonna if I'm gonna call myself a white nigger I'm ready I said it first Yahoo drops it's a rasie verbal nuclear weapon on people it's like I knew a lot of uh girls that were like sexually abused kids as kids it became promiscuous because they're like I'm gonna fuck you before you fuck me whoa you know what I mean like that's that's common well there is that but I think there's also something that happens to people that were sexually abused as kids where they become hyper sexual as they get older for sure it's not it's not good I mean we're not looking at this in a positive way but I think we were talking about when it comes to throughout history human beings molesting children that it was insanely common and it probably wasn't until like what what year see people realize that's a horrible thing to do was it like the 1800s there's just one dudes like this is crazy because did they did the same thing with violence they like infantry comes from infant-like they would send the infantry was always like 12 year olds what yeah a tree comes from infants yeah it's four cannon fodder man they used to just send out the kids to get fucked up really yeah like right now in Africa why these like little militias like the kids is when you get the sociopaths cuz if you don't raise them right they'll fucking kill anybody god damn oh dude it makes me so cuz I was like my town was riddled with like pedophile priests and shit and so it had a real bad situation with legs riddled because we had a Monsignor that was messed up I'm it's long dead shit so it doesn't matter but like he would bring in other ones and like then they were just do you think they talked about it yeah for sure what do you think they said okay I can imagine man lays there I bet it was some kind of code and just it pushes back dude I was always and I I never I never think they talk like girls like guys talk about girls like the guys talk about girls like girls man she loves coke and she's down to fuck like do you think they literally talked about abusing kids the same way a man would talk about or a woman even would talk about hooking up with a guy a guy's got a big dick is gonna be awesome and they talked about a like an openly sexual way I can't I I don't I don't even now fuck like it's just like is there some so did they use that code but it like it crippled my town is full of like there's some weird shit going on there with that like not the time I live in now but the other like where I'm from great people well where I'm from what a pride where I'm from great town but like there's some shit going down you know it crazy that you could be in this great area and just one element makes the whole thing chaos just rot and everybody accepts that element because in some perverted way you really think all that kid fucking is connected to God dude and it always was the kid with no dad and shit that's why I'm fucking I have this hyper like like you're talking about that response shit that's mine where I'm like if you going after vulnerable people makes me insane well that was the Sandusky thing right like you would always go after kids it didn't have a family and right he would help them and he created all these organization rather too you know like a charity organization yeah to help these young kids he's just do it and that's why it's like I get furious about the people that misrepresent himself a lot more than like there's all these scandals in Hollywood now and and you know that the Spacey's and the Weinsteins of the world are so much more dark and evil than like you know there's that scan with Andy Dick and I like Andy Dick I'm like The Dude's an obvious dick rapper and he feels bad about it and he fucking just wants to get punched when they asked him what did he suppose is an initial what was his initial comment it was something like like kissing and licking is what he does he's been doing like that no mal misbehaviors is middle name or yeah misconduct misconduct they're signing up for some yeah yeah that you know they were upset be fired him from an indie film because of sexual misconduct by the way I hate to be cynical cuz I don't want to say that anybody wasn't victimized but if I was running an indie film that was so fucking stupid I hired Andy Dick yeah I might be the type of guy that would make a statement about Andy being Andy right it's like we're gonna put our foot down e-enough and then hey if you want to see this film it's gonna be appearing at the Sunset Plaza and blah blah blah good move it's at least gets people talking about something that they would never have talked about because Andy Dick hops into the the river of speculation as to who's a molester yeah but like for me he's so much like he's just he's not a snake yeah it's not like the snake in the grass where you're like oh that guy's misrepresenting himself Bill Cosby exactly it's it's a dude it's like I grabbed a dick and got knocked out yeah he's always just like a great grabber since Derek whoops he tried to grab my dick I knocked him down and then he apologized an outsider all good man I know that you just freaked out you get excited about Wiens man and Rita was like oh thanks for not really fucking up anything I'm like he's he's vulnerable it's about vulnerability dude it's like some people are just these vulnerable people and like I'm a giant like he's not trying to it's not about power he just blacks out and grabs wieners yeah but he's also like in a different way than you he's a perpetual button pusher but it's not necessarily like the worst thing in the world to be that button pusher but that is what he is yeah like he's not he's not as competent with it as you he doesn't navigate the waters that's not grabbing dicks Andes but like you know there's hills and valleys too like your interactions with people and like this certain Hills we like you go you just get way too crazy with it yeah and you bring it down and you try to figure out what's what's a good middle ground and II just it's all spikes it's all I got and that's what I have a hard time judging people like the the the person I've always been is trying to not be judgmental it's the it's the snakes that I'm like oh you're you're telling everyone about global warming in your private jet like you can go fuck yourself you know it's like it's the same with like Andy I'm like Andy has never acted like not a train wreck dick grabber and you're like when my friend died the dude wrote me a fucking sweet email like he's a sweet man he just blacks out tries to grab wieners get sober no more Weiner grabs and so when I seemed getting pulled through the muck I'm like you can't associate him with these like power fucked up guys that are like you want watch me whack off on a ficus but here's the thing like the one apart guy is that guy ever make it back now cuz no one's rooting for him anyway you know it's not like iron man it's like yeah that dude used to do a lot of fucking drugs but we're still written forms he's vulnerable Ryan you know it's like no one's wet no one relates to the guy whacking off on a fucking plant in for an iguana Paltrow you're like throw you're out man you're out you're out of it you're out of the tribe mmm like that's why the dude that you just interviewed I kill scene or whatever like he has a way in he has a way back in because everyone relates to reward right he's not like actually raping people he just got mixed up in like like likes and Twitter and shit but this is the idea that I want explore because I think it's fascinating is there like a point where a guy fucks up too many times like say if Harvey Weinstein jerked off into one plant one time he was on coke he got crazy and he's hanging out with some with that she's like one of the naked vampires and dust till dawn but she doesn't get to talk and you know she skip a snake on her and she's so hot and he's so fat and so gross that he's so cooked up and so drunk and he also has a billion dollars in the bag and he starts taking like a pushing a fucker movie I did I give him benefited I'm like that guy loves photosynthesis he loves it like dude he's whacking on a plant he's like yeah you take fucking carbon you sure know what photosynthesis that's for convecting changing sunlight sunlight into food I thought we're talking about whacking on a plant that's not photosynthesis in the plant making shit yeah but photosynthesis is like this specific process of a plant converting sunlight into energy no Emma's I've no i'm bossk let's find out what that is I could easily be wrong but I thought that photosynthesis meant inverting turning light yeah that's like it's like look at you making sugar out of some I get it I get it so he got excited by the photosynthesis see that's the thing is now people are starting to treat me like I'm this like moral high-ground guy and I don't want what wait hold on who's doing that because the fucking standing up for three-year-olds and I'm like good I wouldn't judge one plant back I'm not as the difference between you know like transgender three-year-olds and some coked up studio executive of course here's the thing like I don't want to excuse anybody's behavior that's done anything that victimizes other people but it is a fascinating aspect of Hollywood culture that forever if you wanted to get apart you had to go to the casting couch and everybody knew it and there was a lot of those guys that had disproportionate relationships like they were disgusting right he's disgusting and his wife is fuckin smokin he ever seen Harvey's wife no she's um open and you know no need to bring her into this at all but I'm just explaining like this is a consistently disproportionate relationship that exists throughout Hollywood like there's the guy who was insanely wealthy but physically vile and he somehow or another managed to dunk his dick in attends before he pokes himself into an early grave but that is a fucking common common common theme yeah and I'm not judging that that guy who's just getting tans when he's a - that's the American dream how do you do it though exactly it's about hating women it's about it is about heat right but this is my point it's like you do not get to dunk your dick in tens unless you do all the things that that guy did he produced Shakespearean love that's a dick doc I'm not I'm not excusing him I'm not exonerating him and I'm saying like women do not naturally feel attracted to obese guys with bad skin it isn't this is not a common thing right I didn't order for him to force the outcome that he desires he has to cross cultural and appropriate boundaries you know this is just like we're dealing with like mathematics right we're literally and I'm not exonerating him again I can't believe I have to say this but I don't want anybody taking this out of context if you were dealing with this as a system as a biological system like say if you're looking at it from afar and you had no connection to culture no connection to civilization you've like well what is this how does the system working like how is this one like extremely flawed biological entity losing its way into these perfect shapes like it finds a way to penetrate these perfect shapes with thin waist and per asses and beautiful faces and his face is just pile of slobbiness and just disgust and because growing hair on top of it and a little fat dick and just shoots incompetent sperm into the mouths of tens yeah what what what is happening here what is happening here well what's happening here is there's no way he would have been able to do it any other way it's like so like he's not Thor right he's not he's not some fucking Ryan Reynolds type character with perfect cheekbones he's just like blah and he's just feeding that back with coke and fucking booze and blowjobs and constantly trying to put out more things that allowing it by the biggest fucking house the highest hills yes I mean this is literally the only way he can do that yeah anyway you can do that is to be disgusting like girls aren't just gonna line up I loved I loved your movies and I'm just like you do it to me what you want you'll get one out of a million that do that but that's not enough like they have to they would have to find him through the crowd that's not gonna work it's not gonna work it's almost like that crazy mindset and again not exonerating not excusing but that mindset of like look what is the mindset of someone who wants to run the fastest race what is the mindset of someone who wants to make the fastest jet bike 0 to 100 time when you fucking hang onto these handlebars what is the mindset of that I don't know but it seems to be some sort of bizarre quasi competitive biological environment where people are chasing some strange unattainable highest ground right yeah that was coming from like a slight flaw like the sand makes the Pearl the colloid comedians are a little flawed like sure somebody commented and I like they were talking shit but I was like you're so right to go dude Owen is the tallest do with the Napoleon complex that I received and I was like you're fucking right man it's like ambition comes from this weird like feeling of threat where you're like at any moment like like I got a try I got to work really hard I was trying to work on this bit but it is never went anywhere about like civilizations based on cock size where you got the Japanese in the English take over the whole world cuz their chick is like we need ma you know you dick no good and then like sub-saharan Africans have these monster hammers and their chicks like you're not taking over shit you got that big old cock they just stay put exactly where it's almost like ambition sometimes can come from insecurity which I am riddled with and a lot of ambitious people are totally which is the point that I was making there's like you have to be disgusting to want to chase down tail to the point where you willing to rape as like at that level right and it's like and I think like that guy gets a billion dollars and he realizes chicks still don't want to fuck how many spirals well I don't think it matters I think he's constantly caught up in the pursuit of doing it you know and I think probably it was like super exciting to get the young starlet who I didn't know any better didn't didn't you know wasn't really a hundred percent sure she was gonna make it in Hollywood yeah and having that threat of like controlling her career over her like a giant vampire and then that was the horrific nature of it for those women that's what's getting people particularly angry about this not that he was a fat gross guy trying to get laid like and those throughout the throughout human history course has always been people trying to get laid but is that he was doing in in a way that was victimized exactly causing psychic scars yeah cause like I what is this well now it's just getting crazy it's just like it's gonna be like Kermit the Frog control but it's like God like I'm the opposite I need like a ton of consent like I'm like it's like oh I like your dick attacks but but you don't love the deck have you ever seen people like there's been people that have said that you should have a consent form and these should videotape the signing of the consent form I was watching this YouTube thing where this guy was like talking about consent forms and like that you should get people to sign a consent form and like what Michael Jordan does that shit I think you're like a billionaire maybe but like that's fucked up that takes away the whole thing well it's definitely a different thing it's like what a consent form it's like a merger and acquisition it's like two companies like your dick like dick Inc and pussy Corp you know it's like are you cool with this you gotta sign that shit well I mean you're seeing things where people didn't feel cool about it many years later but in the moment maybe they just let it happen and they decide that that letting it happen was way worse you know then they were thinking about it at the time and decided some sort of a sexual assault and then it spirals onward and outwards like you know week it would be really nice if people were just attracted to each other I know but like it's like some more think it pasted some of these people those when they're like talking about like eye contact being some shit like I had a friend like this is this is dark but whatever there was a you know she was kidnapped and like gang-raped and nothing yeah did its and I like there's so many false or like stupid accusations that like it clogs up the system the point where I'm like you know I wanted to just kill these people you know and like I did I'm the wolf is getting in me the wolf well there's the boots urban you know I'm talking about how I want to kill the standard on its podcast blends up once every couple weeks but uh yeah it made me really fear infrastructure like where I'm like other cops come with a pencil it's not that CSI shit and it's like there's Pete there's people out there that legitimately hurt women and I want them to die you know and it's like you know there's a nine-month wait on like a rape kit because fucking some chick regretted some shit when she was like texting and coming over with condoms you know I'm like we got to start triaging some of this shit you know well you got a we have to be very very strict on both sides of what we tolerate you know and we cannot tolerate real rape but we also cannot tolerate false accusation it's 100 percent cannot tolerate indulgences where people have distorted perceptions of reality and they paint what they know somewhere at least subconsciously to be some very inaccurate interpretation of the events of course and we also can't can we we can't condone the cosby type shit that went on for years we can't condone rape we can't condone people who drug people or abused people we can't condone that shit no I don't either one of those things but I think more importantly is there's something going on right now where there's a hyper-charged environment where people are terrified being called out and people are like waiting like looking around like what's gonna happen next and then people are thinking about some shit that happened to him a long time ago well you know what this has been fucking sitting in my craw for 18 years Dustin Hoffman it's time to world know yeah and I don't like hard-boiled eggs Dustin I don't know what's true and I don't know what's not true I do not know I I cannot comment and no one can but it's this there's something that's going on where this I would hope and I this is what I always hope I always hope that any wave that goes this way eventually goes that way and I hope that any outrage leads to more understanding yeah man all this stuff and all this especially this fucking reap shit that I feel like there's more rape talk today and more understanding of how many girls get approached or fucked with or harassed or even actually rape or drugged yeah and we ever thought before that I'm hoping this conversation leads to more understanding early on in people's lives before they form this idea of what is and isn't acceptable yeah because that's a good thing from it yes is is making people be like you can't treat women this way especially if young kids here early for sure but hear it when you're young so that you don't ever grow up in some sort of an environment with the people around you tell you it's okay and that it's us versus them and fuck those bitches to work he's home yeah there's a lot of people grow up with that I know and it's like you want to be so good that women want to fuck you that's what makes civilization grow it's the move dude you know what I can see Beethoven by ear you think it wasn't for someone to take I had a great penis I'm just kidding a start when I was three I didn't know what I was doing you did somehow know that you were male he's identified as if you have where I always say be the man that you pretend to be when you trying to get laid that's awesome just be that guy well know we can all do that and by the way if you weren't that guy two weeks ago and someone keeps like sticking your face it doesn't mean you're not that guy now all right relax everybody relax with the finger-pointing like if some dude makes them sort of a terrible mistake goes off the rails a month ago or whatever it is just it doesn't mean that he's not he's it's an ineffective process he's a trial-and-error process yeah and you can't judge someone entirely by the errors forgiveness and growth it's also like you gotta you gotta judge the whole thing as a big picture you can't say you know in 2001 Arnold Schwarzenegger pulled out his dick in a sauna yeah and you know it's like he was jacked up he's trying to beat some people in weightlifting it was probably trying to psychologically intimidate someone - yeah I made love to about this you want to cut touch the dick where it all happened you think you can clean and press you think you can even fit us in your mouth you're less of a man and that woman is a woman and another thing is we can't keep calling men like toxic because men good men keep these fuckin shitty rapists men beaten down somebody put this on a fucking pole the other day and they sent it to me and somebody put this off photo of it or they saw an image of it and they sent it to me whether they took it themselves it said eliminate masculinity uh-uh listen when the Vikings come and dude it gonna need men and the most masculine guys I know are the least likely to fuckin rape anybody they're the ones that defend women yes well there's a few that's women are attracted to yeah there's your question guys there's some dark lot and you know what here's the thing about a lot of those dark people the dark like the color I'm he meant pigment John I didn't I didn't the dark mindset the the predatory rapist mindset there's a ton of those people that come directly from trauma that come from being violated themselves they come from being in bad situations they come from being programmed incorrectly and exam again I'm not exonerating them I'm not excusing them I'm just thinking that it would do us all a world of good if we could look at these people from afar I didn't experience that I didn't grow up in a family filled with crime I didn't grow up in a family filled with violence and murder and and and I did in a neighborhood filled with people robbing people leftover I didn't grow up with that yeah am I looking at it is as a complete third party outsider but I'm thinking a to pretend to imagine what it was like to grow up in watts in the 1960 yeah try to pretend what would it was like to be in Compton in the 90s try to pretend well this way ethic transcends that is still cruelty cuz like I'll hang with legit gang members and feel safe what are you hanging with cameras well I'll do like Cleveland and brav and then afterwards I'm smoking blunts with like dudes that you know I believe in improv as gang members you know there's some there's some fucking people man it's like you know someone's wearing a Bulls hat in the city without red or like someone's got teardrop tattoos and like I don't feel scared because I don't like if they have a body count it's because of threats and business it's not like cruelty and I think that there's even in like fucked up environments you still have the cruel man and the good man even if they like do things that you don't agree with in your social economic era that's the hero's journey right the strong person that's kind enough to take care of the people that are weak that's what that what everybody wants right it's someone who's a strong person that looks out for the weak person which is why everybody like they turn bully which guy think it's overused look sometimes bullying gets used when people are equals and once someone's critiquing someone oh you're really like I don't listen I just think that's stupid that doesn't make me a bully right you're you're using it wrong this is not we're not talking about children we're not talking about people that are physically weaker than me like let's let's be clear about what the fuck we mean when we say this very polarizing word right that word is polarizing because we absolutely don't want to be the person that's in the position of physical moral ethical economic whatever it is superiority who has influence over the other person's life and steps in and fucks with it yeah that's what that's what a bully is people respond okay with passion like it can be like fuck these people and people are like okay even if you're a little off the mark you're not trying to hurt people to make yourself feel better for your own inadequacies that's what's evil or if you are you need to understand that that's what you're doing right because we're all evil we're all evil and good just make the move but also just to have someone like pointed out makes you go am i like and think about it you're not necessarily your words and your actions what you are as how you've dealt with your past words and actions and make corrections I mean that's that's really what you are I mean that's and that's what's really important because if we don't give people that leeway they don't ever learn from their mistakes yeah don't ever learn from their mistakes then we we're essentially committing to a future with no one learning anything right yeah it's like I gave up dave smith and steven crowder both this uh this compliment it's like because even if you disagree with someone the thing I love about people is like if you make a good point they look excited and happy versus threatened when I'm like even if you're not on the path that I'm on you're still trying to like carve your fucking sculpture with it to a beautiful and not a threatening posture yeah and that has nothing to do with the left or the right I mean it's really just how you approach information yeah a hundred percent yeah because I think a lot of times people from the right do not want to accept good ideas from the left and vice verse I think that's just it's a real issue that people have and that's a weakness to it is a weakness yeah and I've experienced it from my own mind and I'm sure you have from yours probably see my Twitter everybody but it's important that we realize like what what is that reaction that we had and how do we how do we mitigate the negative aspects of it and how do we figure out how we got to that point where we said something maybe we didn't believe or we we you know we we reacted to something in a way where if given time to reconsider our you know the potential of going this way with it or that way with it we probably come up with a better idea yeah cool thing you do for men especially max like speak on behalf of mecca's identify the winner in Boston thank you it's like you you make people think about their actions where it's like it's like about mine yeah think about yours too which is why we gravitate to each 100% where it's like what is this good is this is this productive for me my family society like what exactly am i doing right now and it's like and with my recent shit like some people are like oh how's your wife feel about your spiral I'm like spiral I'm like she's never wanted to fuck me Maura do you Twitter numbers keep going up dude I know my spiral I know and I'm like oh I'm representing a group of people that they keep writing me emails like thank you so much for not calling me just evil for I like what I you know my basic beliefs yeah cuz I'm not supporting racist sexist bigoted homophobic a cake it you know it's fucking crazy dude and it's like and I'm not gonna fall in that trap either where I'm like Oh a Jewish grandmother my wife's Hispanic my piano teachers fucking trans it's like no my idea is strong and I don't need to justify it with my association with people that you fucking have justified it and with with good reason like it really does it is a trump card when you say look my dad's probably gay Hey look my dad wears outfits that are questionable but he's a loving man Hey look my piano teacher used to be a dude a woman now yeah woman now dude yeah I became aware same thing okay it's all there like my wife's Hispanic and not like Spain Spanish like Home Depot max again yeah called you white supremacist like okay I see what you're trying to do and it is so transparent that it minimizes everything you're ever gonna say ever from this point on on this subject because I always have to think well your intentions are disingenuous well you're trying to do is divert people from the actual reality so this Shawn King guy maybe he's a really good guy I know maybe it's just that white guy's a dickhead well he's only a white guy maybe he's a good could be an albino a Nigerian I don't think he's that no it looks just like his dad his brother yeah maybe he's a really good guy and this is just he hangs out with the wrong people and has the wrong ideas in his head and he's followed the wrong operating system to an illogical perspective right the only way to disagree with you is to call you a guy married to a home depot Mexican white supremacy of course I don't like she doesn't work at Home Depot she works at Lowe's I know she listen I've known a long time you're the opposite of a racist you're just not yeah it's so fucked up like right now and 2070 it's like if you're truly not you sound almost racist cuz you're like you're like if I'm gonna make fun of the wife I'm making fun of everybody like if you stand up and say hey you can't just openly make fun of all white people this fucking racist too and if you do I'm to talk about you know your employment record dude I saw this lady's tweets and I did not retweet it I thought about retweet and I'm like I should fucking turn some fire on this bitch well that's what I'm for don't we know about you doctor up the heat okay I don't want to do I don't want to be the guy's dm's get discovered and finds out I've been secretly plotting against radical feminists but this lady wrote she wrote all white cisgendered if you don't know what cisgender it is it's not real but what it is just heterosexual men who are actually heterosexual tada if the way to marginalize normal people that's the norm acknowledge it goes all white cisgendered men are shit and less proven otherwise okay honey you might be a cunt right kind and I know you don't want to be a cunt but you probably like I don't maybe it's the geometry of your nasal passage to cheekbone to chin structure maybe you got crooked teeth maybe your unathletic and guys don't want to fuck you maybe you've dealt with all the wrong guy maybe a perfect genetics maybe your brain is accelerated maybe you look at me like I'm the stupid ape that I am I don't know what the answer is right you can't say that now have no repercussions for your actions you can't say all white straight men who identify as men are shit until proven otherwise because that is crazy it's racist and it's stupid because if that was the case we were all shit there would be a goddamn rape Festival in the streets of every major city all over the world if you really thought that we were all bad let me tell you what all bad looks like yeah all bad looks like the world filled with coked up Vikings just running through this tree mouth fucking everybody you've ever met that's what men can do and I'm not bragging but that's what if you're if you if you have lingerie on and you can close your eyes and walk through a football field in front of a large crowd yeah like one of them cheerleaders for like football yeah and no one just tackles you and starts fucking you and that's a win that's a win that is because most people don't want that to happen yes well I'm convinced that's why they keep coming it like white American dudes because we're some of the most chill guys yeah but we've done something oh there's some fucked up shit but they're coming at us for a reason not and I'll say us no we don't have a rape culture though we we see a rapist we go fuck that guy well they there is a lot of rape but the problem is until now there wasn't enough of an ability to express what written and on both sides like some people call things rape that's like we had been oh you were both drunk and it was consensual right ring if they ruin two dudes life falls where that's happened yeah I had fattiest Russell on he was talking about the incident in Occidental College where a man and a woman technically they're both like over 18 they did they got drunk they decided to have sex the girl called the guy texts him you have condoms the whole deal they did agreed to get together and after the fact the girl's friends decided that it was sexual assault because she was intoxicated not even taking into account they were both intoxicated right both agreed and there was text messages back and forth remorse does not equal rape having a bad experience and yeah both for the guy and the girl I mean it's just like people fuck up and they make mistakes so you got it you got to figure out what is and what isn't and with Thaddeus was talking about was that the girl went back to school with no repercussions but the boy was it's overdue life is old yeah don't do cross there were two people who were attracted to each other who were exchanging text messages who were influenced by the ideals and the the ideology of all the people around them dude how the media just like hits Trump so hard that sometimes I'm like back off so I can mock him a little you know where it's like is it like because I have that instinct of like dude I can't mock a guy everyone's fucking unfairly calling shit he's not but it's like look at this guy who in Occidental College I don't remember his name but look at this kid and then compare them to Bill Cosby exact dude exactly I don't recall out real snakes let's call a real rapist a real rapist and call an 18 year old kid who was drunk or no Howell he is maybe he's 20 and a 20 year old girl who was drunk call them kids call them kids yeah it's not like this guy drugged her and duct-taped her like let's let's but look at what it really is is it really just two kids that got intoxicated and had intercourse with each other right and then one of them felt bad goddamn how many times you feel bad about sex yeah a lot because it's almost like that that that that thing of like the Leprechaun like he got caught what leprechaun girl it's like an old parable it's just real short I'm not gonna drag on a parable but like a leprechaun got caught and he's like yeah I'll give you the treasure it's under the tree with the fucking ribbon on it so we put the ribbon on all the trees so now the ribbon doesn't mean shit so everything's rape rape isn't rape it's like if everything's racist racism isn't racism and you're like you're now taking away our ability to identify predators yeah and it's like dudes like us it's like I pray these I promise you if if a guy brags about rape will fuck that dude up it's like no one likes that guy you're in a small enough community where people feel responsibility right that's the big problem I read about this once this is a phrase called diffusion and responsibility that happens in a large group of people that see something happen like there was a pretty Genevieve where she got killed in front of 40 people in New York City exactly yeah exactly there was a picture of video rather from Chicago really recently and see if you can find Jamie where a guy assaults a woman and he did it on a security camera he had kicked her and knocked her out I mean it was fucking awful I don't know what led to it but this guy punched her and then I mean like skillfully head kicked her like he took martial arts before it's kayode she falls down and a bunch of people walk over and start filming her Jesus Christ this is one that I I don't think i retweeted because I think I'm not I'm not entirely sure if I remember correctly but I think I thought about retweet and I'm like look people don't need to see this yeah that's something I want to promote and support yeah it was but someone wrote this is like an episode of Black Mirror because this guy kicked this girl and instead of calling 911 these people are filming this girl while she's curled up and did you find it this good um it's I don't even know if you I want you to find it this but this girl curls up into filming it on the sidewalk and they're standing around here filming it well I think all right I think a big political divide isn't good evil blah blah blah it's it's population density it's like cities like what we're talking about all these monkeys going by each other no one's eating each other's faces you want a powerful government to keep a chill but if you live in a place with a 40-minute police response time it's about individuality and that's when you need to start going more libertarian because it's like well I have a gun and chickens you know versus like a big city where it's like we need a powerful government to keep everyone relaxed now I can't always rely on dabby fucking daddy doesn't do shit daddy's a guy wanted a job being daddy yeah that's what police daddy is police daddy is I mean and sometimes you get great guys and sometimes you get fools yeah it's like across the board like you might run into the best guy ever when you shopping at Walgreens you might run into a fucking moron right knowing exactly man it's like a job needed to be filled and you might have hit the perfect guy and I love the way to describe cops it's like it's the hardest job in the world the hardest the hardest soldier and then you you you meet cops are like god bless you man you're the greatest enemy cop sir I'm like oh you wanted power fuck you man and it's like it's it's such a hard job it's like teacher you know it's like my family or teachers and it's like oh these are like a throwaway job we're just gonna be a teacher it's like oh you're gonna educate the youth and cops are gonna keep us safe those are our fucking warrior heroes you know and you know what I mean this is a very easy thing for me to say when I said I haven't had a bad experience with cops because I haven't I really haven't I mean I've had cops like get mouthy with me before but I've always I was said no cert and thank you very much yeah I've always have been like I've always like immediately try to defuse a situation but I'm a white guy I you know I speak pretty calmly I I'm a comedian I'm an entertainer a lot of them know me from the UFC at this point it's almost like I'm out of the game right this point like cops were into me like almost all cops or fans of the UFC yeah so if I run into a cop the cops like oh it's Joe Rogan hey man oh hey what's up man realizes like oh this is a guy I'm not a terrorist like I'm not I'm not a criminal I mean I'm out of the confusion like he doesn't have to worry about me shooting him in the head Oh totally and it's a shake his hand I'm like what's up brother how you doing everything we're all good so I'm almost looking at it like a privileged outsider but even when I was young cuz you know my actual biological dad was a cop I don't know him I never knew him you know I knew him till I was like six got great genes in him bro but that but I when I was a kid I remember thinking like what a crazy job like he has to go out and right here is fear fear fear but it's also probably one of the reasons why that led him to be so fucked up you know and I never really like let him off the hook for that but I saw a lot of dark shit from my actual biological dad when I was a little kid like violent stuff and I was like well of course he's lit he's a cop in New Jersey yeah 1967 like how do you how do you not be fuckin violent like totally you're not gonna live you know I could survive you're you're on the front line and then going from that to martial arts from the time I was like 15 years old not I was completely immersed in martial arts and I ran into a ton of cops and they were all like regular guys and that made me think okay this when I think of a cop I don't think of someone that I'm running into that's trying to lock me up I think of some poor guy who has this position in life where he's the guy who has to put the badge on and hold the gun and wear the stupid hat and stand in front of the criminal and go put your hands up right right I hope he doesn't get shot by a guy behind him that he doesn't know exists and this is his life 24/7 all day long comes home to his kids their sleep and he kisses him on the head and he thinks about the kid that he saw shot in the apartment building in the Bronx oh dude is to think about that stuff it's like I'm boys with a lot of cops where I live in a lot of them are troopers who are like really well-trained and they're like the coolest dudes ever and they just it's almost like the cops emotion is just like it's like you just microwaved your fucking baby dude yeah you know where it's like they see the shit and then like I do all benefits for like a tour de force and shit for like fallen officers and because I have so much compassion for that shit man it's like they are the watchdogs of our area but then you get the bad seed or you get someone who makes a horrific mistake and then justice isn't given and that's why it's complicated you know sometimes it's about like lawsuits where it's like you know someone fucks up and no one wants to admit they're wrong and then the community that witnessed that is like they want they're like they just want justice but what's also the punishment of fucking up is so extreme oh my god imagine we bomb and we fucking kill a guy you know it's like we are one of our jokes bombs and someone fucking is kid dies Oh like that's why dude cops deserve a lot of respect it did it's like it's a crazy job it's a crazy job and you're dealing with pressure that most of us could never possibly imagine and the life and death decisions that happen at the blink of an eye and you are responsible for those decisions for the rest of your life and this is like something I talk about too much Jamie can you keep a conversation with Owen Benjamin I'm a lightweight I don't know how to hold my pee anymore bareback and now Malcolm Gladwell's got that blink that blink book man man he's about to pee out of his car and it's the first time he's had to do this during a podcast I think over October fucked him up yeah he never has to piss never it's a three and a half hours over two and a half hours in two I think this one's gonna go for a while yeah I was gonna get you guys some more ice if you needed it so did I fucking love Rogan man he's such a good dude what are you looking at I had a couple of things pulled up to talk to you guys about you talked to me about anything man we were talking about South Park before this to the greatest show ever made what was going on and you said there's Halloween episode just happened yeah it's about no it's uh you got to see the name of John spark it's a like the dudes drink jack and smoke crack that's not that's not a spoiler it's the first act of the episode but definitely check it out I just think that like sometimes like people ask me where I land politically and I usually just tell them South Park because it's like it's just this objective as you can probably get to the point where Trey Parker is like a fucking genius dude awesome such a big fan I wish she would come talk to us here one time but um I got trip trip soccer if you're listening you did hire me once at comic-con in San Diego if you remember that uh to host a thing so why don't you come on the Rogan podcast yeah they just had their new video game came out I don't know if I was trying to explain that to you you were talking about the game's called fractured but whole not but whole but the word bu T and that WH o le o butthole exactly play let's profound but you have to take a shit in everybody's house all over the city to be mark making your mark dude the thing I love about South Park is that they they go after everybody and that's why I have like so much respect for them you know they tried to go after Islam as much as they went after the Mormons and that's why I'm like you guys are great you know cuz it's all about just like no one gets a pass because that's when you create martyrs and shit you know I like doing podcasts way better high and stoned and drunk do this is really fine it's way more fun yeah sober October is important you know why just like running up a hill is important because it makes you appreciate naps do it in ways that I miss my weight fast yeah you got to do chin-ups at weight vests it's view important you a champs more than pull-ups day they're both the same to me I just need pulling exercises I mean there's a bunch of different ones I actually have these things where the handles rotate ya watch different ways but it's just a matter of lifting your body weight I think when I talked about movement before it's one of things that I got from this whole month of doing yoga and I knew I've been doing yoga pretty pretty extensively others guys are switching back and forth that's a good movie that tough I wasn't ask you about that yeah it's hard to do yeah it's hard it's hard to release it's because you're essentially throwing yourself up and then exploding to catch yourself and wonder if you wax off like that why not well once you keep switching what I learned from the yoga thing though and I've learned over the last few years is like there you could it's a balance issue like what yoga does is balance everything out not just balance in terms of your ability to stand on one foot but also balance the difference between the strength of your major muscle groups and then your tendons and your back and your core and the connecting things like your knees and your hips and all these the things you never take into consideration like you don't really put a lot of emphasis on when you're doing other things but when you do yoga you guys oh my feet are giving out first huh oh like my hips are getting sore when I get into triangle pose like oh my you know and all that different stuff that you do that like it leads to like the strengthen of strengthening of ignored aspects of the entire system and it also keeps you off your phone like I've been doing hot yoga with my wife and it's like it's so hard and she's so good at it and like it's so funny because she'll do will do hot yoga together like once a week maybe twice a week and she'll get real horny and I'm getting real dehydrated so it's like that it's the most frustrating combination because it's like she gets really in touch with her body and she's so fucking hot it's like awesome but then I'm like oh I need about a gallon of water to make my cock like awesome mmm well just drink that gallon of water I work on it thank you I usually under bring water into the hot area tea do the yoga is you got to drink the water beforehand yeah I'm usually hungover from the fucking PBRs yeah you got a drink especially the hot yoga you got a drink like try to drink like a leader like a leader of water like maybe you know an hour before yeah even more yeah try to drink what is 64 ounces how much is that it has an ounce is 2 liters it's all confusing god I wish would switch over to the metric system it's way better that's one English fucking King that just screwed it for everybody yeah with his foot but we tried it again in the United States and I want to say the 70s or the 80s 2.7 liters per day 91 ounce 64 ounces of water per day recommending we consume 91 ounces okay so 2.7 liters is 91 ounces so 64 liters is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 liters oh yeah 1.8 1.8 9 liters I think that's that's what I bring to yoga I bring a 64 ounce thing I think this year's you can get that in the before class like if you could get up early and drink water yeah lemon in it you'll have a better performance because it's literally like like and I see a lot from guys that get dehydrated and try to make weight yeah you're literally dealing with the electrical signals that go to your muscles and I got a fire and brain and brain yeah look I got a camel pack and I crush it while I'm mowing my lawn do you use like a water bladder and with a straw yeah I love it yeah because I usually when I cross-country ski because if I like pull my hand out of my glove like my pan first yeah those are great for hiking too yeah and hot well if you're at a hot or cold weather at high climates and high altitudes oh you get dehydrated shit like an aspen like the ass Mikami festival back in the day today I'd have like three beers and be like I'm king of the world I did a show with Louis black and they had oxygen backstage for us really I was like Louis what the fuck is the oxygen for it's like I guess if one of us goes too hard they slapped that fucking mask on your face Oh like that's crazy dude training up there that's like we're the Olympics trained shit sometimes yeah because it's like fucking I'm dying for it anytime you can get at high altitude just they'd say you you should actually work out at low altitude but live most of your life at high altitude I'm not like 3,000 that's good yeah thousand is definitely better than zero you know and if you can get accustomed to that they say I talked to a dude once when I lived in Boulder and he told me that it takes three years for you to fully acclimate to a high altitude but that once you do fully acclimate there's like extreme like cardiovascular benefits well but you get a sweet boner maybe not maybe that's the trade-off you can run forever but your dick is always three-quarter man that's what I miss about LA is the beach runs and then totals no it's the people like dudes like you and like just really like brilliantly creative people and also the beach runs and shits the physical beauty here I don't miss that at a ministry or the traffic I'm a different kind of beauty right like you're in the mountains oh it's so gorgeous but I missed those like the oxygen zero fucking feet sea level just running I we used to live in Marina del Rey in that path I just listened to Dan Carlin just about fucking Chang's Kaunas I just run with my fucking camel pack and that was a blast that's that's the thing about la that i think is really beautiful is like the amount of biomes like mountain you know there's some desert there's some beach ocean yeah yeah I think you're right but I think you know if you have the ability to travel to all of them you well I think you appreciated probably where you moved when you first moved there right yeah and I still love it though man like now I'm like I'm always miss it when I'm away from it but I know what you're saying yeah it's easy right it's easy to get like real accustomed to what you see right in front of your face yeah and like I have so many memories now with my family they're my chicken just giving me food every day they just keep shitting out eggs and have wolves up there either right we've got coyotes and I've learned a lot about coyotes from your podcast dan Flores do you kill them they multiply the brown ones you can't kill coyotes it's actually the worst thing you can do well the things spread their range too it's a mere ah there's a type of catfish er Fisher's Fisher Cats to keep Jack in my shit and foxes and raccoons or my enemies coyotes not so much coyotes will get a chicken if they can but coyotes are smart they were oddly clever like they figure out how to avoid people you know one of the things that I found most fascinating about Dan Flores his book coyote America was the mythology that the Native Americans had about coyotes that the coyote is essentially a God yeah and the coyote was a God that was watching over you like watching what you did all the time constantly judging you and trying this looks really weird like the Native American and you know some tribes their interpretation of what a coyote was it's really fast I mean they're pretty powerful if like if they Jack your chickens like sometimes like we're talking about empathy like what's it like to live a different life I'm like what if I needed these chickens like I got more chickens but we had one chicken Holocaust and I'm like we're fuck now imagine that was like a winner and like the chickens are gone it's like what do we write but here's the thing you weren't fucked but the coyote is like this is I had a weird come to Jesus moment when it came to coyotes when a coyote stolen my chickens and I wash down about they tricky trick my dog something dick call there's a honey big dick yeah Johnny Cash Johnny Cash is my Mastiff and Johnny Cash is a tank this is how fucked up Johnny Cash's Johnny Cash got into the chicken coop just like huh need a couple of months ago just a couple of months ago Johnny Cash tore through the chicken wire with his paws and got it in it was a chicken Holocaust in there just kill dog who's needing them yeah he killed like four chickens in one setting it was a disaster and I saw him in my underwear I went outside I was like I looked out the window and I looked I saw the Choi fuck and I ran downstairs in my underwear yanked him out of the chicken coop I pick him up and throw him outside he's fucking 12 he's an old man good for him - I'm still getting after it just kidding at did you do you like named your chicken to get bumped yeah well I don't but my wife does can you get a cookie and for Meredith and shit princess petunia princess petunia got jacked by Johnny Cash laughs why I do by what names like deer and shit like one spot I'm like I think my brother wants to kill spot dude yeah I fuck spot up don't do that you know but that's that's the thing it's like I if they were in my neighborhood I would always I would probably name him - yeah but and I'm like a road a lot that's when I know she misses me when she's like oh here comes David I'm like the raccoon raccoon it's always just a fucking animal you know spot might have to go David might have to go yeah cuz my brothers getting into hunting now and like I think he wants to kill spot so you I have thought you talked about it before the podcast that you thought about actually getting and hunting yourself but you don't want to wound out right I want to get has to be a quick kill like is that I would love to hunt and and my wife wants me to hunt because uh because my uncle hunts a lot whenever we stay with him he's always got like pheasant shit and like it gets me pretty jacked up like natural animals I think there is some juice in it it's like there's something different there's something going on does anybody around you hunt and is willing to take you and literally are you everybody they want to mentor me oh fuck yeah all you have to do is learn how to shoot a rifle right and here's the mean there's a lot you could read about shooting but you you have to get someone who sets up the scope correctly sets up the rifle correctly and then you just have to someone have someone teach you the proper form and how to just only move your finger just pull pull pull pull pull pull and get a surprise shot yeah can't go huh yeah try to shoot because you'll flinch and the minor movement left or right over a hundred yards could equal it could be the difference between a lethal shot and shooting an animal in the butt yeah and anybody who's shot a rifle including me has done that before it's not good and we shoot a lot you know like oh we have we'll shoot like ar-15s and shit like in the well we'll get a nice section of land like my brother has 40 acres in this beautiful area and it's like and by the way it's so cheap up there dude you can get an acre for like 800 bucks you know and you just get this this you can wait you can get an acre of land for 800 bucks and it's the most beautiful shit you've ever seen these are direct flights there's a there's an airport and fucking syrup yeah you have to fly like you have to fly like Syracuse or some shit and then take a puddle jump or that killed there's some lethal there's some lethal flights yeah there's enough ah there's enough like super wealthy people there that we have like a pretty huge it Airport in this little area because it's but they fly their own jetson those fuckers they do they fly their private jets into your little funky town yeah and then they just sit there and then we are always like we pay us to hunt for you yeah but dude you do like it up there my brother's like dude wants a hunt because it's like it's many animals you have up there what kind of animals we have moose deer it's probably hard to get a moose tag though right now it's not that hard mushiya it's hard to miss yeah they're talking about shooting a house they're like an ancient looking animal man it's so crazy looking and they're fucking vicious a well they are rare in the deer family like all deer will fuck you up if they have to especially they're in rut they're just like yeah but a moose will try to fuck you up yeah there's a difference because they're constantly dealing with grizzly bears and brown bears and they can fuck you up they can fuck their big dude I saw one wants up there it was like I was like a come to Jesus moment rhyme like ah I'm not I'm a guest in this area dude I shot one that was young he was like a four key like he had like a little fork on the left and a fork on the right and each one of his legs was over a hundred pounds I had a scoop his leg up and throw it over my shoulder yeah bigger than a liwon okay it's almost like a stone in England where it's like how many alley Long's do you weigh there's a I did a cover for Peterson's hunting magazine and on the cover I'm holding a moose leg over my shoulder yeah and it's a crazy picture you look at how big that fucking leg is and that's not a big moose the moose that I shot was only like maybe 900 pounds it's like fairly small for a moose but that's like the entire offensive line of the Dallas Cowboys yeah there's there is right there that's awesome that moose woulda fucked me up yeah like there's not a way in hell you could have stopped that moves from stomping a hole in your chest yeah and they want to it's like a lot of prey animals get is video almost as vicious the Predators even though I don't feel as much empathy for the priors like if I wounded a fucking yeah I'd be like yeah you learn your lesson bro my brother recently hit up raccoon with a pitchfork and he lived and I don't feel bad at all well he lived as far as you know yeah he's definitely dead now yeah come in ahead house definite handsome like leakage yeah that was the rapist man that was the Weinsteins coming in trying to get our hands we fucking stabbed his ass no he was more ethical like what he was doing he's just trying to eat he just found a way to eat it me starvin he's in that hardscrabble life of the wilderness and where there's some there's a lot of food up there like it's a beautiful area there's no supermarkets for raccoons do they have a Whole Foods reckons out there it's a lot of quinoa work for raccoons quinoa soy isolate I love P protein does this does that give you boobs like that too much soy you you would know that shit I think it's like extraordinary amounts I think it's one of those things where people like real the over exaggerate the impact of it to emphasize the femininity of going vegan right like I don't think it really makes you a woman but I think that you know guys like hey look and you could just eat bison right dude get harder soy let bono you stop playing flowers he's still lactating yeah you start speed walking to Bisons good shit yeah that's good shit they were almost gone the soy really cause man boobs let's find out we're gonna what website is this and fitness assist I never trust doctors with back to the first name no dr. Steve Z he's a friend of mine he was on Sirius satellite radio I got to get him on man he's supposed to be on a million times we never we never put it together dr. Steve let's make it happen dr. Steve man dr. Steve focuses on very bizarre venereal diseases it talks about them in depth you're like wait what huh except die from that like is there ones we don't know about not yet but for sure they're coming it's not like there was no herpes and also in there was herpes and that's it that's what I like being married like I don't have to worry about that you know so thank you don't bored about toilet seats that's a good morning while sneezing and I like to whack off on toilet seats mmm what about what if plants fight back like a fucking Emma Shamma Lamma ding-dong well then we jerk on that's what I'm saying like what if they fight back we whack off on a man Weinstein will imagine not if Weinstein's bars didn't just extend to him sexually abusing actresses but that his calm when Harvey shot loads on those branches that those branches like morphed because of the the vile hatred for the female organism was in his DNA and those those trees like found human babies and female babies and smothered him to death yeah just our puppies come it's not producing movies mmm it's like produced by ficus Harvey jizz but it was like his jizz contacted the mark of the tree and created the new plague whoa it's totally pasta it possible who the fuck knows what causes the plague I was reading something about the Black Death is spreading because people are Zoners I'm sherry no no it's like somewhere in someplace I'm never gonna visit and it was they were talking Indy or some shit they were talking about how there's a problem with culture where people pull the bodies out of the ground they exhumed the bodies and we're dancing around them and it was literally causing the Black Death display dancing with death Madagascar plague is spreading because relatives are digging up their Black Death corpses and dancing as part of an ancient fama dahana ritual I mean that's commitment to dance let's commitment to stupidity where someone's like oh you're gonna die if you do that it's like no I fucking love dancing good night from the Sun oh it's not real I don't know is this unreal or the male's not real one of them's never both I think they both have questionable they're not the onion right they're not done so they're not they're not honorable more I think like that the fake don't fake news thing from the grocery store that you'd always see almost like newsy it's like onion it's almost like legit news at this point what is fake news and what it's real news anymore I have no idea it's almost like your opium wars where it's like we're just flooded with fucking info at this point which say Jimmy that's what those hearings are about so I was just reading there's something Tim Cook gave a talk this afternoon the Apple guy yeah based off of the he says that the fake news spreading is probably the bigger problem than the Russian ads he says that ads is probably like a point one percent of the actual problem and the ability for fake news to spread manipulate people through social medias problems one through ten who gets to judge that though it's almost like a Martin Luther Catholic Church saying no no no it's not who gets to judge it's whether or not it's fake like concentrating on who the person is that gets the judge that's not helping anybody but what what's fake and what's not fake there's got to be a way to differentiate this should be like a pregnancy test for stories just plus or minus and you know - second before you tell me this story I want you to lick this piece of paper yeah that's motherfucker that's what where is what does it say where there is Tim Cook Apple CEO says that scroll up there's a greater issue than Russian Facebook yes they have that big hearing going on today and yesterday where they're people from Facebook why does everybody have to be number one why does it have to be the number one problem the number one problem this is Russia there's not ads it's fake news why is their goddamn competition between what sucks the most listen to me Tim Cook they both suck the ads suck the stories that are fake stock erase everything sucks yep making it about what will the number one problem is not that it's trans baby no no yeah like why kid multiple things suck simultaneous we have a contest what is there a top ten list of the suckiest things about life how about things just suck yet like me and my friend you know what fortune the comedian fortune for hamsters is funny oh she's she's uh she's a buddy of mine and we like we'll talk I not Twitter she's like well offer a dissenting opinion but we're like but so like we go back and forth and I was like ripping on some fucking Weinstein type psycho and she was like yeah but what about the fact Trump did this I'm like yeah both sucks both suck like what like that the whole line in the sand like you only can fucking say one thing sucks is the end of our civilization and I think the one good thing the time wait a minute what did I read I read a headline I didn't read the story but that Weinstein said that this happened to him to change humanity see if you could find that he might have had to fuck an angle it's a good angle that's a great buddy and we weren't doing mushrooms together listen to me bro you just handle this right dude it's a good thing that you jerked on that ficus not that part the fight is the most forgiving apart the part yeah that's it he didn't say that who said it it's pointless Weinstein pals said that whose pals what okay Weinstein tells pals oh there you go Jamie hey well I mean this smell secondhand for me he wasn't loaded he tells power the scandal happens so he could change the world that's what I said so make it larger mister hero's journey for perverts it says disgraced Harvey Weinstein has been telling what friends he has left if there's a bigger reason that he's embroiled in the ever weilding widening sexual harassment scandal to change the world sources tell page six I hate when they say sources say he's a savior a Hollywood insider says okay this is three swing but it's an interesting angle so let's keep going a source adds that the pervy well that's rude former Weinstein Company Miramax matcher Miramax matcher what's him they might have left out a word on our the letter it's that word sneer max matcher mocker I don't know Oh like big mock mock her is that like I never heard of used though it's telling you a hasidic word big I know there's like big maka but I don't think it's Maher things done yeah this big monster nice okay yeah there we go has been telling confidence that he was born to take the fall for his behavior in order to change the world he is resigned to his punishment as a martyr for social change but here's the thing a comment a rep for Weinstein commented that's absurd yeah it is absurd but but here's the thing I think that's true I don't think that there's like some crazy fucking destiny that he like has the golden ring and he was supposed to take the fall right but through his own folly through his own greedy fat chubby dick trying to pump his ineffective lows into the mouths of tens he really is gonna change the world yeah but he doesn't get to say it though look the other people have to be like I don't know if he did it's it's it's one of these insiders that don't exist they might have been real but they might have been fake Jamie if you were writer I don't not saying this person did that you could have made that quote up and just wrote an article you see headline that gets talked about on podcast yeah sources could be like voicing your sources I mean that was the I mean I hate to exonerate him but Trump has said that many times about some of the stores is the stories written about him they keep saying according to sources he's like you don't have any source and use that the sources do need to be protected for a journalist it is your right so is a really a weird sort of gray area you're right yeah I mean there's there's only one way that someone's going to give you information that could possibly threaten their life if they're there's no financial benefit no no societal benefit for them they have to be anonymous right we've always been that was like one of the main problems that I had with the Obama administration you know people sort of let him slide on that but yeah it's one of the worst with whistleblowers ever there was a part of the hope and change website a part of the hope and change website that was later redacted or deleted was that they were talking about expanding protection for whistleblowers who are exposing someone breaking the law which is exactly what Edward Snowden did yeah that like like Obama tricked me he tricked me trick me man I himself dude I was like this is gonna unite the races of America and he's gonna be transparent and he's such a good speaker he's made me cry like literally with hope and then I see what the what he does and I'm like God you know 77 cents is bullshit man and it's like those little things ramble say what that is Oh they say the wage gap between men and women is 77 cents on the dollar and he said that public he said publicly right and it's one thing if it's BuzzFeed it's the president United States and that is completely bullshit it's been debunked by the female president of Harvard like this is not reality at all it's like and so when I see the same what it really is though okay it really is more like a four cents maybe it's a they don't include factors such as quitting for having a children or dangerous jobs or all this shit that's just the rough average but if you look at this man and a woman with the same job for the same amount of years at the same education it's basically the same it's very close yes some jobs a man makes more and they have attributed that well there's no real way to tell but they they believe that's tribute able to a man is more aggressive in negotiating his initial salary total and subsequent raises and the interesting thing is uh women are better at negotiating for other people like I've had FEMA female agents that are like vicious and awesome because they're like it's almost like they're baby cops or they're like no they deserve more that's my baby but for themselves point yeah for themselves they're not as alpha because I think their attractiveness this isn't Bret Weinstein yet where it's like their attractiveness is so given that they don't have to like most men didn't fucking procreate for most of human civilization so we're always just trying to be like look dude I got a car that's an interesting point because like if you have a view like these two girls and one girl is like kind of gross and overweight and the other girls like really pretty the gross overweight girl will protect that pretty girl like a fucking German Shepherd totally but that the gross overweight girl will fuck an entire busload of willing men of course yeah like men are like super excited about her all the standards get out the window she has a couple of shots of vodka and she's like fucking taking her bra off as she's walking through those expanding school bus doors you know like USO tours it's like they come desert roses where it's like you know a threes a ten but that doesn't happen the other way like if there's a bunch of women on a desert island there's some fucking wine stain with no movie credentials they don't read about them like that they can just be like - we can just hang out with each other and just kind of cuddle and when the wave fucking buddy right but like dudes are like as low as it goes we will potentially meet that standard mm-hmm and that's and that's why it's like men can highly spaghett specific with their skillset but we're more susceptible to brain damage but it's interesting we're talking about like a woman protecting that other woman a hundred percent like I do a bit about how women are socialist men are capital that's where it's like women it's like oh she's having a bad night we all have to go home you know liquor tears ice cream man are like he's being a buzzkill fucking cut the week yeah we have to go home for Debbie yeah but the opposite is true or it's like he's the fastest her it's like he's the funniest let's make him King and women are like she has herpes to everyone no she's she's the prettiest everyone she has herpes it's like it's the tallest nail gets hammered down because in a gala terian societies like the gatherers have to be like the same and the hunters value skill so it's like can you shut your mouth and shoot a fucking gun great you're in versus like berry picking they're like everyone's great right let's share babies or share berries I'm gonna fuck that shit I just realized them all drunk you're definitely drunk yeah but the point I made is still valid the party we're good for a while but you didn't know how to get off the horse yeah I said babies instead of berries that happens when you get to a certain point and an idea and your free wall and you're like oh my god I'm like skiing down a hill that I don't know how to stop yeah I just start winging it we've done enough this is like three hours and 20 minutes right how many minutes there's sweet blast I love you man I love you too buddy we did this I'm glad I was with you for the first alcohol in the first marijuana I had in 31 days and I'm here to tell you so Bridey is fucking highly underrated and overrated at the same time yeah it's overrated when it comes to podcast that's good take a month off I like it it's respect respect I feel good about it I'm excited I'm good to be back on the horse I should take a month off winter to show my fucking low power no that's not worth it well you have to promote gigs I think a month off interacting with people it's not the worst idea in the world just send some love out there and then just walk away right you know but did you know send some good positive feelings don't worry about being sappy why why sincerity sappy like what happened well we eat so fucking cynical that someone can say can't say much live to everybody for good pussy you know like sincerity became sappy somewhere along one let's turn that around turn it around let's turn around and all you bitches out there that think that all white cisgendered men are shit fuck that shit I pray for you to get some good dick pics of good friends and some happy times to change your ways the same way Jamie kills teen did the same way I hope we all do yeah I hope we all do goddamnit all right we'll see you fucking freaks at the ice house
