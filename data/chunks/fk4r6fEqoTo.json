trained my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night all day I don't you Disney flight over like two and three pounds it's crazy if I can make the wage it's no different than Emma Mayen that was so weird Mme you're dealing with a you know from middle weight to light heavyweight which guys jump back and forth you're dealing with twenty fucking pounds I mean that's madness you think there should be more weight classes fuck yeah I've been saying this from the jump there should be a weight class every ten pounds and they're like well if there's too many champions and waters down I completely disagree you're telling me some of these amazing fighters that you have that are superstars like a Donald Cerrone like a Diego Sanchez like all these different guys so there's some amazing guys that never won a title that are huge fan favorites right if you look at all these different guys your riot papers another one you tell me those guys couldn't have been champions and you you wouldn't have had even more champions and an even crazier thing if they were if there was a weight class every ten pounds and a better product thank you you're getting better performances from yeah because Donald's not destroying his body make 55 you don't have these monsters make these weight classes that and their actual world champions there's not other ships not enough weight classes I agree not there's not heavy weight losses 206 or 265 how dairy that's great he's crazy oh god it's crazy right dammit - but what's interesting is the best guy seemed to like flatten out around 240 yeah - so my thought is let's make it to 40 let's make that heavyweight and then to sort every way to two to 40 to 65 or all champions the better or all the way up call out dawn kid the only time you can't is like with a little bit of prog Pro problems with cyborg right cuz she's like she goes I'll fight anyone at 140 but at 140 to be I heard from my source it was a beast for it to get - I think she's the 145 pound Invicta champion they have a 135 in the UFC one may go 145 and I think you do 140 I forty watching but why do it why make her make it she's a 145 pound champ I know but there's not a lot of all the superstars in 135 can make 142 make them put on 10 pounds ever build it they will come however if I would only say right now mr. row but but my chances you understand she's the Invicta champion so she's fighting people and Invicta Hey yeah look it's true wouldn't Vic she's better than all of them anyway doesn't make sure but you shouldn't be forcing her to kill herself when 145 is already established weight class yeah Miesha Tate was the 145 pound champion Strikeforce skip Oh an established way he just said she would fight her - it's an established weight class I think at 140 though well listen Holly homes for people in boxing as high as 150 - it's a but 145 an established weekly I was a fast to sign up the house I how does Holly Holm do my work not that Holly Holm is mentioned because she is the best chance right because cyborg is a ruthless Marauder she's like a berserker at our shoot the box style not this last night no she wasn't this last fight more calculate right yeah and those hits I was like oh shit no calorie Ron yeah that counter right hands lost Leslie she mix business card at the stuns knees heart of course she's mad stylish she's a beast she should be she should be celebrating that she should she should definitely thank the referee referee saved her from herself yes but she's just so tough fighter she's so tough it's what you want she wanted to go out our shield yeah she was already gone yeah just understand ground-and-pound that shit ass o ill-fate or days mask she was punch in the face she's so much more advanced than anybody else crazy so much more than more than god I ended up tiparillo well she's different than Holly we see Holly is a counter striker and Holly also had a really brutal knockout in boxing against a larger woman and I watched and I was like whoa is to kind of knock out that you never really fight that way again cuz you realize the consequences now yeah like someone gets brutally brutally knocked out they're aware of that as a consequence and I think she's become much more of a defensive minded counter striker which was super effective against Ronda is better I think for her right but it didn't look so good against Misha because Misha was fighting super smart but it was also he was up and down well it's call so because Misha didn't brush after I she's like hirings I agree Stanley Aisha fought amazing but I also thought for whatever reason Holly didn't fight like herself she says like he was a clone the trigger she lead yes just like the lead and she's worried about being taken down when she got taken down by me we realized why shouldn't like the lead creme he should took her down beat the shit out of her on the ground like destroyed her in that second round was on Oliver most of the round just beating her ass and so we knew look if Nisha gets her down she's fucked so then she fights like a like a craftsman the third and fourth round she just fights real smart stays in the outside edges those rounds and then Misha is forced to go for broke in the fifth and me she want to take her out and choking her out story man so but here's the thing cyborgs way better on the ground I mean way better on the ground and strong way mean way better get Holley way way better way better cyborg wins straight jiu-jitsu competitions she is fucking strong she fucking she suplexes baby just made she's raping rag doll and bitch and she gets on top of you oh my god the grounded pound oh fuck should we sue she looks like a panther like she looks like him it's almost like she was put on the earth for one thing like well when she's in that rank that cage or just like to mean I was doing shit to you beat her yeah she's she's built herself into that and it's taken so long for her to finally get her now she's here and everyone's like God and even when she's here mandate they did in Brazil and they did it at 1:40 they made her suffer I would have in my personal choice I would have had the first ever 145 pound fight in the UFC let a bunch of people sign up to be who wants to who wants to get in there and you know sign up for that my man that's the prime but I think you got Invicta girls that are green to fight her so if you got Invicta girls are green if I do you tell me those girls wouldn't take a fight in the FC okay I'm telling no one would care Frank egg doesn't matter it's the cyborg show dude it's the cyborg show right now this is Mike Tyson versus people that you don't know and you know it's turning tubs yeah Mike Tyson versus Tony tough easy she has a ways to go where she's Mike Tyson she just got introduced everything when you went to see Mike Tyson versus Tony Tubbs didn't think Tony Tubbs gonna win I'm like Tony Tubbs you went to see the Mike Tyson shot know I was there see Tony touch I'm with you good to see if your misha's manager in like hey we need you to find out 1:45 side block take me show me I think me she would take that short okay but there one else like that in a good move really nope and listen you know cyborg like go back to the Gina Carano fight cyborg had problems in that fight so people don't understand Gina Carano had her mounted gina carano was a tough fucking girl hot is very bald they duked it out Gina literally was on top of her head her mounted cyborg wasn't the same cyborg back then but cyborg was way more shredded back then she was what she was like a bodybuilder man she was terrifying like just the physical muscular the the muscularity and the power that she had there's a picture that I'll never forget man is one of if I have like a list of all my iconic memories of photographs in MMA there's one where cyborg is grabbing the head of Gina Carano she's got her fingers out she's got an MMA glove on with nail polish on and she's about to punch her in the face and Gina's face is already fucked up and cyborgs holding her head not she's about there it is right there look at that talk it out look at that come on son Ted that is an iconic photo look at the eyes the cold blood schuyler in the back on Shh yes it shows he fought it up she the boom she's gonna sleep dropping a right hand on her fucking just being an air crushing her feel that bitch yeah and this is by the way the cyborg that you're watching Tomaso's on her fucking shoulder in her arm and the cyborg you looking at is a day a bit bitch the cyborg you were going to say would fuck this cyborg up for sure she's better now she's fucking dedicated man just doing the damn thing
