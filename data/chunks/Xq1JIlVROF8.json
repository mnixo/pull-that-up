hello freak bitches a huge weird thing going on now as a lot of people are building like dorms yeah they're camp stuff yeah which makes a lot of sense as so many guys are bouncing around sure you know they come from out of town to go train it and a great Jackson's building one way yeah yeah Greg Jack Conroy said he has a bad motherfucker ransom yeah good cowboy look against Cote holy shit riemann at the TV you look fucking awesome sensational have 170 he looks goddamn sensational though I mean that it's like everything came together at 170 and Cote is a beast man no nobody's ever worked Cote over the way cowboy did and he Cote farted like 205 before - right yeah well first his first fight he was saying it that uh at 170 the guy was also like a 155 were coming up but it was I got a new weight right hmm was his first Oh cowboy fight yeah it was a big dude that was that other cowboy dude yeah but that guy's big he's a big fella he was bigger than cowboy but cowboy caught him in a triangle but he just looked great but like Kofi David fought like 185 he started his first fight was at 205 he dropped Tito Ortiz this is way back in the day when Tito was a light heavyweight champ I believe and I think Tito is either a champ or in that I mean it was Tito's in his prime and he lost to Tito at light heavyweight and then went down to 185 fought Anderson Silva was doing very very smart fight he fought a very smart fight against Anderson where he was like making Anderson lead and Anderson's really counter guy and he was just sort of laying back and Anderson didn't like it he doesn't the Anderson does not like nobody had like weird knee popped or something yes knee blew out yeah you like lifted his leg up to throw a kick and his knee just buckled and shaved in on and it should happen sometimes oh yeah weird freak shit like that happens a lot in this for well sure and there's also like injuries you get like the second and third round that you don't even know what go you've felt your knee pop you're not exactly sure what it is and you're still standing on and everything seems fine and then you throw a kick and it just gives out there's that you know but the point is Cote is a stud it's a tough fucking guy and to have cowboy work on like that I was like you got a ninja yeah who I look fucking lost they look terminator that night like he likes yeah awesome it looked like a world but gonna have before them look okay legit world champion yeah yeah I hope he can keep that together I really do I think 170 I think these guys that are fuckin depleting themselves so badly to cut wait I think that's gonna be a thing of the past I really do I think people are gonna realize like this is not the the benefit that you get in that is its negligible Cowboys weighing like 176 somewhere around that and he's cutting just a little bit of weight and making 170 easy yeah I think he was like four or five pounds off when he came through zero we sparred a couple weeks before the fight he was like 14 days out he was like 5 pounds like we have to eat marry even whatever one that's nice shit drink your beer he's so fucking ridiculous with that he drinks beer up into the day of the wins yeah that can't be good right yeah why well a little bit of beers probably okay
