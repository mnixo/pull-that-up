act like there is I assume there is yeah oh yeah sumo whoa Merry Christmas ladies and gentlemen Happy New Year Merry Christmas it's fucking on you understand me it's Christmas Eve you thought it was gonna be ho-hum fuck you uncle Joey Joe Rogan here fucking live Christmas Eve talking about bugs in your house and how easy it is for the feds they don't need a bug your house anymore they just use your phone they just turn them on Jamie tell me tell them what you were telling me about that uh the air pods there's a new setting on the new operating system where your ear pods you turn on this thing called live listen and it's listening to the microphone on your iPhone so you can leave your phone in a room walk out and you can use just made your own bug but that means that anybody that can then access your phone could probably also listen if they have access to that I'll know how I've already said like if we talked to anybody that knows what's possible with electronics they could already turn your microphone on any time they want bro when I was a kid I grew up in that bookmaking shit and there was certain bookmakers that wouldn't talk in a room that there was a phone in the room smart ones in the 70s yeah I'm not talking not on the phone but if there was a phone in the room they would leave the room yeah that's an icicle these guys are super paranoid they were thirty years ahead of their time well you remember how they got Vince in the chin they started bugging cars along the way where he would walk he would walk with his bathrobe like he was crazy and he would give everybody instructions and he would do it on his walk so he couldn't get bugged anywhere so they started bugging the cars along his walk route that's how they got I'm gonna get you at the mic yeah wanted the same microphone they use in the NFL when you hear all those tackles and grunts in the old days they had I don't know that the parabolic Mike takes vibrations from glass yeah so I could just point this laser at your glass which speakers on and it'll take whatever you're saying in a room and bounce it off the glass I've heard it there's a recluse in the fucking ass so by now it's world class they could do well there listening to everything bring anything in everything like want to back him on a plane you have to assume they're watching it like I used to go ahead and do blast of coke I would always pull my pants down go through the whole process like I was shit and I wasn't really shitting I just always thought there was a camera that well you're probably correct I've heard things that are just horrid about Vegas in the 80s how they had cameras in rooms well Vegas in the 80s was all mob Vegas and the bathrooms have cameras so as long as you do a blast you come out within ten minutes the cops around here when did they um when did the mob like officially get out of Vegas like what the mob is still in Vegas just short spurts it's crazy I was in New York last week and I realized how much construction was going on and I thought to myself how much of that is the mob still getting they had a tax for years 2% so if it's a 300 million dollar job do the math on that you make it a big chunk of that construct didn't get rich because the construction business is huge you go to New York you know I can't give you accurate numbers because I don't know numbers are but look what the average is for a square foot of concrete in New York look what the average is in Iowa I was reading something about that the square foot of character to build the building in New York st. the concrete is fucking insane because so many hands are getting fucking greased you know you don't pay a job okay so you don't pay it's like that one episode of The Sopranos so what I do is break your balls you're a GC you don't want to pay me my money that's fine I said somebody from the Union down there and instead of me doing this come on through I gotta stop you I gotta take your book I gotta call the union's to see if you're paid up when you dues we check your tire pressure we count the low let's count the windows on the truck recently you got 30 trucks backed up and you're not making any money that's how they'd shake you down that's the shame then or you pay me okay the trucks go through Oh what's on them we don't care who the driver is we don't care fees you a non-union it's such a dirty business at that level that's the shade down foon drop would be the GC on the job you pay your job runs smooth you don't pay so 2% of it went to the moms at the concrete tax then they had like another 2% right off the top it's a bid rid bid ring Big Ben ringing where we take G we give it to Joe Rogan no matter what the price is we inflate the price even though Jamie comes in three million dollars cheaper I'm gonna give Joe Rogan that three and two more Joe Rogan's gonna kick that to to me and we're gonna do the job at that's three million dollar profit plus I'm gonna take 2% at the top of that three million dollar profit you know what I noticed when I was a kid I was working construction one of the first things I noticed it's one of the weird businesses that's run almost exclusively by men like manly men like the construction guys were burly dudes with big fucking hands they worked hard and they were like these were like rough guys but they were running a big business it's like all these other businesses if you think about businesses you think about like computers you don't think about like rugged burly guys but computers and construction are just as common like everybody needs a computer everybody needs a house like constructions everywhere it's a gigantic business and it's run at least in back in Boston when I was working as a laborer it was robbed by these big savages - fuck it big dangerous guys we've gotten more diverse now because the unions have made you hire more women mmm when I was now electrician like three months in there was a female supervisor who knew her shit mmm my dad you know my dad was no electrician she was a kid that was a fucking day job and men had a tough time working for her I clicked with her she was easy she would leave me the fuck alone sometimes men can't they just have a real hard time with a woman I would have worked me out of it I didn't mind at all I didn't give a fuck I like there if someone's great at their job too great there's a good job just kind of a fuck what yeah and there isn't some weird thing that a lot of guys have right you know Phoebe rad female trainers yeah yeah a lot of people will go for that don't get a female trainer Yoel Romero well the best motherfuckers of all time what is she trailer man I don't know man fit strength and conditioning she was strengthening conditioning training him in this videos watching busting his ass will even let guys a super savage you know make sure I'm right about that make sure I'm right about that because if it's not you well it's someone equally savage someone is just fucking a super alpha we know it's a super alpha like you well when we had him in the podcast I was looking at him sitting there I think this guy has built it's not even a real person with 12 hours should get over I remember that night we both had spots at the store and I pulled you aside and I go what do you really think what do you really think I mean this is I shoot people or is this something that I think it's genetics super freak genetics well when we went to heat I went to New York last week I purposely went to a Sorrentino it's a restaurant North burger you know run by this dude named Jocko Jesus Christ the spaghetti with the tiny meatballs I couldn't even finish it but one of his waiters was a wrestler over the raft listen to the podcast and he was saying how he wasn't that good he was on the bottom floor he ate the scratch ah and he but he goes yeah I know you're welcome back there just last week think about the other super athletes that have come out of Cuba that have gotten into MMA and boxing okay Hector Lombard dude I'm a lot of people they might look at Hector Lombard because of some of his tough fights that he had in the UFC later in his career but if you go back and watch Hector Lombard Wayne was rotten shit in Bellator those were probably his prime years he was the champion of Bellator I mean fucking smashing people smashing people at 185 pounds and then he came over to the UFC he fought 185 but there's a big-ass 185's in the UFC man I mean Hector is what do you think he's five not really not only is no effect no I think I think he's either my hider I'm 5/8 he's either my hydras an inch taller but he's just so jacked but he was when he was smashing people like earlier his career man I always wanted to get him in the UFC I was like this guy needs to come over he's so athletic man he would and he's a judo player I mean it's like a fucking jacked actor is he's a you know he was a judo player for Cuba but I'm telling you man did you could take all the steroids in the world you're not gonna move like this guy moves Josh Lombard Josh Barnett rather told me that Hector Lombard when he went to the gym could just do muscle up after muscle up he never even trained it before it's hot Jamie I'll tell ya it's fucking hard to do a muscle up he just grabs that bar he's a super athlete he's just had a lot of really really rough fights against the best fighters in the world and I really think that some of his best fights you could say like maybe he was tested more and I think he certainly was tested more here in the UFC than it wasn't belt or certainly the caliber of competition is far greater but I also think you know fighters have like a window of opportunity for the most part for most of them there's exceptions well they can extend that window that window the the experts seem to think the windows around nine years this is not a number that I invent anything phone but I it's a number that I agree with in terms of like the best you have you might be able to do it for nine years like a door the longevity of an NFL running back is three and a half years which blew my mind that's crazy that blew my mind then I started thinking about it I talk about all the greats I thought about her okay I'm on Jim Brown yeah about those guys I thought about their injuries how lucky you have to be okay now the UFC is a fighter how many people actually did fight in the UFC for nine years straight so far a lot there's been quite a few a lot but at the same time there's been a lot of guys that have had great potential and by the fourth or fifth fight they've moved on well you know everybody's different this is the thing everybody's different in terms their ability to cooperate everybody's different in terms of their style like some guys just don't take much damage you know some like Ben Askren perfect example never fought in the UFC but when you watch him fight in these other organizations thing that's most interesting is that it doesn't take any damage you could say he's boring if you want to I don't think it's boring I think it's super high-level wrestling and you need to see how that shit would fly against the best in the world I mean that's why he's here now I'm very excited about this but he's a perfect example of like he doesn't have any problems that guys been fighting for a long time you talk to him he's as lucid as they come he's articulate it's very smart very well-educated reads books all the time he'll send me recommendations for books very very interesting guy so you got those guys who like he could do it for a long fucking time because he's not taking a beating when you start taking a beating man pool you know some kind sometimes guys try to get back in there too soon and they're still hurting you know from from a fight like a really bad knockout or just sometimes even just getting beaten up is were you like even if you don't get stopped like you incur more damage that way you know four in a long-ass fight than you would in a quick ko you know like in glory you know Joseph Valtellina Doria know that cazuca Joe he was their champion and he won the title against marked a month after the fight couldn't fight again because concussions were so bad he couldn't look at the light from an iPhone charger like a laptop charger that little light from that thing would would be blinding to him he had to be like in a dark room for three weeks CBD oil brought him out of it well I think though fighters and what happens during a fight I go back all the way to Bernard Hopkins against Felix Trinidad because you brought it up to my attention I never even know about that world he never came back it was like who's the guy that went the distance that's now Bellator fights out of G ESPYs camp really tough guy - went five rounds would fucking what's his name and then Rory MacDonald Rory yes Rory after that fight that he had he was never really the same time the Robert Louis robbie lawler fight fights affect you in different ways the beating you take affects you in different ways I want to see what the kid that had some Barbossa fights with next time how he comes out he took a ferocious beating against at Edgar Edson yeah that last fight before our Kenta and Kevin Lee see but Rory I got to disagree because after that fight he looked fucking phenomenal in Bellator in his first four who was his first fight in Bend up belt or was it Paul Daley he D fought um but then the next fight he did Leamas a beast though do you Fonzie mostly baby monster man Douglas Lima is a fucking straight up killer you know in comedy sometimes was appalled daily yeah so he manhandled Paul Daley right it's a very smart fight because he fought really well on his feet first threatened daily a little bit on his feet and took him down dominating him on the ground and it was it was a it was a very impressive win but then he fought see fighting Mousasi I think was probably not the but you know you never know you know you got to test yourself there's only one way to do that and he knows better than anybody I mean the guys in it to test himself now he knows that he can't beat Musashi at least at this point his life yeah but he's a smart kid then he's an animal to me that guy's so no I don't say they I just thought that a lot of times after battles people don't come back to say I agree on some but I don't agree with him the guy from Texas that took GSP to the fucking zoo and for Johnny yeah yeah he never came you know some people give it all you got yep don't give it all you got moment it's how we react after that what's gonna happen how is Kevin Lee gonna come back yeah again SIA quit that you always have those questions which is a great fight by the way amazing for though the fight I was most excited about this weekend was michael Chiesa Carlos do it mmm Brian's gonna fight with Carlos conduit you know Carlos conlou been around for a long fucking time his name is Condit but Condit he knows I'm his brother and I'm one of the biggest fans and if I was a mafia I'd hire him from the UFC a long time ago does he's an assassin he's like he realized John you just give him a gun with his silence yeah and a pencil will let him do the rest go down and you could switch his mind quick with six hundred thousand a week I want to say that his UFC was his debut against Brock Larson but that was as debut or was it was that in the WEC I feel like that was in the WEC I feel like his debut was against shit was it Jake Martin Kampmann was his debut that's okay in Nashville they fought him natural gallenberger too right yes Gilliam burger was out that was Jake Allen burgers first fight in the UFC yeah to Jake Ellenberger was another one man super fucking dangerous for a long time man you ever see before he fought in the UFC when he knocked out Pele with one punch okay oh what a beat in my office about three weeks ago he came into my office and he's the nicest guy I heard you dosed him up I gave him a bong hit of this shit that was 31% he couldn't answer questions dawg it was like fucking he's the best the poor bastard he couldn't know how to drive home yeah folks at home nada was not around Rhonda was not around it would have broke their system for a week if you think Brock lesner system disappeared in the fucking system whatever oh my god poor Jake Ellenberger we took him deep I haven't seen it but I've heard he told me go smoke do a little and I asked him a question after that he was just frustrated I love him to death he's coming back on to redeem himself and said he's never smoking again but he asked of his battle yeah you can't that's too much most people yeah that's a 3-foot bomb well not only that Joey for most people that don't do podcast all the time getting on your podcast is a mindfuck I can't believe I'm here soon here with uncle Joey holy shit and then boom that thirty how many percent 31 that's so high this is alien hoji this is in in just as a for people that don't know the numbers let's find out what the numbers actually are like what was what percentage THC was marijuana in the 1970s I want to say it was like 8 to 10 probably and then I'm just guessing it's so funny how okay I grew up in New York New Jersey so I would go to Harlem and what we had available to us was Panama red Columbian gold I could be verse of verse I could be wrong on the names and then you had from Jamaica you had this weed called lambs bright and then all of a sudden in the 80s this green weed came along and they called it sinsemilla so I was Coppola hundred 48th Street then he would either sell your chocolate tie which is lambsbread or he would sell you sense of me oh well he would put them together and call it the master mix if you bought ten bags or the master mix you got one for free gave you a punch card this is why not closing maybe a real punch again of nineteen fucking 8283 the guy was in the middle one corner hanging out and the funny thing was I went back in 85 he looked me straight in the face in his light ain't no motherfucking weed on his block no more dog crap like it had just converted to crack but this is why watch him I told you that watching that narcos Mexico those first two episodes was so important because it's like it's like some colors and you watch a TV show it's really hard to believe that one day some Spanish got I couldn't even speak English said hey there's not three cameras here his name was fucking loose Desi Arnaz Desi Arnaz invented the three camera shoot did you know that that's hilarious that does he loop production to all that shit that he's the one that said what has it took eight white people sitting around get two more cameras let's go I'm the light the guy that is the principal guy in narcos this year is a character who grew weed in the desert I want you to think about that I've never been even thought of before but by doing that I don't know the science so please Joe Rogan people don't torture me he eliminated the male plant to make the female stronger the only way you could grow that is in the desert so he found water in the desert why is it the only we can go at grow in the desert something about the climate roof so that it's like the Immaculate Conception well you get pregnant without getting pregnant so you eliminate the male plants or something I do not know this water and right we have to hide this information from women so there's no seeds and the reefer gets stronger that started in the 80s that's why if you watch the articles in Mexico it shows you how that whole thing started and they were pumping 15 metric tons a year into the United States of this shit so green weed became the Mexican green weed was what we started smoking I gotta say that average was maybe 15 then like the strongest and then there's weeds now that I bother that 21% like they take me to the fucking mountain but that 28 or above and a bong you're doomed yeah you're stuttering your mum when you're fuckin can't focus I like that feeling at night well I listen to music I love big news like I want that I called you like there was like October 3rd and I was gonna call you to tell you that I'd love to participate it's sober sober but because of my love for music it's not gonna happen because my thing is to go home and matter sometimes I go to the office like I told you that my house is dead at 20 tonight the kid goes to bed and fucking hate 30 and my wife's in bed ten minutes later so some nights I don't have a spot on a podcast I just go to my office I bring a notebook on an iPad might get stoned and I put a little album on I go down album road I just get fucked up and listen to that music I love it your oh that's my hobby and once a week I go to the album store and I buy in a while a new vinyl album lately I went now that leads up one to Road that's one of the greatest dirtiest filthiest albums and it opens up with a whole lot of love it's just dirty then a lemon song and then a heartbreaker it's just dirty damn and then I've been listening to fucking Physical Graffiti I love going into those foxholes way that night stoned to the gills yeah there's something about that music they they were the first drug culture music in America right if you think about it except Lynne and pink floral showed up the Tweedles and they went the idea they grew longhand that came back with those four albums then there was rumors of acid if you listen to the you know one revoir think it's revolved one of those John Lennon spreads acid bond then I mean there's so there's a lot of musicians from that era that are great that aren't associated with drugs but if you think of Hendrix if you think of I mean Hendrix was always associated with drugs like Janis Joplin always associated with drugs you know good or bad it's it's very interesting it's very interesting that the sound is so it lasts like it's so relevant if you listen to some Zeppelin today it's still so goddamn good they were so good so good they were so good I saw one Zeppelin's tool called bring it on home at the end he comes out like with a harmonica slow then Jimmy Page kicked some one thing at all y'all that stops yeah like you're arts the house thank you like I'd she'd why jump out a window while you Led Zeppelin - there's a couple of hours I got in that office that I put on such a part of my childhood like I think about my mom coming in the room saying yelling lord I'd fuckin devil music feeling saying waiter by isamu stick-up all it and how it blasted at fucking 6:00 in the morning oh the neighbors next door with jehovah witnesses and he was knocking on my door you have to please lower your music I would I never load it lowered it at that age that officious stereo okay and I really do not to get components like I was already hit like I never bought the album with the 8-track and the cassette fuck to you I bought an amp and I bought a cassette deck and I had a turntable and I would fucking blast it I don't know where I got the speakers from my bottom they fell off a truck I love music loud my my store every time till this day everytime Led Zeppelin's final album comes out I'm you know in through the out door comes on the radio or something I think my mother banging on the door freshman year going if I got to not have this door one more time I'm throwing that scenario out the window like 7:00 in the morning I had that full fucking speed roll enjoying getting ready to walk up the hill smoking enjoy I wouldn't smoke at the house not like that she had no idea we playing album album sort of record player yeah fuck I still do it you don't did you have a good needle remember you would go over dude's houses they had a special needle which good a needle I just wasn't got new needles I had a hoarder online impressed of a guy who like a fucking cool-looking needle I still had a have friend that had a reel-to-reel Jimmy - I just got this I had a record player at my house for short Wow you had a reel-to-reel a friend of mine had a really real in high school oh my god and the sound he bought the speakers and everything he knew the sound you could hear like that the musician pulling away from the microphone so sound was that good so when he's playing this reel-to-reel it's got like a like a projector screen type deal no he was that sound he had a room like this and he had a shelf and on the shelf he had speakers and he had a real real have seen ya he was connected and it will have two or three hours of music on it so whenever he would have a party he would just put on the reel reel at that time that was the threat that it's going to real really that's right it's going to real the real that's the loot threat that's crew that never made it it then went from it went from albums to cassettes to fucking CDs so if you put something through that you would have to kind of like do it like you were working in projection room you take yeah it's from one of them and it works almost it's is just really large cassette tape player you put the music on there I forget how he put the music on that could you buy music on I think so it there's a record button on this too it looks like so you could have recorded something on there if you had a cable to to plug it into it yeah I forget how I know but they make copies the same way you put your original would be like on the left in terms of feet you did you need a copier you couldn't do with this machine probably but back the same way people did with VCR copies back in the early eighties you know oh yeah tape to tape isn't the same thing how it would degrade each generation you get porns for your friend and it was like like someone threw mud in your eye he said watch it the fuck is happening on the screen because it was so many generations of copied do you remember when porn was watch like this I don't remember it but I heard about it and I remember that movie about the dude from Hogan's Heroes that was a he he was on Hogan's Heroes and after Hogan's Heroes he just went around making his own homemade porn and he you know you had one of these kind of things on the home projector type field porn came one in those days if you went to the back of a dirty magazine not Playboy and not penthouse but anything else they would actually send you a projector with three movies for say 1495 there was a low-end projector it probably gonna work ten times but at least you got to watch porn and they send you a reel-to-reel that was so bad porn was so bad and I still remember story with me and my friends chipping in and getting the fucking reel-to-reel with the thing and plugging it in the wall and putting sheets on the windows and it was just horrible horrible bored white chicks they were flying off the streets flapjack titties somebody turns cigarettes off on the chest and this chick was half on drugs and Shanna sucked a guy's dick and the most vivid picture I remember is when she took the mayonnaise with the bread like she was something this guy's nicked the guy's dick had been beat up and she took mayonnaise Miracle Whip that's why I never liked Miracle Whip she put it on the bread and made a dick sandwiches with his dick and it was like me and three other 12 year olds dog we almost had a heart attack you understand me like our heads blew up I turn off crying laughter laughter who wants this fucking projector no no no no no no no no no how was a cheap cheap cheap little projector you had to put a sheet up on the wall and use it as a screen you had a fucking shade up all your windows in the attic because I used to do it in my attic as my mother wasn't home so our that the first viewing party we had was in my attic you had to send the money on and Janna said the dollar might 95 for shipping and handling S&H and then it would take six weeks to the delivery so you would just sit and you couldn't send it to your house so I would have to send it to Rogen's house because I knew his mother and his grandmother worked all day so they'd never be home so they would just drop the package off in front of the house if one of our mothers found that package we'd be dead we'd be fucking dead can you imagine your mother putting it on and all suns and checkmate with merit upon a piece of bread and eats into the fucking your dick what you think mom's today probably wouldn't even flinch what if what if they found their kid with some like that on his computer fucking kidding me every mom the Edit you talk to any mom fifteen year old and go do you think your son's getting lazy thing stopping I don't want to hear that it's true no mom wants to hear this I'm getting laid the first girl you brought over the house actually bothered your mother oh I'm sure the first two girls you brought home actually bothered and irritated the shit out of your mother it took your mom a while because you're always gonna be that little boy I can't imagine getting this dick sucked or he just I just put diapers on ten years ago you know what else they were worried about they were worried about you get so many pregnant because you're so stupid when you're fifteen sixteen seventeen you guys are just doing stupid shit you know you don't really know how to pull out that good how good are you at that not very good you know when you were that young I mean it's your parents are worried about you doing something dumb your parents are worried about you getting pregnant but they also don't want you having sex I had this skinny girlfriend like I always had girls that were friends and naturally grows would leave my mom would pull me aside and said what's going on I know nothing you know she's just a friend and I would stream out of the house I can't believe it you know and there were friends but there was this one skinny girl that I used to bring home in the seventh grade and my mother caught us one afternoon look like she caught us making out so she asked me as a man she was from now on do me a fucking favor if she's here and I'm downstairs just leave the door oh my mom was one of those dog she was alone just do me a favor just for me it'll mean something when we lock the door but if I'm here and just leave the door open and I would leave it open the foot and then try this eight inch it six inch it and she would have to come up and say I was I'm 21 I thought you leave the fucking door open and then you you're an animal at that age said that age you finally talking with dilemma because all I was doing was dry humping this girl that's all I was doing we weren't having sex I think I sucked at its one time you know we weren't having sex we just make it out dry but one day I had up my mom had the Barstow and she was just fucking come home and he afternoon was to see if I was at this broad and one dad in here and she brought one our friends up me one of our friends with her and I'm

privacy whether it's fifty years whether it's a hundred years and I mean I think there's gonna be no privacy with anything I don't think with your thoughts I think we're gonna this is the next thing after cellphones is gonna be something that allows us to communicate way easier there's gonna within the next 50 years they're gonna come up with some way where we're gonna be able all communicate through a device it's gonna be better than just talking we're gonna we're gonna share thoughts it's gonna get really fucking strange I'm a hundred percent convinced I think all this stuff is just getting everything accelerates right it used to be really hard to get a hold of somebody now it's really easy to get a hold of somebody and now your your connect people have figured out ways to turn people's microphones on and record them and people who's putting tape over there their webcam I want to play look at while I'm jerking off okay think someone's gonna look through it from the other side they probably can it's gonna be a matter of time before everybody can with everybody with everything you do it's gonna be there's gonna be all all information available to everybody this is gonna happen we're so far away from where we were in the 70s so far away so far away so far away and that was our lifetime we can remember the 70s you know 1973 I was 6 years old ok I remember that I remember I remember the Vietnam War I remember when the war ended thinking when I was a little kid this is great that the war is over cuz now they know that war is bad and they won't do any war anymore the war is over it's gone and then when the war started up again when I was I think I was 21 when Desert Storm kicked in I was a holy shit they're doing it again me and my friend jimmy detillo we had an apartment in i think it was fucking where were we Malden or some shit I forget where the fuck we were wall that's where we were we're in Walt dam we had this fucking apartment and we were sitting there on TV which is sitting in front of the living room I don't think we got a couch we're just sitting there in the living room watching these fucking missiles flying through the air and I'll never forget he goes buddy looks like we're at war I was like what how though we're both sitting there going what how the fuck we're at war I thought we didn't do that anymore I remember that I remember that whole that time when when that was how you got information from the TV is so far removed from today today everything that happens all the time is coming at you a hundred miles an hour from every direction there's just too much to do so you have to control it though you have to control it you still have to have a wife you still you know I don't have facebook on my phone I have my email account I try to keep Twitter off my phone when I go on the road the iPad has no Twitter no Facebook it's too much it's too much interferes of who we are and if you haven't caught that by now you're not catching this you know I'll open up my Twitter on a Saturday just to see who's tweeting thinking to myself what are you doing with your fucking life that you're tweeting on Friday and fucking Saturday and Sunday you know it becomes a little game it's it's a little game you have to give it a breather you have to you it's too much news coming at you from 202 on on your satellite disk it's you know the other thing is it's too much news from sports to world news you got HLN CNN and then ESPN all in the fucking row it's too fast it's too quick last week when I was old my buddy as a cab driver I took six overs on Monday in New York Tuesday I just want to take a cab I took my wife to get some real pizza roma pizza the guy that was making pizza that was still there when I was a kid I drove by one day and I don't eat still in there so we took a fucking cab on the cab this guy that drove me as a friend of mine we grew up together since we were 12 and we were talking I go that's the fasiq first gas station I robbed and then he goes remember when we were 12 we'll walk at home and my Freddie Prinze got killed Wow Freddie Prinze had killed himself to lay in before we didn't find out till that six o'clock news do you know I'm saying yeah wait that was the gap anytime mm-hmm so you got your news and they even though that was New York it was the city capital who watch TV in the morning maybe they mentioned it in the morning reports out of LA for any princes in the hospital yeah but you never saw it no I saw I remember us being out and them saying Freddie Prinze died he shot himself last night and I stole him how cold it was it was January or February was fucking freezing but we were walking home we were 12 and what are we seeing in front of us but a guy passed out drunk just hammered drunk on the floor so what I call now let's get the money out of his pocket you take the bottle it was like a bottle of Dewar's or whatever so our plan was to take a bottle and shake a bum what what's it called you roll a bum yeah and we put our hands in his pocket he grabbed one of us like carry so next thing ought to be was just started kicking him like we was to kick the matey two times and we ran away in a bottle he got up in chases oh Jesus so we do a short path through the cemetery so he lost but you you get all those weird things like that's what I associated with like Freddie shot himself at night they must have mentioned it in the morning I was too busy on the school and it wasn't confirmed to the next day that's how slow Lou was now you're getting news you let hit with 200 stories in 10 minutes yeah what happened in France what Trump decided what the UFC is doing what fucking Penny Marshall died you get to do this thrown at you all day and you really can't control it take your child you've watched these two young girls grow up do you ever have days where you take them somewhere Disney and it's so much information they got to go back and take a nap yeah what happens to our stuff so yeah that's gotta be happening to us well for sure it's wearing you out and it's a lot of it is really negative too you know that's that's another part of problems what's interesting to people is what's dangerous and there's not much dangerous so what's interesting to people becomes you know being negative being nasty about something complaining about things bitching about that starting starting Twitter fights like people enjoy doing it they're like they're looking for for battles you know and I wish there was a way where people could choose to only engage online without insulting people and just trying to get a rise out of people like a troll free way of interacting but it's never gonna happen so you got to kind of accept what it is you see if you accept what it is you should be very wary about entering to anything where 60% of what you're experiencing is negative anything anything in life where you're looking at 60% negative you don't have to this is one you like being informed is one thing but that's more than just being informed because how much of that information is evil valuable to you a lot of is just getting soaked soaked into these fucking horrible stories you know I mean I went down a rabbit hole the other day reading about this these Scandinavian tourists that got beheaded in Morocco in the mountains these girls were hitchhiking and they went it's fucking horrible it's horrible horrible stuff man then I watched a video of it it's horrible mucho ruined you know I loved your room one noble headshot gonna Morocco what your fuckin business you know girls apparently did this all over the world you do yeah either you talk about a guy that fucking went somewhere tried to convert a tribe you know they showed up with a fucking Bible you know yeah mind your business all right send the fucking Bible via email and do the best you can there's some people want to put themselves in dangerous way they don't think I fucking hate or I'd shit I fucking hate all that shit I like control in my situation I really do I'll I don't want to sound shallow I would love to be able to have a passport and go to China and go to Italy but I'm not going nowhere whether there's nothing fucking crazy going on I don't need that in my life right I don't want to hear a bomb when I'm fucking sleeping with Israel talk to Harmony earth day you get Bob's going chuckling Harvey's like telling me jokes on the phone yeah and you hear a bomb going off and shit I don't need that I don't need none of that shit that's putting yourself in harm's way you know I appreciate the balls I appreciate them walls of you climb the mountain of Jarrow I appreciate all that stuff but it's not in my percentage graph I believe in percentages you understand me I get it so it's just the the other night I read so I get high at night guys I could I do family and to come down I smoked 55 fucking bong hits sometimes you don't have to say a joke on Twitter the joke is written when you read it as a human being you're saying this is a very interesting article but at the same time it does I fell immense of humor in it there's an article of a hot chick and it says mother goes to court to complain about teacher who fucked a 15 year old kid because his life is changed has never been the same since she fucked me sure it has it the kids never gonna get his dick sucked like that again can you imagine getting a teacher to blow your horn when you're in high school one of those dirty teeth you see a picture of the Joe Rogan with a fish on a boat with a bikini now you take this chick to the prom and she's sucking your dick cryin you know the saying like I've never done this before you never saying like we're luck that his life has changed yeah it's a joke dog I got attacked for two days and I didn't reenact people I turned it around on them I called them love listen Merry Christmas and they had nowhere to go it's so funny that you can get caught man they forget what comedians we are a tube a tube that transports something really ugly into something that's still ugly but a little bit of funny to it yeah I cracked a joke when I found my mother dead on the floor to myself which said I knew she was never gonna know I got left back cuz I got left back but I never told and it was couple of a year that I had to tell her she was she kept asking me have you chosen to college yet and then the sophomore year for three years I ran the scan with my mother that I had I didn't tell her she thought I was a Judy I was really a sophomore so as soon as I made that turn I picked her up I saw her arm was purple I've kissed the forehead but I loved the popping up and going I knew this bitch wasn't gonna have a phone that I smacked before i down 9-1-1 so if I dropped humor at that situation that's how I fuckin handle myself well that's how you leave that's right yeah you have to drop you but I will drop a bomb on you at a Funeral I will drop a bomb on your the feel I love that you look at me and go Jodie is the balls on you but thank God you came they ever tell you what Dave always said when Phil Hartman didn't win an Emmy what we were all in the audience right went there to honor him cuz he got nominated and the dude from Frasier won and Dave for which he turns to me and Steven Rudy goes what the hell do you have to do to win [Laughter] because he got shot for fuck's sake always a funny way fuck really is people have no idea what I see people argue and now like now is a 55 year old you look at it and you go I threw away 20 years of my life are you with people yeah that I had no reason to argue with them for it's not even worth it they played the tape back you'd laugh at yourself and feel horrible hmm you look at shit now you know what it how does this even affect your life I turn it I watch so CN n like when you're in a hotel room on the weekends you know you got it you go down to CNN or CH NBC a political pipe hole oh I love those four six minutes to see people get fired up and they attack each other and then you know and everybody's fuckin bullshit but you sit there you know what is the big fucking deal no matter if fucking Hitler makes a comeback and he's president y'all got to get up and go to work every morning hmm it's like Thanksgiving your money anymore something like somebody's giving you money or their point you in the house for free if the Dow resurfaces from the grave he's the president you still gotta work you still gotta build houses you still gotta announce the other to the UFC's you still feel what what it how much does it really affect yet at least that's how I've always thought the problem with all these shows is all of them whether it's CNN or Fox News or is that they're leaning they're leaning somewhere the leaning one they're telling you about the news but they're leaning on it in a way they're not just simply recording this the fact especially Fox News right they lean like I don't know right I don't know what you guys are talking about when you say that but I will tell you really yeah when people talk to me about left and right I have no idea because I don't even know where I stand on most vicious but guess what I did see in New York what take a guess of what I did not see homeless people really they because it's so cold I was homeless for 719 days in New York in December from December 12th to the 31st I got a hotel room maybe 50% of the time but beside that I was homeless at one time in 1984 you did and I asked people you know you just don't say it hmm I saw very small sections of non encampments but the homeless pizzette percentage was smaller so I asked somebody what that is how come I have somebody homeless people out here and they said it's called because they're liberals I didn't fucking know that's what a liberal was I know I did I just need California's yeah I just try to be a human being I don't know that doesn't make sense it's like what does that mean then what were you where the homeless go do we make more of them out here is that what he's saying do you allow it the dead philosophy he was telling me a las vegas ships they're homeless gives them a bus to California and my ship I feel like the shipping of busting people like Alaska for a little while or something maybe yeah you saw that the TV show wild wild country do you see that no it's on the rag Nisha's I they say it rag neish cult from Oregon and one of the things they did - they took over the town all watched it homeless people in buses and then how all those people vote and then they took over the fucking town they like developed a real town and then they took over this one area bust out how America moves its homeless as well each year US city gives thousands of homeless people one-way bus tickets out of town an 18 month nationwide investigation but the Guardian reveals for the first time what really happens at journey's end whoa that sounds like a M night Shyamalan movie all right they kill a bunch of homeless people like Satan's involved it's like they just move them away where do they say where they ship them looks like this throwing up down in Miami and in LA huh well lives in Colorado in Colorado people would the homeless people would commit crimes they figured out what crimes they would get 60 days for and they would commit that crime plead guilty do the 60 days just figure out a little winter hmm because in those days boldwood give you tobacco you were a lot they would give you tobacco but you gotta roll it that well that type of shit Boulder County Jail and 1991 Boulder County Jail and some other jail will voted number one in two jails in the country Wow that people would want to go to those jails then bold to built a new jail and it became fuckin communist land like Aspen communist land yeah like no cigarettes everybody had awake uniforms huh no more stayin up till 2:00 in the morning when I was wrong with the other way Boulder County Jail the way what was good the good way up old it was a paradise well what was wrong with that it got out it got out that it was too nice right so like I'm telling you homeless people would commit a crime to do 60 days can I ask you something guys as a person who's been in jail good would it motivate you more this is an honest question would it motivate you more if you were in jail and it was nice and comfortable in there and you got to relax and calm down or would it motivate you more if they brought you into some communist type jail as you described it with everybody had wear uniforms there was no cigarettes there was no fun they limited your outside time what I did I did them both what would what I didn't think as a person who's been through what would be most effective in rehabilitating you I mean that's the idea right I don't live in rehabilitation now you said to me you gotta stay in this fucking building for six months this is gonna be a jail there's like pablo escobar's jail it's still jail I want you to remember that right you cannot leave the building for six months I will let you go out to her front and a cage one hour a day but you got to figure out what you're gonna do in here for 12 months it's a cage yes I have more options here I can lift weights I can do different parts of my body I could shoot pool ba-ba-ba-ba-ba Boulder was very simple boldly got locked up they gave you the linens you either took them away in it not only in my own cause so you called home at once time Joe Rogan's brought me my jeans my snake is my t-shirts I'm wearing my own clothes so now they determine what you were in for nonviolent or violent if you're a non-violent offender you the world is yours the violent ones the ones that get violent ones so now the violent offenders depending on what you do as violent you go into one sector and that sector the longer you're in there the more rewards you get so if you're in green you stay up till tenth and they got cable TV if you are red you stepped 11 and they got cable TV if you're purple estep till 1:00 1:00 a.m. oh my god Boulder County Jail was tremendous I am sweaty so I'm cigarette I didn't drink milk milk is big in jail because the bodybuilders like milk it's like fucking drugs yeah so I would trade you and you my milk for your kool-aid all right so I was in there drinking fucking cool laser shit because I fucking hate bill Boulder was a paradise compared to other jails oh listen to this Thanksgiving Day when I was locked up thanks everyday yeah the guard came in and I'll never forget his name was Grande and he opened up the cell door there was a phone there and he does anybody who needs to use the phone use the phone I figured how you know those days you had a press mind sideline I press paid to see if I get along this is London press seven nothing six not been five nothing for fucking long business I got the quoi my peeps in Jersey for 20 minutes of peace you know you just figure out different things then they send you to a place where somebody looks you in the eye and says strip down and you gotta go take a shower then you come out and they put a finger up your ass deceive me that's contraband and they give your tighty whities an orange jelly put like a rubber glove on and then lube their finger up it doesn't matter it does at that point I didn't give a fuck you're putting the finger up my ass is it it breaks you down as a man as much as anything in the world that's the first breakdown Wow they turn you around to let you know they run you they're gonna stick it up your ass then you order yourself and like those guys are then are not very nice they weren't like the Boulder County Jail guys those guys would kick your bed and make you get up turn your light on in the middle of night and say get out of bed we're gonna do a search at 2:00 in the morning those people are not nice at all then I got transferred the summer County Jail which was a fucking paradise paradise paradise handball all day outside TV till 2:00 in the morning keep easing yourself black-and-white TVs and yourself basic cable you could be up all night if you wanted to go to breakfast you ate breakfast if not you could sleep through breakfast and we'd eat your breakfast for you and then from there they shipped me off the Department of Corrections that's where it's a nitty gritty if you think black people talking to movie theater at night don't go there [Music] don't go that black people talk all night it's six or seven floors and I was in there in August with feel full humidity Canyon City Colorado Wow alright with a little window you know and I was like on the third floor I couldn't breathe and in those days they let you out you think two showers a week and one hour a day you went outside after that you were just in the cell by yourself and then nighta froze the daytime it was like fucking being sweating in a fucking tin can you wanna ten candidates on it now we're finished nope it's all shit there's nothing to showers and then the three meals and then that then the first week is good because you actually get out of your cell ago test they test you everything your math your English they fucking put a bunch of pictures of funny and they put you through psychiatry they take your blood out they do everything and then they assess you and then they have I took care of all the dots okay there's a bunch of dots you have to you have to dot your i's like if you have a high school diploma you get a point if you were working at the time of arrest you get a point if you up to paying rent so I got a bunch of points for that it's so funny out to talk about something very interesting it's very interesting whether it's Harvey Weinstein case is gonna go it's very interesting where it's gonna go right now he has Benjamin Braff as an eternity and if you see what happened Benjamin Bratt push for a dismissal and he didn't get it the lawyers said the judge set a trial date they gotta get a trial date Harvey Weinstein's gonna go throw more money to pay off time Harvey's gonna go for time then he's gonna fire a Benjamin breath and show up with two women primarily one black and one Asian or one white and one Asian and this is when this trials and they get very interesting Harvey's also really hire millions of dollars and prosecuted in a private investigators they don't interview boyfriends they can interview this case is gonna be very interesting unlike the Cosby case where Cosby didn't really fuck you how do you know he's gonna do all the stuff because I know of this is what I would do I know if you come to me and you know I'm getting busted for this what do I do because of how I grew up around those people this is what you do Benjamin Braff cannot ask a woman the same question and a woman can ask a woman hmm so I'm gonna go in there with either a black woman but the Asian woman or a white woman my first two choices are black and an Asian woman you want to get the diversity angle I'll get the diversity angle and I want to get that you can't you're saying that cuz you're a black woman Chinese woman what I'm trying to stem you have just did you ever really watch the People vs OJ Simpson no I didn't very interesting and it's it's time that you sat next version I watched one episode it seemed very good very interesting how you put a dream team together how Jesus it's gonna cost you ten mil listen to me gee you got two hours he's going on like Cosby and pay two mil and make believe you're blind or we put together a fucking you didn't you see him he went no with that milky shit over his eyes like the guy from kung fu when we were kids kung Fu's father head like yeah kung fu father was like half blind and shit yeah I remember each other's eyes that's how Cosby will in there playing like I'm sick routine he's got cataracts whoo Cosby yeah but he didn't have like that that when he put the pill in the water either no he knows what he knows with the fucking so Larry steps really fucking you know yeah he knows but Harvey has to play this hand this is what America's about to watch they're gonna watch something fucking crazy Harvey knows he can't go in there Benjamin Bratt Benjamin Bratt hey Gravano look at the list of Benjamin Perez and Benjamin Bratt can't attack a woman Joey you look at love like legal cases like supports Dalek is debilities Jon Jones versus Gustafson I went to New York last week and I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with my daughter she loves art and while I was sitting there I was at it saying I'm going on your own cuz my daughter didn't want me taking pictures in front of the statues anyway she said daddy get out of the pictures this - so I'm like what the fuck am i hanging out with you for she was in the Chinese when I wanted to see the Armenian way but it was funny I was thinking about when I was 21 and 22 jor-el and I would get stoned to the gills and go to the Museum of Natural History the Museum of my hobbies back then since I was such a loner people looking for me I was always a criminal I would go over the bridge to either go to one of those museums I would sit in the courtroom I would go to a place that had a fucking Italian sandwich and I got a bag of wise potato chips in the 16mm scope and you go to any courtroom court starts at 7:00 at the metropolitan downtown I take the A train and I'd walk I forget now what you know this is 1983 81 I was a kid and I would sit unobserved Night Court I learned how to plus I grew up in that you were what you'd sit and watch Night Court look you'd watch a basketball game with your games yeah with a sandwich and the soda and potato chips I think a lot of people don't realize you can just go to court and I would watch you do that 12 people I would learn how to set bail can you do that anytime you want can you just get in there watch in the 80s yes now this bomb detectors you have that's the reason why you're there do you have to but if you're interested in the case yeah good night in just watch it but if you you know for whatever reason there's a speeding thing like someone lost their license and they got arrested driving you're gonna get away from cops you go watch them go go supporting Joe I like to go and I see I would like to see what the fuck was going on when those guys are trying to get away from the cops the helicopters chasing them with the spotlights and they just keep going like what the fuck were you thinking like what I would like to get to that courtroom here I want to see that guy I want to look at that guy that was like running from the cops the fucking spotlight from the helicopter on me knew he wasn't gonna get away he's gotten people off and driving in the fucking side it'll nobody ever gets away has anybody ever gotten away recently the other night a parking garage I can find them oh yeah take it away the percentage is explained all right the percentages are very fucking low right it's tough to get away bro they got you once those helicopter spotty you running through neighborhoods to a mall they have cameras they can rewind the cameras watch you go if you're running into the mall you know there he is well spot on the car the thug hey big what happens to you you wanna know what happened to see what happens to all right first of all usually spike skyline is following you so that's the news yeah they gotta put you on the floor kick your legs do everything by procedure on camera then they pick you up they handcuff you and they put you to the side of the car the guy tells you this whole white version of what happened the pursuit started on the vibe this wanted subject yes suspect was moving at a high rate of speed fuckin you know if I just had to chase you for 20 miles I'll piss to my you oh yeah so they put you in the fucking trunk and they push in the back seat in front of everybody so the cameras take places they put a cop next to you on the drive day you got a couple back hands to your face because I'm saying that you you hit the steering wheel or something a couple times then you go in there and you sit in the holding tank and then you fucking if you're with one another person used to you just shut your fucking mouth you want to call your lawyer I'll call them whether you wanna call your lawyer because you want one of the other guys to get a lawyer so then like that you have to get ah it's it's puppets it's conflict of interest so if me you and Jamie get arrested right now I'm gonna shut my mouth and tell you I'm gonna call my attorney later because I know for a fact Jamie's only got a public defender so now I can't get a public defender because well that's conflict of interest so the state has to pay for a different attorney for me well a lot of people don't know that so if you got arrested with two or three people you keep you much yeah I'll call my attorney later you have an attorney yeah I forget his name let Jamie cop a public defender now the two public defenders can't represent you haha you got a better chance of getting a better attorney and the state pays for it it's on the young so next time you pay for your Morgan's you know goddamn at the state takes aside it's cuz they jerk off like me when we fucking Johnny run but abouts and fuck him he wants eight hundred an hour even though the state will give before hundred now it's like wholesale am saying by at least I got a better type of attorney you game the system you game the system it really is fucking crazy how I love figuring this shit out you write you're writing things down like you weren't even thinking you just automatically started writing down numbers and percentages shit oh yeah I love all this I grew up in this shit it is like a sport so that's what he'll do hot and by the time ha we bring on a rape case you gotta go up there we lived the story and tell the dates and if there was a rape kit it's very fucking tough this is gonna be very interesting bro what's gonna happen the only thing is anything he cops to he's gonna come they gonna come back I don't like OJ hmm and try this also and he'll just live in Florida making fucking super 8 films dad I've been fucked in Miramar Florida is crazy we can't get sued because they work the system I'm not saying nothing bad here that's what your advisors and your people run you know tell you he's in hot water for the rest of his life because even if he gets that down to like an assault charge and he has to serve eight months 12 months which is really eight once he gets out hey all the civil suits are gonna come at him and then he has to pull a little gem move to Florida where they can't touch your pension or some bullshit money and into something like that Wow it's really crazy this is not unrelated to what we're talking about right now so this has happened I think since we've been live Kevin Spacey uploaded this video on his YouTube channel where he's in character as Frank Underwood and since this has come out today he's now been indicted on rape charges and Matt Massachusetts I believe whoa felony rape charge so it's his plea to get his job back this might have come out without him knowing that was gonna happen I don't know I was to see if you wanted to watch and see what he's doing should we watch it if we watch we're gonna kick some YouTube news it's fair use ish ish I mean it should be definitely fair use we can always watch a minute or two something like there are a second seven see what he's doing he's washing his hands I know what you want oh sure they may have tried to separate us but what we have is too strong is too powerful I mean after all we shared everything you and I I told you my deepest darkest secrets I showed you exactly what people are capable of I shocked you with my honesty but mostly I challenged you and made you think and you trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't so we're not done no matter what anyone says and besides I know what you want you want him back of course some believed everything and I've just been waiting with bated breath to him he confessed it all they're just dying to have me declare that everything said is true and that I got what I deserved wouldn't it be easy if it was all so simple only you and I both know it's never that simple not in politics and not in life but you wouldn't believe the worst we see Karen Karen yes that's supposed to be dead in the show correct that's strange to watch coz but wait you know what strange is it seems a little off his game right I mean I don't know if he's playing Frank Underwood yeah he seems a little off like okay with a little tense on that one let's uh oh yeah let's get into this you're Frank Underwood come on man Kevin you're Frank under it I'm Frank Underwood and then boom hit it a second time there's a second take felt smoother second take felt smoother you know it seems like acting it's weird it's not like it's great character but that character's fucking great character I mean the Frank Underwood characters like one of the all-time TV characters but that's just weird he's brought him in the real life for statutory fox news according to Fox News but this is what everywhere else too he shared this video as he's announced that he's facing felony sexual starts at salt charges for assaulting a teenage son of a former news anchor and then Nantucket bar in 2060 Jesus thought he was going off on that powder oh and God knows the power they give you and what you buy in so just to make that tape just shows you how fucking creepy he's good I really think to be that good at acting you gotta be out of your fucking mind Kevin Spacey's a bad motherfucker when it comes to acting all the horrible things he's done aside there's a there's a quality about someone that's that good you know they're just got a like a certain amount of insanity - god this is not apologizing for his actions everything he did is horrendous but I mean to be surprised that you're seeing him seem crazy there no that's not surprising he's - he's too good to not be crazy like I would assume that they're all when they're not crazy I'm shocked you know when someone there's a you know seems to like Daniel day-lewis doesn't seem to be crazy right he just seems to be obsessed it seems to be obsessed with work maybe I'm wrong I think all those brilliant motherfuckers are out of their mind says his out of his mind as if every jump was a horrible I did when I was a kid my grandparents did certainly Shep is a very smart intelligent oh yeah but they all have a quirk they all have a core you know my mom wouldn't neuter us if she had a female bleed once a month which made him even fucking crazy so now as a kid my mom had one that you can go to next to a purse that buddy's stinky had one my buddy stinking had a German Shepherd that was pure authentic he's a walk in the house I have a great time I'd a to make a move for the door so he bid all our friends in the ass didn't like when people laughed everyone so every one of us because of the extreme of what we do including yourself has to have some you know something you will I wanted to felt less we speaking about Bill he wanted a helicopter he plays the drums yeah he's a comedian he's a dad he doesn't animated series you know you know so here you are the helicopter with bill burr flying around the city but two nights earlier he you laughing him onstage right he made funny some fuck in that when I saw him last he was hysterical make him follow you Obama tour yeah you know so you follow me yeah those extremities is what makes you good at your main thing you know the fact that that fucking does all those different things the fact that cowboy Cerrone fights at a high level of competition but then two weeks later he's high diving off a cliff for motorcycle racing not just dad he does it Wow yeah that's raining while he's in training yeah that's what makes people who the fuck they are yeah you know way when it comes to drugs psychedelics or the hard shit you know you get these people that for years I heard rumors about certain actors that they show up on this set still coked up from the night before but give me three cups of coffee give them breakfast um take a shower and then whoever they're supposed to be so for that love eight hours they kept it together for the other twenty they were a fucking mess Wow look at guys like Nick Nolte right Nick Nolte is one of the greats for sure right I mean unbelievable actor and it's had some serious serious substance abuse issues and it's passed Jan Michael Vincent after taking over Hollywood watch the mechanic you know yeah we have listen bro dimitru movement was a great movement it made people you know whatever the word still had people always count but what do you think happened to Marilyn Monroe she was the first meet through victim Marilyn Monroe was if you look at it from an angle they passed her around between the president Nick Buoniconti the fucking mobster in Chicago and who else passed her around she was married to Mickey Mantle she was married how many fucking times she's my tool a right take tormented that poor girl then they found her were dead alcohol whatever no no no to me Marilyn Monroe will I see Marilyn Monroe she's the first thought an original me to you know that they're knocking down all of gardener and Schrader on Sunset Boulevard but the last but everything is closed the nerdmelt disclosed everything is closed on that block the only thing that's still open is that flower shop they finally decided to close after a thousand years but that was the flower shop where if you wanted to take Marilyn Monroe impress her you gotta order flowers from that flower shop that was what it was famous for that DiMaggio Sinatra everybody ordered flowers for her for that shop if you knew her they'd say what is she like get flowers from that place on Sunset but she was the original come on dog think about how tragic her life was and she was beautiful she was young and I had them all but all of a sudden a slick young guy comes along with his olive oil voice and his tight shoes and he takes her away from me I'm a man that cannot hit be humility and isn't that what that dude tells walks this now what he tells Robert Duvall when he comes over in 2000 he wants an outfit in the movie yeah and he goes there's a piece ass and I've had them all and she was the best piece AB just to show you it's not about dollars and cents I put singing lessons into dancing lessons she was gonna be a fucking star but all of a sudden your boy comes along with his olive oil voice and his shiny shoes and he makes me takes her away from me I'm not a man to be humiliated you know what that felt like and he goes off on me through fucking what's-his-name how the next morning he wakes up in the dead horses that's right that's the speech he gives that Sinatra fuckin took his girl that's right the horse and the bed scene was one of the most fucked up scenes ever in a movie especially when you attend yeah cuz if I was a horse's head oh yeah do they really oh yeah they killed a fucking horse for that scene a hundred percent that ain't a fucking rubber horse that's a real horse's head you ever watch it again no I don't think I'm mistaken I'm a pretty sure I remember this I remember that it was I might have a shit man that I think that they might fucking throw you in jail today today even then the 70s you can get away with it what's that movie twists my butt Rose made well he was gonna throw the dog got the plane and the inspector showed up and they kept saying oh oh shit well that's the movie leads to stuntman and Jan Michael Vincent comes to take his job there's an old Burt Reynolds movie hopper hopper hopper that's a movie about Burt Reynolds being Bertram the baddest stuntman of all time but then Jim Michael shows up and jam Michaels and he does lunch but then Burt Reynolds puts jam waggle in his place and they make the judgment the car together but the funny thing about that movie is that he has the jump out of a building and the guy that played the inspector was a wacky guy we got here Jam this is uh Snopes article it's true yeah Oh Canada horse the studio had encouraged Francis Ford Coppola to use a fake horse head but he didn't take he didn't like the mock-up his Scouts found a horse ready for slaughter at a dog food plant in New Jersey the art director picked one that looked like the horse in the film and said when that one is slaughtered sent us the head he said one day a crate with dry eyes came with a horse's head in it five hmm well that sounds like they're gonna kill the horse anyway that's probably better than not using it right but people have attached wheat they serve the horse rectum once on fear factor and horse people got real mad they get very mad this is seen here we go you imagine being this poor fuck and being in tangle with the mob back then this is supposed to be filmed in what like the 50s as well it's supposed to take place in the 50s I'm not showing it just you know Yeah right oh the people at home they can look okay it's very what's really scary about this scene is that they came into your house while you were sleeping they didn't wake you up yup and they put a horse's head under a sheet message under your sheets so I keep realizes there's some blood now he's looking around he's like what the fuck what the fuck is this how good is his actor who's his actor what's his name he's been in everything yeah he's looking at the blood it's all over his fucking sheets I mean it's fucking crate and that's real blood - and there's a horse's head they start screaming aha they chopped his fucking stuff it in bed with him that was like a prize stallion that he had right he fucking took him and he and he insulted he insulted me go see you can get out and I ain't no bandleader and he knows yeah I heard about that story because that was a story Michael tells to check it that day how do you know Sinatra she goes well my father's done all this to him he's his Godfather I think those what does that mean and he goes he sang with the Tommy Dorsey band and Tommy said I'm not releasing them and they put a gun to his head Luca Brasi put a gun to his head you either gonna sign it or your brains gonna be across it which one they paid a dollar for the Sinatra oh my god so that's why would this guy shows up because I ain't no fuckin bandleader and that was the last thing you tell some guy like Robert Duvall Robert Duvall says if for your mind I have a plane have you driver sent over a point it's kept me till the plane cuz Vito Corleone he's a man of insisting bad news right away and hearing bad news right away and he knows you don't tell him and the next morning he wakes up with a fucking dead horse Jesus Christ what a way to send somebody a message so that was a good fucking movie all those movies were great I got a guy the problem is that got Italians way too into being Italian overemphasizes crazy I will tell you this Joe wrote and I told you this a couple weeks ago and I know it's tough for you it's tough for me subtitles but this episode of narcos is really a bit more are they doing it all on subtitles no they got a little on official on English but it's tough for people to watch but like I took the guy who played Pablo was a bad like I was saying the other day I was telling somebody you know what man I grew up watching American movies and I loved him but my undercurrent was watching Spanish television at that from the age of five to eight of nine there was a couple novellas that I really appreciated and I kind of like the acting I was like these guys can fucking act but I forgot all about it then I watched man on fire and Men on fire had some phenomenal Spanish acting plus they had the Italian guy Giancarlo Giannini how bad of a fucking how bad I'm a motherfucking Italian at you when your name is Giancarlo Giannini he's the one that was in Hannibal that Hannibal stabs him and then fucking throws his guts out in the fucking I don't know if you've ever watched Hannibal nah he shows up and that's how Wow he kills them to my stomach but he's the cop and man on fire the one who thinks just a girl's ass yeah man on fire had a lot of good like side actors but a lot of great Spanish acting slow vs. Marcos and all the hold-down all these shows are coming back I'm watching these dudes and I'm like pearl he's tied these guys from old soap opera Spanish soap operas was just tough if you ever did a soap opera it's a time I did General Hospital and let me tell you something if I would have gotten off a plane and done General Hospital I was gotten fired thank God I was he at twelve and thirteen years and I knew my way around the set and you know when you booked a soap opera nobody talks to you you don't know that yeah like you walk into CBS ABC over there on oh god street you walk in they leave your ID and then go go to room 27 you go to your office you fucking your suits they're lost on the lady comes in and she knows how you doing my name is Mildred watch the TV and look for your numbers to come up so you sit down you're writing numbers I'm insane 27 chapter ace and you sit down with wardrobe on for you I would go there at eight o'clock I might be in my car like all the time really how many soap operas did you do three General Hospital three episodes yeah find that three episodes of General Hospital I played a recovering fucking preacher I've been out in prison and I came out and now I was a fucking marriage thing bro when they called me I think they called me they're like we're interested in you sending your real and I'm like wait so Benjamin Bratt those good-looking dudes they start on General Hospital and you want me on your loss are you fucking crazy I sent them a real I swear to god Wayne just like they really want show me will you want me to do me no send it all what do you want me to deliver gonna hire me bro they called right back come on down for three days Wow you walk in there Joe Rogan you give him your ID it's that fast you go to your room don't say scene 28 prepare wardrobe you're ten minutes away you put whatever wardrobe they give you on they have cue cards for you they have a yeah under a fucking under the cameras it's a three camera shoot you go out it says okay actor number 28 come out you come out how you doing Joe Rogan very nice to meet you okay let's do this action boom boom boom boom let's say you fuck up your line they don't give a fuck like if you start from all over now we're starting from that line ba ba ba ba ba ba ba cut moving ahead Wow an awesome they switch you out bi ba they put makeup on you and they're like you just not in the scene just sit over here for five minutes bro five minutes they come right back to you alright you ready it seems to read you like what the fuck Bob you're right thank you for coming down nobody talks to you nobody does nothing huh so it's not uh it's a they're just trying to get it out quick they don't hold your hands it's 8 to 5 Wow Beano is so proper is probably the easiest way like if you land on general asshole you could be in a general husband for 30 is that dudes but I'll never do it he is yeah you know you to be on the people been on it for a long time yeah so it's look it's 8 to 5 General Hospital was that Luke and Laura it was that was Luke and Laura right remember Luke and Laura happened there was a thing that happened in in soap operas and it happened while I was a kid Luke and Laura transcended General Hospital and became a thing all throughout the world these people yeah these people he makes sense cuz the dudes hair was weird and it was a strange couple I do the scene would have dog they were weird yeah I didn't sing with him she was a little too hot for him didn't make a whole lot of sense but it worked great for whatever reason it fire culturally and became a big thing and I think I was in high school at the time there were there was the 1983 okay yeah so I was in high school while I was in high school this was all going down and everybody paid attention to Luke and Laura it was like the General Hospital thing took over the country it was like in the cover of People magazine and shit it was everywhere it was this one weird relationship on a soap opera for some reason just became this gigantic phenomenon that everybody was watching I mean I was watching it I would like I said 30 million viewers crazy I was what was what was the show with the good-looking singer I wishes she was Jesse's girl over a Springfield General Hospital and I watch that yeah but it wasn't even him see if him if he was with Laura I watched I saw that he's a handsome son of a bitch that Rick Springfield you know and he was a double threat he was on General Hospital and he was a badass singer that Jesse's girl that song if you read fucking like Wild Wings and Jesse's girl comes on he's still out there hitting it still torn yeah he's still torn I think he was at the canyon Club in Agoura he's out there that dude was when I was in high school that dude was on top of the fucking food chain every girl at a poster Hill on the wall my Laketown that's not good for him it's crazy that whatever soap opera was on from 12:00 to 1:00 was a big-time soap opera and there was a bar in New York and there was a bar in New Jersey in my neighborhood and if you walked in there from 12:00 to 1:00 and you said a word somebody would tell you to shut the fuck up and it was 98% men and they would serve lunch and it was the one I would go to was the Midtown lounge but there was another wall so there was a lunchtime soap opera yes that men left their jobs full construction guys and they would sit there watch the soap opera on two TVs like it was a Yankee game what the fuck and then they would go back to work I know strain is that how strange is it that was the thing it was a big thing at one point and I still remember you know if you dated a girl and she stayed in on Wednesdays to watch dynasty bitch you stayed on dynasty night if that's gonna get them looking cookie that makes sense for like today it's translatable you know Sunday night Game of Thrones is on or whenever night it's on it's like people do get together and they watch it live as it goes on that makes sense what doesn't make sense is that the market for those kind of soap operas was there was appealing to men and high school kids like we're all watching it who shot junior bro does Dallas but then yeah not only were they sucking you in the daytime in those days this is all the 80s we're talking about the eighties correct okay what the fuck was going on at night ball you had Dallas and you had what was the one on ABC with Alexis Carrington dynasty and the dynasty that was badass as a sad-ass shit that girl right now the chick who played the princess on that that was supposed to be Alexis's daughter and she was having an affair with Dex Dexter she's the one right now that's going through that thing with her daughter in the sex ring hmm up in Connecticut there was like a sex ring novo went over right like he's a princess or your life watches yes she's the one that's going through all that with the daughter I remember her being on dynasty as a hot hot and she was Alexis's daughter but Dex Dexter was Alexis's husband and she had something from Dex Dex Dexter I'm gonna be lame is that look at that cast Joan Collins she's still hot back then she's the original milf right yeah for sure cuz she was super hot how old do you think she was back then fifty yeah she was 51 she was flushing Dex Dex she's hot as fuck and look at Ricardo Montalban how much Pete that dude got paid on that fucking Island House Island how they haven't done a remake of fairness he didn't they did a comic well couple comics went out there and did it yeah they had it they had it was on TV for a little bit no they fuck wasn't The Love Boat yeah was it cool alive boat am i confusing it before fucking them no but I mean a new version of it was there was either a new version of The Love Boat or new version of Fantasy Island so one of the two neither one dynasty actually was but it was in the 90s it was it was in the 90s because do you memory cherry-red Wilson tonight yeah so Jerry read Wilson was supposed to be filming that what was it which was about the next will of vote Jerry Brad Wilson was supposed to be filming that show and he went to a doctor and turned out he had meningitis and I guess apparently he left the doctor's office cause it was awaiting a honeymoon and he by time he got there I guess flying when you have that's really bad but time he got there he died where he died shortly after it's horrible horrible to hear he was a good guy he was a good guy that funny funny honest is so you had a lot of fucking character I worked at that kid a lot in New York we did gigs together on the road together a little bit too I was a good little clique I'm in Bloomington Seattle he came up louis c.k came up all those guys were all coming up together at that time in New York so it was a good bunch of guys you know you know yeah man they do remake a lot of fucking television shows though I mean it is fucking ridiculous they were they remake so many shows makes it like is it that hard to come up with a new line of thought like how many more fazham be show is gonna have they have a new zombie show right I think they're making World War Z as China but there's a new Walking Dead in China now I think okay Jesus Christ like that I think I know what's gonna happen bad things you know like you have when you were growing up I don't know what the fuck he grew up let's just say Boston for a while there was one fucking sandwich shop and he wanted it all the time a little Italian guy and then he made you legitimate and which and all of a sudden another guy opened up but that was cool but now subway came and now the Safeway started making sandwiches so now nobody's making money it's the same thing with movies and TV it's like there's so much content we can't keep up with it can keep up you can't keep up with the amount of content that's out there so when you try to remake the show I want it to be they remake a ton of shit but they forget the main element of it which is the heart aspect of it let me tell you something you gotta say that's good that's out right now on Amazon Prime marvelous mrs. Mazal tremendous some of you some mediums you watch it yeah yeah the two episodes why she's a stand-up comic and she's hanging out with Lenny Bruce it's fucking amazing it's a good cool show it's a real good show it's a real good show that's the first show I've ever watched on Amazon Prime it's very easy to do you just set it up through the Apple TV with a log and or bam fucking things it's fucking it's like but the thing about like things like Apple TV or Netflix that are so good is once you're logged in it's right there right you go to it it's easy we're so lazy now that the extra step to log in to another service whether it's whatever it is you know would another thing on top of the getting onto iTunes all right Evan one more thing oh my god I gotta use my password like that little extra step even just setting it up once you get it set up you can just go to it but before you do that that extra step bothers the shit out of people for whatever reason it's ease oh I just have my wife programming for me my iPad you no no no I got to play I pull into airplane mode I hit the Wi-Fi thing and that's II know I'm watching fucking TV I get it I try to keep it's like I'm work right now I'm on the second time or watching narcos Mexico because I like the acting so much that the guide Diego Luna Joe Rogan ain't no joke that dude was a goober my time being it's such a difference he's such a badass motherfucker I don't want to spoil it for you but fuck you if you haven't watched it by now you slippin yeah I only watched the first two seasons together you watch the Pablo sees yeah which one he was very good he was a very good actor I enjoyed him then the third season with the but the colony cartel and that was okay this Mexican one just stood alone one this we're fully based from when you watch this shit explains a lot why Felipe is the way Felipe is I tell you what if I could move this in the lower I would I belong down it's just a city full of fucking fucking crazy thieves and shit you know they just crazy and they figured out how to grow weed in the desert and they were making thirty million dollars a week a bunch of crazy fucking Indians oh we never found out how much what percentage of marijuana did we'd used to have is you're right but it's also really hard to test back then and they cross yeah they were testing him right it's wrong this weed I was smoking back then with chocolate I weed that we've made you go fucking crazy someone to explain to me the difference between strains that were raised in Afghanistan and and strains that came from other places right like right now Dean our friends from the store he got a seed from an Afghani weed from the old days shit so here apologized that I guess the word he uses and he keeps trying to get that seed but I storm I'm smoking Afghani weed you were going for rock you were going for a ride but your your tolerance is so high now and the weed you're smoking is weapon-grade I mean you're you are you are smoked in some of the most insane weed I hate a bleep a vape pen the other day a simple little vape pen I took one hit I was obliterated you couldn't believe it all right now yeah damn strong they are now you gotta be really careful now I was cocky I was treating like the old ones especially those disposable ones you can take 3-4 hits before you even feel it one hit of alliterated but especially since I stopped with the edibles that changed the game Oh me yeah the edible drop change the game of it you a hundred percent off the edibles 100 percent oh my god a job a buddy George has thousand milligram Hannibal's and he gave me two bags I think like tonight oh I'll take a bite out of the edible cause it's Christmas but I had to cut it out because it was just killing me it was it was taken away from my other high I enjoy taking two hits off a pipe in the morning gets me gone gets me listening to music I'm writing a little bit of moose I love being loose on with the movie tie-in 9 I had two hits at me and I'm sorry I enjoy that shit I can't when I throw on the road I don't bring a pipe so I gotta bring joints in me if I gotta come down off the 11th floor and walk two blocks I gotta smoke the whole fucking joint so I gotta go back to my room and pass out right that's how strong the way this I can just kills me especially now I'm not eating them anymore yeah just kills me mummifies me I go back to the room I watch two three episodes or something I think of that this scientists making weed now I mean they've gotten they got real botanists involved there's money in it now and now that it's opening up in Canada it's gonna be really weird because in Canada they're making it legal right it's legal now so I'm pretty sure RJ Reynolds is that who wasn't just dumped a shit ton of money into some marijuana production in Canada that's gonna follow suit the United States it's there's too much money involved in it and it's gonna be good for everybody it's gonna be good for capitalism it's gonna be good for people getting marijuana as long as regular people could sell marijuana to let fuckin r.j. Reynolds as long as they don't put some restrictions like they were trying to put was it you Jamie they told me about what they were trying in Ohio where they were trying to make it set up where you could you could grow weed but only a couple companies could grow it so the we would be legal but only a couple companies will monopolize and then everybody was like fuck this they but they ended up passing it I believe that's terrible it's sad that that mean that's such a corruption that's like saying okay you can have Tomatoes but we're the only ones who grow these fucking Tomatoes like why it's a tomato that's a law against nature so you're saying that nature can't take place I can't put a seed in the ground and grow my own shit get the fuck out of here is it legal it's legal okay how's it different than corn how's it different than a fucking pear tree it's not it's it's a legal life form it's a life form it's a plant you're allowed to grow it if you say you can't grow it you got a corrupt system you got some bullshit law that you weaseled in because you greased up some assholes and the other people don't have as much money as you do it's the only reason why that ever happens or people are so desperate to get legal weed that they let some dickhead dominate the entire industry some greedy fuck no the the deal is it's legal or it's not legal otherwise we're in some sort of a weird dictatorship you know this is not you can't just decide it's legal but you're the one gets to make money fuck you it's a plant that's crazy imagine if you owned all the pine trees in the country it's all me it's my country my pine trees you want to buy pond you're buying it from me I find you with a fucking Christmas tree I'll take you out crazy no what happened last week was calm oh I don't know in New York he said he wants to legalize weed oh yeah he wants to make his recreation York stupid to shoot down you should be making money off of it it exists no matter what you do if you're a capitalist if you're your person who believes in free market you already have whiskey you already have pills people can get high they're not sober just they're just not stop with the childish arguments give the fucking people freedom and make money off it you dummies that's what everybody should be doing they should make it legal and profit off it and they wouldn't stop with that either it should go to mushrooms should go to a lot of different things they should set up clinics she set up places where people can go through mushroom therapy people that have suffered they're coming back from the war PTSD you there's there's so many different Bennett's for depression people that are getting ready to you know to pass away they have extreme anxiety a lot of that is alleviated by mushrooms people that have gone through like extensive cancer treatment and realize their terminal one of the best things for these people is mushrooms it helps them eases their pain and suffering in their last dying days and it doesn't seem to have any negative effects you know other than the occasional person losing their fucking marbles which is gonna happen no matter what you do it's it's something that should be studied and it's not something that should be free and it could benefit people so it should be fucking legal I think if everybody models what Colorado's doing people see it you know there's a lot of naysayers in this business and they don't understand that in Colorado you get tax rebates tell me that Colorado's real estate went through the fucking roof yeah you know this is this is something that I hope most states go for and I know that there's a back angle to it it's a gateway drug it's this it's that it depends what you do with it you know only argument is traffic fatalities that's the only argument I have have we had a lot of increase in traffic fatalities but what I've read is it depends on who it's a problem is it's hard to find the study that's absolutely correct some say there's been an increase some say the increase increase corresponds to the population increase I've read that too I don't know if that's true but that kind of makes sense that if you get more people in the city you're gonna have more people driving you have more traffic accidents period so if the number just goes up but the population is increased by 14 percent or whatever it's done that would kind of make sense but also let's be honest some people don't drive very well when they're high and if you're out there driving high and spacing out you're a fucking idiot you might slam into a car that's entirely possible - and to deny that that's possible seems silly but I think that it's like everything else there's people that are responsible people and there's people that aren't and there's people that are good drivers there's people that aren't there's people that drive is tracted there's people that don't pay attention to shit and then there's people that do you know whether they're high or sober I would rather have you driving then a lot of people driving sober I know you don't fuck with your phone when you're driving I've seen you drive you drive you take it fucking seriously you look around you know you're not interested in getting any stupid car accident cuz you weren't paying attention I've seen you drive I'll fucking take you high any day of the week I'll Drive with address it was a cell phone addiction I Drive very defensively i watch everything i watch everything coming from all angles especially today you have to double-check everything when you drive yeah our dear friend when we live when they leave me got hit by a car dog yeah heard three weeks ago crossing the fucking Street she broke both her legs yeah I want people to understand that you have to have your eyes open oh I don't take nothing for granted I don't care that guys stopping there when I'm making that right I'm watching that motherfucker plus I got a watch for pedestrians because they will walk out anywhere next thing that you drag on a guy three fucking blocks so I did not know the one who was hit by a car yeah she was in a car accident no she she was in - listen - right away the whole thing I mean somebody was telling me the story I mean it was just you have to pay fucking attention so I Drive there's only a little New York in my drive there's only a little New York in my drive number two I Drive away from the people I do take the two or three car lengths I never did that to about ten years ago my rear-ended somebody you know you know we're driving in a place where you have to assume unless you're fucking stupid that 30% of the people for the last ten years have been driving high then you gotta had another 20% for people that are texting and driving then you gotta add another 10% for people who are just visiting it and I'm looking around going oh my God look how beautiful California is hmm it's a fuck every time you get the car you have to drive a certain way was it how I thought 20 years ago no I want to get there why do you think I'm against high speed cars I wanted to ninety Joe I'm getting the Porsche I'm doing lately I ripped it take it up you give me a pickle I'm ripping I knew you were gonna get rid of those Cadillacs for a while but you decided not to there's another I gotta forgive you see my feet my foot is very large they're very large and once they rest on you it's 90 okay so that gas pedal I made it to San Diego and back don't say anybody don't tell people is secret it's not illegal okay I'm sick and tired of people coming to me going oh my god to drive to San Diego was horrific what time did you go 1:00 in the afternoon can I smack you now or should I smack you in the mouth later that's four hours that's three and a half but isn't that crazy that it takes that long but if you get in your car at 9:00 and you do fucking 80 because all you need to do is get out of LA once you pass the Commerce Casino it's a river of dirty nobody gives the Frenchman's fuck you stain that second to left lane and you're just doing 75 baby it's an hour an hour 45 on the way back I made it from La Jolla an hour 30 whoa because I that's the easy route soon as you hit the five north you're banging out the hole were quick all the way to Camp Pendleton yeah Haiti you know I'm saying you don't give a fuck so you got fucking serious on it's nobody out there it's a weird area though too when you're coming back from San Diego says militarize and you're hit 80 80 80 80 80 then when the road starts to thin that means you're about to hit immigration they're gonna ask you if you got oranges you know you know what how they never up there those motherfuckers head without this is 911 all right you just once I hit that point I kick it to a hundred till I hit her vine once I hit a vine spectrum I come down til about 80 80 80 80 and that's the highway 19 miles back up to a hundred but then you're gonna hit traffic because you're gonna hit the ten to five everybody's hooking up you did good 1:01 but can I get back on that 134 please and that 134 neat no ha the five goes into the 134 and next thing are you home no drama the night driving from San Diego is the way they do it yeah you definitely want to drive home after the kid you don't away for the morning fuck though sometimes you're so tired you scared no no that morning that we all got morning it's two hours no you stop get yourself a nice coffee hmm and you fucking Zhuang it all the way back to Lawson no you're right that's what you definitely should do but man with that you know which the key for folks who you worry about falling asleep in your car while you driving get a rag or a t-shirt and get some ice it's the best wet rag with ice in it is the best just rub it on your face real quick and you wakes you right the fuck up and it lasts for a few minutes then just do it again a few minutes later and you'll be fine the whole way home if you can keep ice and a like a washcloth or something like that with ice in it and it gets wet just keep rubbing your face it's better than anything I used to smack myself in the face when I was getting up early in the morning to do newspapers when I was delivering newspapers then I would do gigs at night I was fucking tired man and I would be coming back you know at midnight from this gig and I knew I had to get up at 5:00 a.m. to deliver newspapers depending upon the day and I'm talking smack myself in the face because I was falling asleep at the wheel I would just feel my eyes getting heavy and I'm opening them up and I couldn't keep it I just fucking whack and if you whack yourself in the face it lasts for like a couple of minutes like you're like Jesus oh just my whole face would be stinging you know just like seriously slap myself really hard in the face whenever a fucking coffee guy I thought I was as a kid I mingled in Cuban coffee but I just straight away from it so when I first started Tribble runs I would have my kid at 2:00 in the afternoons on Sunday and I don't get off stage and Boise Idaho I had 11:30 at Schiphol run my car would be filled with gas and I'd get in it right in hell four or five rows no doves and I would go to a gas station get the biggest mountain to do a little and that would thought was six hours I would eat no dose but one of the worst experiences I ever had was I was falling asleep like I was done and it was fucking ten below zero you know and I pulled over on the side of the road I turned my lights on I put the brake lights on and I kicked the seat back and laid down with the heat blasting and the car was out and at one point you're rolling I opened up my eyes and I thought I had lost control at all in your mind you feel like it but I lose them haven't be holding on to steering wheel he says my heart almost stopped and going thank God and get fucking hit here but I was in nodos this is way before red blue Bull Red Bull whatever that shit is yeah well I still remember doing coke all night and shooting a short film for Fox and I'll never forget that fucking they gave me two red bulls I drank two of them and I still fell asleep and ever since that I go Red Bull sluts the fuck is a Red Bull yeah yeah the fucking Red Bull don't do dick hey what do you think of this John John shit what's going on do you know what's happened the AFC's moving from Vegas I saw this last when I got home from the comedy store break it down for me I'm having Jeff Novitzky come on and breakdown scientifically on Thursday a lot of people calling bullshit including Daniel Cormier I talked to call me on the phone he was like he tested positive again do you believe this shit and they get a little fight I found out about it from Cormier Kwami he told me they're gonna move the fight to LA I go no yes Joe don't move with the fight to LA I'm like no this can't be real it didn't seem real like I don't believe this I looked at his core me aids Twitter and I said it's a he tested positive again and then I looked that one what this is like first thing in the morning and he's like again again but from what I understand from reading Ariel Helwani zhh transcript of his interview with Andy Foster and hearing what Jeff Novitzky has had to say about it what it is is the num the the amount of it is so infinitesimal and it's the exact same metabolite that he had been screened for that he tested positive for a year ago and that this shit could stay in a system in those kind of sizes of the molecule it's like some 500 millionth of a grain of sand or something like that see Google with the actual number of the how small this molecule is so Andy foster has said again through this transcription of this interview that he did with Ariel Helwani that it's the same metabolite for the same substance they tested positive for that is the same instance that the the number of it and it indicates that this is something he's already been punished for it's the same exact he's already gone through his you know his steps and this is just a infinitesimally small metabolite that's that's what I'm hearing so I would love to hear someone who doesn't think that that's the case that thinks there might be some way to gain the system and the big thought that people always bring up when it comes to stuff as micro dosing if someone micro dosing like you're the one who told me about that first you were telling me about somebody Alex Rodriguez yeah who is taking he'll be bad Tommy Bennett Ostrom yeah he was so he would be up for the seventh eighth and ninth inning but by the time the tenth inning came if they tested him it would be out of his system so I would imagine the testing is better now and it's one of the things is that Nowitzki once get into that the testing is far superior now so you're able to pick up these metabolites in much much smaller quantities okay this is so this test is from December 9th yes I want to see what his test was leading up to that apparently was clean before that he said we were notified early this month of an issue he has had over his most recent tests where a very small amount of fact described how small it is of a long-term metabolite substance called d h CMT known as oral turin the ball turn a ball which is the reason for his most recent suspension a year and a half ago a very very small amount but there was a number that where does it say the number there was a knack right yeah something like how much smaller it is in a grain of rice is it can't find ya let's try finite yeah look I get how everybody would be fuckin pissed I get how everybody would think that he's a cheater he's cheating again I get that you would think that but I don't know if that's true and if it's not true it would be a shame to accuse him of it if it is the same stuff that was in his system that was ruled to be from a tainted supplement here it is a picogram is one trillionth of a gram novitskiy said if you put one grain of salt on the table and split it up into 50 million pieces a picogram is one of those pieces of that gram of salt which is insane so that grain of salt it's some 50 million times large or smaller than that it's crazy so it's very very very very small so if this is true and they believe it's true and the guy runs California State Athletic Commission Andy Foster I have a great great deal tremendous amount of respect for that guy very proactive with weight cutting very proactive with weight class is very proactive with a lot of the rules he's really good if he believes that this is scientifically been proven to be from the same exact thing that he already has been punished for I agree with them I just that that guy knows what the fuck he's talking about he's legit so is Nowitzki so are these people that are all saying that it's legit here's the question though have other people been still punished for the exact same crime have other people tested positive again for the exact same thing this I do not know and I don't know if people are looking into that if there is any preferential treatment that would be where the argument would be with preferential treatment he's fucking tainted supplements are a legitimate problem I mean Nowitzki showed us hundreds and hundreds of supplements you could at any store that has you know vitamins and muscle builders and all those kind of things that test positive for steroids there's a shit ton of a mouth there man you can get a lot of stuff in these system but then there's also people that are taking steroids so how do you know who to the only way to find out who's who is don't take shit don't take anything unless his third-party test it don't think anything controversial don't take anything squirrelly and sometimes people do and it's fucked up that you know they maybe they like a supplement maybe they've had good results with it and then they get one bad batch that's possible too I just want to know that this was from December night I want to know what the levels of that drug they found were before December 9 it takes a long time I understand so but every time you urine the level should get lower and lower and lower I think what they're saying is this is the lowest detectable number so so lower than them so they should have found this before maybe this higher maybe not depending the did see these numbers the way it's been explained to me again I'm not a fucking scientist but the way it's been explained to me this number is so small that it could conceivably be tested in one test and not tested another test and then also as the testing procedures get more and more thorough they get better at it they're detecting things that couldn't detect maybe even just a year ago like it's continue the technology is to continuing to grow and they're getting much better at understanding how to use it how to how to advance it so it's not as simple as you test positive a year ago you test negative today like they might have better methods of detection today than they had a year ago you got arrested today Joe the judges on the fake Joe Rogan I'm releasing you on bail but the DEA wants you to take a urine test right to the samples and if you come back dirty the first you way is free they know who Joe Rogan is you're gonna go in there and you're THC levels gonna be off the chain this is gonna be off the chain this the other chain when they come back they gonna coy and they lose your Rogen this is what it was now this is this the next time we test it the bell not be higher than 26% doesn't know you using this isn't 97 yeah he told me right I'll know if you use it on that and I stayed to the program and I went down down down down down and then I joined the voluntary group and my buddy sent me an eighth of PI weed I loved him was smokin enjoying going back and the guys like Dawg did you smoke a joint before you came in for the test it was like levels we've never seen before this is I'm telling you about this this is a funny joke and whatever but I want to see the test before the 9th and I want to see the test the most recent test those levels haven't go down unless I understand we're saying to us he's not necessarily correct unless he did this steroid during nun competition season which they were allowed to do whatever the fuck no they're not that's not true they never know they can never take steroids there's a band list of things they can never have in their system they see if you are fighting they'll still test you say if you don't have a camp you're not in your on camp you don't have about lined up they still do Joey Diaz how are you come on in the bathroom we're gonna get some get some fluids from you now I don't know if they use in just urine or Verde's if it's urine and blood I'm not sure with the protocol but I do know that it's very thorough and they're catching people for things that they would have never caught them for in the past and this is one of the things about this test it could possibly be as it's been explained to me that this this number is so fucking small that they might not even been able to detect it a year ago but this number this insanely small number there's new levels of detection now whereas he would be completely negative X amount of time in the past now they can test it and they could find that insanely 50 millionth of a grain of salt size particle it's it's so fucking small that they weren't able to catch something like that X amount of time in the past whether it's a year ago or two years but now they can and in the future it's gonna be even better they're gonna keep getting better at this stuff as they advance the technology that's as it's been explained to me what you're seeing here what you're seeing here is not evidence of new drug use it's evidence that the testing is far better and that he has the exact same metabolites and he definitely did have it in the system because they're finding it a year later in this teeny tiny amount his body hasn't completely gotten rid of it yet still in there the question is how long is that stuff stay in your system they've said through normal detection I believe Google this make sure this is correct but through normal detection what's not I mean from whatever the time they they wrote this stuff out I believe they're saying it can be detected up to 18 months but again as this technology gets better and they can detect smaller and smaller particles it's potentially possible that that might extend so you might not just be 18 months it might be 19 or 20 or who knows how long it takes for your body to get rid of that shit the guys like Cormier and Gustafson and guys that you know they look at this is where there's smoke there's fire oh yes you know and there's they have a point to they have a point oh so I'm not mad at them for that I'm a big fan of John Jones person I am too for what he does I love them to death when I saw him in Albuquerque came to the show we laughed I don't think I don't know what to think anymore you know I don't know what to think this one really you know and I feel bad we you and I both know this is the car of the year it's a phenomenal cause the card when people fly in and it made plans around it and they do a bunch of stuff around it I feel bad for those people I know what this is like for them they just was this Saturday night activity well in Vegas it takes a big hit too because this was gonna be taking place in Vegas all those people are gonna be in town it's gonna be a tremendous amount of money for the casinos and you know that I'm sure it was a lot of money for them there it was but it's a big thing to have there and a bigger arena so they're moving it to the forum which is a smaller place the forum in Inglewood is I don't know how much smaller does the t-bone mobile arena but he said he was Dana was saying he could make about six million dollars on the gate and t-mobile Arena and he's gonna be lucky to make a million in the forum that makes sense it's just it's different prices too in vase and also the fact that it's such short timing I don't know what they do with the original tickets I don't know how it works this is what happened the very first UFC I ever did the very first UFC ever work was in Dothan Alabama UFC 12 but was supposed to be in New York State they cancelled in New York State they wouldn't let him do it and then they they switched the whole thing overnight down to Dothan Alabama I take one of them helicopter plane and flying a fucking Dothan it was weird it was weird back then man but that's that's the only time I've ever heard of something changing this close to that was one day this is one week I've never heard of an event changing like this before not that I could remember I don't know what the fuck is happening I really don't but they seemed very confident that you're not dealing with someone who's taking a drug again you're dealing with the very same drug that he took X amount of months ago still in a system the drug he's already been punished for I understand that people get mad but you you don't want to accuse someone of something that they're not really guilty of he's definitely guilty of taking it the first time people are accusing them of being stupid and taking it again I don't think that's true I don't know for a fact but what I'm reading from actual experts leads me to believe that they're making sense but I would have to you know I'd have to talk to someone who disagrees who knows more about it than me to really form an opinion so my opinion is like well if I had a bet I would say he probably didn't do anything but I would like to talk to someone who's like a real fucking expert who could break down exactly what the process is who can tell you if it is even possible that this could be from another ingestion somewhere along the line and you let me tell what the sad sad thing about this whole situation is what they really really from the bottom of my heart was a great card oh it's a great car you don't win BJ pens on the card and nobody even talks about it yeah nobody even mention BJ pad well you know BJ stuff fights I was looking for Carlos and Michael J's you know Amanda Nunez and Cyborg I haven't slept for a week all right put the car to figure that fight out Jon Jones Gusterson just to look at it let's pretend it's still in Vegas you know you got a guy who's been active a guy who's been fighting a guy who's angry a guy who felt he beat Jon Jones the first time against a very very talented dangerous and rested Jon Jones is their ring dust you know is their ring rust I'm sorry ring dust what the fuck am I talking about you know look at this you know man in a Kris cyborg has been bitch-slap and motherfuckers since day one a man the Nunez is something that you taught me about that's not around anymore and that's being slick a man the Nunez is very slick she's taking out some tough opponents you know she hits very hard he hits very you know long arms really watch those rocks and Carlos kinda with Michael chaser this is a great fucking fight right here you know amad Mendez Alexander Volkov ski fucking tremendous by - Chad Mendes looks amazing in his comeback fight when you go scroll back up to the Cris cyborg event Chris Korey Anderson's leather is real hard breaking his wife seven months pregnant mmm no they gotta get that away you know this has yeah it's a disaster but this honestly guys was one of those cards that I look at and go okay what are the main two fights I know favorite on paper you gotta go over cyborg and John Jones but guess what people you never seen a bookie with a part-time job so somebody's got to lose one of these fights keeps groans if you don't mind season to think about Chris cyborg is she's not just good she's good and ball cats and gah know Megan and this and aundrea Lasky's fighting on this card she's Australian gotta say Meegan Meegan whatever you don't think I'm no fucking English major you got BJ bad Ryan fucking Hall I think that's the first fight of the a yes yeah yeah crazy yeah I saw big good cars and I know on K bump on Instagram the other day she looks phenomenal she looks fucking phenomenal so it's a shame that this had to be done I'm sorry listen I'm I'm happy that the fights are taking place I'm sorry I'm just happy that they've taken I'm sorry that everybody gets their life disrupted and the families have to go from Vegas to LA to see the fight I'm sorry about all the hotel bullshit that they have to deal with but I'm very happy that the fight is still taking place I would love it if Oba ran a fucking special for people just a flat yeah just run a flat for fucking people out of Vegas 300 never gonna happen though you never know each other and you never know you never know people need fucking action come on let's go boys step up bitch make a flat rate for three fucking people to fuckin forum and 300 back people would do it it's driving an uber some guy farting in a car all the way from Vegas to LA why would you do that when you take a flight because the flights not that expensive Uber's bro it is on a day's notice is it how much the Southwest cost its 255 here's the van 303 is your teacher I had a car with a guy farting for three or four three three hundred divided by three I save two hundred something Joe wrong we have to look at them from their perspective you know they've already fucking taken away and said Stan they're losing the day of work this is a lot well also they can't gamble like a lot of people love the combination of gambling gambling go to the show exacts a lot of people stuck a lot of people gonna fuck I just take my money from the ticket yeah and staying gamble next day or whatever because what's it gonna cost me to ooh but la get out party whoo look you gonna come to a lane just get in the car that's you're trying to tell me now you want to go to a party yeah Oh what's his name John Jones might be having a party Carlos conduit might be having half the party Uriah Hall I think you're right all's on this card too busy I wasn't in the yeah Uriah halls on this card I think yeah yeah you have to be oh wow yeah yeah okay we didn't see look at this part you God knows who's having Brian calendars on us fight and Kurtis millander that is a fucking sleeper fight right there yeah no yeah it's a fucking Beast Kurtis millander that guy is he's got serious potential he's got like superstar future superstar potential he's very good that's a that's good fight I like that a lot Kurtis millander is the one he fought Thiago Alves and stopped him right click on that make sure that's correct does it show his record does it show his record how good is their website now is pretty good yeah that's it Thiago Alves he beat Thiago Alves yeah and then he beat max Griffin he's a beast man he's very good real real massive future potential and by her design it knocks people dead he hits hard that's a sleeper fight that's a fight that no one's talking about very very good fight it's gonna be a great card man I'm happy the cards happening I hope everybody gets compensated I'm sorry that the UFC loses money I'm sorry that everybody gets dragged through I don't understand why they couldn't just figure out this in Nevada it's like this I guess they're on vacation or some shit that's so crazy like figure it out everybody let's make a phone call like isn't there one person who could like some person should say okay is it to the best of your knowledge absolutely from the original test yes sir by all the science we're gonna submit the science and we show you the science when tell you the number okay let him fight the fuck you let them fight you gotta let them fight California let him fucking fight Nevada stupid how fucking stupidity raka see it's just dumb stupid that in this case it's due this case it's a fucking they're on vacation yes well let's have a fucking emergency meeting yeah let's save big the tourism board in Vegas must be steaming hey ask this ask this Google this find out who's disputing if anybody dispute if anybody like makes any sense if there's a scientist or someone like that who says that it could be micro dosing or that it did that what the California State athletic commissions understanding of it is not correct let's find out there's anybody that has written anything about that I'm upset I just wanted this fight to take place without any bullshit behind it I just want it to be a great fight it's a it's an amazing match out I think Gustafson especially against Glover Teixeira has never looked better he's he's long as John he's got crazy footwork he's the older first guy to ever take John down it was a fucking tough fight regardless of whether or not John prepared much for it I don't think he did prepare as good as you could have Gustafson's better I think than he was when that fight took place I really do think he's better it's uh it's fucking phenomenal it's an amazing fight and John's gonna be so motivated to try to get stripped the way he got stripped all the different things that he's fucked up to have a chance at redemption it's gonna be so emotive in but you also have to consider the incredible amount of pressure he's going to be under - historically though he's a guy who shines under pressure I mean stop shogun and his first title fight when he was what was he 22 or something like that he's a monster john has always been good at fighting top-level competition good at handling the stress this is you know it's a different kind of stress this is I fucked up stress it's not this is a big fight this is a big fight plus I fucked up and everybody knows I fucked up and this is not even the current fuckup it's reminding him of the past fuck up and then there's the other stuff the car accident and all the other crazy shit all of it's bad but he has an opportunity at redemption it's just when you know how much is on the line because he's undefeated right except for the Matt Hamill fight which we know he was destroying Hamill and he was disqualified it wasn't a real loss like somebody beat him he's beaten everybody that's unprecedented outside of khabib nurmagomedov nobody beats everybody Jon's beaten everybody so there's going to be a certain amount of people that looking forward for him to fail and he feels that too so a lot going on man it's a lot going on in this fight and Gustafson is fucking good you see the combination he knocked out clover Teixeira with whoa that's like some videogame shit man it was like he was in mortal combat it was tremendous his footwork everything I was really who I got a work Saturday night I'm working I'm relaxed not all week are you really yeah I forgot I thought it was this last week up so I thought it was this last weekend so I called the store I call then and then I go fuck no I'm not missing and I called back and cancelled and then like Wednesday I go what the fuck am I thinking so I ended up back at the store Saturday night I squeezed onto Brian's shelf I got to see Tiffany Haddish I hadn't seen her since she busted out became a star it was great just to see her bullshit with her and then last night I went down then there was two shows there was I'm leaving they're like hey you won't open up for sure pal I know sure pal where they know if he's doing his show in the belly room there was a fucking line around the corner unless something that I pulled out I was like this is crazy this is getting so fucking insane I took two weeks off from gettin on stage after la hoy I did too late some lawyer and that was tremendous to each other on the high is amazing you know law is the room you go to when you want to put you want to thread that hour together they take the right with you that's one of the few rooms this takes the right we do two shows a night down there yeah yeah yeah that place is amazing it's like a comedy store south yeah really is a little bit more loose yeah even though it's Friday the sound it will let you try some new shit they're fun people down there man very fun that's a nice area like dobutamine Diego has a lot of the same qualities that LA has but it's more like a little bit more the rest of the country boy is beautiful boy it was went to Ron on jujitsu I trained when they the place is right next to the fucking candy store really yeah I just looked it up called the guy was awesome Levin you know La Hoya is that's why you moved to when you got a lottery this that's a lot of down there he lives on that Coronado Island doesn't he where Donald Rumsfeld I don't know who fucking was gotta rich dudes but it is just gorgeous you can't see at night there's no lights on the streets there's nothing they encourage that listen 9:30 go to bed go to fucking bed go to bed all right we don't want you wanna mingle they'll fucking down this hour whatever Street Scotty Shore lives down there he showed up did he he showed up on Saturday okay yeah hug it was great to see him he has a little dog with him he had the little dog cuz I do it joking but I gotta get his dick sucked with a dog so at the end he goes the night inspires Ebola no no I did see the dog he came down to see loose don't playing the piano I mean the county store down there did not lose anything except Mitzi sure plus it's got more shit on the walls that you look at him really makes you think mmm there's pictures of green room for Jim Carrey and Paul Rodriguez and Dice Clay and Louie Anderson at the time that they didn't even know that we're gonna be stars yes we done down there yeah we said a lot of shows when did we first started working together down there I think the first nineties oh yeah it was late night the first time I went down at one time there was a girl comic who was it I don't remember what her name was it was a very uncomfortable weekend she was clean oh you had to stay in the condo with her yeah oh that's crazy I read there imagine a girl being forced to stay in a condo with a guy that you don't even know she stayed in the headline I stayed in the feature room at that time still it's weird then I went down there she wouldn't book me down there but once she started booking me she booked me a lot Mitsy yeah I remember one going down there one time and I went down there with Marilyn Martinez and her husband and we weren't there in the hour and Marilyn Martinez husband comes out with a fucking rat well with a rat in a trap the trap that he set he does we won't hear motherfucking like as the rumor was there were rats down there be careful Oh so he went down and said traps up within the power you did bah oh my god the fucking thing had to be 9 inches long the tail and I'll never forget going on the balcony and hearing them in the weeds I packed up my little sleep apnea machine and I fucking drove back home I fucking hate rats well this door has so many rats that back area oh my oh my god they're fucking popping out every time you're sitting back there there's a little for folks that are listening to us there's a little back bar area where only comics and their friends can go and behind the back bar is a smoking area and that smoking area has these railroad ties these railroad ties these rats will run in and out of these ties and over the Jew feel like all the time all the time if I'm back there for more than 15 minutes I've seen a rat and if you go near the hedges by the dumpster that's where they really are where where the back area is not that big it's the hills the hills are filled with rats the Hollywood Hills are filled with rats occasionally we have cats that hang around the park amount economy store like local feral cats but they don't get the rats because the rats go in the fucking the vines those vines that cover the side of the comedy store ramp the ramp that leads up to the Andaz hotel those vines are all rats that's a rat village it's crazy how much sound they make when you're parking a car you hear i'm scurrying there's like probably hundreds of rats there dude I know whenever I parked my car my dump site close the windows Oh because I know I don't want to jump into a car with a fucking listen to me I just leave fucking and leave Aspen I don't like $80,000 I got any people looking for me the cops are looking for me I go from Aspen to Boulder and I need a job so I take a job making Jo I'm not kidding 160 a week 60 hours Wow as a fucking shag which I'm the guy that takes a car from me in the body shop when you pull up on me and it takes it and I wash it and they start the bodywork and then after they've done the bodywork I'm the guy that washes and if he do that for three or four months then they turn you into a detailer and I passed the test memory game indeed they hit 160 dollars a week all it was fucking garbage I was starving starving but I was good and I became a detail but the detailing was commissioned and you made a hundred to a buck fifty a day and you know I was enjoying it but the guy I had as a boss was a dish his name was dirt Jordan he was just a dick so he was one of those guys that was one of us but when they get to manage his job I'm one then I'm back there washing the fucking car and I see a dead rat and I picked the fucking rat up and he had his jacket hanging by the door I put the dead rat in his pocket that was jagged right you know me thought I go home I get stoned I don't know nothing the next morning he comes in bro and his cat cause fucked up like he hit like a pole he went in his pocket to get a cigarette ah and he pulled the fucking rat out and he fucking just went crazy and hit like a pole he came in running I know who did this I'm gonna get for the bottom of this that he can't blame it some other guy Oh bosses fuck man that's one of the worst relationships ever a boss an employee one of the worst relationships some guy gets to tell you what to do he's the fucking he's the head guy at the office you gotta listen to this fuckhead that is one of the worst positions to be in working for a guy who's a dick and that power that someone would have you know if you were you moved on up he became the office manager you can control people's future control where they get a raise how much time they get off you can make the decisions well then I allowed him to do certain things what was fucking terrible was the wars boss you bad let's come on and be clean was the first caption what was the first guy you looked at and said you know what if I have a see outside am I'm a fuck yeah I never said that but uh guys in construction they would get real Dicky I did one time there was a guy when I was a teenager that was talking about the shed he would hit me with a hammer yeah there was a because he got he got aggressive with me and it was and it wasn't in a way where I deserved it he was just bullying me and I was like 16 17 but I had already had a fuck load of fights by then like you know talk about no fights I was like dude I'll kick you in your fucking head like you talk much crazy shit to me like this like he was talking to me in not just a way like a boss employee he was talking to me in a way where I was gonna have to quit but I never never never said I was gonna do anything to him I didn't like threat and I would say I'll see you after this and I'll fuck you up I said don't talk to me like that cuz I could fuck you up that's basically what I said but it was that's the thing about constructions like there was a lot of like man-to-man type conflict like it wasn't unheard of to hear about street fights between guys who are working together they got pissed and pushed each other and punched each other in the fucking snow you know dudes carrying roofing tiles one guy knocks another guy over or something they start fighting that she had happened all the time there's a lot of the people that were doing labor - were like real dirtbag like there was this one guy that I did labor with um I worked my friend Leroy Rodriguez and his buddy they had some business partner that would take apart old houses and redo them and Leroy was one of the black belts at the the Taekwondo Institute he was a bad motherfucker and Leroy got me this gig and I worked with these guys labor and one of the guys we work with lived in this fucked up abandoned building what not abandoned but stripped out building I mean there was parts of the building where there's no floor was all fucked up half the walls were missing they were redoing the whole building and taking things out and fixing things this guy lived there and he had a mountain Dew jug filled with malt liquor and he would drink it warm all day and he'd had the shakes everything he did the dude had the shakes he was just drunk all day on a crazy job site where like you know there's no floors sometimes sleep everything it's all fucked up you have to balance when you're going from one room to the other because they're tearing down parts the wall and this guy somehow another fucking slid on through drinking the entire time and I remember thinking like these are people that have made questionable decisions it makes you want to go back to college makes you want to get a degree when you're around a lot of these guys like laborers and stuff like you know some of them were just like me they're just young guys who need a gig and they need money and some of them are dudes have been doing it their whole life and they're 50 and they're drunk yeah terrible bye yeah I definitely knew I didn't want to do it I definitely knew I didn't want to do it well you know be a carpenter as a different gig you know like a real good carpenter that's a skilled craftsman and an artist you know you're putting together things that's different but the laborer gig was not like you didn't really have to know anything he just had to be big enough to listen to them you know picking up so he could pick things up can you go get that go get me that bag of cement go dude all right you guys gonna take nails out of these boards now and there was like that kind of shit you just hung out with the weirdest people Matt the worst guy I remember Joe Rogan I was clean from coke I was clean about 90 days I was really trying to turn my life around and I answered an ad for construction carpenters help and he hired me I went the first day you had to work for free play for free yeah he absolutely seen yeah so I said okay I agreed to it Wow first they work for free I cut the stuff and you have to go get lunch and the whole thing yeah okay I did it I passed and then the guy would say okay meet me at a diner at 8:00 and when I go get paid he'd say what's those hours and I go you told me to meet you at 8:00 he goes uh no it should be a windshield time so I say the job we didn't get to the job by 10:00 that's when you start getting paid that I started getting paid and I was you know I was that I was really trying and I lived with a friend I want to give them rent money I was trying to put away some money I forget what he paid me didn't but he made me pay for my own lunch then one day he said uh where's your weight belt you know you don't work belt I don't have money no it's okay I'll pay and you have to pay me for the materials plus thirty percent that was a thirty percent yeah you're a fucking scumbag just to have like a claw a fucking hammer and something else I forget what you do work for him so would have your own tool other sword stuff like that yeah that was always a thing whether it's a union or non-union you know there was a lot of the work that I did when I was a kid was non-union and a lot of the people didn't want a union they felt the Union guys they had it easier but it was it was too expensive and people didn't want to you know use certain people so it was it was like a real debate like what's better probably about a union people you have to have a certain amount on you cuz how it works to balance it out right so everybody makes money but it seems like in some things like Auto Workers they don't fuck around brakes glory time yeah you know this lists if a job opens up how do we get it you gotta go on a list Brogan has more minority than D as he started nine months before D as he gets the job yeah you know it's not about knowing all that shit with that dude I'll never forget that news name one he didn't the scumbag he was to me but on Fridays he would make me feel bad like he goes so how many hours did you work and I go 38 no I'm paying you for 30 and he'd bully me this guy but every Friday he go this Friday I'm going away I'm going here to fuck my wife in the ass and he was always an asshole they'll also think I'm like this from my check I got this check I was waiting for and once a day I'm sitting I'm like I'm sick of this motherfucker I'm gonna rob his house and I jumped the fence and I kick the back door on and he was a guy that bought hot shit on the side snowing showers just a bus a sack of shit and he must have had I don't know how many fucked him bottles and cases of Dom Perignon so I fucking ran up to the corner call my buddy don't meet me at this address and I took every bottle of Dom Perignon and he had I sold him in liquor stores I took his checkbook I mean I buried this fucking guy just for how bad he treated me with such a fucking scumbag oh never bought lunch he was always making crazy oh he's always making little fucking remarks well that's what we're talking about earlier when he offends when a guy gets into power that's piece of shit oh my god so war is such a fuck to him yeah but I had his t-shirt for a long time I used the word and smile every time mm-hmm JHS is some shit like that function that's half with his Harvey Weinstein things about right it's about the boss yeah that's what it's about - what the boss abusing his power the boss fucking the girls so they can get the job and that's that's the offer which is probably been going on forever man it's like I said especially here listen they destroyed Marilyn Monroe and that's the ones we know millions of women that come on here I have been put through a fucking process it was always what how these guys got power I mean if you look at a guy like Harvey how else is he gonna get laid let's be honest I mean is he gonna get laid because he's a good-looking guy or is he gonna get laid because he's ruthless and very successful it would have to be ruthless and very successful oh it was that handsome I don't know was it slept with him did whether not a lot well I don't know that didn't win but I mean there's a lot that did the story is that there was a lot that that did it I mean he couldn't have made these offers all these women that said no and not have some of them say yes it doesn't make it any less horrible for the women who said no and were hounded by them and whatever went down and he ruined some careers and but some of them had to say yes it's just some would make that deal with the devil that happens with a lot of different things people make that deal they make that deal it's worth it you know I mean I joked around about it in my act about Harvey know Weinstein but that's that's what a lot of guys would do a lot has a bang some check if that's all it took and you can you can get ahead you know you don't have to marry you just have a fucker how many guys would do that a lot of guys would do that would girls do that to some of them yeah most would not want that to be stuck in front of their face most would rather make their way through the most the vast majority would rather get by on their merits but there's always throughout time there's been people that fuck their way to the top that's not a myth that's not like angels so it's not like Pixies and wood elves people have done it people have done everything that you can imagine people have married people for money people have killed people for their insurance premiums are their insurance policies rather that's that happens when people die they check the spouse to see if the spouse how to fuck an insurance policy if they find out they've recently put out a big fat insurance policy then they go sideways you all did yeah and just vanished in the woods huh that's weird Mike Mike have a seat we're gonna talk what happened again Mike let's just take me through the top tell me what happened you guys know Mike English live in Colorado I was another one that was another one that just happened in Cabo phone ended up in Idaho yeah miles away they saw her leave the supermarket with the child he supposedly picked her up I want to know how you got the phone up there member every cars GPS now yeah no the car unless it's a little drug or you know this there's cars they still have the dawn of GPS this cars you get him stripped they don't have shit in them but it get a really cheap car a truck pickup truck no radio that's of that stolen that baffles me how the fuck did he get to Idaho how about the fucking guy who killed his whole family how about that guy guy killed his wife killed his kids yeah but that guy fucking in this price and he looked so normal you see a picture of him as one of the mistress camera yeah the missus gamer but you look at him to picture him with his family go that guy looks so fucking his own kid how is he capable of killing his wife peep there's there's certain people out there that just they're fucking broken they're broken and you and if you're a woman you have to think about that that's the difference between women and men that's the biggest difference the biggest difference is women have to constantly be in fear of a violent man whereas men rarely are in fear of a violent woman doesn't mean it doesn't happen it happen to my friend Phil Hartman his wife shot him I was asleep that did happen but the vast majority if you're looking at like the numbers of people that are afraid of the opposite sex it's women that are afraid of men it's a different environment so different it's a different dynamic it's not like anything that we could ever really truly appreciate if you know how to handle yourself in that case that happened in Colorado where he killed is there any past the rest of violence I don't think so nothing you just snapped one day bro it doesn't make any same just left and this guy here like I said the only thing that blows you off is her car phone and I know which meant he had to take her right there drive to hi-de-ho which has to be 11 12 hours and drive back 770 miles or what and drive back without nobody noticing it's only pot no gas station attendant recognizing a truck with a child in the back you know they have to do a search of every gas station camera to see if he pulled up and they didn't find him I don't I don't think they've even gone that deep so far hmm but they gotta figure out how her cell phone and the level of fucking mailbox I just don't understand where people get the fucking it is so tough to ice somebody now and think you're gonna get away with it between cellphones drones cameras pictures think about it you think about it how they find everything there it's way more difficult that's fucking rural area rural areas you could still get away with the law no no nothing so look at that chick that was jogging from the university or whatever oh that's right and they for right a ho Iowa they caught it with something they call a little drunk I don't know exact number it's very tough sorry I got a piece so bad well then go ahead do your thing whatever I'm gonna have pissed talked to Jamie and I'll come back I'm not done yet take your time bye hurry up and shit like that it's the holiday season you're sitting around right now thinking you see what's going on with Joe Rogan that's what happens when you turn 50 motherfucker so prepared you drink your water you try to be healthy but you gotta pee all fucking day this is what I live with every fucking night I go to bed I'm nice and sleepy and at one point I got a fucking you get up and pee and it comes out nice and slow to really torture you to really make you think about that ham and cheese sandwich in the fucking refrigerator should you stay up and eat that fucking think thank God it's Merry Christmas time this is the best fucking time because listen I ain't doing dick till Thursday you understand me how about you Jimmy nothing not that I ain't doing dick till Thursday - then I'm one of the crisis with my wife and kid we're gonna sing minger jingle bells and all that shit all the kids get together I'll probably be home by 9:00 tomorrow ain't doing dick thing about doing open mics at the gym tomorrow for jiu-jitsu I might have to go down there 12 just to get some exercise again using excuse to heat I'm thinking about dropping into the combi store on Christmas night it might be boring but it might be an adventure then Wednesday I got dicked and for a Thursday Friday Saturday I'm up there in Oxnard at 11:00 he lives that'll be fun listen Assent it's the weekend before New Year's who the fuck's gonna show up people gonna be waiting for New Year's cuz that's what people do they do you know what I'm just in the way for New Year's Eve and jump up and down I fucking hate New Year's Eve you in the stem have always hated New Year's Eve since I was 18 a New Year's Eve you asking me why do you ain't fuckin New Year's Eve does weird things happen when I was 18 or 17 I saw an rx-7 hit a fucking tree on New Year's Eve when the car got split in half and then the kid was dead the girl got taken out by the jaws of death then the following year I went to a party and I saw my buddy Danny be bite off Rogers ear and we had to drive me to the fuckin hospital with a piece of here and the fucking baggy with ice cubes so that's why you never saw me drink on New Year's Eve any other time when I threw you had 364 days a year for me to snort coke and heat pills and drink when it came to New Year's Eve I minded my fucking business why because it's just a creepy night in fact I'm excited that Joe Rogan's not doing New Year's yet relax I saw that is that what happened the guy fell asleep yeah yeah I saw that walked away I heard probably cuz he was asleep prayer thought it was in a dream didn't stiffen up that was in another country right yeah dude I peed more than I've ever peed in my life right now I got my blood done recently got everything checked up everything's groovy but I was dehydrated so I've been making a point to drink more water what if I keep myself D hard but that doesn't make any sense good drink during the show but if I do that subconsciously to limit my needing to pee during 3 our conversations no I don't think so you know what man I drink water off from day every time I walk out of the dentist doctors well for CEO for a physical he always says drink more water yeah well he still weighs just drink more water it doesn't hurt and you know what I would water next to me which is Big D get up and have a sip of water yeah I'll get up Pete and drink a fucking gallon of water and then because of the sleep have any machines gonna put my fluid in the well right I just bring a bottle of water with me next door all right to the bed was they at night and it's really important if you read up there's a reason there's a reason why you know because when you're over 50 you pee more mm-hmm but there's a read you have to look it up when you're by yourself next time in a hotel room there's a reason why you should sleep tight hydrated hmm when you're over 50 big reasons why well whenever I get whenever I go to yoga class I always feel like I have to make a conscious effort to take that fluid back in cuz you sweat so much one of those hot yoga classes like if you don't make a real like conscious drink of you're thirsty you got to make kind of a conscious effort to get those fluids back in your body and you probably should take some electrolytes too I'm some sort of electrolytes up I just blast the fucking banana man that's good too I blast 2 bananas you say full yep for an hour till 2:00 after you eat mmm I drink water and I also drink a fucking do you have to work out drink sometimes but hat is a good right before you work no pump no calories no sugar no Gatorade no fucking that monster how did you drink I don't touch nothing that ain't all that shit dear all that's just gonna kill fucking people 20 years from now monster energy and all those energy drinks and shit like that they don't kill people dawn my favorite thing is just coffee before any kind of workout just coffee myself do you know that before I go to this store do you know that before I knock on this door I drink a four shot express four shots you know I usually drink one of these even shameless plug for caveman nitros even my wife ago how big is that day and I put that cancer sugar in there and I fucking get sugar free sugar yeah that's a current I get in that fucking car I don't know music just to show it's just me and 4 cups of expresso do you know what's going through my mind if I have the ball sometimes I take a toke off the pipe just to cook the expresso up a level and I pop a nicotine gum oh my god you know why I'm juiced up by the time I get to the Comedy Store because that's what I put myself through the nicotine nicotine gum is supposed to be legit like from what I understand nicotine itself is a really good nootropic they've they've analyzed the cognitive benefits of nicotine on its own but it's addictive so it's it's I don't think this nicotine gum is very healthy for you but if there was a way juice right if there was a way to blast nicotine like maybe chew it like at the back oh like a clean tobacco just to give you a little hmm push off the cliff yeah I think it's not bad for you I never won one of the things that it really shocked me the cops are looking for me so I jumped on a bus in San Francisco in 1985 it I didn't know the bus was going was going to a place called Reno I had never heard of the marina and with those days you could smoke on a bus I met the kids from whatever Egypt and he smoked with me at that time I was never touched a tobacco product never even consider it I thought I'm CUBAN like what cigars are the worst thing in the world for you and I'm a movie smoked a joint with hash weed and tobacco in it huh what year was this 1985 yeah we smoked a joint on a bus I thought my lungs were gonna fucking cave in I wonder tobacco in the hashish cos hash the prom in hashes no matter what you smoked a hash it doubles in your lungs what do you mean it the smoke doubles in your lungs how does it do that do I look like Johnny fucking scientist to you I don't know next time well these smart guys comes on the show that's why I usually smoke ash I take a pen you know of pens that people put job yeah your life fire put on their glass put under glass and you smoke it clean because the double that wheat that strain the hash there was something else would double up in your fucking lungs that's why you call so hard I remember when expands expands expands I remember when I was a super square I never did any drugs never smoked pot never did anything and I went to an agent's room I think we were in Montreal was me and my manager in this agent who was a friend of ours and he had a piece of hash that he lit unlike a thumbtack under glass he blows on it blows on it and he puts the lid on I'm watching him and then he smokes the hash out of it I was like I can't believe I'm seeing this guy do drugs like this is like a scene in Hollywood he's here he's doing drugs he's smoking drugs he says hash you know I thought of hash that fucking movie Midnight Express that's what I thought oh my god you got to go to jail for life you're gonna jerk off my glass like you're gonna have to fight someone and kill him Midnight Express is about smuggling hash from Turkey that's it in my mind hash was a serious fucking drug like this guy was doing heroin are you doing hash you might as well be doing heroin I'm sorry kid he's just doing this in front of me smoking hash in front of people with a glass scares the fuck out it's uh for someone who doesn't do anything like that's a big it's not like hitting a hit of a joint you take a hit of a joint ago okay guy likes to smoke pot I've seen that before you you light a piece of hash and put it on a thumbtack and put it under that glass and you get down there and suck it out of the glass you create drug addict just sniffing exhaust fuel the fuck are you doing man if you know anything about me you know I've seen some weird people do some drugs shit when I was in New York and when I got up early and there's a movie called sugar hell you I shouldn't help sugarhill I remember the Sugar Hill Gang sugar-laden Sugar Hill is a movie that is possibly wesley snipes best movie sure that was when they were the drug dealers drug be yes I remember the Alexander opens up the movie because she plays the mother and she makes them hold the belt and he goes why you gotta make me all the belt mama because you're the oldest hold the belt so I can shoot this goddamn hair or mom is sick that's right this is his best movie by fucking far that was a good movie so I gotta wrap this up let's talk but what are we gonna do that's it how we can open a new year within laying bets nothing nothing about fucking Jon Jones Gusterson if he had a Bennett you didn't give me a breakdown here bet John Jones vs Gustafson yeah I'm stuck on both fights that's all I want to tell people it's that I wouldn't bet me I can't bet either either they're both very good matchups very first cyborg you have to give her an advantage because she's so much bigger and because she just doesn't seem to lose she's just smashing people she's got really really good technique and she's super powerful and she's really big and she's got a lot of success and then Amanda Deena is is without a doubt the hardest hit in bantamweight she's a fucking cool Smasher man she's a gate great camp she's maintained long shoulders long she keeps keep on the end of punches she'll she's gonna test cyborg you know we're gonna find out whether or not she could hurt her and we find out if she can hurt her this could get crazy who the fuck knows because Amanda Nunez can crack if she hurts cyborg it could get crazy but if she can't she hits harder than Holly I think my humble opinion I think Holly is a great kicker and Holly is you know she's really good at movement and she's very durable and Holly managed to go the full distance with cyborg you know there's a hard fight it was a hard fight and she lost that fight the difference between Holly and Amanda noonas I think is like one shot power is better for núñez but you know Holly when you she fought Germaine Gironda me she when she fought Germaine she knocked her down she knocked you down with straight left she hurt her she heard her a couple times she had kicked her she hit her with a questionmark kick and had kicked her and Germaine de random a is really good heavy heavy duty Muay Thai fighter but she didn't want to fight cyborg Holly did how about just the biggest and the best in terms of like her you look at her success ratio you look at with the way she beats girls down she's so powerful man but Amanda is the toughest fighter this is yeah this is this is a fight if you go back to cyborgs fight with gina carano gina carano one point I was on top of her on the ground she didn't sustain it and she lost the fight and cyborg eventually smashed her but there were Gina had her moments in that fight you know and I don't think Gina was ever the one shot cracker that Amanda is however cyborg is way better than she was back then but you know so is Amanda Amanda you know coming off with Raquel Pennington fight you watched that fight she dominated Raquel Pennington and I think Raquel is one of the toughest girls in the division she's a hard woman and she she beats a lot of really good fighters and she she gave Holly Holm all she could handle and got a split decision lost Holly Holm in Holly's debut in the UFC I mean she's fucking good and Amanda Nunez handled her it was very very impressive who's scary like dismantling she's beating her up I was like wow like she's on another level now as a champion she's gotten even better she was always really good she was always really dangerous but as a champion she got even better when she beat Ronda Rousey in 48 seconds that was the big coming-out party like here we are baby she's she's the best bantamweight ever you know in terms of like her or her ability to knock girls out like she's the scariest of all time she's the only one I mean cyborg can't make 135 Amanda Nunez can she's a legit 135 champion you know and she's got it down now - she can go five rounds she can she can beat the fuck out of you for five rounds now it's different I mean interesting fight but listen Merry Christmas Merry Christmas - the JRE family you know I love you motherfuckers Christmas to you my friend for Christmas - my brother was right this week at home I don't think so not this week but we'll see each other soon for sure and uh after New Year all right take everybody much by Merry Christmas my Christmas Happy New Year Happy Hanukkah happy Kwanzaa and Merry everybody [Music]
