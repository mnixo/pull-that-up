speech how many of those you ever had to deal with three oh you get them all the time I had to deal with one recently movies TV shows you get them consoles your beatings oh yeah do it what I even come listen man I'm not a movie producer all you have to do is give us a check and we'll do the rest oh you don't have to do anything you'd have to worry about yes I do I have to worry about it no no you don't have to worry about it no no I do have to worry about if I give you money I'm gonna worry about it get out of here you crazy idea there's a reason why they have banks okay go to the bank if you have a really good idea and you have credit go to the fucking bank if you don't have credit I gotta assume somewhere along the line you've already made some poor fucking choices I don't want to be involved in that people have this everybody has this idea that they they're gonna figure out how to circumvent this time-honored system of Hollywood and we're gonna get to Joe Diaz if I can get to chori as I know Jody has been killing it on the road if he can give me just $2,000 and I could start this film you know Quentin Tarantino this is my my my my my my Kevin Smith made clerks and ran yeah and they just think that all they need is couple grand from Joey Diaz Joey Joey Joey Joey you can't go wrong okay nobody makes movies like me okay Joey they just don't want me in they don't want me and Joey take don't want me and Joey Diaz they want to keep me on the outside no you get him for your time it's not even that you get him for money you get them for your time yeah look at you with your living through you you're busy yeah you swamp there's no more no someone I keep telling people that to get mad at me no yeah they don't understand what you have children there's no schedule I can't count on my schedule bro a 10 20 she wouldn't get off my fucking lap yeah watching one two three videos on YouTube at 10:30 yeah she went to pick her up like let's go it what yeah what were you fucking talking about I'll be back in a couple hours don't you fucking talk you don't have no fucking idea what it is to and I went to get to go into the room at 9:30 to get out of it I was gonna get out of the early that a little bitch open the gate up I heard those stomping and like that there's no argument she just put Sansa alright pick her up gonna put youtube on I gotta sit there with a one two three four or five you know and then she again daddy okay well the problem people asking to do things too is that you kind of do this shit for yourself okay the way to do it is not to go through other people and ask people to pick you up and help you that's not how it works doesn't work that way everybody thinks are going to figure out some fucking joke shortcut because they know you or they know this guy or that guy this there's no shortcuts in creating something just figure it out bitch I love stand up because there's one part of me it doesn't need anybody I'll even open who right here this is my tools for stand-up at a person we're gonna go to Bob's fucking coffee house on North Hollywood and do three minutes you know me I don't never fuck yeah when we talked about having a band that somebody came on here and said that it was the toughest thing in the world for a band to stay together you got four people personalities you know you get these people that come to you now and I was breaking it down for you on the plane they don't say hey Joe are you doing my name is read my script do you like it here we're gonna get eight million dollars and then you go okay when you get it call me I really like the script something you're interested in whatever three days other thing you do get a call in a year later they say hey we're making a movie but guess what we didn't get two million dollars we got two hundred thousand dollars so instead of you getting ten thousand a week and I get a hundred a day and it's gonna be a hit we're gonna make it happen nine other ten they run out of money for marketing and editing and the whole fucking things to your movie ends up in YouTube they don't have a legit schedule so you have to work Saturdays and fucking Sundays you know those people that are involved in those low rent movies they're a fucking nightmare and it's their dream and I get it's your dream but don't include me in this fucking thing because you want me to do everything cheap on my end all the hours and it's your fucking dream if it's that much you're dreaming do me a favor forget the 200 G's we'll get another 300 G's and make this fucking work but not only that you can find other actors out there that will do it for cheap there's people out there that just want to act sort of a comic will go to an open mic night there's certain actors that just want to do something to put it on a real go find them there's a lot of talented people out there that are not working as far as like acting goes there's a lot of fucking people that can do it there's a lot of lovely people it's just the I just have a problem people like asking you to help them do it like I get it from comics all the time to just looking for a break what are you talking about just you're not you're not gonna get a break from another comic the way you get breaks is by going on stage and being funny like go to an open mic night be funny the club will say hey Joey Diaz you're fucking funny we would like you to come here more often the audience really enjoyed you next thing you know some manager says you know what Joey Diaz you're really funny we would like to think about taking you on as a client and that's how it works like a comic coming along is not gonna make you funnier and then the people that do that they always have a distorted perception of how good they are already you know those those kids that are asking for a break the kids that want you to help him hey manage need a break if I could do guess that for you really help me like that's not you don't you don't go to the Doug Stanhope show and ask for a fucking guest all our Doug probably put you up dr. Berger alright 2:15 starting to go up front Doug will push a parking open micro and its first time on stage he'll do that in front of like a crowd in Norway or something but that stand-up you know uh it's not normal yeah you have to do you it's amazing what people you know we weren't like that thank God we knew that this took work and hard we knew that this wasn't going to happen in one night I was old enough already when I started I was longer the truth already that I knew this was just not gonna you know you just didn't walk on stage and things happen and people come here and they call Desperados where they just do don't up to you for a guest saying you're gonna ask him what is this gonna do for you right how's this gonna fuckin change your life it's like I've never been too much of a hanger out I don't believe in that I never believe in that shit you know I believe in doing this spot if I go to the Connie circle I'm doing the fucking spot if I don't go I don't go to the improv my name isn't on that list the Hangout there's no for me there's no no no no because if you come up to Joe Rogan red band or Jamie and go hi Jamie my name is Joey Diaz I'm a fucking account I'm a funny comic Jamie's gonna say are you going up tonight cuz we all want to watch you I love to laugh but you're funny let's go no I'm just here hanging out you hate that fucking funny if you're not on the list you ain't that fucking funny or they don't know about you yet there's a possibility though no no no we're certain people that go to the improv that's it and I'll tell you dog you've got a network what network your network onstage i network onstage yeah when they laugh and I walk off that's networking well not only that when you're a comic you're sort of like a fruit or a vegetable in that you're you're growing and then you get one day you can be ripe and when you're gonna be ripe everyone's going to know about it people find out about you people people found out about everybody they found out about you they found out about Hinchcliffe they find about everybody here about Duncan you know what happened what's happening in China right now what's happening in child always packing them in oh yeah every night he goes I can't believe there's white people and UFC fans in China you're coming from money out yeah okay they're not big rooms they're 120 seed onion Z this is like coffee shops right but we're on the Internet this shit isn't worldwide this is worldwide yeah this is you can't believe it that there's fucking people walking around here going we came to see you from Macau I can't believe it took people for so long to figure it out Ari's a fucking genius he's a great comic it's uh it's just amazing that people have misled they think they shortcut we got here what was the shortcut if you get out of the Tonight Show right that's it how many people have gone on The Tonight Show not great success no one cares a lot of people now it doesn't know but back in the day it meant something big you know Steven Wright days well I could finally do a technical get up a Turkish get up no I technical get up in jujitsu I could finally do it after a year practicing in hotel rooms five a day I would do on my right side for everything I'm a nut dog right you do know I'm retarded half what people know that I'm a little stupid I'm geeky you're not I don't like I don't like being bad at something and since we got the comedy work that ethic I know that you could turn anything in life into something if you just keep showing up yeah if you just you know like for me to Jitsu has been I suck Joe but I can finally do the whole Jim hip escape that fucking I'm a black belt in HIPAA escapes to me today that's what I do I'm a hip escape expert that's what I work on you know uh this game's a huge bro fuck and when you learn how to doing for you six months I know what I was doing and then salami taught me sometimes all just taught me a different I put it all together on my shoulder and now at least I could pick up my ass and push it all the way back for me those are little things you know I wish I was better but I know if I keep going to jujitsu twice a week which is what my body can handle eventually I'll get something on bar eventually cuz I got funny with comedy I was no fucking to slip Magoo in the beginning I just let my girl whatever girl I just kept showing up though you just got to keep showing the fuck up that's half a life that's half a life and who gives a fuck our I'm not looking for a black belt I'm not even looking to go to beat nobody up I'm just looking to go to learn Turkish get up I could do with ten pounds a Turkish getup I'm up to this point where I put my arm down I put my knee up and I just go up to my elbow and I go down I do ten of those bro bop bop bop I don't even go over I've been doing it fate months kettlebells 10 pounds Turkish get a bitch but I'm still doing it right what would happen if I would it took 35 pounds you know me dawg I get that I wouldn't be here right now my shoulders being my fucking halo so but at least I know this going in be crying loudly because of the lesson I got from comedy that it don't matter though just keeps you know yeah yeah but nobody lasts dog keep showing some people you chumps stay home some people just don't want man for some people it's like me that every when we did comedy there was eight people who had a chance there was another six who were funny but they had day jobs because they were married I had children then you had two people who do it as a hobby that be once in a great while they drove to a gig and then you got three people that just had mental health issues yeah okay he's always showed up every week and they were nice enough but you knew there was something wrong there and for them it was the way this is for me with jiu-jitsu I'm not looked for that me they're not looking to be on MBC all they want to do is one time in their life make somebody laugh how special is that it's huge and they go down it and you miss those guys I miss those guys from my scenes and see how even here and then lay there's people that you see them and they're a pleasure to talk to because they don't want an agent they don't want to be on movies they're just having fun they work at Universal City in the daytime as the hope you know it's very few of those who appreciate that I respect that man but there aren't they're very there's very few of those most of those guys have dreams that just never manifested themselves but a lot of them never material I met a lot of guys that bro they were proud of their job they just got somewhere in their life I take it be a stand-up and they just didn't want to die without trying it right and then they did it they become addicted how many people go to jiu-jitsu it becomes addicting yeah Stan definitely becomes addicted and it becomes updates that it becomes addicting and it's like addicts where you see those guys are scrambling outside they can't wait to get on stage and like even guys are bad they'll see a guy who's up there killing like you be up staring like man he's supposed to only be doing 15 minutes motherfuckers or 20 minutes like what do you care what are you gonna do you're gonna go up after Joey Diaz what are you gonna do you're an open mic ER and you're upset like they think somehow another thing I'm on the non-paid regular list but you're not getting up until 2:00 in the morning you know how it works this is what you do you're in a non-paid I was a non-paid regular you get up after everybody else that's what you do if there's anybody fuckin craziest that people should notice you wanna you were on a TV show and you weren't on pay regular which by law if you're on a TV show you're allowed to go in there and bump bitches mm-hmm even the Bell yeah I'm saying well not only that I showed up every night every night I was there every night I have anything this lesson I learned about this whole thing from you it was news radio on Fridays you got there 11:00 in the morning wardrobe stupidity laughter food and then they eight o'clock your shoot you'd be strolling in there 11:30 bro I respect you for that to this day that meant more to me and you didn't need it it's $15 it's not like you had 19 kids you need the 15 fucking dollars but I'll tell you the truth being passed as a paid regular at the college tour meant more to me yeah getting on a TV show me too when I was on a TV show when I was on Newsradio one of the things I love about you coming to visit me is like finally there's another motherfucker doesn't belong here cuz I was I was always wandering around like one day they're gonna tell me to get the fuck off TV but until now somehow or other I'm on TV so Joey would show up I black come here man hey come on let me show you what this is this is where they keep the food please wander around the set Joey would show up at the set and Joey be sitting they had an executive VIP suite and the VIP suite they had shrimp cocktails and delicious hors d'oeuvres and they had it catered a dude who you know had like one of those Mumford & Sons fucking facial hair things with a beautiful tie a thin skinny time he'd be like serving people shit and it would be all these NBC executives and Joey fucking Diaz with a leather jacket would stroll in and feast he'd be sitting there with a fucking paper plate with like 15 shrimps on it oh my God look is that your friend you
