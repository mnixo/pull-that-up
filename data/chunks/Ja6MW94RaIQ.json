the Joe Rogan experience in the Olympic Games the the event that probably requires more transfer of energy and development of kinetic energy than any other there's a bunch you could name but one of them for me is always going to be the javelin throw the javelin throw involves a full-powered sprint I jump a massive explosive turning of both hips and shoulders and a throw all the quintessential explosive elements of the human body involved in the javelin throw probably to a greater degree than any other Olympic event and as a result people can throw a javelin 80 90 meters what would happen if you took those same javelin throwers and made them perform the same event on their knees wouldn't be so good they probably couldn't throw it more than ten meters okay and what's changed the closer they get to the ground the less they can employ explosive force what's the first thing Cowboys do when they go to Brandis theater take it down yeah they lock up its legs they put it down in the ground nobody tries to brain this standing steer you're gonna get killed because it can employ explosive dynamic movement to hurt you you put them on the ground dynamic explosive movement is massively curtailed it takes away the single riskiest element of fighting which is quick dynamic movement that can generate kinetic energy so step number one of his own Jitsu is get it to the ground it's inherently safer less things can go catastrophic ly wrong on the ground and in the standing position what's step number two secure dominant position control control too vague there's many ways to control people it's a definite step you've just taken the guy down with your first thing in Busan you didn't sit well the first thing I would try to do is get to a dominant position what do you mean by that be back I'll just pass to side control you just sounded it right then get past his legs passes why legs are strong I carry you around you could hold a person in position they were very good defensively they dangerous too dangerous okay if I end up inside your legs if your ass killed you disobey you can unlock me can leg lock me can strangle me even if you were an untrained fighter you could up kick me right many a man has been knocked out by a nap kid even a nun shooter guy can form an object lakes are dangerous so step number two is get past those dangerous legs what's that number three go for a submission no he must be a tense planner platform rigid it's it's one of those things like it has to be regulated it has to be protect it and it has to be guaranteed as a thing for all human beings not even just Americans well it's just it's stunning to me how many people are against the idea of having an open Internet it's I just well you know most of the polling I think polls are always you got to be careful right because they can ask a question one way and get an answer but the best one done was right before a vote by the University of Maryland found 83 percent of the public supported net neutrality opposed what we were doing but who are those 17 percent dummies that's what I want to know I think anything you can get the American public to agree to what 83 percent is it pretty I think it's wonderful but I'm stunned there's a 17 percent yeah seriously but isn't there a bunch of people I feel like there's some and I wrote about this on Twitter recently without judgment I said that net neutrality seems to me to be one of those ideological issues where if you are on the right you support it or if you're on the left rather you support it where you're on the right you would like it to go away it's almost like totally disagree with me I think if you are a Democrat or a Republican you benefit from net neutrality and Internet openness if you're conservative or liberal if you're a big business or a small business you benefit from Internet openness and the history of net neutrality is something that doesn't get discussed enough which is that it began the first time the FCC put net neutrality policy on pay / it was 2005 and I'm old enough to remember that that was when President George W Bush was in the White House in other words this country's first net neutrality policies were put on paper when a Republican was running the FCC it is only in recent days we have characterized this as a left-right issue and I think that's a fundamentally a mistake how did it happen like when when Rajat PI proposed this legislation and passed it it baffled me I thought net neutrality was the thing we had all agreed on it was like we're never touching this how did this happen well a whole bunch of boring Washington procedures whereby they circulate out of proposed rulemaking you know but I mean like how did how did he get the power and leverage to pass this I think that he was supported by people in Washington including some broadband providers and was led to believe that with deregulation we would all be better off being away from race car driving when you deciding it just like enough is enough do you think that in some ways that this is you appreciating other aspects of life too that you're you're looking at you're racing thing and you're like you know what I did a lot I did enough and then why don't I just appreciate all the other stuff well I think that's a good question and leading me into a good thought like I think it's actually more me being honest like I think everyone would expect since I do what I do at the level that I do it at that racing is my only thing I care about I love it so much I'll do anything I Drive every day and the truth is no I like racing but I know there's a lot of things I don't really like about it too and I'm grateful for everything it's given me but if you were to ask me what I do outside of racing in my personal life I don't go to the racetrack I don't really watch races I don't I don't do that so those aren't my hobbies like your hobbies are your real loves what do you not like about it well I would say that in the last year so the just though as far as an energetic space it's just so sad and negative at a lot of the time and even and just racing in general most of the time it's miserable like you have some days that are good but most of the time it's not happy and you wish there was you're you you're your own you're not satisfied you wish somebody would have treated you better out there you there's so many things to be negative about and just the grind of it it's the people like everybody's worn out and you know you have to be really careful about the people that are around you because they've got to be in a good mood because it's easy to spiral out of control because you see each other for three four days a week every week for 40 weeks a year so you know you got to be in a good space with people but it still doesn't alienate you completely even if they're you're in a good space with people the ones next to you because you got a car next to you on both sides in the garage and haulers next to each other and buses right next to each other and you see a bunch of other people so you know it's just I don't know there's a lot of negativity to some degree a lot of grind it just kind of feels like the grind a little bit and so I just kind of felt like it wasn't a space that I wanted to be in as much anymore like I I want to be in a happy space where I'm just doing things that are bring me joy and yeah it just it wasn't doing that as much or I was noticing it I was noticing I was missing that or wanting it more I think that's really what it comes from is growing as a person and realizing I think everybody's afraid to take chances and do something new in their life because they're identified a certain way or they'll be judged if they don't do it or judged if they do something different and who are they now and are they crazy and what are they thinking and you know it's just life just do things that make you happy in his case you know his kidneys were in trouble his heart was in trouble and the cells they don't unlike what we used to think in the early days they don't become anything these kind of this kind of stem cell does not come become anything in your body but at Holmes Terry's of that need repair and it secretes things that stimulates the repair and decrease the inflammation and helps out with the immune system so moat the vast majority what we treat our autoimmune diseases and in in huts case we gave him I be so that that he could basically have these things on board secreting the the secreting the cytokines and the growth factors that are normally secreted and when you're 92 and you have multi organ failure you're basically running on fumes and so you put these days zero young healthy cells and they secrete these things that kind of restarts everything yeah and so what was his response to this IV treatment Wow I you know I I could I can wax lyrical about that he's almost a hundred years old and from pretty bad shape it was like bee stings it was like he got a new lease of life like he got a big dose locally in the hip which fixed all his inflammation and pain and he started walking again and his kidneys were good and his heart he had a prolapsed valves in there and they healed and his cognitive powers improved his eyesight improved whoa you know and other stuff improved that I he would hate me to talk about but he had two nurses that reported to me Wow using it as a towel rack [Applause]
