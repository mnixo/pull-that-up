hello freak bitches or doing the same kind of things that a guy like you would do that's what they think oh yeah but that's not the case nothing closer what is the big difference between bodybuilders other builders there's a hyper 'kathy sport they do have high repetitions and they you know they eat different they take other things different to get very big and then we don't want to get big we're just like you we want to state in a smallest weight class we can and get as strong as me here's the saying they gain strong strong strong so we just want to be strong so everything we do is not to build the larger muscles like I work with track people mostly girls we don't want to put 10 pounds extra body weight on that's 10 pounds the extra weight that they have to overcome gravity run down a track right so we keep your body weight to the minimum you know the muscle mass we just want to make it strong you have to get bigger to be stronger that's confusing to a lot of people because a lot of people think of big muscles meaning stronger and that's the only way to get stronger but I've seen some people and powerlifting competitions it just lifts insane amounts of weight and they're not that big trunk well how is that possible muscle type you know you're always talking about you I've always mentioned you a few times you talk about like wooly and C's all muscular he runs out of gas real quick who tyrunt tyrunt Woodleigh yeah yeah he has the same they got a pretty pretty much the same amount of muscle mass he just has very fast twitch muscle mm-hmm and they're got you you got by the indoors may have bored slow twitch muscle and then so that guy that's why he can fight five rounds in Tyrone where it starts were out somewhere in the second round well it's also because the guy like Tyrone is capable of putting out so much energy like the way he can attack guys and move so fast it's like having a 500-horsepower the engine versus having a foreigner horsepower ones gonna just use more gas right well just fashion she got sprinters and you got marathon runners and it look totally different yeah and so when someone looks at a bodybuilder and they see this guy's just covered in muscles they assume that guy will be able to lift a ton of weights and but for the most part those guys can't lift nearly as much weights as a guy like you can no that's that's crazy to people like that doesn't make sense well like a lot of things are crazy people do don't are No yeah okay but what we're making what about this anabolic steroid do you does it frustrate you that this lack of understanding the general public has about this stuff absolutely no you ever you ever look at the Olympics we look at our weight lifters at Olympic weightlifters we don't go the Olympics hope we never do well probably to never get any letters never said the words Andrews ever they said our Olympic weightlifting team it's pretty bad we can't get a guy on the 18 all right and they you know they they're just not very good you look at our women's gymnastics people they're extremely strong they blow it out of the water you go to China their male weight lifters and female are tremendously muscular and they kill everybody but your gyms look pathetic it's because they're all in different systems you know there you've got better coaches and better systems to take stuff so well American doesn't have good Olympic power lifters Olympic weightlifters weight lifters we rule the world power lifters in this country American witnesses are not very good they're not no terrible really yeah I did not know that there was one girl what got a bronzy an epic one girl got a bronze we in and my supporters 12 male weight classes we hold seven of the total records my gym holds two and in women there's 10 weight classes America holds nine of the ten and my gym holds five I have the strongest male power lifter ever lived period and the best and the strongest female it'll vary same gym now what about shit like those strongest men contests oh brother strong ass guys yeah but that's a different thing entirely as well it's another defender right like boxing's different tune in tonight right yeah boy you know more ties different than boxing and you never see how southerners say in a more tie guy just gonna win a World Boxing Championship right and vice versa well I think it has happened um tide was what the fuck is his name-o there was a kid though I mean I got the gold medal and thought to Ireland pakiya and I think you should know York he might have been a one-time champion right Oh Chris he'll GRE yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he was a kickboxing champion yeah work out tonight so so what the fuck is his name so I forget his name but he was the guy that he's the guy that jean-claude Van Damme is always supposed to fight jean-claude Van Damme pretends is gonna have a fight it's gonna have a kickboxing fight with this this Thai guy and that but that guy won World title as a Muay Thai fighter and as a boxer but that's that's pretty rare but I agree with you but now like what would be the difference see like if you see like if you had a guy coming to you that wanted to win like a Strongest Man competition that seems like something that will be right up your alley because you're so good at preparing fighters and understanding the different demands of different sports my friend in Finland named Sakaki he's got four guys in that gym and deadlift over 900 and they're all strong men and he does a lot he trains long strong men all right I'm not the end of that but told Tom and I that one thing in a sprint with thousand-pound world barrels thousand pounds on willpower we did a lot of wheelbarrow work and also to carry heavy yolks that's to the primary thanks you get them to be strong men what's a yoke a yoke think putting it back you walk around with it like if you walk around we do an enormous amount of walking with what bars with bands and change hanging off that's unstable mm-hm right you got to be stable in an unstable environment so they walk a half a mile stuff like I don't that's what it gets us strong is that why you like wheelbarrows because it's almost like a deadlift that you got to kind of walk with and so it like Dorian prides a real good more typewriter Dorian thought that really helped us up his uh plum-colored clinch yeah that makes sense so oh did you come up with the idea of using wheelbarrows for barrel in 1990 it is just something that looked to you like a good unstable platform god it builds up your registry ministry building up your back mm-hm and and grip you know you gotta have a grip right so you know unless you guys got great grips anyhow but it builds up grip and it builds up all your muscles and you're walking see might you know a lot of guys do strengthen condition I believe it's got to be combined you don't have that much time because fighting is a tremendous skill you need all your you mean the world Strongest Man he damned the MMA champion though right oh I believe you got to strengthen condition same time that's why we do so much outside walking we're doing heavy carry not objects walking so we're conditioning and string training
