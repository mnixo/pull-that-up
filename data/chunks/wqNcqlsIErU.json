the Joe Rogan experience so in part there's an empirical question here which I don't know the answer to in Europe they ban in most of they ban hate speech so or you know Holocaust denial there's certain things that are still illegal it's a crime and in America we don't now it's an empirical question meaning it's open to actual investigation does banning it push it underground and let the people feel that they are victims of being silenced things come back stronger or is somewhat the best disinfectant I don't know the answer to that I think in general I think the American system has worked better but I don't know there's scholars who could who could address that as for what is happening to the left is the left more intolerant I agree with you that you would think the left would be more open and in my research on left-right the left is generally higher an openness to experience the idea of descent descent is patriotic these are leftist ideas not not rightist idea so the left should be more open problem is any group that any group that loses variety that loses diversity any group in which everybody thinks the same is at risk of turning it into an ideology of turning to her religion and then you lose the ability to think straight and now if somebody so you know when I was in college yeah you know everybody sort of leaned left but there was they were conservatives there were some conservative professors like I'd been exposed to some conservative ideas but now if you're in a college that has essentially no conservatives that will put out ideas and you encounter one now it's much more painful it's much more shocking again it's like it's like you have a peanut allergy to ideas that are not your groups right and we want so we it's terrible if we're putting young people in systems that are basically giving them ideological peanut allergies but most fighters are hard-headed and and are in a position to be hard-headed right and that's like the hard part is like you tried to tell them listen you need to listen to me right now no I got this and then their careers just it's crazy cuz that's what made them a fighter in the first place right tell tales to fuck up yeah that's it that father beat their ass you left the house near sixteen fucked you I'll show the world girl don't come in hi and I happen to me that's happened to me and next thing I know I'm out there and I'm fucking getting the cage I feel bad for dudes who didn't get dumped I do why that cuz it's good for you yeah taught me a lot man I remember the my girlfriend in high school dumped me I was devastated for months just devastated but then I realize like what the fuck is wrong with me and I thought imagine if I married that girl Oh imagine had kids with her and ooh and every day was just torture her bitching at me and controlling and oh I got light I got off flight well here's one for you to enjoy well same thing happened to me I got dumped in high school yeah the girls started dating another dude I ended up hitting this motherfucker in the head with a wrench Oh Brent yeah I hit this motherfucking the head with a wrench why is him in there with a wrench he pissed me off oh he pissed me he made me so mad did he make you mad cuz he was banging the girl or do you make him out on top of that on top of that yeah so I end up hitting him and then I ended up going to jail and I end up doing 52 weekends in jail damn but within that time every week every weekend I had going on Friday for year come out on Sunday Oh for a year so I couldn't leave I couldn't leave my city so in that time I taught myself how to fight that's why I'm here today Wow yeah and during the weekends uh-huh no so during the week cuz I couldn't leave so I would just I worked and then me and uh Paul Rodriguez he for 22 Susan C 32 yeah I mean him we trained that we taught ourselves out of fight in the backyard watching videotapes Wow Tony D'Souza the originator of the Peruvian necktie yep yep that's what I came from is that really what I came from she's proven no kidding that's what I came from huh yeah yeah that peruvian neckties a motherfucker that's a great that was Tony shit yeah I hope right that one of my systems man I love them he's a hell of a grapple yeah yeah so he ended up choking out a Paul Rodriguez UFC 32 and I was the night I got knocked out Bobby J yeah but it all happened because I got dumped wow that's crazy well it's just one of those things where you when when you look back and you think of all the great things that you did accomplished then you realize that you're retired at 30 yeah so much so much room there you know 30 is so young is it you're in your athletic prime are they I think they say 32 for a professional fighter they consider most athletic problems at 32 it was but you know I look back on and again you know the 42 fights that's a lot of fights yeah plus I started when I was nine I had a little over a hundred amateur fights George there was a lot with that I mean for a while there well before I retired I was throwing it around you know retiring I was one of them guys that just I liked it and I loved it but I also sometimes got tired of it Brian oh I'm a very simple guy and and I don't I don't care about the glam or the fame or any of that I truly don't you know like even now with my my podcast and what I'm doing with some of these other adventures is because I got bored and I'm going to have fun right you know what I mean and keep myself busy and I've been fortunate to have what I have to be able to do all this on my own you know and go out there and be around everybody but yes so when I was fighting you know there's a lot of rumors around of the retirement this that and I think the final icing on a cake was we were supposed to fight Andre Ward and that's when Andre Ward ended up getting a shoulder surgery and that fight fell through and now I've been out in California training or an Oxnard trainer for almost a year which most fighters leave at the beginning of their career you know when they don't have a family when they're not making the money that's their opportunity to try and go make money not when you're 12 years into it you know and so I went out there and that kind of took a little bit from here as far as the sport even though I loved it and it was great training with Robert Garcia I learned so much that I didn't think I could learn at that state point in my career and but not that Andre Ward fight fell through I was done I mean I I have rolled over I never forgot I rolled over told my wife I said I think I'm done and she goes what are you talking about and I said I think I'm retiring and she started crying of tears of joy because she wanted me to be done even before that she don't know the sport or right but what Prime ages are not and I hung them up and you know over the years as we talked earlier hearing her I would get the itch you know and that could have been just going to the gym and doing around on the pads but I just didn't ever wanted to keep doing it you know my health believe it or not is more important than than anything else space is fake no I this is different than the Flat Earth Rose little hashtag space is fake hashtag spaces face is people that are so fucking stupid the flat earthers kicked him out oh my god for real flat earthers kicked out the spacious fake people spaces fake is their the the most skeptical so what would be the upper atmosphere would be the edge it's all bullshit it's all fake it's the and it's tied in some weird way to religion which is really interesting because even the Flat Earth people there's a tremendous amount of them that are extremely religious and they talk about the firmament and the Bible Bowl in the Bible and that this is this is what's really going on is that they're trying to keep us from the knowledge that God has created this place is a very special place right and so by pretending that it's round they somehow or another are controlling us we're thinking that we're not exceptional we're not lucky space is fake they're using a video from Ryan Gosling's movie he just made about in the Armstrongs there's a man in the moon yeah be like this is look look here's proof take everything they're making a movie because literally the way they made the movie is that's evidence that it's fake because he's wearing it I don't know if maybe this person doesn't recognize that as being Ryan Gosling right there mmm got a NASA suit on maybe it's just a troll account this is how NASA makes everything this is the video I was talking about guys now you know it's all a big actor has to click on spaces fake though I'm on the whole yeah but I can click on it because there's a bunch of I'm on that thread there's a tremendous amount of people that literally believe that space is not real I think it's like that with alligators in Florida - yeah when I was a kid they were an endangered species they would ask us to please not feed them marshmallows because I lived in Gainesville right by this place called Lake Alice yeah lake outside alligators I was fucking 11 years old I was crazy yeah there's a goddamn dinosaur but there was a small population of them because they had been whacked into oblivion before and people making suitcases out of them and then they made it illegal to hunt them and they made it my protected species but then they fucked up they overprotected yeah those goddamn super lizards are everywhere and they're fucking everywhere my mom belongs to a golf course down in Florida where she lives and there's this alligators apparently like this fucking 14-foot alligator and the people were playing golf and there was a deer and everybody's on that everybody's standing there going like fucking alligator comes out grabs it pulls it into the water does that spin move takes it to the bottom fucking done so everyone's talking about it what do we do about it so about three weeks later my mom is out on the course and her ball is right next to the lake where the alligator is and she forgets and she goes over and her ball is right on the edge and she's standing there and she was standing on some fucking like dead some dead grass and it gave out and she fell in the fucking Lake up to her neck and then she remembered and she fucking started scrambling up the mud and grabbing at the reeds to get out of there and enter and the people that she was with had left who she was playing by herself for some reason and she fucking got out of there and got in the cart and and then she just started laughing oh my god my little mother my little five-foot-two mother oh my god would have been a tasty meal it happened so quick yeah better than a dear old lady nice soft old lady way way more tender yeah corn-fed my mom's corn-fed I never told you that no yeah I thought she was organic now now we let her free-range though sometimes [Applause]
