ready five four three two one Larry sharp how are you sir I am doing great thanks for having me before we get started I like you oh that's good I like you a lot I like putting a right-hand man I'm just telling you right now upfront I've been listening to a lot of you interviews watching a lot of your interviews you make sense you know it's almost like you know you can't win so you're talking so logically it's you might win yeah yeah the whole is the people who actually have given up who think it's so stupid they don't bother voting right so the hope is I say something that makes sense and I go oh maybe I should vote oh my god maybe I should vote if those people vote you win I win yeah there's an untapped resource of unmotivated people who are too fucked but how do we fix that is it it is it a matter of getting people I believe firmly that if we could get people to register and vote online especially with their phones it changes the world yes I really really really believe that and I think that this is also a concern of the people that are in the Democratic Party and the Republican parties I think they want that hundred percent look they have they were a lot they're relying on voter apathy they're a rely also relying on people who are committed to their parties and who are politically active yes which is not the majority of the people it's the establishment right and look you asked how we fix this Bernie and Trump actually told us this in 2016 they told us two things number one if you can get people to an event you can get them to the polling station number one that's what they did a lot of events I do over 30 events every month I'm always doing events getting people to show up because if I can get my show up to my event I can get into a polling booth right because to come to hear me speak you have a lot of choices out there you could be on netflix you can hang with your family and friends you could be playing a video game you choose to come hear me speak you'll come to the polling station that's number one but how do I get into care in the first place it's hope the average person who votes often right if you vote often you use the book because of fear the two-party system installs fear right I don't really care about my guy or gal but I'm so afraid of the other guy I'll go out and support my guy or gal even don't even know his name I just know I don't like the red team so boy blue or like the blue team so I vote red but to get someone who doesn't vote in New York it's really bad news State about 70% of New Yorkers don't vote it's a huge chunk over seven million New Yorkers have any % yes 70% yeah last election thing was 67% so it helped us around 70 to get those people out you have to give them hope Bernie gave the left hope Trump gave the right hope if the Democratic Party wasn't so broken as a party Bernie would have been their nominee it would have been hope against hope it was home against establishment hope one that's how it works I'm hope the other two guys who were running in my in my election the totally establishment well you say some really logical things one of the things that you said that nobody wants to touch you you were talking about gun violence game you were talking about these mass shootings yeah and he said there's two things that they have in common one of them they don't have relationships they're not they don't have girlfriends they don't have boyfriends well it's almost always girl a guy does it usually they don't and boys tend to be more violent in a tent males tend to people that madami being sexist but I'm just doing stats that's just statistically males tend to outwardly strike women tend to inwardly strike because the general physically and this exception is obviously the only other the other factor is psychotropic drugs yep and these are two things that no one wants to talk about correct and they're both real and they're both facts and why is it that you think that these are there they're obvious facts that people want to ignore because you they don't actually want to fix the problem right if you fix the problem and you don't have controversy if you know of controversy you don't have a left versus right paradigm do you have to have that's what it is yes that first up they don't want to touch the car did they don't want to fix the problem if you want to fix the problem of school shootings right it's two things remember as I'm as you've heard me say before the school shooting while it is a murder at its core it's actually a public suicide and people to understand that at its core most mass shootings are public suicides they would understand that shows like death by cop right and it's it's public suicide so you have to make sure you have happier people right but then wanted a school why do they choose schools several reasons one because that's where they're assumed enemies are right the in cells think that the guys the bad guys and the bad girls were there but something else there's soft targets the other thing you remember from all these school shootings is they're planned and that's a critical aspect you want to stop school shooting in New York State you don't have to pass one extra law at all have do one minor thing and one thing only and that is say if you are a licensed if your license and you have a permit to carry a firearm if you want to in school you may if you are a teacher or administrator if you want to you may that's it you'd have to force a teacher to carry you don't need a resource officer why because if you have a resource officer which is what most Republicans will say put an officer there they'll just shoot him first if you are Democrats no guns they'll shoot everybody so if you instead say well I don't know who's armed is it an administrator as the teachers everybody's at nobody the planning goes away once there's no planning available the school is no longer a soft target they stop choosing the school okay limb back let son practice so you're saying that if you have an officer on the school that carries a gun and this person knows that officer has a gun they will shoot him first correct and that if just teachers are carrying guns there's no way this person knows and so they're less likely to shoot people they're less there's two things if you here's the core of it what's killing our children it's not firearms the the one of the I think was a Texas shooting I think it was before he stole the guns he had put together and set up pipe bombs and pressure cooker bombs in case he couldn't steal the guns so if he couldn't get guns he was going to kill people anyway the the the key thing here is what's killing these kids lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that's what's killing our kids those three things take those three things away kids don't do that you give a kid who's 16 17 18 purpose he can't go off and kill people who has something to do he's a reason to live remember this is a public suicide if you have a reason to live and you think the right answer is to go do something you don't kill yourself if you don't kill yourself there's no public suicide mass shootings all of a sudden not tremendously reduced it's just how it works it's human nature you've to understand that but if you do that then there's no extra law then there's no one to point a finger at you can't restrict guns I'm saying this makes actual sense this is where you and I great company because I don't agree with that I don't think that anyone is trying to keep these school shootings in the same state there are now I think that there's two things one no one wants to demonized psychotropic drugs and especially politicians they have a really hard time with that sure because they don't want to tell people who are on psychotropic drugs that there are either suspects or suspicious or potential mass shootings in New York State it's incorrect we made this a fact and this a fact literally says if you go on these drugs you lose your firearm so that's absolutely not true in New York State it may be true in California I don't know your laws here but in New York State the opposite is true we've we've already done that we have made our medical personnel part of our secret State Police which means if you go in and say you know I'm feeling depressed I need some drugs I'm thinking about suicide the state police might come by and take your firearms that's already happening in New York State and they now want to create red flag laws which means a teacher can now do it so now a teacher says oh there's a student who I see drew a fire on me drew a gun cops and robbers may be a red flag let me go to a judge and see if I can have the cops go and take his father's fire I definitely want to talk about this but I want to bring it back to what you said earlier you don't think they want to fix the problem yet you don't think that's true I just don't think they have a viable solution that they think is politically viable perhaps but I think my solution seems cloaca viable people I say everyone I say this to you they go oh wow you're right well you are definitely right that they're lonely sad people that are lashing out I think you're definitely right that in many instances it's a public suicide yep and I think you're definitely right that the vast majority of them are on psychotropic drugs yeah which do have a disassociative aspect to them where they're not even sure they're aware of what they're doing this is if you talk to those people that have been on these things things don't mean anything and like a car accident in front of them doesn't mean anything people have various reactions to various SSRIs and antidepressants but one thing that happens is you lose the highs and lows and everything is just flat you become numb yes and you become numb to almost anything it happens absolutely again it varies depending upon the individual that's on these things sure part of that would allow someone to do something horrific which they wouldn't be able to before well there's two things remember here one I'm not concerned with being righteous I'm concerned with happy New Yorkers and happy people that's what I want righteousness is very low on my priority of things so that doesn't sound if what I'm saying sounds bad I'm okay I want to fix the problem the second thing is another politician which means I don't have I don't have a career or how to protect I don't have interests I have to serve the average donor is $75 so I don't have a bunch of people who are any huge checks so don't have that concern either so maybe in four years I'll be corrupted and you can beat no I don't think you're corrupt I mean I'm not saying that at all well I mean they're corrupt I mean I'm sure many of them are sure what I think that they just there's things they don't feel like they can discuss politically and I think one of those things is in any way demonizing people are on antidepressants because a lot of these along giant percentage of people absolutely our our opioid crisis is is heavily based upon the idea that when you have pain of any type physical mental the answer is not dealing with that pain but the answer is a once-a-day pill right yes that is the answer for all of our pain and because of that you have a lot of people who are on drugs and you partner a stat about 80% of all the people who are currently heroin addicts somehow started on someone's that even know was theirs but someone's prescription legal legal drug I mean that was prescribed for the pain medication or something like that usually pain medication yeah but other things too you're totally correct this is a problem but what I'm saying is this right I talk about often people say Larry you know why should I vote for you why should I support you here's reason why whether you believe I can win or not is actually irrelevant if you think I can win awesome I can win and to be four with you if I win in New York as a libertarian the entire nation changes overnight and that's not exaggeration the entire nation changes overnight this is the most impactful election hands down the entire nation 2018 Wow cause it's New York that's not New Mexico Larry Johnson one yes if I would New York State was ranked 50th by Cato when it comes to freedom it is we have the most people leaving over a hundred thousand people leaving every single year more than any other state we also on top of we aranged the least friendly to retirees all of a sudden Larry sharp libertarian becomes governor I mean it's insane that the advantages is a five-way race in a 5-way race 30% could win this is actually winnable race how is it a five-way race it's gonna be his majesty who our current king he will run there'll be a Republican said homo yes correct there'll be a republic on this majesty cuz he thinks he's a king any is a king that's the reason when I'm in front of Malcolm your grace but you I met him one time in 2014 oh yes yes he was yes he was he was he was very dismissive yes he was I was I was actually with the Libertarian candidate then in 2014 hmm so yes he was dismissive so His Majesty will run there'll be a Republican sacrificial lamb placeholder who knows he'll come in second probably third to me because New York has basically always been a left-wing state not always no the last 16 years the last 16 years in New York State same thing happens in a statewide election blue team comes in first red team comes in second nothing changes nothing change that's been the last 16 years but prior to that Republicans did win it did happen but in since then what is she running us she won't be running in about a week or so no she won't finish yes you'd be really yeah how do you know let me let me give you the five people then I'll cover her all right those two then Stephanie miner will run she's a an independent who runs out of our Syracuse they'll be a Green Party communist to run Howie Hawkins communist yes and if you total communist yeah he wouldn't be unhappy if I called him that really oh yeah he's he's he's he would not his head yeah probably close yeah Wow he'd be okay with that so him and then myself so five people running okay right with five people running New York State's a plurality state so 30% in theory could actually win this thing with people who know who I am I already poll at twenty five percent this is about the Quinnipiac poll on gravis marketing poll both polls I pulled about 25 percent with people who know you know who I am my problem is name recognition right and if more people get to know who I am then that number of obviously will be going higher and how much time do we have here two months hmm here's the reality I get two million dollars I win because all million dollars is all Turks because I just need to give an Amen I already have infrastructure I already had the message I'm an email which takes what it takes his advertisements on local news news on local stations get my name out that happens I win exaggerations how important the debates are important if I if I don't get that money I'll have two debates I have to do it Jesse Ventura right Jesse Ventura in Minnesota when he had a debate he won he'd handily won in debates and that really gave him the became in the election that will give me the election people were a big fan of that movie predator that yes he didn't have time to bleed that's exactly right yes those are slack-jawed faggots for those who are old enough to remember that movie yes Jesse didn't have time to bleed yeah so yes so that's that's what I'm saying with that we make that happen we can actually win and change everything because all I need is my name to get out but you asked about Cynthia Nixon Cynthia Nixon made an error Cynthia Nixon is not a politician and doesn't know politics and she thought that her celebrity would get her past the Democratic machine which is run by by Cuomo in our state so she ran his Democrat Stephanie miner is also Democrat but she chose not to run Democrat because she knew that if she ran is that Cuomo will crush her as Cuomo's crushing Nixon how is he crushing Nixon yeah in the Democratic convention if you are able to get 5% of the vote from delegates you get to speak on stage Cuomo controlled those delegates with an iron fist so much he made sure Cynthia Nixon did not even get 5 percent she couldn't even get on the stage to speak it would be clear Cynthia Nixon is a popular actor who lives in New York City there is no way there weren't enough people who would have if they wanted to hear us speak could would have voted five percent of course he made sure they didn't happen she had to submit 65,000 signatures to get on the actual ballot so she could be in the primary there is no way that he allows her to win she doesn't win he debated her and because he thought let me just show people that that I don't care I can just dismiss her and that's why he debated her and he's going to win and she's going to lose she when she loses I don't think she's gonna stay in I doubt she will if she does better for me because of a six-way race but I doubt she will she might drop out in some way shape or form my odds are she'll run for Congress or something like that in the working they're working families party to do something like that the working families party yes that's another party to the party near state yes how New York State runs New York State has a a fusion state which means you can run as multiple parties if you want to you can have three or four or five lines if you want to so what often happens is the big two parties they use it as a way to have issue-based voters so they literally create parties mm-hmm so they're create a party that says I'm the Working Families Party and people go oh well it's that Democrat I'm a working family and they'll click that and it's the same guy Cuomo beyond four or five lines happens often the Republicans on three lines and the Democrat I think will be on probably four lines it's a very complicated process now is there any effort made or there any discussion whatsoever about potentially moving voting to online is that something that you would not be ever not New York State right now no I'm unsure not sure of it I love the concept completely I do the only thing I don't know is it over the technology behind it I don't know how safe it is don't know but what about banking if you can bank online where all your money go no I love the idea I miss I don't want to commit without knowing the technology if we New York State is a problem because New York State throws out everything that is new we've thrown out blockchain we don't want to do any open source we threw out hemp and marijuana we're we're trying to tour the vaping industry I mean anything that's new in New York State we try to get rid of we hit with a step we're beating up ooh BRR now or taxing uber to pay for the MTA because the corruption by established bodies that are 100% yeah New York State likes old money we're really happy with old money we do not like new money at all which is another reason why the youth is leaving we had the hardest time getting the UFC into New York because of yes and absolutely I had to wait until that one politician was arrested was that one guy that went to jail New York State there's so many at you yeah yeah forget it was but he was corrupt yes he was one of the main reasons that was they were trying to make an illegal absolutely it's new which means by default hit of a stick that's how New York thinks it's new hit of a stick don't like it it's new we want old stuff we're on Oak for a place called New York yes it's which is why my slogan is a new New York that's the reason why my slogan is that because we are right now an old New York and it's not helping at all now our spart is with the old New York speaking of the people who are older people are retiring they can't stay in New York State because it's to expand to expenses they pack up and go to North Allina South Carolina Florida is it taxes Real Estate's both of its taxes and it's an opportunity it's both of those two things right so so so they decide to head on down to North Carolina South Carolina Florida Tennessee they actually have a name for us in the Carolinas they call us half backs we went to Florida and halfway back it's true they closed half backs that's how many New Yorkers go there what is the worst part go to Florida go uh this is a mistake well the sad part here is though Florida actually has more people than we have and half of our budget and the Scott actually the governor Scott actually thanked Cuomo for sending all the people down there because 15 percent of New York State's budget is actually pensions and so many people who are pensions are actually leaving New York State and going someplace else so New York State people are paying for the pensions and then they're being spent in other states it's a terrible idea we the state is broken it is so broken and people are talking about if you're democrat it's saying everything's still great if you're public you're saying well tweak this or tweak that I'm saying rebuild from scratch there are things you have to change you have to change the route so you can make the branches actually die we keep clipping branches the weeds that keep growing now we got way off track with this school shooting thing and I wanted to get back to it because I think it's a very complex issue and I don't know what the answer would be I think there is no one it sound right I think you've found problems these problems that you're willing to discuss it very few people are yeah are these people are lonely and sad that it's public suicide and that they're on psychotropic drugs absolutely hey I don't know why you don't think that other people want to fix it I just don't think that they have a solution that they can discuss that is not so controversial that it overwhelms the rest of their messages what could be done sure I have a couple of answers okay the the issue is this is an issue that's been going on literally for decades so there is no do this and it's done right right there are several things one of them is fixing education the other one is fixing family courts start slow well sure how do you fix education absolutely it is a complete reboot right now but the first thing you men do for education is you want to make sure there is no standardized testing until high school none whatsoever so nice testing is bad for several reasons number one it's an unfair way of grading teachers right teachers are now graded by how their students do in a standardized test which is silly that doesn't mean you're a good or bad teacher next it makes a bunch of kids who are 10 11 12 13 years old feel stupid because they're not good test takers and you create now a secondary class of student for absolutely no reason because the next reason is standardized testing is no indication of success in life you could be a great test taker at 12 or 13 or a terrible test taker and it does not mean you'll be successful or not successful in life last is how New York State often will decide how to fund schools so it's a way of funding schools that's also unfair there's no advantage to standardized testing except it means the federal government now begins to control our schools more so when you say the standardized testing hasn't there's an effect on funding does that mean that if a school does really well they get more money yep often it's part of a very complex algorithm that New York State has that almost no one can actually find that seems like it should almost be the opposite but if a school does poorly that they should put more resources into that school because it's not being effective in theory that's true I'm not sure that's I could either win we throw about twenty-two thousand dollars per student per year New York State more even in California and doesn't work we have mediocre results at best dollars isn't the answers it's revamping the system right funding is not the answer so how do you revamp the system yeah there's more parts than that first one was discovering that the second thing is we shouldn't even have K through 12 K through 12 is an anachronism it should exist because the last two years she became through ten the last two years of high school for a huge chunk of people Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed just nothing but bad for too many students just sitting around doing nothing they have no purpose they have no community they have they have no no reason to do anything they're unhappy right another reason why they're unhappy it's not but gross generalization that they're unhappy no only thing on it's probably a lot of kids listening to this there are sixteen and seventeen they're working their ass off and I have a solution for their future and I have a solution for them that's even better I have a solution again your limits moving okay right first thing is how do I know what I just said is true right you just asked that question return I'll tell you why what I just said y know is true because for the vast majority students going to college now the first year of college is 13th grade cuz they're not ready for school because the last two years didn't prepare them for a college if it did we wouldn't require 13th grade I don't know a 13th grade the adverse student now takes six years to graduate college so the results show me that I'm correct right and the results of what's happening and here's the worst part now we ship these kids off to college too many of them don't want to go to college so we sent them anyway takes them six years to graduate the 24 years old with at least 50 K in debt if not more minimum decay some 100 K some 200 K depending what it is and now there's no job for what they want to do and now they're working at Starbucks Wow what a disaster that is we wonder why our kids coming back home so how about this instead at tenth grade take a test you pass test you get diploma with you a home school private school public school diplomas yours awesome now you have five choices and this is exactly to your point you have five choices choice number one you're a kid who's hardcore you think that college is your answer good go to two-year prep school imagine that kid who right now you just had his busting his ass he could be in as in a prep school of his choice and and the people in that prep school are all kids who want to be in that prep school it would change his entire situation no more knuckleheads who don't want to be there who are forced to be there who are cut in class the kids would be there are those who want to be there the teachers and responded no disciplinary issues there were kids who want to be there better for them they could hustle better now they're ready for college when they get there they take advantage of incubators of internships maybe even graduate in three years now they're rock and roll in less debt better off life is good better services better everything for less money I'm not done you're not that kid you're the kid who's super smart you even become a scientist you want to be get a PhD awesome go right to an associate's degree start run away 16 17 18 get into your degree because you're that good take your SATs you're that smart you're Einstein awesome go do that not you know what any of those things no worries go to eight school become a plumber or carpenter Mason whatever the crazy me go do it New York State desperately needs tradesmen desperately the average trades person in New York states about 50 years old too old for an average should be 30-something for an average 35 min before an average it's too high which means we have a lot of trades jobs that are not and a lot of foreign labor has to come through New York State right New York kids aren't doing it why we've been told a lie and that lie is the only way to success the only way is to do well in high school get a great four-year degree and go get a job and sit behind a computer all day that's a lie that is a way to success it is not the only way to success there are a lot of kids now I'm sure you know people like this who they spent the first five 10 years of their life trying to make it that way struggling through school then at 28 years old they go it's gonna build houses man then they gonna build a house oh that's gonna make this it's gonna be a computer guy they just make apps he's gonna do something when I do they should've been doing that at 18 well I'm not most people though they don't know what they want to do this is a big part I don't have a passion they don't have a direction and they're confused yes I this is one of my biggest complaints I got about this plan right because other two ideas are cuz go get a job right just go work or start a business mmm and what you just said it's work it all the time but Larry there's 16 that are doing good make your mistake at 16 not 26 mm-hmm we're making mistakes at 26 we have people who are lost at 26 we have a generation now if you ask the people in their twenties right now across this across this nation you say do you feel like an adult over half will say no over half you're saying now 40 year olds also not as much but yes but not as much look it'd probably be over half it won't be over half okay you go to you 20-somethings over half will say no I don't feel like an adult right because they're making the same mistakes that many people made 18 19 16 they're not making it 25 26 28 there's also not a rites of passage something that actually happens this would actually be that they'd have to make that choice at 16 but here's the issue how do I pay for and this covers the entire issue no but you're talking about that's next question I get how you pay for it New York State says I have to pay for full 12 years of school have to pay for it stay Nets pay for it no worries I was a Marine when I got a Marine Corps I got a GI Bill exiled I think was $100,000 I forgot what it was back then this is in the 90s I think a hundred thousand dollars like 10 years to use it we're gonna give all of our kids $20,000 and five years to use it they don't get the physical check but the state will pay a check to whatever school they're gonna go to for $20,000 they have five years to use it what does that mean you can at 16 experimenting you can say you know what I know colleges for me I'm gonna go to prep school here's what I promise you I promise you this I'll bet any minor money you want promise you this as soon as this comes into play you will find tons of all of a sudden prep schools and trades goes to pop up and guess how much it's gonna cost for two years twenty thousand dollars that's gonna be a tuition you might say well while air it's a lot of money it isn't we're paying forty-four thousand dollars now for each of those kids we're saving twenty four thousand dollars per kid and giving them better schooling more accurate actual choices they can learn something they make their mistakes at sixteen seventeen which is way better than 26 or 27 and maybe I figure what they want to do well why is it so cheap why are you going to be able to do that for twenty thousand dollars when it costs so much more now what's going to be different people gonna be choosing right yes but the people that are educating these people yeah how are they gonna get paid all of the money gonna come from great question now a couple things remember teachers ask me all the time they say Larry how are you gonna help us here's what I tell you I'm gonna get rid of a bunch of your administrators in New York State we actually have school districts that have more administrators than teachers why yes that's correct do you own home what's the value of having administrators because you have two check boxes for government you could check boxes for coming did you do X did you do why did you do see these emissions required that's what's going on that's correct there's there's about sixty billion dollars in our budget New York State for education give or take about four billion comes from the federal government about thirty five billion comes from a state about twenty billion comes locally give or take these are a round numbers and they change your lead payment on on who you talk to but it's about that once we get rid the federal government being involved in in the in New York State four billion dollars goes away go get afraid oh my god we lose that money good good let go away because all the ministers go away also if you can give her a three four five six ministers for every one or two teachers oh my god I'm not good you know educator but I would imagine that if I was I would be upset at this I would say that there's a reason why those administrators are there and we need them to take some of the administrative weight off of the teachers the teachers are stressed out enough by teaching students they don't have the time to be taking care of all the formalities and the things that these administrators um I have never heard that ever because that's not true you are the first person that ever said to me ever in over a year of me doing this so every seizure when those administer with you no no no not every teacher I said I never heard it you never heard it I'm not talking to a lot of lots of them dozens of them okay does what administrator awesome because it's not in those words but yes because most ministers are actually administering teachers that teach tell them how to teach what to teach one to teach grading that payment if they don't who will the parents will the parents will yes you think the parents have the time or the understanding of what an education should comprise of to be able to direct not just their their student what their child needs but you know a group of 50 or however long that's a great question and generally speaking probably not but teachers do teachers do yes they're gonna self police there'll be something ministry there's your your assuming that I'm gonna get rid of all administrators no like that I'm not saying I'm saying but you're definitely saying you went to schools I'll hold on you went to school mmm-hmm do you remember how many vice principals there were any of your schools you remember no don't probably two or three that was normal in most schools when I was in school often it was two or three I don't remember now there's 12 12 10 why why is that because the administrators and they're making sure other things they're making sure boxes are checked so here's your alternative the alternative is keep funding a broken system mmm and be afraid which is what you're saying no I'm not saying you're saying teachers will be afraid because over eight yeah because they don't free who educate our kids no no if we don't overwhelm okay yeah fear of being overwhelmed just not just that but also like having a mandate like having yep a very strict I'm with you curriculum yes and that is nothing but a bad thing I'm gonna give you real fast if you don't mind him I give you a list of all the time centralized control has worked ok I'm finished centralized control doesn't work in education what in anything when a centralized control make things better to find centralized control strict mandate from Albany a strict mandate from DC well I'll ask you a question I'm assuming you're old enough that you were in school at one point at nineteen eighty or older yes oh oh yeah before I was yes prior to 1980 basically the partner of Education didn't really exist as it does now it did exist but it was basically as a repository for information it didn't really do anything when I did any power since that nad began to have power do this and we'll give you money don't do this we don't give you money here are your rules follow them or we punish you that that's what they are now you learn to read and write you learn to function in society so did I somehow every American prior 1981 to school learn how to read and write learn how to function in society somehow it worked do I trust the administrator or a teacher I would rather trust a teacher now does that mean it'd be no ministers of course there will be a mission of course there will be there will be still principles and things of that sort of course but the difference is an administrator cares about checking a box check a box your students aren't better off because boxes are checked you said what's a better off because the students are getting better and because the parents are happier right but when you're saying box is being exact that means things being covered that they feel yes isn't it for a standardized test yes you said that they feel significant is correct yes well that's someone I mean I would I don't know how the curriculums are set up but I would imagine that people get together and they decide that children need to have a certain amount of ability yep with grammar yes an amount of understanding of mathematics yes I agree so who's gonna do that how about teachers and the local administrators and how about the local PTA which were also less administrators yes and an elimination of administrator I never said that so I didn't say you did but how we decide how many administrators are necessary and how many can you cut out how much money you save this is and this is even better you know that you're gonna love my libertarian ways on this one okay right now what happens is there is a convoluted way of deciding house what a convoluted way if I had come loaded you here the it could be but no I don't think it is a new word and I don't think it should be used is that is that new no not convoluted the other one yeah okay this is I'm sure there's a fetish there somewhere I'm sure there is I just haven't heard me there see you you're ready to go now so there's a calm little way of imaginary of funding these schools I don't want that I want to be very simple I want a flat fee to come from the state mm-hmm here district depending on how many kids you have here's your money what does that mean well the reality of it is there are about if I'm not mistaking about 700 school districts in New York State a lot a lot that's a lot it is a lot and so what happens now is there's your money most of them are gonna make no changes because they're gonna be afraid but it's like anything else they'll be an early adopters and really adopters are going to say wait a minute so the federal government isn't telling us do this the state government isn't telling us do that so we can change some things here so when you say here's your money they're going to get less money than they're getting now it depends well it depends on the school district some will some won't there it's not like you'll have less jobs there they're gonna have to decide whether or not the administrators you got it exactly right yes and you're saying oh my god that's scary some of our school districts will fail yes but in New York State they're all failing now so I don't care but the administration in mass right now I'm okay I don't want government to be what you always hear which is the elections have consequences mm-hmm so I win I now get to impose my will upon all of you because I won so what I say goes I'm supposed to know everything be everything create boards and make things happen I instead want to be the guy who when you have trouble I can help so as school districts begin to have trouble I will without question try to help them of course I wrote but there's 700 correct how would you have time to do that I won't Percy I'll have people who would ever write now there's there's already an infrastructure to handle that already I don't have to create a new one already exists but right now it's just it's making up reasons to punish people I don't want it to make up reasons to punish people I want instead to say okay this school district is lost how do we help I only have one string attached to the money I give only one and that is transparency as I told you before I'm a business guy and here's what I know this is an actual equation that works every single time very simple simple equation personal freedom plus transparency plus accountability equals innovation if we do that the early adopters will come on they find great ways of making things work they will get rid of some administrators they will get rid of some teachers they will hire new ones they will decide which one should be given raises that will happen okay with you there please go ahead because what you're saying may work in the world of business because people have incentive to succeed in business not extensive is monetary success we're not always monetary but yes okay not always but for the most part yep sure when you're talking about a school yeah and you cut the funding for the school and say hey figure it out you guys decide how many administrators you want to keep aren't the administrators essentially the bosses aren't they the ones who are in control I mean they're not gonna get rid of their own jobs so what are they gonna do you're gonna pay the teachers less so they're gonna get inferior teachers and it's a great question ramp up their their control of the of the cash flow because they realize that there's less of it it is oh it's a great question and here's the issue it's not gonna happen overnight it's not like I win in November and go great all the money is gone - how it works I wouldn't November people know what the plan is we start talking about it already we start bringing parents on board we said coming with plans already the plans it's like it's like it's like any other organization you're saying business something it's works in military this works in this works in business this matter works in everything what's your family it doesn't matter if you knew that six months from now you were gonna have a significant decrease in your income you wouldn't start to make change - cliff there was someone above you saying hey Joe you're gonna have a decrease in your income mm-hmm how do we make this work what can we do if someone's there to guide you and you already have enough structure there you'll begin to fix it my fear would be that they would have less teachers there was a larger classes totally positive administrators because they're in control people don't like to give up control but the Minotaur's control well who have seeing control was the PTA right The Parent Association can you second have a lot to eat - borz the school boards would decide but they would have to agree with you yes they want to get rid of administrators and they didn't universally if they didn't universally across the board then this fails miserably and then classes get larger and then kids get less attention yep and then the already piss-poor education system sinks further into the abyss and we have two choices we can be afraid of that and stay a hostage to a terrible system that's not working and filling our kids and making us unhappiness joy in a state that's option one or option to do that and just watch over it right understanding that that could happen just remember the only two options yes fund it move from the bad system boo know why okay if you had a teen what's what's wrong with the system let's go over that just told you I don't know but no but I mean in terms of like how much money are they making right and what would increasing that amount of money enhance okay two things remember the first thing is there's no way in the world that a governor should be deciding what every teacher makes in a state okay that's just philosophically wrong so I'm never gonna do that that is simply philosophically wrong it's against Who I am centralized centralized control is a bad idea localized control is always a better idea for so that's so that premise I'm never gonna even touch that what I'm trying to achieve here is to make change I know that locally there will be people who do it right because that always happens that's just how it works you will see out of several districts some of it decide to you know get together and and mix this church together some will decide not to some will do different things you'll see it happen my point is this is a major overhaul I get it right businesses do it all the time families do all the time if you are able to watch it I don't want to be the mother or the father right Democrats won't be your mother they want to give you everything pup doesn't be your father and protect from everything don't be your brother let me - got you love you don't to live with him but you love him and when you need it ride to the airport is there for you I'll be the firefighter the guy who comes to help when you need me now you're saying but Larry school this will fail yes that's what I'm saying well okay some might fail that's you're saying some I'm not even saying they might fail what I'm saying is that you're gonna put them in a compromised situation yes you're gonna give them less money and you're gonna say figure it out yes but not just see you're assuming that is just here's money good luck no there's less money yes money and I think you have too many administrators yep and let's talk this out over a series of several months when you talk to Professor yes educators do they agree that they have too many administrators teachers you always do yes so far every teacher I've met they everyone but they agree they do well with less money if they didn't have the ministerís yes and how much less money are you talking about I'm not sure to be fought with you not sure yet there's some unsure but you feel like the way to fix the education system is to cut funding that would like from people like me who are on the outside you hear that and you go oh I already feel like teachers are underappreciated and probably because of that unmotivated because you decided to say the answer is cut funding it's not what I saw no no no no this is what you're saying yep regardless of what you're saying yep what I'm saying is currently yep even in California forget about New York yep I feel like teachers are underappreciated I would agree and I feel like it's a noble profession that's incredibly valuable and the people should be able to make a decent living agreed I don't know how the solution to that is to give less money to the school you're missing a very value if you ask most teachers whether unappreciated most of them they're not gonna say that people like you and I don't appreciate them they're gonna say the system doesn't appreciate me that's what they're always fighting the system Oklahoma they fought the system they're always fighting the system what I'm saying is fix the system the system is heavily controlled in many cases by the federal government four billion dollars worth so we have to lose four billion dollars unless we unless you want to keep the federal government in our system but I don't want that your fix is to let them figure it out get the federal government's but hold on let them figure it out with less money I have to have to push back here okay you you keep saying let them figure it out I said I'm just gonna walk away and say oh well good luck I hope I'm gonna go off and now you know hang out in Puerto Rico for a while no I'm saying I'm gonna facilitate it because you know what I do I trust teachers more than I trust administrators I trust the local people that if I give them the right tools they'll do the right thing but more importantly they'll show others as also transparent what's gonna happen is they're gonna figure out the right way to deal with teachers should should school district one hire more Spanish teachers versus gonna stick to I don't know I'm not so host:2 know that but they do and if they make a mistake then they'll fix it whenever vanities yes you are you talking about the teachers themselves or are you talking about these administrators who you want to eliminate talking about the school board's school the school boards are gonna be the ones with it with the PTA with if we make this work the right way it will be everyone talking together it will be school boards talking to administrators Tomah teachers talk with parents I don't want schools graded be by standardized tests we've been doing that for years and we have very very unhappy people unhappy students unhappy parents I want parents to be happier how my students to be happier and you might say but then Larry they won't learn certain things is that a horrible thing I'd rather than be happy then learn AP chemistry yes if that means one school just decides that ap chemistry isn't that important in a school district it's fine those kids will learn it in the prep school and some kids won't learn ap chemistry if that makes your school to check happy I'm okay with that because goes to the next level which of course becomes kids with special needs you have a special needs kid how do you make that kid happy how do you decide with our kids successful or not the standardized testing doesn't work what do you do these are doing check boxes does that work of course that's why you literally have hundreds of peak of parents every single year suing New York State because they were happy with their kids getting services but not getting better I want your kid getting better you're assuming that because the federal government puts these standards in it that makes them good or bad it doesn't if anything it makes them worse if I just mean if my kids are happy that's what I want happy New Yorkers means they stay in New York happy New Yorkers means they've grow their businesses in New York families in the I get that but saying happy and saying that solution and the key to happiness is funding them less and getting rid of administered by God Joe I'm a Democrat yes you are you are so a Democrat how am i Democrat the world's ending less funding means the world's ending lot of people they hear that you're gonna take money away from school the person who only hears that if the person says all he's gonna do is get rid of money from schools that's that person is never gonna vote for me that person's probably Democrat that problems person's gonna vote for Cuomo and that's fine I'm not gonna win everybody I can't win everybody but I'm going to change the system that is completely broken if you say this what you're talking about people talk about the MTA also in New York City the MTA you gotta keep fronting the MTA I'm not gonna be hostage to a ship system period I don't care I'm not gonna be hostage to a shit system this is a terrible system that is failing New Yorkers that is failing people in New York City when it comes to the MTA that is know what that is that's mass transit I'm sorry yes it does you are not in New York it's a bad system I'm not gonna be a hostage because of fear no I will fight my jailer period and my jailer is a system that is broken that says if you if you you better give me more money otherwise this will happen you better give me more money otherwise this will happen no no I'm gonna fix that system I'm gonna help facilitate fixing that system I'm just gonna let them go away I'm not saying that what I'm saying is I'm gonna help facilitate that system and to do that we're gonna lose four billion dollars and we'll get over that we'll fix that we'll make it happen we'll make it work so bye and if you get more people into this state and there's a most important piece you can raise money through other ways and just raising taxes on people and this is the most critical piece when we hear funding and this is why I'm I was teasing you and call your Democrat because we need to about funding you talk about more taxes I'm not talking about that if you get more people to stay in New York State you raise your revenue without having to raise taxes on anybody but if you raise your revenue you're gonna put more revenue into the schools of course there be more people in schools my rep yes absolutely money in the school there'll be more people in the schools that more tax of course we would if we could rid of course we would of course New York State has a hundred and seventy billion dollar budget with about a forbidden our deficit and 300 billion dollars in debt and the answer for every Democratic Republican is more funding there's gonna be nothing left this state's gonna go to front it's gonna go it's gonna it's gonna go under in ten years how do you get more people to come to the state all right first thing about having a really super cool case is my talked about super cool education that'll get people to come back are you gonna hire someone to create this super cool education system we're gonna let these teachers figure it out on their own if we teachers build me a super cool education system so that we get more fun I already have the I already have the infrastructure for the supercool system I just told you I've already told you what that what the instructor is then the concept already skeleton is already there okay now once I win in November we begin to build it out and yes it'll be me and other people be clear it's not like New York doesn't have enough New York stairs have enough workers we have tons of workers that we can absolutely use to make this happen tons of them now if I'm not mistaken the New York State has the most by percentage government employees are thinking I think in the nation I know be the most unionized but I think we're the most government employees about percentage you're gonna move their jobs sure love it yes let's do that love the idea you're asking details that are simple to fix when a time comes and simple to fix so you're gonna take people out of what professions and move them into fixing do you think I actually have decided for every person New York State where they're gonna do I don't know that's why I'm a course not you this is a you're doing it like a show now I'm not doing a show do you you're a Democrat look at you you're Democrats crap not I'm giving I'm just asking you real clean questions here you four times said you're gonna take money away for as you are right yes you've said like four times right because you kept going on about these other things which is what matters more than losing four billion dollars from education right but I just want to be clear about what you're saying about what the I'm going to fix this system by creating a good skeleton off the bat that people are going to enjoy and like mm-hmm and then once I went in November we're gonna fill that skeleton up to make an amazing school system that people can be proud of they're gonna want to bring their people they're gonna come back from North Carolina they'll come back from Tennessee they're gonna move from from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts I'm gonna be part of this system they're gonna see schools I've actually work well they're gonna see prep schools get kids into college they're gonna see colleges that actually educate kids and get them into jobs when they see that happen they're all start coming that's going to happen it doesn't happen by me saying how do i fund this doesn't happen by me saying being afraid of making a step you don't have to have the perfect plan to move forward no plan is perfect anyway you want a good solid plan with motivated people if you have motivated people to take up a plan it'll wind up being successful again it's how it works so this grandiose plan is yeah thank you I like you're gonna get rid of in the last two years of high school and you're gonna offer potential prep school for children and you're going to for other kids offer them trade school schools sure you're gonna get rid of four billion dollars in federal funding you're gonna let the school's figure out how many administrators they should have with help with help with help and what's to help who are you gonna hire to oversee this whole thing we'll figure out you figure that out yeah look I'm two months from the election away from the election and then at least six months representation at least if that Mets that's probably low but mark nine put any time this is this come into play until next September right at earliest right the earliest Kingdom to play is next September I hope is that fast that be amazing hope it is that fast but isn't five minutes like up I'm not doing this so I can become a king weary have a king and that's why we're in trouble right I want to give localized control many more options i I'm I'm the crazy guy who actually means what he says when I say let teachers teach I actually mean that most will say it and then they and their response then becomes give more administrators so you think what's stopping them now a standardized tests and administrators and then funding that's based on the success of the the tests and that's correct in the school district it's correct the answer is always more funding the answer is always more funding and it isn't it is not that people always say we have to fund fund fund that is not the answer there there are better answers out there of course there are might mean done let me go to the to another piece on how to raise money okay the first thing is of course as I mentioned get more people if more people show up to the state New York State could in theory and this is theory easily hold 30 million people in state this state could it's possible how many down the city seven is about eight and a half in a city this it right now but didn't have to see right now whoa that's a lot it is a lot it's the largest city in the country by far it's it's over double Los Angeles close that is about what three and a half not mistaken well sort of la there's no end to it yes well think about at the metro area of New York state of New York City's at 16 million metro area 16 million the actual city itself st. half so it's it's by far the largest city in the in the nation so yes so it could in theory take 30 million people it's possible if we get that amount of people oh my god the the tax revenue will be insane right you get people to move to New York State by having a better state and one of the things I mentioned was education but there are several other things you can do first off why aren't we supporting small businesses and we don't notice that we punish them right we punish them but with licensing we punish them in New York State there's actually a license to braid hair there's a license to walk a dog there's all kind of license you have to get a license to walk her dog correct yes so that's involved in that I don't know I'm not a dog walker no no there should be none here here's my rule of Licensing I got a nice good general rule would you ask your friend to do it if you were a a woman who had lots of long hair would you ask your friend to braid your hair you probably would want you probably yep you probably would if you had a dog and if you have a dog but assuming you have a dog door would you ask your friend to walk your dog sure sure of course you would why is there a license for that would you ask your friend to remove your appendix well I think the idea would be that you wouldn't want someone screw it up so you'd want to make some sure someone has insurance so that the consumer doesn't get ripped off yes but the appendix thing you would unless someone oh yeah you license for that I'm fine right get a license for that but your points a valid one how about instead there's a difference between licensing and what you just said which is insurance it's difference Licensing says the government decides if you can or can't do it and if you don't the government will find you and or jail you that's a license so you don't have to have hair braiding insurance or dog-walker insurance you might what have insurance I didn't say that I said license there is a difference right the assumption is and you've made it by make that step you made the assumption which is licensing is for safety it is not it is full control it salts for example I'll give you as vaping in New York State many counties have them a license for vaping so what is it lice isn't a license to sell yes to sell that vaping store yes that a baby except of a license they have a vaping store similar to that of having a tobacco store similar right right they do that so you might say well vaping unlicensed it's great for safety right well does the person who has done the vaping sheath or maybe I don't know learn CPR or under the effects of nicotine on the body know they have to write a check and fill out a form that's it there's no safety involved the license be approved for license that's correct they can't be a felon with a history of fraud I'm not sure if that's even the case in that in the made me I don't think that's true I think maybe that's not true in certain cases there are that's true and certain but this one is tobacco controlled substance it is so I would assume that they do have to have a license based on not being a felon for tobacco brand so my vaping babies are doing is a because that no it's not it's not no not at all it's not that girl right some is somes not now so the vaping is basically a is though isn't that a controlled substance no no no nicotine I don't think it is I don't think it is hmm tobacco is I know that's hilarious if tobacco itself is then the active ingredient isn't the the point of all of this is why is any of it controlled and why is vaping controlled hmm if you're talking about safety and it's let me go to safety I'm glad you brought this up all right safety everyone will tell me what it will tell me well licensing is for safety regulations are for safety they're not they're not they're not and I'll give the best example I can give you health food stores the healthiest people you know shop at health food stores there is almost what is a health food store it's a store like a store where you might go and buy vitamins that are not that's that's not GNC or store where you might go and purchase organic things that's not a regular whole food not a hopeless hopeless is similar but the mom-and-pop health food store which generally speaking is usually privately owned usually there's an almost thing from the past there's a health food store yeah yeah I said it because most people understand what I mean when I say that but if you didn't I apologize but most people do understand when I say helpful I mean basically a local store that was some things like vitamins and it will sell things like supplements right no it'll be it's like Aegean Sea it's often often it's a mix of like a GNC and grocery store usually owned by an individual but not always our family in that kind of store those stores are are almost not regulated at all I mean probably 90% of their products have no FDA approval right because of there's no FDA approved for supplements correct so they're vitamins it's a stamp that says not approved by FDA right most their products are most of their their their their products are just out there where are all the deaths from health food stores there aren't what health food stores have our standards lots of standards tons of standards now some people buy certain products because they believe in them some people buy certain process because they believe in the brand name up to that some you go to certain stores they trust those stores it's fine it happens all the time it says it's a standard what would happen if say there was a health food store or even a GNC or any place like that there was a supplement that if you took that supplement and most people took it will get addicted and do crazy things and that came out to the news look here it is if you take XYZ product you'll probably go crazy or do something not so whatever that happen they've removed them yes like that's correct fuel goes away yes that's exactly my point to kill you thank you it goes away there's actually repercussions and it goes away right and maybe there's a lawsuit maybe not but it goes away what if it's FDA approved nothing happens 80% of all of our addicts if they approve drugs nothing happens when it's a government monopoly run by a government regulatory body there's no percussions it just keeps killing us well that's real pharmaceutical and yes yeah absolutely it just keeps killing us on and on and on and on if you want things to be safe then let's focus on safety not focus on control so I want products to be safe not controlled control this useless so how do you then say they're safe I'll use a helpful store examples for example how about competing standards sarens that are competing I don't have a problem with the government saying these are the standards we believe are the appropriate standards to be safe they should do that absolutely a practice of choice take the stamp or not the only exception is why they punishing you if you choose not to it's not with government stamps not at all but it has to be something that is voluntary it's correct the person who owns the store and by the consumer now how do what my example I gave is in this water I would probably has it yes it does has that circle you mmm the circle you do you know what that means no it's the Orthodox Union right I'm in live in New York City it's a very high Jewish population York City had many Jewish friends and the Orthodox Union means it's a kosher product Oh so the waters coach this waters kosher yes how does it become kosher the night a blessing dares eh I don't know this circle you want you know so if if you're Jewish and you care about keeping a kosher household you would buy this product because you trust the circle you is this kosher I don't know but the person who buys it believes it and buys it and what if they found out this water was not kosher then there'd be a problem they'd be and they'd be uh some kind of backlash well as a person who is a partner in a supplement company and also someone who works for the UFC who has the UFC has giant issues with people taking tainted supplements or there's a third-party independent verification third yes independent testing absolutely really good supplement companies like on it and many others use where you can find out that you don't have tainted supplements absolutely I'd rather have that then how about we have those stamps on products are like that yes I have the stamps and if you have a government set have that and guess what maybe you want four cents maybe with the government stamp plus third-party stamp plus the origin stamp well what I liked was the consumer cuz I business yes he does third-party independent company absolutely has their own personal standards and you know when they're a really good company you can rely upon them yes and if you don't you have competing standards multiple companies because you trust one company more than the other or you want both is a possible solution for education a third party independence a little verification look at the education system we've been here for what about an hour or so and you already gave a good idea yes exactly my point that seems like a good idea to me there we go yeah that there should be some effective school system that works and then you take the people that run that effective school system and they have a curriculum and a way of doing things that they could perhaps you know teach other other school systems that's the idea of transparency and accountability that's the whole point so this is the deal with people that are libertarian right the idea is that you are free-market person and you believe in the free market and you believe in less government I believe in the consumer right I believe in the consumer is a general rule when things are consumer driven and this is not her present role look government isn't always wrong it's often wrong but not always and the consumer isn't always right but often right so as a general rule consumers tend to drive things better like as I said kosher water like supplements if you don't allow the consumer to decide you by default stifle innovation you just stifle innovation you stifle everything new because if it can't get through the FDA then it can't it almost can't be done and you control that's very difficult to get past you got it exactly right are not really motivated to improve or they know into the opposite they're actually incentivized to make sure nothing goes wrong so always err on the side of no no it becomes the rule of no one meaning everything is about no there's no one's job to make it work this is my point on the education system the job there has to be at someone who's who says we have to make this thing work I'm the guy who says that I wanna make it work let's make this thing work let's just not make sure things go bad let's make sure that things actually work now you obviously know far more about New York politics than I do I know very little about it but one thing that I do know is it's almost universally regarded as being insanely corrupt true you get to a position where you become the governor yeah how do you clean up that fucking hornets yes the one thing people always say is Larry you gotta clean it up like you just said it's funny you you say I think I hear a little time you gotta get these guys in jail you got to punish them whatever I rarely talk about that and the reason is okay you put some guy in jail you punish them whatever case may be great whose family came back from North Carolina whose kick about education who got a better job whose taxes went down who's happier whose business didn't go under no one's helped by people going to jail we feel righteous and then we pack up and move to North Carolina I mean this is not the right answer we are alone it's beautiful it is the problem it is you go there it's all green it is people it's great or not have a little twang to the way they talk bar it's pretty fucking good trying to make sure a bunch of New Yorkers don't go there ruin it say I understand understand New York keep New York I want to keep them all in New York so my point being I've got my point now I don't know your point corruption in jail the goal is not to just put people in jail the goal is make a better system right well I really even interested in putting them in jail what I'm interested in is figuring out a way to stop question several things the first thing first of you can't stop corruption you can absolutely lessen it and you can catch it fast that you can do you can make less corruption and catch it fast then you remember is the average person who is about to do something which may or may not be unethical or maybe corrupt isn't thinking I wonder if I'll get five years or ten years just thinking will I get caught mm-hmm it's all the thinking about will I get caught and will my career be over right so several things the more one I want less opportunity for someone to be caught what does that mean in New York State less money coming from Albany which is our capital less money the less money the governor has to give out the less chance that they'll be corruption that's number one but on top of that New York State is filled with boards and committees and authorities and things that the governor creates to make other things happen will create this authority to make this happen and this commission to make that happen and then he appoints all of his cronies all of his buddies onto these onto these commissions and boards and such now he now is one step away but he has raised over $800,000 for his campaign for people he's put on boards so he gets lots of money for these people rewards him uh putting him on boards and then they become corrupt if you've noticed New York politics many people been indicted arrested convicted almost every one of them is either on a board or a commission or Authority trashing those is a huge part of getting a corruption any what we happen to state we have regional economic development corporations these are basically where the government decides where the money goes to develop areas yes the government decides were to develop areas you mean you do whatever Raston any time gentleman yes yes well we're gonna put money into whether it can be infrastructure building a hospital putting a new downtown in all these types of things sorry who would decide then how about local the local people yes absolutely why not okay the government you have it be the local local and local s not something else how about just like bankers who want to invest in things businessmen who think this is a good idea how about the local woman who thinks this is a great place for an open um whole new business how about the guy or gal who thinks this is a great place for a new school as opposed to what it is now which is we all the petition to the government I'm not joking and we think we should the government then agrees blesses it gives us nificant of need and then says here's government money to build this thing that it's completely the wrong answer right but there's got to be some regulation like you don't really want a nightclub opening up right next to us here we go there's got to be some regulation gene there should be yeah of course did I at what point did I say to show everything well I'm not saying you never said that but I'm asking you if there should be some regulation based up your system I'm arguing non-structural not I based upon safety not control safety if it's based upon safety I'm in right control we'll be right next to a strip club is that safety right is it yeah I would think so then I'm okay with it I'm not sure I really I don't know about that but if that's safety I'm okay let's say for those kids then there we go some of those girls today that then I'm fine with that and I don't have a problem if it's based upon safety but by who so just because just because I decide I don't like this thing here right if someone stability other ability if the community doesn't want it there as a general rule the communities to support it what's the main argument against libertarian philosophy when you fear fear fear fear of change fear fear of not having big brother in control remember something in New York in New York in America in general as a general rule in America the government does not just take our rights as a general rule we eat early vote them away because we're afraid I'm afraid take my rights I'm afraid take my rights that's what usually happens fear is a problem which is why as you've said will there be no regulation there are a lot of libertarians who probably heard that one yeah Larry say no regulation I'm not going to and his reason why if I decide to pull the rug out from people they will be afraid people who are afraid make bad decisions all the time the word that I need to use more here maybe it's not landing me this is my error for not making this land better its facilitate I want to facilitate better options I'm going to facilitate better answers I'm not just gonna go to the school simisage take away the money go away that would create fear and bad decisions what would you do instead I would say in X number of months the federal government regulations and the federal government dollars are going to go away which means by this time we're not gonna have it which means not only do you not have the money but also you don't have these restrictions mm-hmm how can we fix this system to it so you don't do this anymore what can you make to be better stronger faster how can we do this now let's talk this thing out some people will fight me of course some people will not make a change of course but some will go oh my God thank you so much yes I would much rather not spend the money here but I rather spend it here okay try that let's do that and before no others will follow and then others will follow and that might take a year or two it might take three years but what will happen will have a much better effective system home when one fails but hopefully I'm done yet because it hasn't been done before okay it's been done in everything I'll give you the best example I can give you with education with I'll give it to myself I can give you okay Google Google Google yes Google had a program and I think they still have it I'm sure someone will let me know if they don't but I believe they do to where you had an employee could choose to take 20 percent of their their work time and do it on any project they wanted to any project whatever they want to do is you work on if they want to do is voluntary you didn't have to just do your regular workload if you wanted to but if you wanted to take 20 percent and work on anything you want whatever you think appropriate the only rule was you have to be transparent and you're accountable to your team what you did again in freedom plus transparency plus credibility right okay that was it many of the people who did things mind up doing things that didn't really work very well but when they did it they said hey Joe I went and tried this thing it didn't work you might try to - you learned something for good things out made it better but a bunch of them most profitable things profitable applications came from this now what actually one of happening also is some people that 20% some people worked even more let's get more work out of some people they have more innovation out of people because they've been doing something wanted to do now did everyone take it no some people just did their own work and what happened with don't work that their salary moved on but what happened is you got innovation and other people learn from it and it became better and better and better that happens all the time all the time that is a very different system than talking about the education system when you're talking about Google you're talking about people that are hired to make money for a mega corporation that makes billions and billions of dollars yeah and you give them a chance because they're engineers and techies and you give them a chance to innovate yeah they innovate but their financial incentive is massive I mean I've the financial incentive had a friend who's a big executive a cool they make a shitload of money absolutely the people that work underneath them have the potential to move up that corporate ladder show none of this financial incentive business school systems that's not only that you're limiting their amount of money you're not just offering them the possibility to exchange creative ideas you're saying we're gonna give you less money and we're gonna have the administrators who are still going to be in the position of power you're gonna have that everyone's gonna have to figure this out all right this is not this is not a parallel situation absolutely is let me show you why this the first thing is the people who get into teaching they don't get in because my god I'll make millions of dollars they don't do that they get into it because they think it's a viable career path for them they have a skill at it if they enjoy doing it yes you want to make it difference all those things yes that's correct if you if you if if everyone's lucky that's what they do it for well the same thing with Google right does everyone go there cuz I'm gonna make tons of money no a lot of them sure and a lot of two years ago there because they were make a difference yes so the incentive I don't think anybody's going to Google because they want to make it different than no teachers teachers yes while they're but somehow some giant business how many one of the best businesses in the world and the New York's in New York state schools the system is a 60 billion odd business still a bunch of money it's not profitable that's for sure same thing I think the same thing by any stretch of the imagination it's certainly not profitable for the individuals that are involved in this innovation that you seek and I think you are wrong in many ways how am I wrong that it's not profitable for the individuals that you're asked you or assuming because we lose four billion dollars your assumption is that means teachers don't get more money that's your assumption she's gonna get more money if you're giving them less money I'm not giving teachers less money you're giving the school last month that's correct it's the district the teachers not going to get less sure schools get more less money well what if you got rid of I don't know a bunch of administrators what if you got word that you would have to who would decide that these administrators they remove don't know I've got it say this you never said anything clear that's why I'm asking you over and over and over again it's not clear okay you're saying it's gonna work itself out yes we're gonna facilitate it but then you're comparing this Google when you're giving people who are making a fantastic salary yep the ability to innovate for 20 percent of their time sure I don't I don't think these are valid comparison humans are humans we want to have purpose we want to do better at whatever we're doing we want to have accolades from those you respect that's what humans want ok greed no matter what humans want that right if you're a teacher you want accolades from those you respect you want to be good at what you do you also want to be able to feed your family you also want to be able to make a living so when most of them make piss-poor money all right this isn't Oklahoma it's New York State right so most of them are doing well enough to not starve it that's true how am I'm sure how my teacher makes it didn't you just get done saying how expensive is to live in New York it is expensive yes outrageous it's outrageous absolutely we're moving out in droves it's true and then there's gonna be less money for people that already get paid less than they should I'm not saying that's true you're saying that's true but there's gonna be less money that goes to this goes to a school district yes so how is that not going to translate into less money that goes to the teachers unless I will use write again how no no you've never said it tell me what you want to say no one has decided how this is going to somehow know the benefit the teachers yes you've not firing these administrators you're making everybody figured out on their own the mistress will wind up being fired they will by who by what the PTA I'm sorry ta PR the school boards they will begin to you it's gonna happen we're gonna facilitate the way out it's gonna happen you know if you if you want me to say there are 700 school districts and I'm gonna fire that guy that guy that guy that guy that guy and I'm literally two months out from the election and then at least nine months menteng it you're simply asking too much of me she's asking too much of me the skeleton is built the idea is good it will work will we fill it of course we will absolutely how am I gonna which guy to fire and I'm I'm a year out from doing this you should ask too much of me it's an unfair question so in for questioning which particular human being to fire I'm asking you how you're going to facilitate paying less money to these school districts and somehow another having them organize the right way to make the school system run smoother and more efficiently while you're comparing it to people who work at a multibillion-dollar tech company yes well you're allowing engineers who get paid substantial amounts of money to innovate for 20% of their time and I'm just saying that is this is not a valid comparison and I'm saying you're incorrect because they're both human humans want to be good at what they want to be the reality of it is as I said earlier a lot of school districts won't do much different at all but there will always be other adopters that happens in everything there will always be early adopters and some people will jump in and go this is a wonderful idea let's start working on this now and some will some solutions will do absolutely Riis gonna fail who cares let's change nothing of course and probably most will do absolutely nothing once I'm elected nothing but a bunch of us say oh my god what an awesome thing this is and they'll begin making change right away and as they do we'll start watching oh what are you what are you proposing what's the right way that sounds great what do you think what do you think as I said I'm a business guy when I go in I've been an officer in a public company for a short reason I'm twice and in both cases when I went in I didn't go on going they you you you you that's TV show stuff so how it works how it works is you walk in you talk to people you begin to figure out what's going on you try new things until the right thing works that's how you fix a business if you and if you know no one who does it they'll tell you that's how you do you don't walk and go I know everything so how it works well let me let me come at you from a position of fear please let's pretend that I'm a parent and I'm hearing this plan yeah and I'm thinking this is not a plan you're eliminating money what if my school system doesn't figure out a way to innovate what if they cut funding what if the kids classes get bigger yeah what if there's just just a mass panic throughout the organization because you've essentially gutted their infrastructure Wow I got it their infrastructure I really hope they don't believe that but they might you're right right I mean that would be if I was your opponent that's absolutely what I would argue sure and I guess you could argue that if you wanted to here's my response okay keep the same system keep paying your same taxes keep your kids unhappy sue the state and you can pack up and move to South Carolina this time is in North Carolina or Tennessee instead of North Carolina Florida now move if you want to that is an option for you if I was your opponent I would say that is a ridiculous proposition so you're saying either we keep the current system or we adopt your system these are the only two options we either leave or we take your option and nope I would say why don't you throw more money at these teachers give them more incentive to succeed figure out a way to take money away from something else and applied to education because we believe that it is the least appreciated thing that is the most important because we've been doing that for 20 years and failing that's why yes they've been paying teachers more no no but they've been throwing more money at the system with 420 in regard to hiring administrators yes they've been throwing might we've been doing it for 20 years it hasn't worked yet when you gonna stop that's my response we've been doing it for 20 years at least throwing we spend more money per kid than California does and we have worse results if you're happy with that system awesome vote Cuomo you'll get it you'll keep it no worries but if you actually want change if you're unhappy with the system you got to change it and this is my system with people all the time I did what I'm doing right now I think the same thing yeah but I haven't even prepared and finding all these problems with it yes you haven't given me one Pramod oh I haven't given you any problem what have you heard me say not one you just said I'm afraid of my framer afraid know something what I said that's what I heard that's Ivan said I'm afraid I never said that once you said but what if but what if but what if but what what in questions it's not saying which says I'm afraid of him I'm afraid that's what I hear but what if is asking you to define how your system is going to succeed it's not saying I'm afraid that's hyperbole didn't you just say from it maybe out maybe I didn't hear you correctly but didn't you just say but what if this bad thing happens what if it's my school district what no what I did they just said as I had an exercise where I played a parent who was scared I didn't say that's me and I'm telling you as a person who's not debating you I'm just asking you questions about this please I'm curious yeah but I see massive flaws in the logic behind allowing these systems to figure out how to eliminate administrators in order to stay alive with less money I'll try it again I'm facilitating this to make it happen I'm going to oversee it of course there's already administrators in at Albany who can help to facilitate these I understand those repeated ad nauseam I'm curious about it but it seems very loosely defined and it's I would agree with you I don't think it's confusing at all loosely defined it's true it's a skeleton and it's a good skeleton well it's confusing young the fact that you have these administrators and they're in this position where you're going to eliminate some of them but you don't know how many or which way or how to do that and you can allow the PTA and the teachers unions to figure this out or not the teachers used to be part of it you of course look you need to be part of it pts be part of it school board's be part of it of course Albany's and Ministry has to be part of it of course it you can't you can't do a long-term solution for any problem by just dictating what is right and what is wrong I agree with David Luba more worried about the short-term consequences yes the ones they're gonna vote for you or not vote for probably not vote for me yeah my assumptions not vote for me right yeah I'm with you I think most most people who are afraid of that who think the way you presenting to me most of my not gonna vote for me but you've got to play devil's advocate with yourself when you're going over these of course and is what I know for sure there are a bunch of people who are not gonna vote for me I'm okay with that I'm still right it's the right answer whether I win lose or draw everything I'm saying is true and right and there is no better alternative in New York State period no other every other person who's running is saying we have to fund more fun more fun more that's not going to work that I'm sure of and anyone who knows the system also knows that it is impossible that funding more is going to work that's correct why is it because you're changing the system itself you still just have a bunch of teachers being told your goal is high test scores in standardized testing that's your goal that's how you're funded that's how you're judged that's how you decide if you're going to stay a teacher or not that's everything that's the current system and there's no opposition to that other than you that is correct yes so everyone else wants big people that are doing the best to get more money the people that do school systems no no no they judge them by standardized testing right but they're doing the best no they're not doing the best whoever's getting the best scores thank you those are the ones that are getting the most months the people that are doing the best yes they're not doing the best that's course this bastard well they mean something you take a test so mean it means something it means you better at the test in the past or the best tests correct yeah but but but test taking standard standardized test taking is no indication of success what is a good indication of success emotional intelligence but you can't measure that emotional intelligence yes but that's not gonna work for some for schools right but if you're teaching kids how do you how do you judge whether or not you're doing a good job you know other than tests how would you judge as an example how do you judge things when they're hard to judge and I bring this up well in my business often right when you can't when it things aren't when it's not easy to find a win right if I don't know what a win is how do I figure out what a win is mm-hmm sometimes can be challenging right if you're uh if you on a subject company you might judge it on sales which is a lot easier but you might not you might you might judge on something like you know I'm how many of your competitors how many of your customers are professional athletes you might judge you know something like that you could find another way of judging it if you felt appropriate depending upon what you thought was a win more valuable they said make it happen in schools you could judge it by simply how many parents are happy and you could judge them by uh how many show up you could judge them by having an actual rating system similar to how Google rates things or Yelp rates things there's many ways you could judge getting system to how well the kids are doing you couldn't Theory show it's another option of course but how would you be able to figure it out like you spell this out for me well I don't what's your question you're saying a rating system for kids you graduate you could be parents judge the school could be the teachers do a 360 on themselves right many business beador 360 I don't know few don't that means I'm sorry no I don't say business thing sometimes what will happen is in a business how you judge an individual HD was call 360 and people who all around that person would judge them usually anonymously so person maybe has seven juniors seven peers and three or four seniors they'll pick a couple of juniors a couple of peers and a couple of seniors who will then grade this person let's call 360 and now that person gets created every six months or every year or what depending upon the company every quarter and now you know how the person is doing because everyone around them is judging him or her so the teachers are judging each other they could do that too sure you're asking me for a specific plan could be I think these are all viable places what I'm saying is a viable alternative to testing to find out how well children are doing it could be a situation right how about graduation rate I like that too graduation rate could work right way by what standard they're graduating if they're not taking tests and I said I think in tests they're not taking standardized tests not take standardized that's what I said so taking some tests of course so you're judging them by these tests it's correct and let me standardize that is correct that's why it's a difference between the tests that you would judge them on and standardized tests your standardized test is usually given by federal or state authorities it's usually written someplace out State it's usually decided based upon the company that bids the right bid and it doesn't necessarily decide what's important to the local kids or to the parents so what would be the difference and the test each of these kids teachers were have their own tests so there would be no standard that the state would enforce they would all be up to the community sure love the idea I love the idea let the school districts create their own tests and the odds are they'll wind up copying each other most the time anyway it's finally we'll see what works the issue is you're assuming that a standardized test has value I don't I don't assume in standardized tests I'm sorry I'm just asking you what would the alternative to a standardized test be is is it is a district-wide test district one yeah what's wrong with that standardized for the district I'll take that sure much better why would that be better than for the state because each each school district is different because each because each county in New York State is different each reality is different they're just physically socially they're just they're different regions so they should have different standards sure in terms of how they graduate I think what an a is and what's a pass how you get through school and with that would it be even across the board I mean would you be like it would be better would you have schools that would be worse and they would all have the same grades look if you wanted to I think you could easy create a system to where at the end of the day meaning at the end at the end meaning 16 in this case where I'm from K through 10 at a K through 10 where there is one statewide standardized test which is where I said no standardized testing until high school mmm-hmm right so prior to high school I don't want standardized testing at high school I'm fine with it at that point the kids a bit more mature the kids kind of know where they're going this a nice test will have more value for them in that regard because they'll know wait a minute I'm doing Sarah nice testing because I'm thinking do I want to go to college do I want to prep school do I want to trade school okay so you're also a with standardized testing in high school that's what I said okay so that's 14 is 16 basically just two years it's correct yes in those areas I'm totally happy with that because that point the kids are deciding where they want to go and being a good test taker in those years I might make you think you know what maybe I'm good for Sciences maybe I'm good for math maybe I should be a plumber maybe I should be a truck driver maybe actually be a insert thing here right maybe to a teacher so I'm totally happy in high school so I said until high school doing it in the youth doesn't do anything except make things bad so once we get to the high school level yeah there's standardized testing at that point but I'm saying before that but before that is when the kids are building up who they are right before that's when the kids are building up who they are as as students as who they think they are in their life are you familiar with other types of teaching like Waldorf or you know some of the other alternative forms of Education and have you ever looked at those models and I tried to no I'm not not teacher yeah I have not but I'm happy to look at those two I've had to look at them if those are if those are models that would give our kids an upper hand and a better chance of success I would happily take them if they are I'm happy to I'm happy to do that to be four with you as I'm trying to tell you everything you're saying right now in the conversation we've had in the past hour and a half you've already come up with some different ideas and such already you have can you imagine what teachers were doing was they had this the concepts and ideas they will come up with we can facilitate things actually working maybe even by region maybe even by county maybe even counties that would test may even test schools schools it would test things out for a year right but what's imagine even actors have the kind of freedom to innovate in meaning any foreseeable future like that yeah decide decide some of the things that we've talked about now yes or parties certifications and trying to figure out absolutely yes what you're hearing me say would you have so many people get afraid messing you or but many people do if I'm talking about an actual revamp a reboot of education system we're talking about change radical genius because my state is collapsing and I understand that radical change yes do you think it's collapsing or do you think the current numbers are just unsustainable is there a difference yeah the difference is it'll still maintain but there'll be less people it's not collapsing it's not going to collapsing to me seems like it's falling apart yes that's what I see I think there's a lot of in New York that are like holy shit this is too much I gotta get out of here which in my eyes tells me that it's clouds because you have situation where you have counties that are one-third of Medicaid one-third of Medicare with a bunch of unfunded mandates that force them to pay for certain things and with people leaving you have a dueling tax base mm-hmm so at that point yeah that's collapsing at what point does it stop I don't see it stopping I just see larger chunks of Medicaid Medicare and at one point when it's Medicare even they pack up and head to Florida North Carolina or South Carolina right okay families are keeping people in New York State more than anything because their relatives are close by yes so now if they're not so I taste education out of the equation so if we've got education cured how do you make it any more be amazing how do you make it more attractive for people to stay in New York that don't have children how do you make it more attractive to businesses absolutely several things number one we as I said before with to raise money through ways other than taxation right we can still raise money we can find ways to fill gaps and if we have to fill the gap say the four billion from the federal government we have to put the gap if we find that the first six month discussion there's no way we can do this without the four billion hours in the federal government let's say let's say I'm wrong let's say I'm wrong and the four billion dollars I want to get rid of in the federal government is no we have to have it that we the plans we've come up with that we think will work will carve that money okay deal I got it we can still raise it some other way now in the past we've done things very poorly in New York State with some things like let's have a lottery and allotted will pay for education then it goes up to the general fund and goes away we can do is said something like this I talk often about using our infrastructure in New York State as a way of raising money we have bridges and tunnels and through ways and an Erie Canal which is over 500 miles and about three dozen locks and lots of stuff like that right why in the world do we have a bridge right now in New York State that's named after one of our previous governors it's called the Mario Cuomo bridge that's embarrassing we literally have an imperial bridge named after our royal family that bridge should not be named that the bridge should be the the staples bridge the Verizon bridge the the 3m bridge the Kellogg's Bridge the Apple bridge whatever we should be leasing naming rights out I'm a business guy I want to retain the asset that we don't lose the asset least a naming rights out right these are companies that pay billions of dollars every year in marketing all time they dropped twenty million dollars for a stadium that gets used on weekends instead we have them pay a hundred dollars for bridge that's crossed by hundreds of thousands of cars every single day so you call the Verizon The Horizon Richard love it perfect and it's mentioned hundreds of times every single day during rush hour in a 16 million person metro area but here the next pieces on top of that once he has the money they're also responsible for the maintenance we will still inspect the bridge right people citizens responsible fat is correct that's part of it yes so they have to pay you and they have to fix the bridge jingo yes correct all I know is I already have bankers already asking me about how long as the lease what did I do they already love it yes really people already don't know whether you want them to fix it at correct yes absolutely yes be part of the contract again I don't have to and this is a common theme that you'll find it people don't like and you don't seem to like it either which is I don't have the answer for exactly what the contract is I'm not saying I don't like and I'm just saying man if I was Verizon I'd be like shit yeah so hang you guys just to put my name on it now I gotta fix this yes then maybe you know what if you don't want to maybe we negotiate you pay a little bit less pay ninety million instead and fix the bridge but I want you fixing the bridge and there's a reason I want you fixing the bridge right now across our country bridges collapse concrete cancer yeah they cut all time you're right and and why because the government has to run it the government runs out of money or bureaucracy fails right but in this case we would actually have someone who has to fix it yeah so we could actually check the bridge and say it said at a B and a diesel O's you can get to as an example right is the B Verizon refused to fix it goes to C rice and fix it now all you do is contract and I guess now it's gonna be the Sprint bridge right they have to fix it the bridge have to get fixed that makes sense so yeah that's that's one right so immediately at that point we're getting money the bridge Darcy getting fixed and his the best part the neva tolls if you've been through New York State you know we are the tall monsters I mean we are horrible it's brewed yes when they establish those tolls under the false premise of once the bridges paid about it yeah correct once they addicted to that money yep they said well we're never paying this bitch off that is correct yes so instead they now know it's also creepy which means now those truckers that are paying a hundred bucks every time across that bridge they pay by the axle those go away this is $100 every time they cross the bridge for a big truck trailer yeah axle dirt yes it's horrible that is so dirty they're paying tons of money every time across that bridge and if you actually was away just if you could do that you would win the governor I would hope so if you could figure out how to do that you would become government it's already be this the idea is not crazy but I ever brought this up besides you never we already have adopt-a-highway fuck your education system this shit would work see that I got you on that one at least all right so hey what would work well work on this one I said but here's a better but might be done yet not only are they paying for Magnus which means we have lower spending because we're not paying for maintenance right and here's even better part the less money I have to give out for these contracts less corruption because I'm not giving out the contracts anymore Verizon's gimmick how much money do they get though in the tolls every year I would imagine it'd be bigger than 100 million dollars um no is it it's not no yes it is I'm sorry yes the the tolls I'm sorry I'm talking about billions yes because the New York state budget I was there billions apologize yes it's not hundred billion but it's several billion I think just New York City not mistaken is over two billion two billion a year in tolls just noises that is so turdy but that makes from people you can't drive as you give us money yeah cross this line pay attacks pay a tariff yes that soap soaps it's tons of money we're some lucky here in California so we could raise that money so to make you see I'll make your education happy I'll take four Bay off of that I'll put it back in the teachers and the money is the same well how'd but you're if you take them out you let me again as I did not love you I was just fine and holes in your game now when your way to Olien no holes don't be silly no holes there don't be silly there's some holes there then so when you take away all that money that people are paying on the tolls two billion dollars a year how do you replace that if they're paying two billion what if we're getting a hundred million dollars right for just one bridge that's just one bridge okay how many bridges there's over a dozen just in New York City just in the MTA and I didn't even cat and I didn't even count the Erie Canal has 36 locks we can name each lock repair the entire Erie Canal make it vite commercially viable without paying any tax payer dollars whatsoever and we at McDonald's could own one eat but McDonald's on every single lock these are for commercial boats yeah we can make whatever we want right now the Erie Canal is run by the Parks and Rec ins which it it cost us about a hundred million dollars every year including capital projects to maintain area canal we make less than 5 million have you crunched all the numbers on putting different advertising sponsors you can't different projects you can't and the issue I mean in theory you will absolutely raise billions that I'm sure in theory will raise billions the problem is you don't know which one goes first which one is more valuable you don't know how long the goshi ages will take right you also don't know will they take the 3 ways also what bridge they'll take some but just may not be viable to be taken so I don't know each one some tunnels they may not want to take and in how fast was catch on yeah manages mana you could do this with tunnels you get to do this with roadways yes I mean nobody gives a shit what the Parkway is called the Verrazano Parkway so I'm making anybody any money by calling it the Verrazano Parkway right unless it is another idea it's a there's a I 81 in upstate New York which is falling apart some idea for that is they're saying how we gonna fund this interstate youporn youporn highway well we either will only give you the most money what I'd rather do with a highway but I'd rather a highway is have instead make it a Google Road a Google Road some of those fucking people grip on your state oh yeah I well look if they want to give me a road here's whole Road here no here here is how it works they get their own Road they get their own Road and they can make it a driverless car Road and whatever they want the rent for that right is maintenance of the regular road okay that's the rent that's a you you maintain the road for free right you get to keep the next to it Google Road now people have an option you want to drive in a driverless car as they come up with or the driverless buses or whatever they come up with came up to come up with right you did you take it if you want to if you don't try the regular Road if Google says I don't want to pay for any more they lose ooga Road someone else buys it now it becomes an Amazon Road or a battle care whatever Road becomes an animal road whatever right well and it's funny that makes sense to me and I like that because nobody really gives a shit what a road that's correct it's call which is why you don't you don't name the road you give them a road next to it right right that they do they can but you can use that they can either brother want to just to transfer their goods for Amazon it could be an Amazon hub that just moves Amazon products fine I don't care as long as you maintain the regular road do what you want with the other road what and what other road is this again could be an Amazon Road what the only thing is this to help to move Amazon products back and forth it's fine again I don't have to know what this is is that required okay so they will figure it out what works for that this that's an innovative way to generate income absolute reduces the roads not even done the MTN is subway right the subway plan right now the answer is the same thing just give them more money no I'm not gonna be a hostage the MTA either the t-mobile subway no not that no instead I don't know no instead well because I think I'm gonna work here about that anyway the issue is this all the rail lines there are rail lines that the MTA Cross is about 11 I think maybe even 12 different counter things 11 different counties so it's all over so embodies lines we at night aren't used so want a freight lines that Amazon move its product from upstate New York into Manhattan on a freight line it's that being used at night what's that what's the fee for that fix the lines fix the lines fix them and maintain them is that a viable alternate yes absolutely run this by people with no sense for them yes I live in I live in New York City mmm right I live in Queens I work in Manhattan I know lots of bankers and I ask them these questions and they all say yeah nice idea sometimes they say no to some stuff I say but these they say they actually asked how long the lease would be on the bridge they went that far that's how much they like the Bridget you like that Bridget it to our office a good idea is good idea they like you very much now the is all your idea of course she'll lock that shit down why I'm still let's have the Nixon let let them Joe you just came out with the reason why this is so important because win draw everything I'm talking about stays and will fix my state people say all the time like what happens if everyone takes all your ideas good I'll go home and go back to work I can stop doing this so you can say some reason why you're doing this is just cuz you want to affect change in New York I don't get three reasons why number one I don't want to leave New York and if new doesn't change you ever go to North Carolina I have I know I know that barbecue I get it and I know and I don't want to go so yes stop teasing me so yes I don't want to go that's ever the number one reason is I want to stay in New York okay number one but also I want to change the state for better but even more I can change the nation for better when New York can be the place we will look and go wow you know what we can start doing these things I'm not even done okay I'm talking about small business right Wyoming has a law right now that says if you're a small farmer and you agree to not sell outside of Wyoming that you're immune from federal regulatory bodies helps the small farmers if you get a leg up there sitting in New York but why can't they just for every business every small business if you agree you will only sell locally why are you being bothered by the federal government's clause come into effect here it doesn't so how about we make that happen so that applies to all restaurants of course absolutely but unless that some boarder restaurants actually deliver across the border okay so you live across the border now that won't work we won't look at deliver that's great but don't worry if you don't deliver or don't cross the border you find what about if you use one of those third-party delivery services you know where they use an app and they order something and the app would be the people who are actually doing delivery would be responsible you would not okay as long as that as long as that company's based on your state so this keeps all the money in New York State no just keep all the money in yours a good amount of it it gives the small business owner a shot at competing as large businesses which almost always cross borders mm-hmm gives farmers a much greater incentive yes and to be more farm table right now I gotta help my farmers out my New York State farmers are hurting badly that's one idea but a second thing is you want to treat farmers like small businesses and they're not which means they don't get the SBA loans they don't get help and get treated that way it does not work when you treat them like small businesses but next I want to completely legalize hmmm and cannabis and what are you talking and I want to regulate them like onions onions like onions I'm a joking like onions white onions he's the reason why a lot of onions come out of New York that's right yes so that's my grown onions no one cares bingo exactly correct and here's the issue there are three reasons why I want to legalize hemp and cannabis and most you'll think you want to get high no the only drug I use is cannabis this cannabis is caffeine oh so this is only draw Freud I like that that's about cannabis I know but that if I use cannabis I would happily tell you so I don't have him to hide okay why don't handle II tell you use it not my thing a paranoid and worried about school system when you get high I think I talk even more I don't want to talk even more do I nobody might not be introspective you might sit back god I talk too much yeah maybe mushrooms and Exodus I've never done mushrooms and when I do mushrooms I feel like I talk too much so maybe maybe I should try them one day you never done mushrooms you have it a mushroom that makes me uncomfortable yes yeah I'm very squared right what do you hold you I'm 50 yeah I'm 51 there we go you've never done mushrooms never so somebody came up to you go Larry you want do some mushrooms you like no man one day I want to be governor that's what I was thinking it was seven and I thought that'd be governor one yes who's bringing mushrooms to a fucking seven-year-old oh that's what I'm psycho are you hanging around there you got it you don't stand where where I grew up when I get it where I can grew up no I grew up in South Bronx Oh even more crazy it was crazy and there had Tim dog I don't know Tim dogs sorry I haven't think the rocks of many years South Bronx sorry I haven't been in the Bronx in many years apologize but anyway wasn't a secure reference mushrooms and marijuana yes thank you all right you've never smoked pot I have not no never never have what yes I can't ever have mine you bro sorry never had what kind of square are you doing snore no pie il mushrooms acid nope do you want try it maybe one day what about right now no not now no no no I'm rotting and can't pay my friend oh yeah no help you odds are now talk me to the mass M it okay number seven okay to be forward I'm not against any of these things it's your body you own your body okay so if I if I stretch cannabis no I don't drink either you don't have her drink now do you like once a while glass wine dinner if people are around drinking a drink but I don't I don't have the alcohol in my house I don't drink unless all those were drinking okay I'm socially drink again I'm doing it drink your focus most of your life has been what business first it was military I wasn't worrying for something mm-hmm and then and then it was business yes so you just keep your nose to the grindstone kind of guy yes done how else could I do this have you seen my campaign this is that the last three gubernatorial campaigns in New York State combined didn't raise $10,000 combined I raised over Quatermain ready the last three gubernatorial candidates combined didn't do anywhere near the amount of stops I've made and I stopped too much laughs how much does Cynthia Nixon raise 1.7 I think million people getting behind sex in the city a lot there's a lot of that menopause money out there bro I need some of that I guess no no my point being yes nose to the grindstone I'm doing this of course okay I believe is lutely little mushrooms Oh huh no mushrooms have them maybe later no no wait till November 7th and then once you hit then maybe we'll see maybe your party with me maybe if I win I can't do it while I'm governor mmm that would be that would be that would be not not cool but marijuana isn't it legal in New York State no no serious diseases right that's correct medical and you fix that of course why appoint yeah that seems really proposed my whole point on cannabis and hemp is heavily because of farmers also right small farmers right now clean eat yes particular has yes totally uncontroversial and it's a fantastic commodity it's good it's good for the soil it's good for the environment and the best thing is if you treat small farmers like small businesses they can now specialized meaning they can specialize in help and then also create products in their farm then with specialized hemp products they can do that and create niche industries right right we see that New York State with both coffee and M breweries we said already happening in York State and you would have the same sort of incentives for them to sell in New York absolutely yes so they ticularly hemp which would be incredibly beneficial with zero controversy that's correct terms of like psychoactive effects doesn't have people people would be very happy to do that right but is to because I want you to be able to create cannabis products but there's something else and that is there are a lot of people in this country but I'll talk about New York State specifically who have chronic pain and right now they have three choices one in opioid it may be addicted to suffer which I don't accept all three what people tell me and for some reason again it's only been women who told me this they walk up to me and say you know Larry I hope you can legalize marijuana because I smoke a little at night so I can go to sleep what about CBD CBD is legal in your state now it's not a thing so it's not I don't think it is fucking I don't you know it's a good question I don't think it is that's crazy it's right medicinal I'm sorry he's probably distal CBD probably maybe my assumption but CBD has no psychoactive effects or if it comes out it comes with cannabis right so I I think I think it's just I think it's medical in New York State so my voice is some sort of a doctor's prescription yes so my point is if it's onions you can grow in your backyard right great medicine your backyard right if we have a Lino's yes if we heavily regulate cannabis and or hemp big business wins small business loses guaranteed it'll become big business cronyism the small farmers collapse right that's the wrong answer right so we need to make that happen and people already smoking it and maybe you don't to smoke it why don't you have an edible why don't ya I have liquid why don't you have whatever's your thing you don't have to smoke if you want to smoke please smoke it but there's many ways of taking advantage of of both THC and CBD yeah just you prefer and look it's your body not mine yeah and why in the world what I want you to have to live with chronic pain if you don't have to see because CBD again is not psychoactive is illegal yeah okay it is legal New York here we go it's it's pretty legal everywhere CBD because of the fact that doesn't have any psychoactive effects and it's fantastic for people with arthritis and say hey we got older folks or I mean shit I got Ted Nugent taking it how about like that he's never even touched anything Ted knew Mary does he it likes my facebook stuff well one of them likes is that you're a second Amendment proponent I am you know very true yes you know there's an issue that I have with people demonizing the National Rifle Association and one big issue is they always point to these school shootings and I'm like goddammit not a single NRA member has ever committed one of these mass shootings this is not NRA members so you guys are going after people that are fighting for the right for people to have arms when there's people that are taking these arms and they're using them completely illegally yeah none of them are in the NRA it does like any sense yep will you find a book you man right but that boogeyman is culturally accepted yes it's it's really confusing and then it's not helped by the fact that a lot of people that are in are a proponents get you know they dig their heels in the sand yes and they fight hard and very much emotionally so against people who are against the NRA and then it becomes this tribal thing it does and the tribal issues the biggest issue I don't agree it's a point where you're not even listening to each other yeah this is why I say the third party is the way look people ask Larry can you win this thing hear hear all the time the biggest the biggest critique I get is you can't win man what are you doing you can't who's saying that too particularly right now Republicans but some Democrats to their head Lisa you can't win you can't win you can't win but the answers there some aren't can't win yeah a lot of them are some are smart to things remember that the first thing is I can win and histories and why the Republican cannot win because there's only about two and a half many Republicans in New York State and about six seven million Democrats in New York State give or take the the tribalism we have now if you're a Democrat you're not gonna vote for Republican you're Republican you're not gonna vote Democrat right but you might vote for libertarian right you might but with somebody who's not the other evil guy so I have the option of getting the other things I can get the other guys and I can get this 7% of New Yorkers who don't vote I can get those so there's a chance to win and on top of that a five-way race only being thirty percent to win this is a winnable races can be done but let's say I'm wrong I've been wrong maybe all my ideas are wrong maybe every hole you found is a it's a real hole and it can't be done and maybe they all destroy me and they beat me up and I can't win get rid of those polls and your win bro just get those fucking balls out get those tolls not polls or other tolls you mean you took those tolls gone yes and you can in the whole thing but say I'm wrong and I can't win great if I just come in second I beat the Republican only mm-hmm imagine what it does for the state the first thing it does is shows them that a third party can actually have impact in New York State which means the entire nation off the bat what third parties were thinking wait a minute we can do something in a big stage yes and something else it'll make better Republicans and better Democrats cuz right now neither of them does anything for anybody they don't care something gets done but one there's a third party I become the referee I'm moon who says Democrats you're supposed to be about civil liberties you're not what's wrong Republicans you're supposed to be about less government and Second Amendment and some more business you're not what's wrong and now the media hears me now people hear me they have to become better because if they're not they'll come to me instead and they'll see it and out of fear they'll begin to change now what do you think about this move toward democratic socialism and you're seeing this a lot of young kids in particular they seem to be abandoning this old system and trying to adopt a much more radical left-wing system yes and apparently there's some real problems that lady who won would she's literally my congresswoman she were in the council yes koc you know Alexandria Ocasio Alexandria Misha Cortez was it was that true they smear in her or is it true that she used to be a Republican anti-abortion I have no idea person I don't know and that she's really from Florida I don't know I don't know there's people are so terrified of her and yet you know and attacking her and she's made some missteps too you know but we have to realize is socialism for most Americans today to a young young ones is just the newest ideology of rebellion Brian toal it is most of them don't know most of people the youngsters pickly who actually supported Bernie couldn't tell you any of his policies right they just knew he wasn't the establishment disabled Trump though there were lot of people support Trump who wouldn't tell you one policy but there's things he was an alien that Bernie says that they resonate with people yes one of them is that there's income inequality in the country very true that's that's a big one yes and so people say oh well the game is rigged and Bernie's gonna fix it yes well the game is rigged that's true and inequality is happen that's true but it's rigged because of corruption because of the two-party system right it's rigged because of corny capitalism right that's why it's rigged but it is rigged the problem is you have a system where people keep saying it's the free market right this happen with Obamacare by the way with Obamacare they said well we have we have markets right we have the marketplace where you can go buy insurance mm-hmm and what people then hurt was oh it's a free market it's not a free market but that's what they heard it was a free market so then when Obamacare fails in certain states what are they saying the market didn't work see we need single-payer the market didn't work with its single-payer that's how it's spun and single-payer is a single-payer is the right answer it's Medicare for all what sounds amazing but it won't be what it will be is VA for all and the VA to disaster it'll be a two-tiered system and that's a disaster and what most we don't realize is socialism actually equals a two-tiered system the reason why so many people who are wealthy will will be found with Obamacare or socialism is because they're not gonna use it mmm they're not using it I see in Manhattan right where where I'm in Manhattan it's already happening because of how New York State works and how bad the system is you have less and less options for insurers there's only like one or two insurers now left in New York State and leaving it walking away at them campaign money so what's happening now is all the best doctors shouldn't say all most of the best doctors don't take insurance anymore really don't take it just don't take it real yes so what you have this doctors have enough patients that are wealthy that want the best medical care they can go look you're gonna have to pay me yes and and it's actually a better I know cuz in my own family right Mike that's crazy I I'm a business owner so up that pay for my own Obamacare right but my wife won't want Obamacare so my wife too takes private doctors and I take Obamacare doctors that's how I spoke to my actual family so when we go to a to a doctor's office you can see a difference right if it's if a doctor takes insurance to doctors in the darkest office five people who are administrators and they care more about photocopying your documents than you you're in the way that the the rooms bad no one cares whatever your appointment at two o'clock you get seen at 3:45 now change it now it's a doctor who does who does nothing insurance well that's five doctors in that office two administrators you show up that I care how are you what's going on please have a seat whatever they take your credit card or your check whatever boom you're good to go you've hurt me to two o'clock he's in 205 well the comparison of valid comparison is the Canada's health care system versus Americas I have friends from Canada that come to America to get health care yes because the health care system over there although it's free it's not as good that's correct many aspects and their waiting lists are massive and the wealthy come someplace else a two-tier system exactly correct right right they live everything now where you go on vacation to get your your your stuff done right and you I'll get my yes I mean it's it's horrible right but let me finish the last piece okay in the if you have a an insurance the author in tax insurance he'll talk to you for maybe five ten fifteen minutes at most and it will always end with one or two things a prescription or procedure so that you're paid the bill Medicare right they billed Medicaid they bill your insurance company prescription or procedure they're always doing this how to make money private the person talks for twenty minutes thirty minutes ask you things that matter like how are you eating how are you sleeping what's your stress level things that actually matter when it comes to your health they ask those questions is what's going on all those things they begin to ask use questions see if it works then it doesn't always end with that it ends with what I was a probably because you're writing them a check anyway right they're getting a three headed bucks for one visit no matter what you ready my check will you stop your credit card and there's an incentive for you to talk about what a good doctor they are says grant more business that pays them the same way you're paying that is exactly correct and they don't have to go through because should paperwork you are the customer right right when it comes to anyone takes insurance the insurance companies the customer right no people that are listening to this that don't have enough money to pay for that you're saying well I want that kind of care yeah and I want it to be federally funded yep is that possible mmm the combination no no can you get good care yes and how do I know this them again anything I'm saying is based on something right right and the best example I can give you is non non emergency or non critical care things like LASIK eye surgery things like cosmetic dentistry all the types of things right getting breast enhancements things of that sort any kind of enhancement yes any of those things right if you remember years ago years old so you know when when LASIK first came out they should charge you per eye because it's so expensive it was so expensive was per eye now you get both down with less than a thousand bucks right sometimes a couple bucks depending on where you go so what's happened in every instance service levels gone up price has gone down technology has gone up in every case that's happened so while we follow the same model in in this and can it work sort of happening the Oklahoma Surgery Center right now right is doing it right now laney late they list all the pricing right so you can you can I see fit oh ok I can get this I know what cost it's unit deals outside of insurance correct no sure it's yes there's a Mara's popping up in certain areas now doctors that are companies in Oklahoma only that I know of there may be others but then that one I know of interest rate so I think it's I think it's actually called the Oklahoma Center for surgery or something like Surgery Center something like that and so the ideal situation would be that would be available for people that can afford it and for people that can't afford it there's always gonna be catastrophic health care you break your leg you're gonna be taken care of well here's the age of flu you're gonna be taking care there's a bigger issue here the bigger issue is we in this country have confused health care with health care insurance hmm they are two totally separate things I don't talk much about health care insurance that much with I care more about the health care system itself this is the miself is broken it's cartel system right so it's literally a people in a room get together and go hey what do you think aspirin eighty five bucks what do you think yeah 85 bucks it is fresh spring it's not based on how much it cost to make it oh not at all not at all it is a little extra like that Martin what is that little twats name that went up going to jail shkreli yes the wu-tang clan album perfect exact up the price of some heart of some medication in a horrific way perfect sample yes that of course is an extreme example but that's actually happening if you've ever gone to a hospital or go into a doctor's office and you see the they give you the bill right mmm ask for 85 bucks run in a bed for five minutes three thousand dollars I mean they do that right and and that's a problem in itself and one of the reasons is this right now health care system it's the current health care system all right Joe you decide you want to get a new job and you want to get some new clothes for your job so you come to me the closer you say hey and he seemed too close they look great here's some new clothes and I show you what you gonna do and I give you your hat and clothes and everything you got awesome you go thanks Larry's perfect awesome how much it cost and I say I don't know you see wait a minute I can me a store you gave me the perfect outfit for a new job you don't know how much cost that's correct I don't know what it's perfect I don't how much cost he's we're gonna do you go home take take the clothes it's great for you you can get a bill in the mail about a week or so whatever the bill is I don't know what it is you have to pay that's our current health care system Wow that is true yes it's not worse it is true it's only in our system right you don't do that for a car or clothes or computer everything else nothing else only that it's true but here's the worst part all right you decide you want to buy this water from me right I'm sorry Jamie so Jamie decides he wants to buy this water for me I'm calling young Jamie if you want to be young Jamie young given wants to buy this water from you and you agree you want to sell to him for a dollar he agrees didn't buy $4 I step in I'm insurance nope you cannot have this I have deemed as the insurance company that this this actually is worth 50 cents I've decided so so by giving the water so are you trying to sell the water for a dollar insurance company says fuck you that's great fifty cents that's correct and gives you the sense done yeah that's a real problem with yes absolutely so hey comes next piece though now this guy over here and he wants to buy the water too he doesn't have insurance I can't get involved would you want to sell the water to him how much you wanna sell a war to him now a buck fifty now you gonna make a pretty sense for him so he's paying three times what she's paying how do you fix that that's the current system how would you fix her transparency transparency transparency so number one thing good right the parents office you broke your foot you say a broken foot cost this it cost $50 an hour for that it cost fifteen cents per pill for this will be amazing but just just doing one thing just saying in New York State just saying this if you sell medical services like any other service you must be transparent right that's it that's it so you can't just give someone a bill you have to show them why it cost what it costs and you have to have a standard absolutely please charge them for that's very reasonable yes it's like a car right you don't always know much it costs to fix the car they give an estimate so you feel like it's just been in place for a long time and they've taken advantage of it and they have power and so they're just leaving it the way it is there's also a bunch of fear and then you have this isn't enough right this concept of transparency is not enough all these problems that we have people often say well I what's the answer it's not one thing it's many things transparency is a huge piece but you also have to facilitate more things as an example you want to facilitate an environment to where if a okay the current system people are something to use now is what I call the Costco model which is basically a membership model right so the doctor's office has all of us as customers all of us decide to pay or they agree without the payment this is 400x a month or you have a kid so you're eight hundred bucks a month or your singles you turn whatever the part of the pricing we all pay we now can go to that doctor's office whenever we need to and whoever is in the office whatever they have we have access to it cost five bucks five bucks per page that's all they try this at zero just doing it free but senior citizens will show up every day so they charge it's at five dollars five bucks sharper five bucks and to me - what's the goal the doctor's office the goal of the dollars offices for you to be healthy if you didn't never show up just pay your foreigner bucks every month and to never show up they'll be awesome right right now that's happening already right the advantages whatever they have we get to use so if they start making more money they will bring on more doctors they will bring them more everything so that you will get more of your family and friends to come and pay the monthly fee like a gym membership same thing right as you long how do you find what will happen is as long as they can help you they help you if they can't - things you have catastrophic insurance and they would have some type of agreement with another facility like a hospital or something like that so that you they'll get a lower price because you're going to them they're sending patients to you right so if you had a bigger issue they can handle they have the groom with other facilities so you get a lower price anyway but you'd have insurance for that catastrophic insurance of course and we already hasn't like that we have long-term care insurance right which is insurance that when you get something that will last a long time there are insurances that will help to pay along but also but more important than that with that in mind we've take care of our people who are very poor so what could we do we can have a system to where you have an option normal if you want to or this system and here's an incentive if you decide to say as an example and I'm making this up as an example only you know 10% of your of your people you will bring on for free and based upon how we decide that they're poor I'm making this up as an idea so um they they they're eligible for free school lunch in New York State that's how we as New York State will define poor for the sake of argument right crown sake of argument if they'll go for that you take those people then we'll give you a break on this tax or this fee or this thing if you do this mm-hmm many of the smaller doctors the break problem will be enough and they probably won't take it but large organisations probably will so larger companies will take on people who can't afford to pay anything this is another idea or concept you start making this happen in facility in this and you will see healthcare will get cheaper and when healthcare gets cheaper now insurance gets cheaper now you have more people to get into insurance business you'll have more options and choices for insurance you know people just get an emergency room insurance some people just get long-term care insurance some people just get XYZ insurance how could you reduce the number the amount of money rather that pharmaceutical drugs cost because that would be a big issue right it would be absolutely now there's several things one of course is the FDA the FDA stifles so much I mean if you had to be completely rebuilt I can't redo that in New York State that's the thing the government that the state government really can't do much of all I can do is make it force and be transparent so that people see how bad it is as a general rule and this is 100 percent rule well general rule is when you shine a light on bad behavior almost always you can make the bad behavior less mmm so one it has to be transparent and when you actually each pill cost all this money enough people go do what he's doing right enough go what are you doing I'm not doing this and it will force the system to change but that's a long-term solution that is really a federal issue well listen Larry you got some really good ideas they're very revolutionary you're a bold mother facts the goal and some chances absolutely I like the fact that you're sticking your neck out there with a lot of these things and I hope so I really do well let me wrap the last piece up too if if if I don't win if you don't win if I win it changed this nation overnight 100 because all the ideas pop up things will change you will see people who are independent step up you seem to be in the debates just be popular that's it how much do you have to be probably what has to be decided they just decide who decides is there a committee no I think presidential thing yeah Cuomo decides if he wants to show up or not that's it yes and what he does is he says follow my rules and I'll show up what is his rules whatever he feels is appropriate really yes you can do that yeah yeah he won't show he there with Nixon he said it has to be sit-down must be here must be there she said yes he showed up so he'll have his rules I'll say yes I'll show up what will he do that with you I don't know I think he will in the last last two times he did it he did all that all four people showed up last well good for him so yes last time he did it yes probably well when would this possibly have October October yes and we could promote that of course people about absolutely um what would be the key things that you and him would butt heads on Wow so much as a general rule the biggest thing is the state's collapsing and he doesn't say that he says the state's awesome because we have great gun control solutely what he says he's worried about fighting Trump he thinks fighting Trump is everything because he's running for president 2020 so his entire campaign is I'm the only one who can beat Trump I'm the only one who can protect New York State from Trump and if he loses the governorship he's fucked running for president I don't know depends on our Democrats think I mean you know depends some Democrats who depends on who wants to fight trauma 2020 if Trump is very popular a lot of Democrats won't want to fight them but como well who else is going to run what do you mean for my president for as a Democrat is Hillary running again I don't know it seems like she is right maybe seems like Bernie might run again he might yeah I don't know there's a lot of mites so I don't really know his loss might mean that he that he doesn't run but if you win changes the internet changes not just that you will find people who are Liberty leaning all of a sudden run in a libertarian banner because I'm I'm right now the most popular guy running who has an L buys name there are some libertarians while running who don't have elves by the name they're running in nonpartisan races I'm running boldly with an L by my name right so I'm trying to change the Brian so it's a decent brand it's what I'm doing you put them trying on my stuff I'm always libertarian so I'm trying to build the brand out to be a better brand so if I win the brand is better people will do that will raise my money it'll be a real third party I mean there'll be a third party in the United States which will make better Democrats and better Republicans will literally be a better nation a better politic will be better in America if I actually win this damn thing but let's say I lose Sam wrong my things my my T's are wrong whatever people agree I lose doesn't matter the bold ideas are still out there what you heard what your audience heard is still there someone's gonna pick this up someone's gonna talk about it and if you're fine with that a hundred percent what yes please I want to fix things I'm not concerned with who gets the credit for it let's fix it I want a better place to live this cut is in trouble nearly it's a perfect example of where we're going I don't want that to be the rest of this nation we can fix steal all my stuff please steal at all awesome I hope you steal it I hope California copies me and does everything I said to be amazing please do that it'd be awesome but if people don't hear me if I don't get out there if I don't in debate stage and I don't come in second or third then no one's gonna hear me cuz I'm gonna be forgotten but if I come in second or a tight third there will be a microphone in my face for the next two years and every time it's out there I'll be saying stuff just like this again and again and again and maybe my education isn't perfect but guess what someone will figure out the right one it won't be just keep giving it money it won't be that it'll be something that actually work there'll be something brand new and exciting and get people to come back to our state what I don't want is what's happening now is kids get educated they leave they don't come back hope you guys hear someplace else and never come back it's the wrong answer good luck to you Larry thank you very much for being here all righty Larry sharp ladies and gentlemen the revolution has just begun [Music]
