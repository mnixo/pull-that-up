they have zero life and they don't even know what a pussy looks like quoits old school right yeah we're on quake 4 with this quake champions that you play online we've been playing quake 4 because we

right and they get all serious angry face don't talk to anybody pretend they're real fighters relax some of them are real yeah but some of them are not though some of them get super serious that's when I whisper like this yeah when they say I don't like when people say I'm going I'm gonna train today I'm like what are you doing you taking Pilates yeah you're training that's not true we trained for what were you training for the apocalypse are you training for some dick his goddamn games they're so addictive you were like straight-up addicted to him right oh yeah I had a real problem well I kind of got a little bit of a problem now Jamie and I have been talking back and forth he's up on me a little bit too that's why I have to kick Jeff out every now and then just so Jamie and I go one on one one on one last time I fucked him up and he quit because me and Jeff Lee is he prey right not easy prey anymore Jeff was easy prey for a little bit if I want all these games how long do you think we'd be here playing quick true you wouldn't say him you lost 13 to 5 because you were trying real hard you got fucked up son I let you up and we're talking shit cake and he says yeah sure fuck them up the problem with having another person in in the thing is he always goes after Jeff first gets that easy kill that's what anything gets me I could really get my fucking be quick yes for killing me right away no Jeff's starting to win you know you got a he came real close to win that last one he's practicing well we're not why he's definitely Jeff should be playing right now he's gonna be smart yeah whoo I told him to fucking lift weights too I'm like dude you got this whole gym here while the show is going on watch the security camera get your pump on boom good all out there so let's talk about these fights bro first of all let's start with Diego motherfucking Sanchez all these young guns sleeping on Diego Sanchez fully redeemed himself do not sleep do not just do not just don't because he will fuck people up still how about Mickey Gaul bid and do you see that I saw the see there's a video of him biting on well there's a video of Diego go and look at this shit yeah Diego I saw on his and his Jam he showed his chest worked a bit that is crazy I thought I they said Mickey gall had a hard cut like a really hard cut maybe that's one of the reasons he got so tired I just don't think that so far he's just the skills aren't there yet now he's out of his element a little bit Wow I dare you outclassed him Diego is a monster I mean you're dealing with a guy who has 40 look at that bite mark that is that is great bites the fuck but you got all bites guys have bitten guys before can't be on my team yeah you're off the team it's not good it's a bad look but me Oh Diego didn't say shit to the referee just kept smash dude he is such a savage he's a savage instigating since he was four years old and he won Ultimate Fighter season 1 2005 14 to the King years ago a lot at middleweight yep 14 fucking years ago you know stop and think about what an insane career that is and his last two fights I think you last fight was Craig white is that who he fought last smash that dude smashed and then smashed Mickey gone dude he's the he's the mascot for Jackson's right like there's a logo it's Diego Sanchez yeah and everybody knows that is Brendan sharps voice I sound like Alec Jones right now there's joy you don't know yeah it's you sound Brendan job with the cold I don't see I don't feel sick you don't feel sick so it's just a sore throat I think yeah but how's your just go we screaming at someone no that's chilling I did two practicing more this wolf howls sometimes my voice goes I'm not sick that's so great that's where cuz I am sick a little bit really yeah well I had it over the weekend yesterday I felt like dog shit do you work out I worked out not yesterday but Saturday worked outside of it probably wasn't a good idea they say when you work out when you're sick you makes it worse you mean system's down I usually short do it too I lift it too and you know it's not smart no yeah but I I'm okay today I'm just like a little little worn out but my voice is alright you should some rest yeah yeah yeah I mean I'll be fine goblin doesn't help no it's the worst man because always I always take the first flight back because I want to see emmalin's again mostly yeah I got that makes it worse yeah I was up at 5:00 so Nicky Gaulle in that fight he asked for that fight that was a fight he was begging Dana White to give him he thought it was a good fight for him he thought it was a good matchup yeah I don't know why people think that I guess cuz like he's been knocked out right out I Quinta K Odom Matt Brown K Odom but I did a big name who's been doing for a long time so these young guys go oh I grew up watching him let me get him well they I think they also think he's been doing it for so long and they're right yeah but he's still so fuckin tough man he has all the skills yeah he still has all the skills and his ground-and-pound is fuckin ferocious and once he's on the ground then he doesn't I mean if there's a hole in Diego's game you'd have to say against like elite strikers he has a real problem you're right like guys like Matt Brown he's gonna have problems he's just not as fluid as those guys you know yeah Diego's grappling is amazing amazing amazing and his ferocity cannot be questioned just mental game Savage just to think about the enthusiasm Diego has after all these years in the game all these years in the game unbelievable crazy how many years how many years well some what we know 14 years was the UFC but he fought before that he was he was a veteran I mean he had several fights before the unit age yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah crazy crazy how long he's been doing it and again how long he's been doing it and how much he loves it still and he says CBD is really helping him he's got his own CBD mm - Wow damn the motherfuckers 77 years he fought Michael Johnson in 2000 bring up Saint Michael Johnson no way like Miami tags Michael was six years what's that his name would probably tag there for what yeah would write not Michael Wow he fought Shannon rich on his third fight Shannon rich has like a million fights come on Shannon rich look at my guy the Joker old-school do that but click on Shannon rich how many fights is yeah I must say he's got how many does it say we should say the wreck losses 53 it's I mean oh Jesus Christ it's the worst record I've ever said is crazy it's crazy shout out to that guy though free keeping with it you know that is crazy lost seventy nine times Jesus Christ forty-two kickboxing oh my god in 42 kickboxing matches Jesus Christ kickboxing he's kind of killing it 35 and 7 not bad but that's an insane amount of experience but just stop and think about 17 years in diego's still slinging and so much enthusiasm that's a crazy part it's not just that he's fighting that he fights he's fucking angry he's got his own CBD company now it gave me some of it any good I haven't tried it yet he just gave me gave me some bottles of his stuff but he's mean he really believes in CBD a lot of fighters do it's helping elsewhere but yeah it's amazing amazing stuff spectrum CBD hmm yeah it's I mean there's so many good companies now but uh you know another fight that was crazy how about Colby and pedro muñoz are you top there you track my coat will you skip past the beat Oh Jeremy Stephens which I thought crazy mmm crazy and no I mean for the beat to beat the number six here in the world yeah it was good okay fine would you think um I didn't think it helps a beatstock because there's so much hype on him you didn't finish the key look all right really well first of all he's fighting Steve agree Jeremy Stephens is fucking dangerous you can't ask any mistakes at that guy zero you're getting knocked out look good I thought I looked okay I didn't think yes stock went through the roof of that fight you can't walk away from that fight going oh my god I can't wait to see him fight again well I don't look good but when you wouldn't you hear Mark Henry's coach talk about him I mean they talk about him like he's the next fucking did you see yeah 360 roundhouse kick he tried yeah shit it's so fast he's really fast hit and his his round kick to the body is just so fast like lightning amazing throw such a jerk such a town yeah so technical to everything does very smooth doesn't get hit doesn't play that game no no doesn't play the game that código Bryant played Pedro Cody graphite was crazy losses in a row three not three chaos in a row I just couldn't believe he was standing with him like that he got him hurt and then he got hurt and then he was determined to take him out and then they were literally going right hand right hand right hand till someone fell yeah and Pedro could take a shot so can Cody yeah I need shots he ate some big ones but it makes no sense if you're Cody so technical I know it was a head but he said he had head button and just saw Brett well he definitely did he definitely got head by the ear and Pecola and he talked about it he said he saw red like got angry about it yeah yeah you can't do that yeah you got a fight and tell it to me obviously it's super easy for us to say you know sitting here drinking coffee yeah don't fight it don't fight angry bro you know it's easy to say but that's what makes him so dynamic agree it's what got him to the party but as a former fighter it's like coming off two losses which I've been there you're usually a little more like I'm not gonna go down that road right I've been knocked out twice yeah I know how that ends yeah if I get hit let's learn from our mistakes right right what's the troubling part yeah and he he has a speed advantage patron money is very good timing but I think Kobe has a speed advantage technique and speed on the fear on the ground it's all Pedro on the feet all day I mean Cody gar Brent is still only 27 years old and still could be world champion again no no doubt about it three losses pedro muñoz okay he played that game long but then another tour TJ Dillashaw right okay so the champ has your number grand fuck and in both of those fights he hurt TJ Dillashaw he's just gotta be more cautious and fight more technical more disciplined yeah you know I mean wouldn't be a bad idea to get some mental coaching you know get some game plan coaching which he might have been doing I don't know yeah I don't I'm just speculating I don't know who he's training is striking with either but you know to mix things up more and be more unpredictable would also be a good thing I mean obviously the last exchanges were just not predicted at all before I mean not unpredictable at all fully predictable just right hand right in right hand just chaos you know his last when he beat Dominick Cruz you just you gotta be cerebral and that fight to be done with groups yeah he had Dom's number I mean it was a different kind of fighting it's interesting Dom said that he did the exact thing that Cody did in their fight that he got hit he got emotional and he fought reckless dom do yeah and that dom went after Kody that Christine yeah he said I know what it's like you just you lose your game plan you start you get wild yeah it's just it's hard to see him get ko three times in a row like that he's gonna be fine I hope so he's gonna be fine I hope so learn from it but here's the thing when you're ranked was he number two in that division it's not like alright let's give you a warm-up fight it's not boxing there's no warm-ups right he's gonna get Jimmy Rivera or fucking ster al Jermaine he'll Jemaine yeah it's like and you know those guys my heart use that they don't want him because he's lost three times in a row you member ferres come off lost to that that's true sterling actually called him out which is weird cuz he's ranked you know he's ranked five I think but he's coming off a win you know huge win right so with sterling it's like generally called out coming yeah I mean Brandt yeah yeah I'm saying he'll be coming today cuz I'm already thinking that marketing yeah well he's good at talking shit and getting his name out there and it's the best thing for the the welterweight division right now after us Mon just dominated tyron woodley I was blown away by that fight me to lone what our takes each other is weird cuz I people over in my house to watch the fights and they were like god this fights so boring and I look out mind like god this is brutal I'm like what the fuck are you talking about I was one of the greatest title fight performances I've ever we were to do that to Woodley and dismantle him you don't understand you have no idea what you're watching yeah it's fucking insane it's not just insane that he dismantled him which is for sure insane but also his fucking gas tank Moosman was pushing on the pedal for five fucking rounds never let off again how about the way he looked in between rounds and to me this mentality yep when you look from the first round Suz they break it up yeah and then you ready stand up like this I'm like oh oh do you know that the word was that he had a fractured foot correct so he took a fucking cortisone shot coming into that fight imagine that average imagine that and still no problems with his endurance apparently didn't train the whole week of just didn't do shit still made the wait no problem but think about what he has to do his coach is going right you got to go in there get out grapple no maneuver tyron woodley who's one of the best welterweights of well he how does he get taken down out did empty take into there who doesn't get taken down Whitley also was kind of I don't know he's 37 I don't know if it's he just didn't show up what happened but he's 36 C 36 either way either way he's been getting for a hot second this is why I feel bad for woodling maybe you know Joe but Woodley was always that guy where he didn't get along with Dana he was kind of difficult to deal with did it his way and made some demands want the big fight and then it never happened for him right just he was in a big draw and but he could get away with that when he was champ right he's not champ the road frame to get back is gonna be so fucking tough right because of what he did wouldn't he was champ yeah that's why I feel bad for Woodley and he's one of the greatest to ever do it he is one of the greatest he ever do it and I was making the argument before this fight that he could obviously you could argue that if he beats spawn he is the greater correct he's in the greatest is George st. Pierre right he was a legend at welterweight you you look at his career I mean how many years was George to chamfer was it six years or something crazy I had the most title so you have George Matt Hughes and Woodley Matt Hughes has legend status because he was the original right he was I mean he was the first wrestler that really developed rock-solid submission skills the fights with Frank Trigg the I mean he the money your arm armbar George st. Pierre and their first fight I mean he was amazing but then the new school was George you know George was the best welterweight of all time but I was saying that the he's in the running right now if you consider the opponents he be wonderboy twice knocks out robbie lawler the wind then goes on from there beats Demian Maia I mean you you look at how he beat Darren till for some reason he was an underdog in the dare until fight which didn't make any sense to me I thought everybody mmm I got excited - I thought Darren tail was gonna win that really I did see I thought Darren tells very good but I did not know much I never saw him on the ground I never saw a real wrestler take him down and ground-and-pound I didn't know what he had off his bass he I think there entails gonna be a problem for Huisman what really his eyes yeah I think he's gonna problem and Darren is committed to 170 still is he still I think especially now that 170 because what what is if you are a fan of fighting what is fun is Woodley being out the welterweight division so fun right now who's been Colby you got Ben act then ask her in there mm-hmm now Darren till has a shot to be a champion well I'll tell you what even though Robbie Lawler lost that fight goddamn he looked good he looked good physically well I got the way and he looked Jack best I've ever seen you know he looked amazing apparently he had a tremendous strength and conditioning resources yeah he looked real good and he was fighting fucking ferocious like the Robbie Lawler of old he didn't look at all diminished and I think maybe the time off was good for him because he had to get a ACL surgery yeah so it might have been dealing with something before his last fight we don't know do you think maybe it was to where Ben Askren it's very so one-dimensional you have to worry about the striking at all there's a little bit of that for sure but the fucking fight started because he launched Ben Askren into the air and slammed him on his fucking head tough which isn't crazy here's the other thing yes Ben won controversially we don't know that there's still what two minutes left in that fight dude I've been watching the dog poke yeah there was that much time it could have got pretty dice for for a fucking Robbie Lawler god I see we can't just go to Ben's been I think he put it on his Twitter or his Instagram page we see Robbie Lara's arm go limp dude it goes limp now here's the question did it go limp because he just let it go cuz he's trying to like let you know just let it go hang on because the choke he was like he's squeezing really hard he's gonna tire his arms out he said it wasn't under his chin now but here's the thing and this is people need to stop saying that you have to be under the chin to choke a guy unconscious you can do both you can choke a guy unconscious across his face or you can go across the face right like this if you have a real squeeze you have like a marcelo garcia squeeze you could put her go to sleep think out strong badness to fan has a real squeeze phenomenal squeeze and and he's in this position with that Bulldog you can get a lot of leverage in that position I mean don't know how he's gripping it so much more torque you get this amazing torque so I don't know if he went out and then been let him go a little bit and he pop right back awake that's what he's saying your natural movement though if you go if you're fighting a choke him your natural mr. hold on to it is not to go limp that's true that's true that's wrong like I maybe he was out we thought he was out yeah I'm sorry was out but in all fairness I thought Ben was out earlier me too but they're gonna stop they're gonna stop him Robbie slamming Mike he's out he's out he was fucked I thought he was out but he damn he can take a fucking shot he can take a fucking shot cuz Robbie hit him with some crazy we got him up so much no we love so much when he came these do goober dadbod how's the game is just as terrible let's figure this out let's see do you have a video of it check both of his pages I don't see he posted he posted it today I think it was a Twitter yeah I think it was Twitter and I think maybe he might have either reposted it or replied to it or reposted it with a comment he says this is what happened it's macaws just a comment okay well let's see it when he said this is what happened then go to whatever he was commenting on I think you'll see the video whenever he was commenting on is the video only they were saying that in the video that he see let's check it out here Jack Sparrow there goes see carefully you'll see that been loosened his chok chok choked a little bit and then Herb Dean touch click on that click on that goes till along yeah but if you go to the top of that thread you'll see the video there it is right there the top right there watch this so check this out watch see that right there that's not a normal move up but look but Robby does give him the thumbs up that's the other thing that you're not seeing this and not a normal movement but it is a tight squeeze it does look like you his arm went limp I think he went out for a second and came to well herb said what herb is saying is he told them to stop when the arm went limp when the arm went Lyn Ben said is that he's lightening up and then he lightened up and then Robby came back to life that's fair that is entirely possible folks it's entirely possible I do not know but I do know that robbie lawler is a classy motherfucker because he complained a little bit what the fuck does all right man good job good fight he's been the game so long I was like you can see him goes off he's got exactly he's got a great attitude that he really does he's got a great attitude and I don't think he's stock dropped in that fight I really don't know no I really don't and I would like to see the rematch oh well I want to see it again I mean he says no but Ben says yeah ben says he didn't want to fight him in the first place murderer but he was so amped up for that fight to who's so angry and like you could see in his face he knew what this meant dude how about Ben vs. Susman that's a motherfucking fight yeah oh yeah ban your performance to shit you barely won your ugliest fuck your chin is too big not to miss you have no respect for no one oh did I say your curly-headed fuck seeing London Muppet well till has a tough fight in London though - yeah Maas Vidal's no joke man Mozza doll is a very technical guy he's wrestling two men he's everything yep very good at everything and very good wrestling and I think that's probably where he's gonna try to put Darren till after that Woodley fight he's a tough fight it's a bad situation for Woodley man because you're gonna people are gonna say oh he was doing all that stuff with TMZ oh he's got a rap album coming up he's opening for he's doing rap concert it's fair though right Jen is fair that's fair criticism cuz cuz I've always been on that side of and you know more than anyone told me to get the fuck out yeah it's when your one foot in yep cuz what Zeus been doing when woodleigh's in the studio going hard going hard loose men is all in he's all in you think those men wants sure if I can win up to him like a dude I'll pay for a shelf Raiders on TMZ that's my face that's what he's gonna say get the fuck he probably get angry at you get the fuck out of my face that TMZ shit dude I was I was telling everybody for years people have been scared of oozma for years but now you see why now I said before you were seeing people were scared of him but he wasn't beating anybody that was world-class he wasn't he wasn't getting those top ten guys gave me my ax right yeah we got those the Demian Maia fight will forever be marred by the fact they separated them when Damien had one hook in he was trying to take his back dude was that fuckin a homeboy the guy whose capsule was that daughter'd what oh my god he's doing what are you did see who that was go go to Demian Maia versus kymaro goostman and see who who separated them cuz the ref Matt Matt the Tara Sarah was going fucking crazy about that and he's a hundred percent right do you know how difficult it is to get ahold of a guy like who spun like that and to have one hook in standing up and to be working to take his back and for them to separate him it is Nandu that's beauty how much harder it is that's hard yeah much hard is to take Woodley down and control him yes and then you stand them up yeah yeah if I'm what the fuck you do yeah but I mean you stop you stop and think about Damien Myers last fight right who the fuck did he just choking judges fuck out of who with that who was it who do you just choked out someone really good dumb kid that they fed okay see here you know that's not Goddard who is it it's the bald teller which bald feller so here's so here's it's hard to tell who that referee is I can't see the face so lose Mon in them they're they're not changing lose my cracked him who is it was it Christy Oni I know two referees I know three no it's Leon yeah okay well for whatever reason what was God our thinking though I don't know what he was thinking and then he shade online at John Anik What did he say seeing your Comte was off so was annex the my commentary was I know okay I don't know what I did just say I didn't say anything bad about mark Goddard I said I disagree with him standing up I don't know why he said the commentary is off but Dominick Cruz did say that he can't wrestle and the reason why he's standing him up is because he can't wrestle Montmartre Godard yes no he said though he was saying that about mark Goddard correct you say that reference he threw shade of God right I have nothing but respect for Goddard although I don't agree with his decision in that fight I do not agree with stand-ups I don't like stand up I like guarded I think he's a great referee in that moment he's wrong well he's probably very hard listen your job is not to intervene right trajectory of the fight right job is to protect the fighters knowing fuck up Iceman's biggest fight of his life by Stan luck because what happens this and we've seen it well happens we stood them up and worldly goods you know what finally I feel good knocks him out right because how are you got it can have like them yeah it can't happen What did he say about me he didn't specifically call you out he didn't call you out what do you say yes the only thing wildly inconsistent is your and your COCOMs commentators regulation observation of actual events I will Bob Joe Rogan's ass that's wrong that's so rude I didn't see the only thing wildly inconsistent is your and your COCOMs recollection and observation of actual events I'll save my side for later well that doesn't make any sense recollection of actual events I don't know what he's trying to say there and COCOMs I didn't say anything bad about him other than I don't agree with the stand ups but Dominick Cruz said that he can't wrestle and I don't know if Mark article wrestle I know he knows how to referee I know this compared to Dominick Cruz he cannot wrestle tommix fine to say that but also John annika when harden the paints awesome yeah yeah you are way off but wildly inconsistent is correct because Herb Dean is the gold standard in my opinion and Herb Dean even though he thing with Robbie Lawler is controversial I kind of look at and I go the arm went limp I can see how I see that I could I think it's unfortunate and it may have been a mistake but it might not have been a mistake great I I'm still I'm still I'm not at all not a look man his job is fucking way harder than mine a hundred times harder heard herb team's job is to protect the fighters and to stop fights and to make calls I don't want to be that guy that gets fucking hated on and never loved curb never gets low and likes it's love but with mark daughter don't be the guy okay a little John replied he said I always try to be respectful we just call it like we see it too but there's an arrogance with which you deal with the fighters commentators and many in this sport yeah and I find off pudding whoa one man's take and I'm quite sure you'll give yours too for everyone to hear what a manic world stone okay so I believe John Eck referred to the inconsistent between each referees decisions of when to separate the fighters and John said exactly that's what I was referring to that mmm that to of the consensus before best referees of the game would handle those two situations so differently I understand the athletes are different but there are parallels to be drawn John is 100% correct or percent 100% correct Matis bra mom I feel bad that mark Goddard responded the way he did because it's not very professional and I think it's very emotional and I think he's probably just feeling the heat yeah yeah hard on them yeah you feel that heat you get angry you know but I like mark Goddard I like him a lot I think it's a very good referee top one and two reps in the business I love mark Goddard he fucked that up my question is I wonder who is telling them they should stand things up when they shouldn't stand things up and wonder pressure heat the pressure he feels from the audience you think the crowd mmm maybe it could be that British people are very nice you know sometimes in English people that you don't know in a deal with me when you got two world-class wrestlers and this guy's impossible to take down he's one the best of all time yep let it go let it go well I think let it go period I just I do not agree with stand-ups because I think if a guy can hold you down like this I was saying about Ben Askren if guy like Ben Askren you can hold you down and give you know gi's until the fight or something yeah do something about it exactly it's not cheating no if he's not cheating keep it up do you know how hard is to control Woodley on the down inside fucking minutes so you have five minutes to sink a choke in five minutes to hold onto him and beat him up and look look all credit to us Mon he didn't even fucking care he gets to back up didn't complain went right back at him and took him down again again he's a monster way cool story bro he is fucking hard to deal with man for Colby for everyone on the planet Earth but stylistically when you look at the fight for Colby I look at what Colby does well yeah he does that he does that the thing about us man is he's got power he's got striking he's got wrestling but even maybe more party hearty oh four days here I was behind the fucking Bank fault it's Fort Knox get in there how adorable was it him with his little daughter oh dude I almost cried such a baby too I'm such a pussy that I've kids me too me too I know how cute and just how happy mom and why for reelection oh they're like peed in a bad video the world you imagine what it feels like to have your husband win the fucking world have you world wealth ROI title going to beat tyron woodley no I can't my wife take a hot fuck out of here my mom sure as fuck gonna be in the cage hey man I feel like when someone wins like that they could do whatever they want me Carter's mom's always in the cage his dad so she's not she's not true thrown out prom okay listen man and who's mine I feel like he's only like what is he 31 or 32 how old is usman 32 he's a fucking Sammy the champion scared me he's not do you see how busy is in person of course your process but when he's not cutting he's Palm Beach toilet what the fuck you doing how much do you weigh I don't know we're the same size he's fucking huge well it gets you stood in sizeable he scared me yeah well he's but he's big like a super athlete not like a bodybuilder right where's my face Koosman like when you look at the way Tyron is big tyrants more thick like his legs or fish important yeah tyrants fuck yeah I look at the height difference look at his fucking back look at all look how tall he is men and and why'd you look scary we're always like what we're arguing he's a monster that the face paint thing was a last minute decision to Susie had to do his face Susan the makeup lady she I do his face she's the best she was the best she's such a nice lady she puts there to make sure that they had the right color paint you know to do the Nigerian flag face dude he might be champ for a long time there's great matchups oh my god welterweight is so fucking hot and don't sleep on Mozgov doll folks you know Jorge Masvidal still is capable of beating something Emily fucked up cowboy mas Badal is the real deal I was if I dare until ban he's my Dark Horse yeah I think so I think so unless he goes 85 but he's a motherfucker you know what happened in that till fight with Woodley he didn't land a single significant strike in two rounds he didn't round anything in the first round he didn't land anything in the second round just understand that this is the big show this is the world title shot you come out to fucking Neil Diamond Sweet Caroline the whole deal it was singing along wonder if that's London but but but he lands nothing alright well here's this Woodley threw one punch at five rounds no that's not true shit happen no was a really he was very tentative he well he was doing the smart thing a smart thing is you wait and you counter because Woodley so goddamn fast that smart thing paid off when he landed that big right hand dropped him and then the other problem with Darren till is that on the ground on his back he didn't have anything didn't have anything often use wrong short for sure but if you can move you've got to be able to there's something to protect yourself and something to tie you didn't see the choke coming that also could be because he was rocked look if you look at the way he dispatched cowboy insanely impressive have you look at the way he beat Wonder Boy also impressive him Wonder Boys a world-class striker don't forget me try him wonder boy who's been wonderful it's a hard code to crack he's a hard code to crack yes and especially if Wonder Boy has some time off to recover and some time gone through those two big five round three five round fights the five did till fight was a fire round site as well so those are hard man they're hard on your body hard going through training camp and I want to say that I think Wonder Boy had a knee injury to that he might have gotten surgery on and his hand maybe but I might have made up to me the point is one of the welterweight division is fun as fuck fucking every division so on his mark Banta might just opened up with pedro muñoz heavyweights got a crunk now - yeah Johnny fucking Walker yeah dude okay Steven 1 Thompson said his moving was out the window after Darren kill kicked knee kick out ok he's also saying that he doesn't think that those kicks should be allowed which is crazy for someone to say that kicks people in the head was spinning wheel kick yeah ok it says it was almost like to do is trying to put me out Thompson told Ariel Helwani yeah yeah but he was definitely damn cage fight he hit me in the knee and after that my movie was pretty much out the window is more focused on keeping my knee it was just another thing to think about out there well that's a strange attitude you know means because he came from a karate background and not a Muay Thai background on the tops on the show Thompson said he was unsure of targeting the knee with that kick like that is legal well I will tell you it's legal it's definitely legal liquor so are heel hooks which are way worse I mean do a spin because hopefully it's nothing major but it sucks man it really does disappoint about the whole situation and coming out of it with an injury like that it only makes it all worse he has a fight coming up yeah Pettis oh that's right so he must have healed it up or got surgery or whatever I don't understand that I don't understand that kind of thinking I mean I don't mean he said I was trying to hit the guy hard it really was I was just saying unable to put myself in a situation do so and the reason for that is because he kicked your knee and she's a technique yeah it's technique John uses yeah it's a fucking legit technique it's good occur you said yes Romero look I don't yes and Romero use it against weird that's where we first got it yeah but yeah doing we doing that and he went right out a little store you fucked my knee up in the first fucking second fine listen it is it is just as valid and maybe safer than kicking someone in the head it's easier to do for sure then kick hit someone in the head but so what if you can kick someone in the fucking head with a wheel kick that is the worst thing you could do to a person when the boy has no point just point yes sad about the fight yeah it just it's unfortunate but again I think a lot of that is because he came from that karate background and he came from above the waist style karate background initially you know when Duke Rufus was cornering his brother Ric Rufus when Rick Rufus fought I forget the gentleman's name from Thailand the I think Lawrence Kenshin has it as the most important kickboxing match in history goddamn I forget who that because we realized how critical because this was in Rick Rufus was in his prime he was the man he was the man I mean Rick Ruth the jet he would do wild shit man jump 360 turning side kicks to the face he would hit guys and knock him out with hook kicks and front leg ground here goes Chang try this named Chang Phuket eaat song grit I fucked that up I'm sure I would have said it Duke would have said the name perfect but at the point is at the end of the fight after the Thai gentleman destroyed Rufus's legs and stopped him Duke who's a world champion himself said that he didn't think that it took any skill to do that because that's how a lot of those Thai guys thought he watched the end of this man watch the end of this can't walk he could barely walk but watch they say go ahead and this dude's comes out he goes he knows what to do he just back to taxi know what to do how it hurts man this dude's a beast two of the guys in this dude whack just fucking those legs up hands up high and just whack look at this dude who's the ref well they didn't know any better in there that's they did it back there was crying the ref wore a fucking karate D yeah the refs got a black belt oh yeah he does look at that wack candy-ass yeah those those leg kicks and that was it so afterwards over Duke who I think was only like 19 at the time said he didn't think that took any skill obviously Duke doesn't think that now he evolved and became a world Muay Thai champion himself it's just ignorance but that sort of stuck there he is right there like a young babyface Duke ruefully play it so we could hear him say it so I give him said not touch anywhere else in the body you know I I think you know that Ric should have won the fight he had the guy out there are three major fouls but it's the way of the cookie crumbles tonight he said later that he didn't think that it took skill to do that but which is that style is so good the Thai style is so damn good it's so good yeah well the Thai style with the other techniques is the best if you got that Thai style but you know how to throw sidekicks you know I'll throw everything else wonderboy yeah Jonjo yeah John John John Jones just don't know fucking throwing everything are some wolf kids it's very interesting watching him man he's doing a lot of sidekicks now and spinning back kicks turning tonight to take slam to the body mm-hmm yeah he's thrown a lot of sidekicks he's he throws a lot of everything man but he fucks you up he's just and he's so good at keeping guys in the back foot just dis man just taking away their arsenal I want to say this though because this is something that's coming up and it's actually kind of pissing me off what's that there's somebody there's a bunch of people that have been saying should Anthony Smith have take have like laid down after you took that Elam illegal knee and and won the title who said this Ariel Helwani a bunch of other people said it I think Ariel was suggesting or asking whether or not he should have some beta male shit well it's crazy because the guy should be praised for he ate the knee he was okay and then he wasn't even thinking about quitting yeah I didn't go through my mind in my mind someone might do that a Smith before no hasn't it was even a thought no nope nope it wasn't a thought I don't agree with and I wasn't like oh we should all give him praise for this I think no why would he do that well that's that's who he is but some people like let's be honest and I think jail Sun will probably admit to this if he took that illegal knee he might say that's it can't go on sorry leave it don't wait and keep on yeah yeah I mean you get the win you get the title you get a rematch I could be wrong chill might disagree might say no I'm a competitor when I'm in there I wouldn't wouldn't think that way now that is not now his agent yeah but the bottom line is like some people were actually actually suggesting that that that would be a good option that he was the many people who suggested I saw several peon and that the fans went hard on these people that suggested it like you're out of your fucking mind we're out of your fucking mind he's getting out class that'd be such a bitch move well unless he actually couldn't go on yeah but we all saw he could yeah yeah exactly Smith right do you think at least miss stock went higher now yeah oh shit no he stopped fired for sure and he looked very good in the first round the first run looked very good John's take down the fence yes very good very good John started figuring them out and John John is so good at forcing you to fight his fight and for in and and being first he's so good at being first first with the kick first of the punches first forward you know he doesn't give you a chance and that's the thing with anything Smith anthe Smith's chance was to always be first if shanthi Smith fights prior he was a bulldozer to you genre that's what you do cool and put you on your back foot mm-hmm you go first not a mine not a my night I'm gonna go first he all the Smith was defensive the entire time yeah and fight he just took away all his tools he also fought very technically in the first first round it was really didn't just showing Adam Anthony oh yeah for very technical John actually in the first round got a little wild I felt like he almost felt the pressure of being a you know - eight hundred favorite really you think so who never seen John thrilled while punch is not for sure he's trying to come out there they went you know what this is easy I thought recalculate and then dismantle yeah I mean he's the best of all time by far are the best but whoo-hoo-hoo in that division can fuck with him now I mean yeah which is look Santos is a wild card that motherfucker can knock out anybody I would have liked to see Johnny Walker not below his shoulder out celebrate he's fine though what listen man he could move his arm he came in the back and they'd even their weight I think today but in the back after he went I'm actually good now okay so what that must have mean that must mean that he dislocated it and then they popped it back in place so it could be fine or there could be some significant tearing inside that allowed it to dislocate and that could be a problem the few let's say it's fine though let's hope y'all not find John Jones yet he hasn't wasted listen Phil that dude up with stem cells get a bunch of needles in there I'm fucking on Frank liqueurs don't do all the fucking no no worms you wanna bro yeah don't know give him cortisone to give him some stem cells Santos is an interesting night for John yes he's interesting because Santos throws fucking nuclear muscles at your head and you know he did stop Jimmy no matter why he stopped several guys that light-heavyweight he looks spectacular like every way he stopped Anthony Smith and their last fight at middleweight I I would imagine Santos is almost a bigger underdog than Anthony Smith um I would imagine that too but I would imagine that he's not going to fight like Anthony Smith is he okay was it say I'm fine I shoulders not too bad not too bad is not a good thing to say I just need to do some exams and check to be 100% sure that it was nothing serious okay that doesn't mean it's okay because the thing about shoulder tariffs and this is coming from someone who's had some shoulder issues they it feels alright until you do something weird then it hurts and then you like fuck and then you get an MRI and then they look at it and go you got some tears in there so it's sometimes it's not shit I've had program like dude I'm fucked I can't ride shoulder than two days later like right let's do that's usually likes or tendons or sore muscles just doing the worm yeah but he fell face-first and landed on the shoulder weird I'm sure he's done doing I don't know I'll just post fight speech yeah he's like Mickey Mouse yeah he's hilarious yeah he's a real character he's a character when you work on his English but ya go far motherfucker has some power flying me yeah I was grilling for everyone and I lost track of time you know he did the TV from my backyard and I saw him I saw him go let's get it on I just fucking dropped everything and sprinted cuz that motherfucker knocks two seconds yeah it was his third fight in the Octagon but he's fighting Nisha Sakura off who's a real 10th man he's a tank and he's got some serious grappling skills chokes the shit out of everybody choked out Pat Cummings in his last fight and he chokes the fuck out of people but you know Johnny Walker let's watch it real quick I mean fucking mm but the thing about Walker's he's so loose he came into that fight dancing oh look at what's the thing how what's he like when someone takes you down and we're in the third yeah we're gonna find out he's a brown belt in jujitsu though yeah watch this see he slapped his own arm on the ground like let me see that again just jump on this his left arm it's his left arm that hurt so watch this he goes down yeah Esther has a great photo god damn he's lying there he's like ah fuck I hurt my arm he's gonna be fine look he might not be fine dude dude let's wish for the best I'm wishing for the best listen I'm a family guy I'm wishing for Santos but fucking there are so many videos of football players celebrating touchdowns and blowing their ACL on our knees yeah it's he's like hey get a doctor so he got up and you know what's interesting is I was talking to one of his his teammates and they were like you know you see how loose he is he's like he's loose for everything that's just how he is with life just walk out dancing you know stripping no he was a dancer I think in Brazil Thunder Down Under Brazil style dude he was a good shipper to this boy probably made some money well he's a he's a real interesting addition to that division and I'm vision finally has some life back in him santé him who's the other dude dad stud which guy drank like number 10 I think all the way light heavyweights killing it yeah I know what you're talking about that's good yeah fuck let me see the division he's top 15 top 10 let me see my tail a little bigger dude okay yes domina grass yeah Dominic Reyes is a monster he's super athletic too the thing about Dominic Reyes is super smart super athletic and he's nine and OH undefeated him in verse Johnny Walker oh yeah so many good matchups out light-heavyweight with the young guys rays is a really good athlete the thing about him that separates him from everybody else it's like he has a background we do you have a background in football was that what he was there what was his uh I would say Johnny walkers probably more athletic than these guys so pretty so much in the way he moves so get weird he's from Brazil's name's Johnny Walker it's named under whiskey yeah weird yeah who knows with Johnny Walker whiskey not just do a deal now I know right jump on board before this gentleman becomes a champ yeah have him wear a Johnny Walker t-shirt and shit now again light heavyweight will be so much better the same thing happened welterweight if John Jones goes have fun boys and goes the heavy weight right which military now these guys are beating John very well could happen well John might fight Thiago next and if he fights Thiago I mean look John wants to fight five times a year so here we are in March it's uh you know March 2nd he wins John easily could fight in May or June will fight in June a bit easily April May June 3 months from now yeah easily ok I D technical support for ok he works at an IT technical support hello NFL see you're right on the Rizal kryptoflex dreamt of playing the NFL but didn't he play for high school he played in high school in college drafted offensive back here for the Wolves okay so yeah played football Oh at Stonybrook okay so he played football and then decided to yeah well still what still excellent athlete all got the fourths didn't get drafted yeah but for football smartest Anders he's super healthy yeah and smart as shit yeah you know that's the thing we've talked about this before the difference between the level of athletes between the guys are going into the NFL and the NBA that they're there that the height of the height dude why watch the NFL Combine there's guy was 63 230 pounds ran a 4-3 in the 40 to the forty introvert he's a wide receiver doesn't the best footwork you've ever seen as footwork like Dominick Cruz it's it's mind-blowing there's a defensive lineman ran a for 440 a big fat dude that's insane that's so fast to 300 pounders rien plus sub five-second 300 pounds sub five-second for that's insane that's insane that's so fast of you I don't know why bring this one everybody have you ever seen the guy he's won the 40th day comes out in sports he's got so much dick it can't be healthy pops out any false no but he pops up and goes because guess what happening us my dick fell out man and they pop it is this fat black let's see him go go oh my god he fell on his day that sucks it in in no replay they slow it down that is so fun look at the size of that guy when they redo it let me see dammit he decided to fall down to cover his own dick it's crazy that he's so confident that his dick is tough he went let's say break it down oh Jesus there it is pops out like god dammit dick fell out again imagine imagine what it's great imagine how many women you start blowing up his DMS like I mean when your dick falls out while your runner you cave it contains these Knights of pants what must we laugh biggest moment of life dreaming of another rod explode sure sturdy pair of compression shorts every dude does I get it let's go again this is something I'm not understanding about dudes who are not wearing compression shorts with a cup like a diamond mmm a cup in the NFL oh no an MMA oh my god you get nut shotted like that when guys Deverick a regular cup on like how how do you have a regular cup on in 2019 how do you have that when you can have one of those compression cups and you're not gonna get hurt sometimes those cups are uncomfortable they're so yeah they are fuck yeah they are you know what's more uncomfortable getting kicked in the nuts I don't get it Kenny Florian used to wear the tie steel Cup and here's the thing I don't think the tie steel cup should be legal but because it is legal oh yeah it's a nasty fulcrum but not only that but even if you're you accidentally hit it you're hitting a piece of metal like why is it okay to have a piece of metal you could break your foot and a guy can do something to you and slam that metal into your face I mean some weird shit can happen and you could break a bone I mean there's there's many opportunities where guys like how about this a guy shoots in and the guy hits him with his hips right you could hit him with your hips and catch that steel cup right your fucking mouth it would break your face remember matryona Derrick Lewis with his hips remember that I thought he hit him on a right hook or so no he said like he just sprawled and knocked him out really Wow I don't remember that I remember eesti in like 13 seconds he hit him with dab but then he hit him with some punches too right at the end but still the hips what fucked up megistus interesting crazy yeah I really think that those cups like a diamond MMA style Cup should be standard and I think Diamond MMA probably has the best one I did like him when I was fighting just because they're so uncomfortable right I'd rather you hit me in the day I don't think the diamond ones are that uncomfortable just bet it's not we have one here we'll give it to you you won't try it out but you don't give a fuck anymore like gene Simmons and kiss yeah he's got one with teeth on her or something those uh steel cups them some dudes used to wear those in jiu-jitsu was horrible cuz they get on top of you they're like if so many more Alice did you and they grapevine your legs and dug that fucking thing in your chest dude how about fucking us Minh fucking great vining Woodley yeah yep mounted him yep and then and then um I had my boy Todd Feldman over at my house he goes could there be anything worse or he goes that looks like a bad position to be in and I turn around went excuse me sir the worst there's nothing worse in professional sports then in the UFC when you get mounted the international TV in front of millions of people and you just it's the most kind of beta male move of all time yeah on your back you can't get up right hands on top of you yeah it's the chest it's so embarrassing and he's helped something worse he's held him there for a long time all your buddies are watching on damn oh and you know the interesting it didn't seem like tyrant had the energy to get him off like he didn't even hip escape correctly he knows how to something was up with ya so yeah he looked off well I don't know if that was it or he's just wilting under the pressure that was fun was putting on here's why and I'm not taking anything away from loserman I think one of the greatest title fight performances of all time of all time maybe the best oh that's fine you want every minute of every round to annex and against a guy who many people thought was in the running to be the thought of as the greatest welterweight of all time top two and if he won that fight especially stopped him I think you could put him in that category so we both agree Holland as if it is yeah where I thought he might be off is right in the opening minute remember Guzman shoots Woodley grabbed a guillotine and he falls the wrong side again there okay John it well will champions don't do that mm-hmm he's not there mentally also he kept holding on to that I was like my god he's gonna get Vaughn flute and I think the only thing I think we're calling - Oh s P now OS p it's a OS p sorry bond flu but OS p has more von fluke oaks than anybody kind of have to call it the OSP I'm didn't say pill but then but when I saw that with Louie we kind of invented it right did he invent that choke I doubt he invented it I want to know if he invented it because if he invented it you got to give it to him true let's call it though SP though way cool so you went for those p choke yes so he goes for that choke but that would least level to do that in the opening round to it he's not ready yet he's mentally not firing right now that's that's Whitley being a black bone jujitsu you know the greatest fighters of all time yeah like you ever seen George st. Pierre make it mental not like that never no never not in a world title mine ever so I saw that what a Woodley's off you might be right about him having one foot out the door because being do we figure out if he's 36 or 37 it's 37 a month so basically 37 basically 37 doing all that stuff for TMZ I want to say he opened for Wiz Khalifa recently if they have a album together oh shit where's it gonna come on show we're working it out right now it's so high it's gonna be awesome it'll be fine come in my companions past these these fucking backwoods ones when do these these are a problem I was so high that was Jones had one but it was only tobacco folks um yeah but but both with wiggly worm say one foot in one foot out agency to say cuz in in hindsight because eventually he was gonna lose ya before this he was doing all that stuff right he beat till he was doing this stuff he beat Wonder Boy twice he was doing this stuff so I don't know well or it was just a bad matchup but we we were looking at these points he had off night yeah he does too much stuff outside that gun was just a bad motherfucker I think it's all the above was absolutely bad motherfucker and who knows he might have been able to do that anyway even if time was in perfect condition but here's the question tyrant over the last few fights over the last few years has been able to control the pace of the fight a hundred percent he controlled the pace of the Maia fight he controlled the pace obviously Darren till fight was a good easy victory for him relatively controlled the pace of the wonderboy fight fought smart and then hit him when he wanted to with big shots and he was the one who had Wonder Boy hurt right but wonder boy was never pressing him like making it's forcing his cardio but if you go back and watch them some of the fights where he had problems earlier in his career and they've collected Nate Marquardt like Rory MacDonald it's someone pushing him someone pushing him and this you know this might he might have figured out a way to look when you're that muscular and he's fucking ridiculously muscular I mean Tyron has legs the size of running backs his giant ass musculars fuck to them yes but who spends longer longer it's different like it's not it's not that stacked a jack dents almost powerlifting muscle and that muscle is one of the reasons why Tyra is so fucking fast and powerful but it also you could make the argument that that muscle just comes with an unavoidable price and that what he's been really able to do is jack is conditioning up as high as possible and then also do a really good job of controlling the pace of fights he couldn't do that with this woman good point could be so we don't know I feel bad for the guy I'm a fan I want to see if he wasn't a hundred percent focused I want to see him one more time focused with loose manga prom like with with was pseudo and TJ mmm-hmm cop behind the air stopped early alright rematch for sure rematch other guys where it's quick Cain Velasquez JD has quick rematch let's do it run it back mm-hmm when you get out class for 25 minutes and there's two eight ten rounds mm-hmm it's tough thing to get there's no way obviously like riding much yes so tell me CJ you could you could really call for a rematch in that fight the UFC is gonna make woodleigh's path to that title shot a fucking nightmare man who stopped that fight so who don't TJ who stopped that fight who's a referee in that fight was that herb no no who was it so Leon Roberts was the one who separated Demian Maia at Robyn's lon I thought wonder say Roberts was it Leon Roberts no gentlemen forget his powerful haircut though hmm so you run that back though because early well he's a tough sell they're the biggest names in that division especially they decide to do it at flyweight they're the only names in that division except Joseph Benavidez Benavidez who also won he beat so who dough in a split decision he there's a real good argument for him fighting for the titles well sure but that fight was so controversial and so hyped up it would I would like to see that Friday 3 matches yeah right but don't you think if anyone deserves B Woodley how long he was just fuck yes reigning - right but I all say the same thing about Stevie Miocic steep a super was the motherfucker for years he's the he won more title fight defenses than any heavyweight in the history of the sport he's number one most successful heavyweight of all time beat nothing but world champions right beat nothing but world motherfucking champions Alistair Overeem Fabricio Werdum Joe Santos Orlovsky world motherfucking champions and you know and then fights in Ghana who's fucking terrifying beats and Ghana guy can't get a break you ain't get a fight why can't he get a fight because in a Cell pay-per-view that's crazy the only reason the world is a terrible place you could do steep a cane uh well canes gonna have to get another knee surgery now is he for-sure how did the way his knee went out how was it possibly heard anything man it's knee I have not you don't think it was a knee problem thing was the uppercut I've heard a knee update I haven't but I haven't asked you know I could probably try to media see his ass be see his team would have really something because his team said something really ridiculous that he didn't get knocked out that he got hit behind the head with an illegal shot first how do you and I do love crazy post Xavier Xavier must been maybe had a few brothers ass dude and I like the house bullshit well we were saying we watched that punch and it didn't even land it landed on like the shoulder yeah like off the shoulder that short shot yeah I just did a food truck diaries on below the belt with Francis and he showed me the exact punch yeah it sounds like people are saying say he was not happening yeah here it is Cain Velasquez lost a freak my knee gave out on me but now there was it wasn't him it was Javier Vasquez said it was an illegal punch she's got to take the loss back you want back first of all it's not an illegal punch when you're swinging on the feet it's illegal on the ground if a guy is swinging and the guy ducks and you hit him in the back of the head there's not a single referee on the planet Earth generation right there's not a single referee in the planet Earth that has ever said that's bad not only that a good percentage of head kicks are illegal shots in the air behind there a lot of wonderboy shots the wonderboy likes that sneaky question mark kick he throws that shit behind the ear so his Barboza's show this cowboy comes right over the shoulder whacked but with Cain that this that's not even an issue cuz that punch didn't land there right the issue is the uppercut the lights off which causes need a buckle right but here's his really know he was punched if there was a knee problem with this with this kind of dilemma about his knee his team would have reported he's going for knee surgery there's a trial there's not yes they're just like uh alright let's just move on so you do steep a care well holler at your boy he might be in a position where it doesn't want to have any more knee surgeries but his needs a week come on no no but I'm saying if you got hit with that punch maybe in another world like his knee wouldn't give an out like that he was just kind of rocked he would have just got rocked maybe maybe but him verse debased the fight by two good fight I'm sure steep a would like it but I mean what's deep a really wants is another shot at DC not happenin bro maybe thinks that that's the way to get to DC UFC would have done it if by now yeah there's a million reasons that do it DC for also for DC it makes no sense he knocked him out so fast you can't get any more impressive than that it's going Jose Aldo Conor yeah right right right I fuckin starched and what do you allow everything to lose now yeah you want me to do so DC or DC's get Brock and probably right off the sunset although Australian tell Francis he needs to let DC just do his thing dip out yeah he can become the heavyweight champion yeah and DC's looking for like a big fight in that set that mean apparently his coaches have already said look you've got a real legitimate career as a broadcaster and he does he's excellent as an analyst do him a Nanuk are the best I love it they're the best relationship and I'm not don't shade at Dom I love doing it with Dom - I love doing it with Dom I bet not as good chemistry well we know what it is it's a weird day and I are silly we're silly Dom's not silly I mean DOM and I laugh a little but he's like uber serious where he's next like when Rose namajunas one and he's yellow thug roadie see he sees what he's fun man you d see an annex the best commentating team on the planet when it's you and Dom there seems to be this weird dynamic where I don't vibe with it really I think a lot of people are on board with that that's interesting because I like it a lot again well it's not bad but I'll at UDC and Anakin but Dom without you even with you he's amazing he's with us but before it's just not as good mmm okay I get it um it's just I I agree with his corner though I would like to see maybe one more fight at DC and then look he's got his wits about him got his brains he's fine he's amazing person like when you hang out with and talk to him he's a sweetheart of a guy the best any Qatar great he's very articulate Dean and as a wrestler unparalleled I mean his skill is understanding of the game as a heavyweight you cannot use the greatest vault Dean Dana just did did he Dana just made that argument he said I think the DC is the best of all time that's fair you can totally make that argument it's never lost starched eBay was the best of all time yeah but he's only fought once in the UFC at heavyweight other than this with Frank Mir but dude when I was in the strike force yeah grandpa yeah insane insane tinny fight um wall city fight at heavyweight in the UFC did he fight down Roy he fought Roy right Ryan Roy was in the man Roy in Frank Mir yeah and beat both those guys yeah but wasn't gonna beat the breaks off both yeah and then starts to pay well I think without cutting weight he just feels so much better that's why if he's gonna fight John we gotta do it a heavy weight oh I know how light-heavyweight goes get out yeah you doing it heavy weight what do you think happens in every way I think DC has a chance baby I'll put my money on because DC can lock bitches out of heavy weight he's he's the one who can land on John he gets dirty do you think that John would want that fight do you think that would be that could be like a giant fourth of July fight bom-bom-bom why don't you and I called Dana White and say we would like to take over the matchmaker occasionally just we would like like a celebrity matchup sort of deal let me get my beak I don't want to take anything away from McMann and Shawn Shelli those guys are great but just let us let us make five fights a year do you hate writing well we'll help you do you hate money promote the shit out of go make your posters we'll do what we can here's what you do uncle D what do we do you do DC John heavy weight for the world title what's the undercard Frances Brock you really think Brock's gonna take that fight Brock wants the title and that's a wrap he wants DC DC's almost terrible DC's only a little taller than me I know you know he's stereo don't let him fool you yeah looks small and like like your dad you know but he'll beat the shit he'll beat the shit out of you he's a tank he's as wide as a house I mean you know dude Drock once dude Brock Francis picture the poster just take that in pitches the hospital bill picture Brock's the remaining years of Brock's life I ask Francis Sebastian why because I don't I don't I don't chase I chase nobody you're not serious people did the funny thing is you standing next to Francis is almost like me standing next to you he saw I did I pick oh did you so we're on the curb I go stand here dude you're like huge free on the internet he's so pale excuse 265 natural I asked tonight what do you walk around that so he said he was 60 65 60 do you ask him about wrestling mmm a little bit but you know with those food truck tires I try to get a little sailing have fun look at that with Francis he talked about how he kind of felt like a loser after the Steep a fight well there's no no way around it was fast enough I know assassinating conversation saying I kind of felt like a loser now he didn't feel like himself and now he felt pressure to take the fight he was not ready how well is he like talking you think I could get him on do you think it would work be tough yeah be tough he's getting better in English though because when I first interviewed him I remember way back in the day when I first when you had the dreads I first interviewed him he was having a real hard time understanding me but he's definitely better at it now he's getting better and you know yeah when he loosens up you'd be tough to do two hours with you Dana White says Daniel Cormier is getting the Brock Lesnar fight yeah but we don't do that today this post is from an hour ago Laura to do with Brock Lesnar post he said it at the post fight press conference yeah I saw that but there's no announcements Wendy Cormier is fully healed from his injuries oh he's got an injury yeah he's been injured what's going on um I forget he had a problem his hand before the Derrick Lewis fight decided to take the fight anyway and because Phoebe offered the fight that's why he's like dude I'm injured I'm not gonna fight you when I'm injured guys like Derrick Lewis that my must make feel like shit first IPE he must be like God don't you feel bad for Stevie yeah cuz like if Daniel Cormier wasn't injured he would have got that shot like if his hand was okay he would have got that shot in New York but now Stevie's never can get that shot dude how about John Steve I feel terrible yeah I like gems here but I feel I feel terrible for Steve Bay I really do we do because I mean there's no how long has it been since he lost the title a year yeah a year how long has it been and and he's tried to fight June 2 26 my god 26 so she's fine yeah I wasn't here he's fought twice dude more than a year February February 5 July Oh what are you talking about do you not know how to count no he was I dare you I didn't cut what do you say to 2600 ok how dare you but still I'm dare you make that mistake you will have C to 22nd okay well that's July way so that's not quite a year DC's been relevant he's fought twice since that loss loss too steep he hasn't fought damn it's heartbreaking damn John Jones Steve Bay coach Javier Mendes can understand why Stevie Miocic is waiting yeah he needs to move on it's not happening I don't think he necessarily is waiting for it though he is he even wants it he wants it but I don't think they're offering him a valid fight him in the meantime I haven't heard any big fights that are there being mentioned but I mean obviously I could be wrong you know well the only thing they could really offer him is one it's funny I have all these questions and I don't ever call Danny come on I don't call Shelby I don't call Mick mater I just in here with you we talk shit we just speculate don't start rumors is total speculation it was interesting being on ESPN for the first time that was interesting how so different yeah look I'm holding an ESPN handle on the microphone you know it was interesting and knowing that it's on ESPN it's very exciting it's very exciting to know that it's on ESPN now because I think that's gonna make a big deal with casual fans I think it's gonna allow the sport to grow agree um and the ESPN fights were spectacular they put on a good product they did it what's cool a job when I turned on ESPN I do every morning Thursday morning is they had a picture of Bryce Harper who just signed like a 3G killing dollar deal with the Philadelphia Phillies and John Jones that was the flyer Wow like it's mainstream that's giant like Fox could never do that no no Fox was great and Fox put the UFC on the map and I think Fox really did a fantastic job over those seven years but there's a it's a big difference going to ESPN is like holy shit we're on ESPN it's like for sport deals didn't go to any fucking sports part ESPN is always on so every fight is on and they're gonna have a shit ton of fights and if you have ESPN Plus you could watch all the old fights you know bless at the bottom just a scroller say John Jones like breaking news ESPN Inc 60th L mixed martial arts league Oh interesting what's up oh that's the that's my boy Seth I think they have something like ten events for the year right now okay that is excellent that is excellent that is so good for for MMA it's so good ten pfl events in 2019 outstanding they do the line across espn2 espn3 or tazing ESPN plus fantastic so good so good for everybody I can't believe Vinny Magalhaes lost I was so so so sure he's gonna win the whole thing I mean he's so fucking good man when it comes to the ground game is it like the Freak he's a freak he's not a light heavyweight on the planet ESPN also just signed Tyson Fury really interest so now you're not getting Tyson T longer I heard about that what the fuck is that about what what did what did Tyson say something crazy like why would he fight him again when he got robbed of a decision in the last fight I heard that I was like is he drinking again dude dude how about this how about this how about Showtime my boys they had the trailer they had the hype video ready to launch on Monday Tyson signed with ESPN Monday morning no one knew nobody fucking knew I feel bad for Dante it's a hard break I feel bad for de'aunte because de'aunte almost put him out in that final round you know in I think you can make a real argument that Tyson won the decision for sure but when you get dropped twice and get dropped one time in the most horrific fashion I mean and now they say the fights not happening that's crazy it's the biggest problem boxes Oh like so angry that makes me angry that is there's different promoters that's why the UFC jump frog boxing a long time sorta but I mean look that fight could have been made do you think didn't want to fight him again nope I think I think it says his handlers his is his representation go dude let's sign with the SPN get a seven-figure deal you can fight two bums and then we'll circle back to wild well man is boxing maybe I mean there's argument that that's a good move financially I guess it's heartbreaking heartbreaking right here oh here it is I want to cry oh I want to cry that's a it's so fresh but it does open up Anthony Joshua Tiant a Wilder which is very little but yeah I'm nothing no time soon cuz Deonte still gonna fight in may-maybe Dillion white maybe Luis Ortiz yeah Luis Ortiz is still fucking dangerous dealing White's a motherfucker yeah so then you know yet Anthony Josh should be great but he's fighting a baby Miller yeah and that's a tough fight for him big baby Miller's got some fucking power mmm you don't think so no that's a Madison Square Garden to right first time Anthony Joshua's fighting in the United States though yeah when you fight in United States do you have to our fuck Tyson Fury Wow Brazil X that seems like a fake name it's like he's a former football player dude's name is Brees you call Brazil oh fuck Dominic Brazil boxing's in May my mentor is so frustrating however that Mikey Garcia or no Spence coming up that's amazing pay for that when is that March something am i in town we should do final thing over boxing we don't have any fight companions for boxing right give me excuse to hold on sorry that's a good one to do it what does it say Jamie what do we got Oh daddy's home daddy's in Miami but you said it I mean probably sort of a business week yeah and that's a week next out of it yeah fuck is it already March crazy dude this this year is flying by January we're gonna see 85 years old before you know it we're gonna be like Larry Merchant over here talking shit everyone Larry Merchant said to Floyd Mayweather I was your age I'd kick your ass classic fucking class it is a ridiculous thing to say greatest boxers of all time oh he's fucking such a crotchety old dude though it's gonna be us one day 85 years old Khan fights today you think we'll still be doing companions oldest fuck yeah yeah well someone's gonna drink themselves to death on a live show it's probably gonna be Eddie I'll have a heart attack we said we should start bringing in two other people too occasionally especially when Kalends out of town cuz counts always busy days yeah but he brings the cheese the nothing's like the four of us though the chemistry with the finality yeah can't fuck with it no it is the best and it's the most fun by far is the most funny one tries a different dynamic yeah but they're talking over my god tried to listen to it you did I tried to listen to side with you dudes I want to know what it sounded like we were talking over everybody it's terrible I'm good that's drunken hyn a long time it was awesome there's people for whatever reason love those kind of chaos shows like that Alex Jones Show they love chaos they love it they love strong and stoned and an interdimensional child molesters and fucking they love all that shit they love it off the charts nuts dad Alex Jones one though I told you I've never been a fan of his then I watch them like gotta like him now people mad at me more some people are mad at me but you know there's nothing I could do about that they're gonna be mad at me anyway but one of the things that they were saying was you know fuck you for they were saying even if I thought you weren't for normalizing him I'm like you can't understand that's how I know him I know him like that that's how I know him I know that guy yes that guy that came on here and this is a guy that by the way on his show said he's gonna kick my ass and break my legs and fucking all kinds of crazy shit and I want to fight it with UFC fight I'm a offer I'm a million dollars like I I knew I knew him I know the real him I'm like when we're not in front of each other you could say crazy shit like I'm immune man I don't care does he bother I don't carry him less he's doing an entertainment show he is doing entertainment but but what I know is the Alex that was here and by the way he was right about a lot of shit a lot like crazy shit they were saying about about fucking human pig hybrids that they're working on those and actually making human Pig hybrid fetuses that's real they really are the problem is he throws so much shit out there at one time I don't know what to believe exactly and you gotta go state start start over again but what's happening on the moon he's for sure crazy yeah but he's he's crazy but I think that crazy is OK and it's entertaining and I'm not a fucking child so if you want to nerf the world and make the world so that only children can watch everybody cuz like make make things that that their own that are safe for everyone including children well I I don't want that I'm a discerning adults I'm pretty rational and I can figure out what's real ones nonsense dude speaking of children did you see the Michael Jackson I did not but I heard it was horrific it's crazy you know Tim Dylan is so fucking funny you see Tim don't think nobody chef Dylan is pretending that Michael Jackson was a pimp and he was banging bitches goat was good his Instagram Tim day if you had Tim on your show is that the big guy yeah no think of the comic yes no dude you know your mom really I'll have money any times in town he's fucking hilarious right yeah he's a funny dude listen to this there's no fucking music in it the whole thing is fucking boring it's all fucking interviews I fast-forwarded through all that shit I want to see the bitches the guy's the king of fucking pop you know he's fucking all the time he was fucking Elvis's daughter Lisa Marie Presley you know neverland ranch was just fucking pussy cuz they're trying to make him look like Oh some humanitarian oh he helps it kids he lets him sleep with him we get it he was a good guy and another thing so there's this scene was it kind of half listening apparently some kid walked in on him fucking some bitch and the kid knows like every one of his moves everything he was fucking to his said what kind of sick kid sneaks into Michael's room while he's fucking a chick it's kind of crazy see that's the problem with Kansas where you can't help kids word to the wise help adults it's a ridiculous guy Matt you got you have a Manju he's very funny she's super into conspiracy theories Lizzie yeah deep in he brought me a book so he want to bring you back bring it back to the fold but he's a smart guy really yeah dude when he said oh when he had him on he said to come it's a brutal job yes someone said oh why is Brogan having Roseanne on again Roseanne she went on Candace owns all the meat you girl bunch of hoes and they were all just sound sex to try to get successful hilarious Rosina's give a fuck especially now they forced her average good good but they fucked up so hard kicking her out that show was number one and now like no one even cares little on their I don't I was in market they might keep it on just for spite just so she couldn't say I told you so but we know no one's watching yeah fuck Don's watching it yeah I don't want to watch that Michael Jackson thing first of all it's weird come on not alive he's not allowed to defend themselves so Gregor's it's also stories and you know people tell the truth and stories sometimes and sometimes they don't and you don't know you don't know and and also there was you know it was always weird like people no one knew why with all the rumors that everybody had ever heard about Michael Jackson that anybody would let their kids go and hang out with him like when you watch the documentary like these parents are fucking moron I don't get it man two of the fathers have committed suicide since we don't have any hard that he was molesting kids right oh we have his rumors well here's the thing horde he was he was acquitted here's the problem the doctor his very doctor said that he was chemically castrated I'm not the guy who killed him yes yeah that guy said he was chemically castrated by his parents to protect his voice I had no testosterone right exactly not just no testosterone but he still loves nuts I mean me I don't think so one of the other weird things I saw that was like facts you should hear no from the documentary was that he had some something to do with the sound in the room he the hallway leading up to his bedroom was wired so that footprints would make a dingdong sound in the room just a very strange thing to just have in general for any purpose but if you grow up in the spotlight because remember he was such a big star you might have some anxiety right maybe didn't want to be walking I'm naked or something or or what anyone walking in well yeah touching boy this could be that look who the fuck we don't know we don't know however what do you think Jamie I know I'm just saying some of the facts I remembering he spent like thirty straight nights with like a twelve-year-old at his house in between the kids mom's house in his dad's house they're divorced and their son would hang for some there's so much video there's so much video for him and this little boy holding hands and the boy in the video goes yeah we would hold hands and we had a signal we rub each other's palms when we were thinking sexually about each other Oh however you gotta chalk it up to the shitty pants cuz if John Legend came to my house I was like dude I love tiger you mind if I take him home for a little while but get your goddamn mind right you're not going and John Legend's not a pedophile no I'm just not known but but they didn't know Michael Jackson was that everybody knew there was something up not the time he was the biggest star in the world back then in the now everybody knew some was kids yeah cuz he loves you younger than us wait yo you gotta trust me sure likes a month on new something was up that yet he's more on the ball than you so he's always online you're off getting pussy James online legit point looked it well well played okay I just feel like it's too weird it's too weird to let your kids hang out with this grown man all those times he is mentally ill day and what his family says they don't know no a lot of you are confusing him for being he didn't have a childhood his dad rock writing this child think that's so in side he felt like he's nine years old so he missed out on the sleepovers and video games so he would get friends with kids and I think that's Adam it's batshit crazy batshit crazy I think all those things that you're saying are true but I also think it's true that he was probably chemically castrated I really think that's true because I've said that a long time ago I said I think he's in castrato the waist is voices why why tell him that it's human nature it's just that voice is just not a man's voice it's not even a falsetto Jojo woman's voice castrated then when he would have zero testosterone SS yeah yeah well he might not have been doing it because he was horny he might have been doing it because he was just weird well these kids said he was busting nuts the kids in the video said like you would Jack himself off in front of them boy it'll make you sick to your stomach not his wife but the woman that gave birth to his two kids said she never had sex with them yeah that's more likely if you're chemically castrated that means your body doesn't produce any testosterone anymore but it doesn't mean you can't shoot it into your body and you know you could shoot tast into your body but if you have no no not you're not making semen you have your balls are dead but you didn't semen or sperm just having sperm from the nuts and then like your prostate there's some other things that get the juice together the whole thing's fucking two years it's weird it just makes me sad basically so sad there's like there's a there's a lesson to be learned there in so many different ways but one of the big lessons to be learned is that you never want to be that famous that that was my takeaway I was watching Mike Riley I go can you imagine being that famous and she goes yeah by awesome I know hold on you know how we like to go to the mall we go out to eat that's gone you can't do that anymore yeah that's all gone that's all gone people would look to start a riot so take that take that away from you yeah your normal life is not over you just stay in your house buddy yeah that's why he developed an amusement park he made his house a fucking an amusement park with yeah they'd had they set this up for him to go grocery shopping they had a fake the emptied a grocery store had paid people to be shoppers so he could have the experience of what it's like to be normal well you're like a Ralph's or whatever yeah we're this is well they should make it realistic so he hired people I don't know how he could do that any wore a hat and he's dancing around it's absolutely everything was weird man everything was done feel bad for him though oh yeah so how much he's worth I don't know 1.7 billion dollars they say but that's after he died see the things what he died he got super rich he was actually in the hole before he died no because because am i broke where when he talked to MCM he's like what are you talking about I think there's like you know publicist broke where they released that you go bankrupt means I was fun I was balling hmm I think is Michael Jackson how you he owned the Beatles catalog oh so that's where he had all's money he bought all the originals the Masters of his in the Beatles mmm that's right yeah Paul McCartney was mad about that apparent when he told he gave me the idea Paul gave me idea he's like a good idea oh I'll be right back so buddy why didn't I buy it he's got money can afford it right he has one fifth fourth of the Beatles money not all of the combining right do you think how could there's you there's no stars like Michael Jackson now you can't wear I can't do any current society hmm there's there's pockets now he also unhappy birthday he owned happy birthday he bought the rights to it that's why you weren't you're not allowed to sing in the rest I feel like that's over I think you can say it yeah yeah now cuz it's back into the public dying line or maybe you after you die dude that's why everyone sings the bullshit happy birthday happy happy birthday ASCAP or BMI could literally come in and find the restaurant yeah yeah that's cuz a Michael that's so stupid dude what a baller move its copyright only happy birthday I want outta money me too bad he doesn't like bitches cuz I'd be the biggest move ever maybe just like bitches who knows no it's Betty the guy's dead you can't defer have some respect shop here's the thing those two dudes who are doing it they were one was the key witness when he got away in court what dudes the dudes in the documentary the two uh-oh we got molested the one was the number one key witness who's saying he didn't get molested okay well then house shouldn't be able to say anything both of more quit because that means they should go to jail and now they're like well no that's not true we were young bitch yeah well also like isn't that perjury it means you lied in court be fucked you can't lie in court either way one way or the other you can't lie to protect somebody and you can't lie to accuse someone either you can't lie I don't know what the deal is I mean that seems like that's something they could drag him to court for and the Jackson came out went well isn't it convenient you guys are coming out now when you're in financial trouble ah of course yeah of course it just seems like a strange thing to do a documentary on documentaries are killing it lately that's good art Kelly yeah he thought he was flying free yeah come on bitches it's not good there that documentary came out he's fucked yeah he's Foggs arrested yeah they just released him do you see when they released him like he leaves jail and he has to walk through a throng of people and they were screwed someone was yelling I'm calling her they took his music off iTunes really they took down all the shit and all the artists who worked with him took their music down like let's say let's say Michael Jackson did get convicted of molesting kids could you still listen to his music could you imagine you separate the right you know Tony Hinchcliffe I don't want to give away the bit yes a fucking hilarious bit about that he has a hilarious bit about life I bet yeah I bet he's redoing it now because I don't think it's on the special and his last special I don't think it's on so no I heard it yeah dude tony has cliff he's got some fucking he's got this new bit about transgender athletes what does it say their day care affiliated woman who bailed our Kelly out of jail receives bomb threat it's a mystery woman bailed him out him he's looking like shit mmm spend stressful time fuck yeah mmm we're gonna do so uh

Preux and nikita Krylov that's right increased for heavyweight now he's alive Khalil Roundtree junior Eric Anders would that's a good fight great that's that's a under-the-radar fight on tilt jacks and you know what Johnny Walker knocked out Khalil Roundtree - with elbows full from the jaw and kahlil's a serious striker Wilson Hayes alejandra put a little fact about Cleo Roundtree you know I used to be over 300 pounds really used to be fat as fuck that's crazy because he doesn't have any loose skin I know some guys they bounce now good uh he was young and he was working in that MMA fucking warehouse well that's the same thing with David Gardens David Goggins of the Oh he bounced back - whoa look at him 2010 and 2016 that's only six years six years challenge Majan he break up with him went six years later he's jacked dude I'm peace look at that boy I'm just tired of you being all fat getting on top me and I can't breathe it's over Khalil he's like what's up bitch six years later big fat dick still dude knocked out gokhan Saki with one punch he's a beast that just shows you like how crazy powerful Johnnie Walker is man ridiculous ridiculously proud you do with him next yeah take it slow give it him good fights don't kill him don't give him a TV no no the TV pisses me off does he why he's so good and he you know he he's not Torrey Anderson nobody's given Corey Anderson any love how weird is that I know it's weird you know and a lot of people say it's because he's not stopping people he's just winning yeah but he's winning ways fuckin Beatty beat Latifi see you're talking about the TV and not talking about Corey Anderson no it's a collapsing Corey we're sorry Corey we're sorry but fuck Corey's a bow hunter too yep that must be fun but fuck that how about how about vana watch Johnny Walker there's another one on the house Dana White well that doubt is a possibility yeah Jimmy man was dangerous I know so who's Johnny Walker Aries power Jimmy man it's great that fight with Thiago Santos was chaos for as long as it lasts it's amazing yeah Johnny Walker Jimmy Manawa yeah sign me the fuck up whoa any other brain-busters whoo how do you feel like Dustin Poirier max Holloway plays out max always so goddamn talented so not having to cut at 45 anymore it's tough fight for Dustin Dustin you know I love you I'm glad doesn't got a big fight mmm super what's interesting is they offered the fight Tony Ferguson turned it down hmm but hear about this Dustin Poirier stops pedis right then he stopped Pettis right um he stopped justin kgg who else did he stop that was his last fight right but he hit those two but those are two world champions there was another one there was another fight in there or he stopped somebody else wholly different animal who else did he stopped he stopped someone else it's Alvarez Alvarez Alvarez knows fight yeah I mean those were three like legitimate champions I mean I know just engage he was a champion in the PFL before it was a pfl right would they call back then World Series yeah so he win he beat him he beat Pettis EBT operate and this is this is that light heavyweight jump you know and he also beat Jim Miller I mean damn his last fight was at 45 against Michael Kors that 5555 it might have been 55 with Michael Johnson that was before Johnson went 245 Johnson 45 some other trouble he's a motherfucker yeah I mean I'm really excited about that I'm really excited with that for you he wanted to paint fighting he got it yeah he's got an interim title you have any idea why Tony Ferguson turned it down I do not know I have not talked to Tony Ferguson mean maybe it was because hey I am the fucking interim title holder why would I fight for the interim title again max Holloway though yeah I get that but I mean he already was the interim title holder and then they just took it away from him when he was a prat I think it's really fucked that really comes back and beats pedis here's what's fucked up is now if the winner max always Dustin Poirier is guaranteed a title shot yeah so Tony's still not gonna get a shot yeah they were trying to do cowboy versus Connor and apparently the the sticking point was that it was going to be a co main event how dare they I think the idea is that they have to have world titles as a main event certain pace says who that's my it my wild west DW get your head out of your ass you guys that's the main event shoot my text said I don't have schnapps my heart sorry heart did he blocked you I think so I actually like the guy we have no problem I know I try to get you guys together I gave it my best shot I gave my fucking you tried man yeah no stand it man it's weird when you have friends that don't like each other you know when you good friends with both of them yeah and they like fuck that guys look alright to tell you but I don't I don't talk bad about it no you don't I criticize something like you'll see decisions cuz I do a show but didn't have no issue with the middle I like that though I mean look part of the thrill of these things it's got to be ragin al cowboy was in my office yesterday you know him white said he wants a fight is ready to fight again White's fight against looking another opponent for maybe rage now Sid did not specify who's trying to be fighting next so it says mm-hmm dude you're telling me Connor was like no I'm not taking a fight if um co-main event why in the fuck would you make that a coming up yeah said he beat cat could be out of action until a fall McGregor could be you know the other things McGregor has a fun so long the other fought MMA it's so long good laughs I was kids last fight was khabib right but he takes like almost two two years off right he fights khabib he gets smoked by khabib and then he has how long was that November was a long time off it's not good no he needs to be active like really act it's hard to be active when you're making that much money how fast a problem the whiskey the whiskey and they made like a hundred million dollars off a full Mayweather fight he's making buh-buh-buh-buh-buh papaya whiskey I'm proud of him yeah he's doing great tight look between you and him I mean him while he's in the middle of his career and you post-career I mean you guys have laid some interesting blueprints for fighters so yeah the it was October October 2018 that's quite a lot long time ago that's not good it's not that far November December January February five months ago it seems like a long time ago that isn't it but he has nothing coming up so nothing let me fight took me another year yes but that was his last fight yep in two years before that was his previous fight yeah it's not good it's not good especially if you want to be creme de la creme you just can't fight like that I think he's only interested in big fights like things that excite him now you know because he's got so much money and so much success it's just one of those things can you blame him but here that look at that that main event the main event of that fight was a non-title fight Conor vs. Nate Diaz that was non-title and but the last one the the fact that it was a non-title fight it was also the biggest pay-per-view of all time dude whoever recommended that he be Co main event against cowboy she kept her mouth piston [Laughter] well I don't know who that was but I believe I can fly yeah alright let's wrap this up before your voice goes out we did it dude there's no way I'm doing stand-up tonight no holidays everyone yeah you can't well everybody
