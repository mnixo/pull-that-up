ball-ball boom Brian Moses you are one of the saviors of comedy I want you to know this honestly truly really because a roast battle roast battle is like one of the last real like sanctuaries for horrible comedy like nasty people fucked up but hilarious comedy and the way you do it will you make everybody hug it out at the end and you you know and you like set the ground rules no violence this is just joke writing this is all this is just boards don't hurt us when I first came back to the comedy store was like how many years ago it was now it's like five years ago or something yeah the Exile was over and when I saw Rose bottle it was one of the things that made me go wow this place is different now this place is change it's like it's evolved we brought like um like some like what a fight culture back to it you know what I mean yeah you know like where if you have a problem you know we're in a place where all we uses words anyway so do get out that way yeah well not just that there's people that don't have problems with each other and they this is like devastated friendships yeah they ruin friendships yeah I mean but nobody's ever attacked each other so that's amazing yeah because I've been there couple times I stopped going it makes me feel bad does it it's consensual everybody every symbol I have fucking I'm the commentator for the UFC yeah Andros battle makes me feel bad that's the combat sport you don't like just stop and think about how crazy that is that's nuts why how was that possible sometimes it's so mean sometimes people say shit that's so mean you like I saw I saw there's a joke recently by a Jimmy Carr and Megan gayly and Jimmy was judging her and she was battling a puppet that's how crazy the show is so this girl's got like a half hour on Comedy Central she's she's brilliant and Jimmy said some snide to her and her response was I wouldn't fuck you if you raped me I was like that's I can't believe I've ever heard that before in his response to that was oh you can say funny things oh wow it was gorgeous I wouldn't fuck you if you raped me let's break that down yeah I would have to be like this while actually hmm I'm going along with that balls previs yeah let go along with that one why not I don't know yeah I mean you're not fucking some of the rape you know no gay it's not consensual right you're not giving this back because it makes sense all right get it yes yeah I get what she's saying it was just so hard those like damn I wouldn't fuck you if you raped me god it's just that's hard and a lady said that to a man and oh it took him a couple seconds to be like I'm gonna let this happen there was some senator somewhere and they were talking about rape and he actually said that a woman can't and unless she submits he a man can't actually rape her wait what unless yeah yeah unless she gives into it I like she taps out like yeah I'm giving it to you there was something along those lines like it was almost like saying that she kind of wants it why I remember that yeah there's it was one of the most pervasive misspoke of course oh dude they made Mario Lopez apologize for worth at the babies shouldn't be trans my my comments were ignorant and insensitive because I want to keep my job at E all right exact is you should added that you should went dot dot dot because I want to keep my because I want to keep my job that's really all it is three-year-old trans babies what the fuck some Blaire white who's actually a trans woman had a hilarious quote she goes three-year-old trans kids are like vegan cats we know who's making the lifestyle choices oh message home and she's trans right which is doesn't say it she's free free like a bird I mean what age ain't three should be in your 20s or somebody should be even you're like enough Duncan adults a full-grown adult right three-year-olds what's man camera cut off what the fucking government they don't want us talking about trans babies is it dead dead camera tie the cord died oh hi everybody um yeah I mean we live in the weirdest time in terms of like progressive ideology right dogma genders a construct races a constructor and bring it all down but race is not a construct because no one's been successfully translational oh that's true never never been pulled off even remotely not even ninety merconis until yeah but you can go black to white like Dave Chappelle used to do it all the time memories do that all right yeah yeah you could you could do black to white nobody cares you used to be able to white to Asian you can't even do that you can't the transformational you could probably go Asian to white people really hold on to this race thing why is that why do we hold on to I don't know I don't know I don't know that makes I don't look at you as like I mean I don't know what you are you're just a tank you know I'm mostly Italian Irish 1% Asian 1.6 percent African sitting I don't even have that I'm just like a nigger from America like I'm just American black well it's if you can't if you care that much like varieties interesting I like that people look cool like we were talking about Blake Griffin mm-hmm like it's interesting that there's a guy like him out there yeah big ol giant dude six foot ten albino looking probably got all kinds of shit inside of hands of shit but I mean like when you meet a guy like that you're like wow that's a different type of person look how big he is yeah yeah like Shaq like comes around UFC fighters there's a photo of Shaq and he was training at American Top Team with my friend Dean Thomas and Dean is like I guess teens like five-nine five-ten and he's standing next to Shaq and Shaq is standing next to Junior dos Santos used to be the heavyweight champ it's like his child looks like Shaq's child cuz he's so small and Shaq still like what seven foot like he has a trunk at all he's fucking he's a legitimate gigantic human being I mean he's fucking huge I like the fact that there's people that are that are different it's cool it's interesting you know the real problem is racism the real problem is not not that there's variety the variety parts interesting it's also like me this new racism you know like there's so much of the the canceled culture and then you know you can say what you can't say and it's it's like that's not scary racism like it used to be right I think people are more scared about the the silent racism then like you know that over you know aggressive racism you like the lynching in the 50s and 40s and you know before well we all know that that stuff happened less than a hundred years ago which is why it's scary when you see photographs like those black-and-white photographs of the families standing around why there's a black guy hanging from a tree mom yeah and then like that that is not that long ago no so that that shit is still in the air down there yeah but now this new racism is like you know you can't you can't talk about trans kids you know well that's not racism but yeah it's it's well that's just what that is is a thorat arianism they're just trying to enforce a certain way of thinking behaving and they they go hard on anybody who deviates poor old Mario Lopez nicest guy that's ever lived doesn't have a fucking controversial bone in his body he's like well I don't think kids should be trans I mean they're little babies they're like what you insensitive it's cuz they can go after him for something like that and he'll act we ask he'll give in that's almost like backing into like that old segregative uh like I guess like you know Jim Crow thing I remember like well another blanket oh my Emmett Till but remember when Emmett Till gets killed rice because of you know he's doing a he's saying hey you look kind of pretty or he's doing a cat call to a lady right and then this woman goes and tells these group of dudes it's like hey and they're just like oh we got a cancel Emmett Till you know what I mean so it's it's almost it's almost the same thing I'm not saying it's that you know aggressive and violent but it's it's the same thing of like you can't say anything you can't have a brain I guess there's a there's I want to say I get criminal thought now you're having a thought right there's thoughtcrime yeah yeah I mean that's the or well shit right this is what people are deeply concerned about its authoritarian reinforcement of their own particular way of thinking and behaving and it's because people have the opportunity to complain now like if if you just didn't like the way someone addressed women or someone you really didn't have a way to broadcast it 20 years ago this like you just but now anybody can just get on Twitter or Facebook right and it can go viral and a bunch of other fucking pink haired weirdos will retweet you and next thing you know there's a goddamn mob after Mario Lopez right I mean that's that's what happened it's interesting though I mean it's it's weird to watch it all take place especially from our business because comedy relies on taboos and in a lot of ways like they're reinforcing us they're helping us because people come to us for relief yeah thank you yeah thank you yeah keep the keep the PC culture going honestly it's only making us more money it's making us more accessible really has never been more PAC oh yeah they people coming in like they're looking to hear those things oh they're so happy when against the grain when you go hard in the paint they go crazy love it they love it yeah bring on oj bring them back oh geez fucking Twitter have you been paid attention guys don't follow it Joe I just think you can't follow oj on twitter that's crazy I follow him do you fuck yeah why because it's great Doug Stanhope and I back in the day when we were hosting the man show we had an idea for having LJ Simpson at the end of every show Oh Jay Simpson would be like Andy Rooney and he would like break down the problems in America is what I think about things hey Twitter world and so that's what he's doing he's literally doing what Doug and I wanted him to do on the man show but he's doing it all on his own like he was talking about the debates he was is it just me or does tulsi and Andrew yang are they the only ones that are following the rules I'm just saying following the reason give me some volume well go to the beginning of second here hate Twitter Ross my favorite part hate - of the world is it my imagination that Yang and gabart are the only two who know how to follow the rules of this debate I'm just saying he's just saying voice of reason but wait he can't even vote he's a convicted felon oh right uh yeah so yeah even involved you can't even vote because he wants to know where everything's going I mean that talks about the NFL Draft he talks it he's got a lot of sports talk on his Twitter telling people they should get paid more and you need to you know draft this guy bring this guy in and so he's a GM now are that you know think there's like you could you could have done some stuff like he could have embezzled some money and went to jail and got out or maybe didn't file taxes like like if Wesley Snipes who went to jail for tax evasion he started talking about politics or you wouldn't carry like that's right no but you killed two people Oh Jay and allegedly he got off for that joke come on killed two people I'm saying he killed them he killed two people how'd you think it's wrong what happen to Ron Goldman nobody even talks about him no nobody gives a fuck yeah they talk about the wife yeah all the time they never talk about the other guy he was like 25 and to fucking wait or man yeah hanging someone sunglasses back whose side dick he was bringing the deck right right place wrong time was he bringing the deck was up has that been proven they were sleeping together right that's what it was is that true that's the bemy that's also rumor allegedly we don't even know we can't even ask him yeah I have no idea I'm trying to find a killers right old little world deserves like a holiday he does he really does here Ron Goldman day today I'm Brian Moses Joe Rogan's episode I knew his sister back in the day really yeah yeah she's to come around the set of news radio I knew her from back then she was very nice Jim's devastating though it was like knowing someone whose brother was murdered and you know you're hanging out with her it's like it's always in the air you know it's always in the air yeah that's like she had like a pin with her brother's face on it I should bring you some like black barbecues it's a lot of sisters there's a lot of you know brothers but the difference is it's ultra ultra public rise pre-internet right yeah that was the biggest thing today oh my god it was I was watch the the verdict with my girlfriend at the time we're sitting in front of the TV and I'll never forget when they said not guilty my girlfriend put her hand in her face away oh no no no that's crazy to believe it she couldn't believe it no summer being like I was like it was either elementary schoolers middle school I remember the verdict happening and it was like a split verdict my teacher who was white she was like devastated and like all the black kids it was like me and the other kid we we were so happy were just like yes we didn't know any better you know I mean we're just like we're just happy cuz a black guy got up because of what happened Rodney King were just like this is redemption that's how many people felt about it they felt like the Rodney King thing was so fucked up that I mean the problem the Rodney King thing is you only see the end I mean he led them on a crazy high-speed chase and there was fights and they ride he was a big fellow and he was on PCP yeah so swinging for the fences and so they had to beat him down apparently according to the cops but then you know a piece of you like makes your bones stronger doesn't it no it makes you really like impervious to pain though okay I had a friend who got his finger bitten off when he was on PCP I never didn't feel it until he woke up I don't think he remembers cuz he was so fucked up but he was a boxer and he had his of his toe removed his not his but not his pinkie toe or not his fat toe the big toe but the one next to it and put it where his index finger was on his right he moved his toe to his finger they moved a total finger and curved it permanently so he could throw right hooks oh isn't that performance enhancing no no not at all I would shake your hand he would give you like the little the the little finger oh oh because they don't make it so it can bend again it was just bent like this forever so if he was punching you know that was the only way so when he opened it it would stay curled yeah yeah he's a hard man and he was doing PCP doing PCP at the time these were hanging out I use my boxing coach though he was a madman yeah legit bad man that wouldn't that be performance-enhancing taking PCP like while being in a fight because you should beat out of you yeah yeah yeah for sure but you'd be too aggressive you would quite like if a guy was a time to make you a better fighter I mean you wouldn't want your opponent to be on PCP because they would have no fear they would just come charging at you and they might be able to just fuck you up just because that if you panicked but if you were a seasoned fighter and a guy at peace he was on PCP he would just come charging recklessly you just crack him as he's coming in and keep moving and he's LAPD eventually his body would wear out your body could only take so much yeah until becomes mush there's a lot of people that believe in themselves and they get flatlined yeah a hundred percent believe myself you gotta fucking believe in it bro if you believe you could achieve mmm not really you know if you believe in yourself at Frances and Gahan who punches you in the face you're going into the spirit world yeah or like eight cops beat you down like for like eight minutes yeah yeah with club what clubs it like metal club yeah there was that pre tasers too did not have tasers back then so that was after the the choke uh because you couldn't show guys out anymore so that's why they said they beat him down because they couldn't choke him out really yeah they couldn't choke him right they put a ban on chokehold yeah why did they do that because they were killing guys oh they were saying guys were on PCP when they weren't on PCP and they were like literally killing dudes were they killing them with their arms were they using a nightclub I'd stick one got killed with a stick I think yeah that was in the second case was a guy who uh like naked choke you know them I know I did kill the guy with a choke in the ring No killed him in a gym he was banging this guy's wife oh he really went for yeah it was crazy he was banging the guy's wife and he invited two got into school and then choked him to death and killed him and then was driving the guys car around town that's cold-blooded and they arrested him yeah he was a interesting character he was a fake Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt my friend Eddie Bravo called him out wait a minute fake yeah it was fake he's a fake black belt let's go tell everybody was a black belt and Eddie rolled with them I remember him coming back to me and he's like that guy's not a black belt I got what you sure and he goes dude he don't know anything like it was too crazy it was like he barely is like a white belt you can get killed doing shit like that I thought maybe he was doing it because he was maybe who's just being nice and wasn't going hard and he goes but then as time goes I was really this kind of snow what the fuck he's doing and so they didn't calls him up and he was like hey are you are you a fucking black belt like tell me about the I said well you know I'm a black belt in Japanese jiu-jitsu stop stop stop stop are you a fucking black belt and it's like this big pause he's like bro you're a fucking liar you're a liar so Eddie separated himself from the guy and then years later dude wound up murdering somebody what yeah yeah would you Jitsu yeah I murdered the guy would you Jitsu no son the guy well you know I could teach you how to put a choke it in five seconds it wouldn't take long at all yeah I could teach you how to do it just wrap your form underneath someone's neck clamp your hand to your bicep put this arm behind the head squeeze you could kill somebody it's not a hard thing to learn but to actually apply it to someone who knows what they're doing mm-hmm you'd have to get you have to be really good but you can't just no one's gonna let you choke them but this guy didn't know anything so I think he snuck up behind this guy who he killed and just choked him choking to death it's not like there's a murder I think he brought the guy to his school under false premises he's in jail now sure yeah shut up to that guy yeah it was weird because I got uh I got semi involved in it in that the guy who wound up ratting him out to the cops was one of Eddie students and I was talking to the guy on the phone about it I was like what's going on with that guy and then the cops called me afterwards and said hey we were tapping that guy's phone we want to know what you know whoa whoa I'm on the fucking set a fear factor I'm in my my trailer Jesus yeah gettin puttin my microphone on mic huh you were a murder case son I'm like hey listen I don't know that guy I go this way I know he's a fake black belt I told him the whole deal and I had heard that he killed some money but I wasn't sure if it was true because the guy's so full of shit this is how full of shit this guy was this guy had a friend drop him off in the woods because he said he was going to Akuma take karate contests like a big karate competition but it was it was no rules and it was secretive so he dropped him off in the woods where was this guy from I don't know I don't know but he lived in California for a while okay dropped it dropped him off in the woods with a duffel bag yeah he gave him a duffel bag like you had a duffel bag with rather mm-hmm it's like a duffel bag that's just big enough to fit a trophy in it yeah right think about this Bing so he leaves goes out into the woods the guy comes back the next day he's got a trophy no duffel bag so he brought a fucking trophy with him and then he came out of the woods like a I want fucked everybody up and like so this guy would he thought this guy would tell everybody yeah that he beat everybody in this karate tournament this guy's a hell of an actor he's really I mean he really commits he was he was one of those guys that's not feeling like crazy radar because he's a friend of a friend so I was assumed you know I was fucking 30 years old I don't know any better it was dumb and I was like I assumed 3030 yeah aren't you fully cooked by them now you think you are you think you are you haven't meant enough murderers yet shit you have to meet enough really legitimate crazy people to have them in the database we like oh oh you're fucking you're a sociopath oh well what's worth it worse a psycho or sociopath mmm sociopath to someone who doesn't care about someone a psychopath I think is someone who violently attacks people but in many ways they're interchangeable like let's Google that what is it never seen a sociopath in a psychopath because I think a sociopath can have no violent tendencies but I think the idea is that they have no compassion for other people right like I have a friend and she thinks her sister's a sociopath everybody thinks that every is a fucking sociopath these days that's like a hot right that's the hot word these days like calling somebody erases right wants someone to not see exactly yeah mmm the quick thing I pulled up well put it up yeah you explain exactly what it said but there's just like a Venn diagram it's so it's a better explanation by the way every woman who's you know who's gonna hear this good he is a sociopath so there's something in the middle there's like you could be both so genetically predisposed Psychopaths genetically predisposed like my parents with a psychopath what's happening with the screen there buddy should connect again Oh even better okay lacks empathy like a psychopath medically predisposed lacks empathy and guilt convincing behavior look how they spell behavior that's I was in ieaving Kenai tonight but look how that spelled behavior oh yeah with the IO IO you are higher job success why it's okay antisocial personality disorders can form social relationships and treatable that's the one in the middle okay so the Bozzio path environmentally influenced feel empathy and guilt erratic behavior struggles to find keep chops wait a minute I thought sociopaths didn't feel empathy like it's the same hmm path does care sociopaths would feel no guilt about hurting a stranger so how is that thing a thing but it's not the same the same thing does it feel that they feel empathy when you look at that chart it says sociopaths feel empathy whatever close we kind of get it sure I feel like a lot of you know stand-up comics is is as much their narcissistic they might they might also be sociopaths you know I think a lot of people they get to a point in their career where there's they're trying so hard to be successful that they it becomes all about them right like it's becomes such an obsession and the the narcissism is so strong that all they really care about is their own good and their own their own success right and they'll fuck people over that's that's a fact I mean yeah I've seen it yeah it's kind of sociopathic yeah have you lived it a little bit we should keep it on the hush yeah yeah we can't break it on this one yeah we'll come back for that one we'll do that when the camera sounds wrong yes those experiences you know when you find it when you start getting a little bit of success and it's not even much right it could be anything you get a development deal right and also in people like mmm oh yeah there's people that equate good things happening to other people as bad things happening to them and that's the narcissism that's that yeah that stream egomania right extreme extreme narcissism and obviously you have to be yes has to be something wrong with you most of the time not not a hundred percent of time but most of time to want to be a comedian right absolutely something's gotta be wrong yeah because this is like your ego gets too kicked in the dick every day you know especially in this town so just taking that every day you have something a little wrong with you yeah yeah and no better way to see it than the goddamn open mic nights bro I don't I can't go anymore I used to be able to go and just watch but now it's so fucking crazy it's just I can't especially The Comedy Store because now there's a crowd now that I mean back when I mean I remember when I was like coming up there was no crowd it was just it was just your peers open mic nights are packed yeah pack yeah like with a real audience yeah yeah like that's you guys are stealing there's people that are fans of comedy now that want to see the process really yeah is that what that is yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a wonder that change podcasts oh that makes sense we started talking about an on podcast and next thing you know I think over the last like six seven years you start to see people that are like I want to know what it's like what is it because they love going to see like headliners like it right if you love going to see the fully finished product you want to see what it's like to see it's almost like going and watching amateurs fight like I'll keep an eye on them maybe one day he'll be the champ I hear that but then it's also I mean there's that bad I feel like fighting yet you can kind of see somebody style here and there but with the comedy you see that everybody style you're gonna see a young guy was probably doing like a Dave Chappelle type of thing the guys know like a do a Jim Gaffigan captain thing you know Joe Rogan kind of thing you know a Mitch Hedberg kind of thing yeah so that's just what open mic is we're gonna see a bunch of copycats did I figure it out you can't just do that but what's cool about it is you go from that and then you can go into the other room like oh you can go into the main room and there'll be a real show going on right Kildonan yeah so you could see both on the same day like you you really can't yeah go see a real comic yeah you can see open mic night and then at the end of the open mic night like Chappelle shows up and pop up all the right dice clay yeah all the time so you literally watch these amateurs and then boom of like a a world-renowned professional shows up you're like oh that's the finished product we get it now yeah they're never gonna be I mean that's crazy because that's the guy but somebody used to be I mean Chappelle was an open-mic er we all were open my curse when you start like 88 I was 21 21 okay yeah he was like what 14 when he started he was a baby yeah I don't even get in um I think they'd let him in I didn't know you could get in I thought you had to be 21 because they are yeah and so but it turns out there's like our law where you can be I think in Massachusetts you could be 18 with like a note to perform at a nightclub they said to make sure that they didn't serve you alcohol when I met Dave I think Dave is like four or five years younger than me and I was 23 or something like that he was a baby seventeen probably yeah the cat's rising star catch rising star in Boston are not in Boston in New York yeah yeah I was already passed a lot of clubs by that point um he must have been he must happen he was onstage and they were already talking about him like that look at this young kid like so talented I remember the Silverman Sarah she was telling me she's like I remember when uh Chappelle got Mel Brooks's one of the last films the men in tights it was like a big talk in New York it was like hey that nineteen old kid just got a note Brooks the out deal Wow the world was a different place back then yeah it was it Isaac Hayes was alive yes true yeah so a different time yeah there was like you guys were scared to AIDS this is the nineties right so yeah so AIDS was big you couldn't really fuck anybody you need the first time I got an AIDS test I was so nervous really oh yeah it just was a slide show every bad decision I've ever made every time I never wore a condom was just going through my head cuz everybody was convinced there's it was funny because at the same time Kinnison had a bit mm-hmm where he goes like they say Sam they say AIDS is a communicable disease straight people can get it to you'll name one fuck you it's not our dance and people were so you know people were so mad well nobody I know yeah but I was just you know we when it happened I remember in my car Joe I was living in Boston my car driving and it was listening to the radio and Magic Johnson had a press conference to announce that he had HIV and it was like a scene in a zombie movie where the first person got bit and I was like oh my god yeah it's happening holy shit I'm like Magic Johnson with all his money that guy's got HIV yeah oh my god were fucked we're fucked I remember thinking that and then it was probably like a year or two later I got I got a AIDS test after magic got it two years later I mean I didn't have health insurance I forgot there was like they cost money back then oh yeah yeah thanks now they're just free yeah well now they want people to not get AIDS or people just get a sometimes just get the free health care really yeah there's I mean I've this is this a rumor on the street of her in the gay community cuz I live in the gay community not that I am but I'm saying I lived there because it's clean in song with gay people right exactly there's nothing wrong right anyway uh and a gay neighbor because it's safe it's safe oh my god too safe yeah I just worry about you know anyway uh boy I drop your keys when you're naked I'm gonna go outside naked anymore Joe but yeah they they say like yes some guys would just get it to stick at the free health care this before Obamacare there's a thing called bugchasers mm-hmm do you know what that is mmm it was gay dudes that for whatever reason look a lot of people are self-loathing right there's people cut themselves people that tattoo their face they hate themselves for whatever reason and they punish themselves well there was host Malone hates himself tattoo on his face there's gotta be something

bug chases were dudes that for whatever reason for whatever reason they they wanted to catch HIV they wanted to I wanted calm bugchasers they would literally go out and try to get it why I mean they hated themselves he wanted it oh this is a real thing yeah this is okay this is like like black kids would be like the death by cop thing yes yes yeah not just black kids you see that video recently and the guy was running towards the cop with a knife and he's fucking screaming and yelling he's like don't make me shoot you he just wanders other starts unloaded on the guy suicide-by-cop is super super common I did not know that yeah I thought was just a good thing no it's a it's a real common thing but uh bugchasers were I mean maybe it's still a thing but now AIDS is dude AIDS is the apple of diseases it's the Oprah diseases honestly it's like when Magic Johnson got it AIDS was like our stocks about to go up like fucking Disney I mean could you think about cracking aids kind of came in at the same time and crack was killing it and all of a sudden now AIDS it's like you eat AIDS it's like you've it's not that big hits wreck yeah yeah fucking Charlie Sheen it looks great looks great

HIV it's not right it's not full balloons yeah hmm but nobody gets nobody's full blown some people do really yeah it's you can live with full-blown I don't know I don't know why they get it maybe people don't react to the medication maybe some people don't get treated full-blown well you can live a full-blown I don't know that you live very long right I mean once again you can live with HIV yes well now they can get it to the point where your HIV by the way if you're a doctor and listen this we're sorry I know we're no idea what you're talking about but if you hear it goes death usually occurs within six months to three years from the time of developing full-blown AIDS people living with AIDS is there any other disease that has full-blown it's only AIDS like a rap name you get full-blown flu full-blown AIDS and that's the scientific term it's like that's so blown out that's so like that's so slang Oh put that back up sorry do you know there's not an ounce with full-blown in people living with AIDS go through periods of being sick alternating with periods of reasonable health it's usually one of the many opportunistic infections that eventually cause death so yeah your immune system smashed yeah and then causes death ooh full-blown all right yeah full-blown he's like we're like 38 now yeah hm he's been around for a minute happy birthday now it's um where the point where you you can be undetectable like Magic Johnson's apparently undetectable right look even through aids tests like when you test him for HIV he shows HIV negative really yeah but they say it's still dormant in the system somehow or another it's very good so it's like like herpes almost enough room like it flares it all I think if you are hepatitis even if you don't have an outbreak if they test you it'll show the herpes oh but with HIV though yeah with with the way they have the medication the way the body responds to the medication now at least in some cases like Magic Johnson's apparently he shows up HIV negative but the weird thing is like well isn't he cured then is that cured mm-hmm there's two people and he's not one of them so when they have started curing people which I was like okay well they differentiate like what's the difference between curing someone and what's going on with Magic Johnson when he's HIV negative if you're anything now else negative figure they cured you yeah they have actually yeah they haven't they haven't deemed him he's done with that like you've you cured it like you get tested for chickenpox and it comes up negative they've cured you of chickenpox right pull the other guy meet the only person to be cured of HIV there's one more guy now that's one more guy now so what happened in this guy yet stem-cell treatment is what whoa hold something there holder dis stuff from us yeah they just yeah they just cured another guy I want to say a few months back it was this year they did it well there was something that I posted it on my Twitter feed that apparently is an older store it's from like two years ago and it was kind of form like a click Beatty type site yeah as cool headlines but it was about how a guy was paralyzed and he's got regaining use of his legs because of stem cells really yeah I don't know enough about it look if that's true that would be fucking incredible yeah I don't know don't hold that from people yeah I don't know enough about how severe the injury was versus you know because I need I do know that some people get temporarily paralyzed by certain injuries mm-hmm I knew a dude who got slammed on his head and his whole body went numb he couldn't move his body and he was like oh my god I'm parallel this is a this is it this is how I'm Allah for now on I can't move my body but then his body slowly started coming back and he just got jolted cuz he was wrestling like a stinger yeah yeah who's wrestling landed on his head scary fucking shit man yeah I mean perils I mean paralyzed and yeah full-blown AIDS yeah so I don't know if they really can bring someone back from that but man if they can hold shit that's a great question uh by the way that because they do say if he's HIV negative they wouldn't say he's cured of it right so then evidently does show up in some testing somewhere scientists sorry we're sorry also how is the how is he the only NBA player in history to have HIV do you remember Keenen Ivory Wayans bit about him no I'm not kina I'm sorry Damon yeah Damon who I sing his praises often on this podcast and he's like the most underrated comedian of all time I hear that an often by the way right one of the grades yeah but he had a bit about nobody wanted to cover Magic Johnson except for Dennis Rodman and Dennis rod was like I fucked Madonna I'll spit in your mouth and he said dude is one of those jokes will you hear it you can't fucking believe he said it and you were on the floor slapping the ground you like No yeah oh no I mean he's a monster he's still a monster by the way yeah I remember like featuring for him like a year or two ago years ago actually yeah he's still great people forgot it's like that Roy Jones jr. song y'all must have forgot yeah he should put a special up maybe that's what he did yeah you should put a special out at all this that comes are pretty great too like he took a long time doing that that TV show that it was people associated them with that television show which was like very family-friendly yeah you know good for him made a lot of money I'm sure did you ever guess that what you're mad about no no I don't matter about anything I love that guy yeah I love his brother to Kenan it's cool shit yeah tomorrow I know that I don't know them as well yeah Kenan super cool he's always been like a real down earth guy too but uh I mean they have comedy bones like all these guys I mean like I work the Marlon and he is like he is so fun he's hilarious yeah the whole family I mean I imagine a family yeah does that much stand up in I mean that's banana in the rock family too yes yes Joran Tony and that's parsley Chris yeah dude Tony's another one yeah god damn that dudes funny yeah god damn he's funny I've never seen him one but he's I only get what I look like him bro he's one of those guys that because he's Chris Rock's brother people almost like they look almost like past him you know like oh you're Chris Rock's brother right the other rock like dude forget all that that guy's a murderer yeah he fucking kills he's really good he's just funny man he's just in he's it's like sharp good writing you know a good solid punch line yeah boom boom boom is pacing so I got legit killer he's a large it killer dude he was the last time I saw him was in he was on the main room in the common start and there was I walked into the to the back because there was roars it was Tony roars Tony rock was murdering I mean murdering werewolves damn you could hear in the hallway that wrote that hallway roar when someone just really hit a high note I walked in my damn know dude everybody's always talking my Tony rock in the community I mean he's he's a monster a monster I mean so much more famous if he wasn't Chris Rock's brother really he's he's a fucking top 10 murderer I think that it's one of those things if your brother is one of the greatest comics of all time not just a great right your brothers Chris Rock yeah you guys just black people I mean everybody knows that bit everybody knows that bit he he's one of the Great's of all time if that's your brother you know it's a weird thing man they just like hey ya can't get me a brothers number he you know means the gifting the curse though yeah I'm Tony rock I kill to probably kill you know Charlie used to have a bit more out it Charlie used to have videos if he was they said Charlie's you get mad at people yelling out Charlie Murphy you know cuz everybody's like hey that was a thing people would do with him if you worried that what Charlie he goes no I'm just glad they're not calling me Eddie Murphy's brother anymore imagine outrage a feels yeah Brandy's brother you never saw the tape I did did you know you saw the tape yeah everybody had to see that yeah it was most watched TV yeah it's super important is in pop culture you're a star you know it's uh it's gotta be weird man to have someone like that that's a brother that's a person who's like like if you're Mike Tyson's brother mm-hmm you know real good heavyweight boxer Tony Tyson yeah but you're Mike Tyson's brother yeah you can yeah like a knockouts to like everything that like my grow at a totally different standard but I don't think that's the case with the Wayans brothers the Wayans brothers is like generally accepted that they're all really talented yeah yeah yeah they're all really good they were all super successful yeah yeah Kim - yeah oh no no yes Shantay like damn you know all those crazy comedy fan Craig yeah and they're all just a it's just it's in their DNA yeah predisposed to being funny well it's also like that's the family business which is you know some people they make boots right where they cater you know or they were delis oh man I was just in Italy like like when you see like these little small family businesses small family restaurants like people that work there you know he looks like the the father's the owner and the daughter is the manager mom works in the kitchen it's like wow this is crazy but they still do that business yeah yeah that was always a thing right you remember like family businesses on the East Coast now it's like so rare that people they wear it like a badge of honor look it's a family business I grow businesses to be family businesses know that everything we corporate though yeah man there's certain places where that's not the case though if you got to really appreciate there's one of the things you appreciate about going to Italy mm-hmm there's this like a bunch of little places I mean they have nice doors like if you're in like Gucci shit and stuff like that they have nice doors there but the restaurants and all the places where you buy things they're not like they're like people's shops right they're not boutiques there's just like yeah i go to i go to Craig's or I go to market or walk guns or you know or Sears it's not there's no corporate to to it it's just families it's weird that keeps the money in the household so you know it makes it real familial actually works out which isn't that makes sense and that's also why I say like I'm not real big into the reparation stuff for black people I mean I don't really know the ins and outs of it people keep saying like we need it get ready for Twitter hey I'm saying this I'm saying like how about we incentivize parenting mmm but can you do that keep if if you're watching your kids instead of like they're just out there cuz I mean like let's say is reparations talked about I don't know infrastructure and black communities and if that's the case well then let's incentivize keeping the parents they're keeping the parents together or if they're split up it's just like if you guys are teaching your kid and he and he's in school every day or he survives you know eight years of school shooting every family gets like you know a big bonus you know or if if he makes the Honor Roll you know like you guys get this it's like you could really be investing in your investment so I could take they say it takes 18 years and make it back on your best move your child if you're if you're in devising him to go to school for education it's gonna make better people a better society that seems good on paper now if you're seeing incentive eyes like how attentive eyes them right I'm saying like always good it's always good to encourage people to be successful so your kids as well on some of these like aptitude tests right right then you get a stipend or something like that I mean it's like what are these reparations are talking about exactly it's exactly I don't really know the ins and outs of it but if it's about infrastructure of black communities I'm so into it but it's also let's incentivize keep you know that being in the child's life because for a lot of the for a lot of the reason these kids are like they're depressed they feel like they have a chip on their shoulder because nobody's home watching them and they go to these gangs that they go to these other things right because they're just not being watched right but I think the idea behind reparations is that some people at one point in time were profiting off of slavery those people have used that money and that money has become a part of really large businesses many many large business oh it's always taken from businesses well that's where reparations would have to come from and my own yeah yeah your electric fucking yeah give me $1,500 that's one that I think directly should be like you have to wonder like if you made money like what if you used to sell babies you had a baby selling business you sold babies right and then your your grandson inherited all your money from selling babies okay but the grandson is cool I mean he just he goes golfing and he's not criminal or it's fine it's fine but is it fine because didn't his money come from babies Helen right where is it we're at wait a minute let's chase this money look here's it started out it was this much money and then your dad got that and then his dad got that yeah and then like how many generations okay so you're saying that families were no plantation owners she'd had to pay that money back to the black community where did it go where'd the money go what was he used for no you're right I'm sorry hundred years ago it's 1865 okay it's not long ago it's so recent buddy that it's on the census that says they're black right at two it would like an 8% if I'm eight percent black I'm going to get how much of this you know the Jones plantation you know fortune I'm not saying that I'm saying that the the smart thing to do would be to figure out what damage was select if they've really objectively looked at what damage was done to communities where slavery existed for meaning how many hundreds of years in this country before it was four hundred years hundreds of years right and then it ends and then these people live in these cities and they're discriminated against and they're locked up it wouldn't they would sort of one thing that I learned about who was telling us about this that they would disproportionately arrest hello man from reconstruction the worst air for black people in America it's not so much slavery as it is the Reconstruction era because then people are just mad that black people are here also arresting them small crimes and making them work in prison right kidnapping people yeah making the indentured servants you become it's just another form of slavery is that through his weird loophole like you can make you a slave again just arrest you for hanging out in the street yeah no we put you in this factory and you have to do this for us like nothing it's basically the same thing when you find out what they make in prisons when you go wait a minute they do work for like 13 cents a day or whatever the fuck they get right what they're modernizing slavery yeah because somehow or another that's okay because we got them locked in a box like they're supposed to be punished right they're supposed to be rehabilitated and take it off the street but we're gonna make them work for no money I know why men so smart I don't like black guys we got to start making white guys work for us why don't we do the same thing we're just a smart well those all the areas that were affected by that in the 50s and the 60s there's a residual effect that has never been addressed like the government has never said we've got to figure out how to make these spots better because the reason why they're so fucked up is because slavery was there and then the subsequent you know the race riots of the sixties and then this quest to to figure out what to do with those sort of stopped short there's not like like like Baltimore and in places like that like Detroit South Side Chicago would just murder every year we just accept nice logic high numbers of murder right yeah is West Side Chicago that where it all goes down let me set aside aside they're just really poor areas but it's also like how these guys getting guns yeah Wow if you can drive around you can get a gun and that's another yeah I just don't know like you have money for guns but you'd have money to like I don't know you know get a backpack and go to school well also if you see that around you all the time the problem is I've become a part of that world if everyone's kind of gun never shooting everybody and why don't ya know you better get one better get a fuckin gun I try to shoot at you you got a shoot back like what yeah oh shoot yeah yeah you live in a war zone bro go get a gun that's what it is it's an it just like it's not a war zone in terms of like its official resignation by the government but it's a war zone these are yeah people are shooting at each other that's a dead there Waring each other Hatfield McCoy isn't it's it's a war it's a civil war this is it's like warring tribes yeah we have that in fucking Siberia right now I bet but they're Siberian gang fights yeah that's also every best depression and that's that's another thing classes and does it's like they're telling you to kill yourself because you're just poor and you don't know what to do and it's like but that's not true I mean I'm a black guy like you guys and I got I got the only members who are you know in gangs like that and it sucks down there they're they're so depressed because they what they say they don't not get out of it yeah and you don't see any pathway and they don't see anybody who's gotten out of it so they feel like they're stuck there's a lot of kids that grow up in bad situations they feel inferior exactly yeah they feel inferior because the clothes they wear or how much money their family has or than how do you empower those kids through I think through activities I think getting those kids involved in things that they can get good at that show that they have value and that with hard work comes rewards I mean some of the greatest success stories in this country are professional athletes coming out of impoverished neighborhoods yeah and they become these global superstars but then they stay over but then they stay in their kids lives though don't they some of them do yeah I mean but it's like you can't you can't fix all that's taken place no have to sort of figure out how to how to improve the way people look at life the way people interface with life it's very hard if you're trying to do that but all around you is violence and crime and fear and other levels or all this act up because you're in the hood and that that's not been addressed like a serious health problem in this country that's like even an infrastructure problem we just sort of accept the fact isn't it your problem so if we're gonna put money back if we're gonna rep repair these black communities put money in the infrastructure but also you've got incentive I sent avise parents to be there right I think it's a good idea I like what you're saying yeah because you're not punishing them no just incentivize no I'm not saying like we shouldn't get money you know just for being black I'm saying we got to keep the parents there because that's what that would build a strong community it really does you know I don't know a whole lot about Kamala Harris but I do know that you know she's a very powerful well-spoken lady but she was talking once about this thing that they did where they had these parents be responsible for their kids truancy and so they could go to jail like the idea was I make sure this is correct make sure this is correct Jamie because I think the the thing what they were saying was they were they were gonna they would have cops go to visit when a kid who had been true it okay and they would sort of threaten the mother that she's responsible for the child's truancy the mother is the father well whoever was there and a single mother in this case at this one one case they were talking about specifically and that this lady had to figure out a way to get her fucking son to show up at school hey I could go to jail you know and did it work I'm sure it worked right I'm sure everyone was probably terrified but is that really what we want in America we want people to be scared that you might go to jail if your kid doesn't go to school so if the kid doesn't go to school you're gonna lock someone in a cage that is so threatening just cuz he's enrolled it's almost like maybe I took out sick day yeah but if you want to do homeschooling thing I think you have to fill out paperwork you apply for it you have to let them know you would right and the school says I think right but how many trustees is this is this this first one I don't know how many I see a first-time offender okay if it wasn't yeah someone saying they're gonna lock you in jail because your kid doesn't go to school that's bananas that's bananas like you he's 16 or whatever the fuck yeah yeah like when are you when you were 16 you were freely I was a latchkey kid right 14 I was out on we lived in different time though Joe I know you know we're genders you know race is race you know it's different for us it's that the only thing that bothers me that's that just drives me crazy the idea of like the way you fix things is by scaring people and locking the MOE that's how religion Gulag start man yeah that's that's really that's how that's how the Soviet Union becomes this room fucking empire of authoritarian regime what's up the the jail sentences of some parents in multiple counties were in quotes what she said an unintended consequence of a statewide law but I'm looking further into this and this says this is from Los Angeles Times what was that speech actually that she gave where she explained how she she did it and how it was effective she was hard on people being truant I think your idea what my point was I think that your idea is better because instead of punishing people for not doing it incentivizes imper doing it and if you could set aside imagine that as a project right you were saying there like it takes 18 years to see right it could fund an 18 year project where they were doing that and just incentivizing kids to succeed and all of a sudden they just start succeeding like crazy yeah what if we got a big jump because it was like financially violet you're competing for what's a great idea it was a great compete look at the a you like look at all these guys who could get popped in the in college for like taking you know incentives it's like because it's because they're getting their parents jobs or homes or cars there's another form there's another form of you know I mean college athletes who's getting fucked harder than college athlete exactly who's getting fucked harder than the only thing that's interesting about the I mean literally the only thing that's interesting about the event is the athletes performing that's it and they make une Goths they make not know they're getting a forty grand give you the opportunity to perform right everybody gets here he's like an electrical engineering degree like everybody wants me what are you talking about my God look at this 2016-2017 school year the NCAA revenue reached 1 billion with a be 1 billion dollars and their nonprofit or an athlete's get one gots it's gonna get paid to organize the sports right that's right click on that link it says NCAA sports make one that's that Business Insider's that's one of them real click Beatty is that Allegra is it or is it a real legit just gotta figure out who wrote the article but it's also like what California is like they they put on a bill right they're gonna pay the athletes for their likeness they should pay them to play yeah should play who do schools I think people in the audience would they pay for they pay for entertainment they're being to watch entertainment yep and watch the game so how come the players don't get a piece right why don't they do it where it's like this says my name on the back I go I can't get it's like a piece of that the idea is that it's not fair no one else gets anything for anything they do in school yeah but that's you're stealing from athletes will make you professional if you're getting paid for your for your craft nuts well then if it's gonna be if the athletes gonna work for free the fucking show should be free it should be free tickets damn just broke the Internet that's it should be like oh ok we don't get any money well you don't get any money either we're doing it for fun but you're doing it for fun what if games were free yeah holy shit that's how it should be you don't want to pay me free everything's free you can't charge money and keep it all you greedy that'd be the worst audience by the way that's the free audience is the worst audience the one you know the weird thing about colleges is the dudes who've graduated in the rich now and they donate money keep that football program alive was uh they give you a fucking the best thing in their community player it love it like Jamie loves Columbus teams anything from Columbus he gets a boner for you get super state with the Epstein shit they've invested a lot of money on Ohio State and they're trying to figure out if they need to give it back oh did he go to Houston he didn't but he's involved in Columbus business and so they've given a lot of money to this team and have they determined that his that his money like how his money was made through sex trafficking yeah I caps teens money yeah I don't know I don't know I mean I know you imagine that one guys I mean how much from sex trafficking cuz that would mean that would make him a plantation owner like in a sense right because he's like he's giving out flush he's getting pay for flush mmm what was his allegedly what he did was he would find young girls yeah and get them to give him massages maybe like you guys should you know yeah getting my tribe yeah like a man yeah ask you a real creepy way of describing it to he said that he thought it was impossible for him to control that his impulses were impossible for him to control and he was a great flight risk so didn't want him to have see if that's true so his therapist was saying this so they're trying to protect him but it's also like are they trying to cure him I think see if that quote is true cuz I'm pretty high right now the prosecutor said that he died some that the Epstein fellow had impulses that were impossible to control that's how he felt but a lot of those guys they say that right even like the Jared know all the guys say that that's a thing apparently about pedophiles yeah is that the recidivism rate so high when they get if they do go to jail then they get released boy man they do it again right cuz like I got away I can do that like idealist and I think they're broken I think this it's like a you know that screen that was just all fucked up that's them that's that it's a glitch yeah I think I don't think we should assume that you know if you if your brain is working well and your body's working well you just can't assume that everybody's is I think that's yeah you feel bad for it I mean like we feel guys who like who were born with maybe like severe cerebral palsy right like in a sense that's what's happening to them you know like they can't control this urge but then it's also how do you fix that instead of like shaming them right in and a lot of it is apparently a lot of pedophilia is brought from through sexual trauma right so if someone is molested as a young child apparently there's a high likelihood that they're gonna do is their likelihood rather that they can so it's like the HIV virus it's it's just you're you're breaking someone's wiring like the wiring to the way they interface with the world as a young age at a young age and you're fucking up their life in a horrible way they said about Michael Jackson right it's like he touched early so then it was like he just he was using that as like hey I this is this is normal to me yeah well why did he ever allege happened to him did he ever explain what happened to him no there was something where he was talking about how he had all the surgery so he didn't have to look like his father I remember that really yeah but that's also it could also be that so he was scared of his father yeah look in the mirror he saw his father yeah man in the mirror yeah that's what it's about it's not about getting your shit together they also say they also say because he bought the Beatles catalog that that's a smear campaign and like they paid those kids off to say that about him that's ridiculous it's a great conspiracy their whole I think people are you know they're crazy if they think it's normal for a guy to have a bunch of kids sleep in his bed and he's weird you know my drugs that is off the charts bananas that anybody would let their kids stay there yeah off the charts bananas it is also Mike was off the charts yeah he had so many hits the more hits you have the more shit you can get away with until okay Berman's just dismissed a request for bail because Epstein's impulses are not likely to have abated or been successfully suppressed that's not exactly ideal hair that makes more sense i paraphrased hard that's how things the Florida guys how rumors get started so this isn't Florida you can get away with anything there you used to be able to tighten down on Florida thank God fuck Florida 2019 it took you this long well Florida was the place where the pain pill mills existed where they'll have the management centers the pain management centers right next to an oxycontin store dude so you go to the doctor it's a yes but back's killing me doctors like you need pain pills know that I do need pain pills this is right a piece of paper and then you would literally go to the next door over and it was the building connected to them that sells the pain pills that have it in the same spot sometimes that's like cocaine country too right yeah everybody's so fucking high in Florida oh dude Florida's crazy it's crazy it's got a history of high I feel like the the chaos of the 80s of all the cocaine is burned into the psyche of the landmass no and then the alligators moved in and there's even more reptilian more reptilian when I was a kid I lived there I lived in Israel I lived in Gainesville yeah gains northward right north I don't know if it's nor is it north sort of ish minute medalists Boca I mean we were around alligators but they were endangered back then so they would tell you that yeah they thought of them is in danger people are so silly they're like we have to protect these fucking monsters they're around us we have and when I was there some ladies poodle got snatched I think it was a poodle was a small dog got snatched by an alligator while I was there and uh yeah yeah I didn't see it happen but I came like after it happened and people were all freaked out and they were telling you to stop feeding the marshmallows we would feed alligators marshmallow and they keep coming back well the thing is they would they like the marshmallows like so you knew if you threw the marshmallows alligator to come up and eat it and they got used to eating marshmallows and then there was signs they said don't have the alligators eat marshmallows because it's apparently bad for the digestive system and bla bla bla bla bla thinking shit everywhere your mother can eat a whole dog with a collar on yeah I mean it's not the dog's collar it's swallowing that collar it's gonna shit out that metal buckle uh you you really think I'm marshmallows gonna start so this attitude that they had that they wanted to bring back the alligator it was a good thing because you know they really were on the verge of extinction but then it became the opposite so now I'll Gators everywhere so now like alligators people find him in their house yeah they find him in their pool like they're snatching people up like rats in New York they're everywhere and they're so did you see that one that was really recently filmed walking across a golf course no it is a dinosaur really 15 feet long I do love the Gator though yeah it really it's an awesome animal see if you could find the video the video of the giant alligator they and they said by the way that this alligator is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 years old yeah he's 80 years old zero 80 years that's a 8 year old alligator jaw in appearance any kind of racism our Jim Crow laws they're just yeah walking through that machine yeah yeah good for them but when you here it is look at this oh shit you were lying oh my god he's 80 years old it's an 80 year old alligator yeah he's moving kind of fresh they'd say the ones that are really big when they get to be that like 15 foot length yeah because a lot of those are really old 56 no arthritis I mean guy friend shot one and it was more than 80 years old shoutout to John Dudley I think you're Eddie's a dinosaur is a goddamn Wow that means oh that is rewind that again because we're both super high I mean what does he even do imagine seeing that Brian Moses yeah or in your yard you're chilling hanging out on your phone got your feet up and you see that walking across your yard yeah I got you get the fuck out of Florida like how close is that to me what the fuck I mean that's it's super dope look I mean look at that thing yeah he's got a scab there too how much you think that weighs let's go half a ton 500 pound I think a thousand easy did you see the guys fishing and the one he's reeling a big-ass fish and the Gator wants it know starts chasing some on land and these guys like get the fuck out of the way oh my god it's a thousand-pound Gary egg but it's big that's all a lot of church shoes it's so big a lot of church shoes but these things they live amongst us and they eat dogs yeah and they deer and everything else they can get their hands they have to eat a lot of food to maintain that fucking mass is this it so the guy oh my god somebody's always got holes in the Gators chasing them holy shit oh fuck whoa Kylie is 480 do they move quick move quick note how old that one is that could be a younger one well he's stealing this dude's fish yeah keep the fish Wow get robbed for his fish yeah he just got jacket oh yeah I was gonna say that doesn't look like an alligator that's a crocodile what's the difference crocodiles have like a pointy or snout and they're way more aggressive okay so don't fuck with a croc alligators are better yeah oh my god they're better okay this is many crocodiles there are alligators in Florida way more people to be getting jacked Oh so croc is a hello Crocs who fuck everybody up Crocs do not discriminate they get water buffalos and people they fuck they're real aggressive - there was this one video of um they had like an alligator farm and they were raising alligators and then they had one crocodile and so when they came time to feeding the one crocodiles like bits down sit the fuck down climbing on top of these roosters and him feel like yeah but he was on the top of all the alligators fuck off fuck off of here and just took control and was getting the food no well crawl a crocodile either get an alligator that's good question they hate each other do they really - caiman where's it came in from that's a crocodile but it's a very small crocodile okay Caymans are small they live in the Amazon have you eaten crocodile no or Gator yeah I was I was I had I had a place it was like a fucking TGI Fridays type joint and it wasn't the best it wasn't TGI Fridays but you know it was like one Applebee's type place right like a chain yeah that's data and it wasn't like fresh but apparently when you get it fresh like right off the Gator it's supposed to be really good there's like any meat could be like that you know no man even rat yeah but the alligator thing is like did you eat gator yeah yeah my uh my brother sister lived down there and my brother got a gun pulled on him whoa yeah yeah but like a delivery driver whoa so there so my brother yeah a little baby my little niece and there with her it's my brother and her in the back and then uh he's driving us in the neighborhood he's going the speed limit right like maybe like five to ten miles an hour a little slower and there's a delivery driver behind him delivery driver gets mad so his honking Adam is behind him right my brother-in-law pulls into their driveway delivery driver pulls him behind him and is like what do you want to do man and she flashes a gun on them and my brother who's like he's as big as you he's like a bodybuilder and he's uh he was like I don't do anything man he's like I don't know why you're honking I mean like my daughter in the back you know she's like less than a year old and the guy is just like I'm not making this a race thing and he's like I'm not saying this is a race thing and the kid yeah so he's just like well and it might mean like uh my uh my brother was in the military he could come to calling the guys sir and the guys like you call me sir he in the military and he's just like I am sir I'm in the military he's just like we're disgrace to the military and he's just like I just went slow enough because my daughter's in the back and you're behind me so he's like I don't understand what the deal is here and the guys just kept just trying to egg him on to try to like provoke a fight because of stand your ground oh yeah I mean it was why I heard about I was terrified my sister was shook she had come home from work because it's like you know the baby's in the back and this guy just like pulled up into your driveway and he's just like if Quincy would have made a move and that guy shot him that Guy'd have been in the right how much of that's going on it's probably happening all the time look we having a Trayvon that's a uniquely incompetent secure guard to though I mean he was getting smashed he's getting his head bounced off my 15 year old right now the kid was fucking him up yeah well that got out I mean they haven't afford it - it wasn't a parking lot right we're a guy like thought he was being threatened by a dude with his kids in the car and then he shot the guy there's a parking lot in uh in Florida I don't know that one oh that's for that that's think I have another last year or something but that's definitely a recent one people just having guns all the time seems like a great idea but the people like that having guns yeah is when it becomes a problem someone yeah somebody knows that you don't have a gun and they're trying to goad you into something so they could shoot you look yeah outlaw Josie Wales movie like that's not someone defending themselves so that's the weapon that's that's why guns are creepy it's not creepy because a guy like you has a gun you're a great guy you're not gonna rob anybody no I don't need to go you wouldn't have a gun Yeah right but if you did have a gun I wouldn't be nervous I feel like well Moses has a gun he can handle it yeah yeah I'm not looking at yeah most people that aren't good guys right if those are not good guys get a gun this was the one he's talking about where the guy was that's a big standard yeah he's like on the ground with his hands up and he's got shot still really like I said he was felt threatened or something that's all they need is a reason to mama that's all they need is a rings in the Florida he's on the ground on his knees and the guy shot him yeah oh my god yeah Jesus Christ I mean when do you not shoot someone if there are if if you you will know you wouldn't shoot him if they flattened out I mean why did he I thought it was always like if somebody's attacking you I thought I mean that's your that's your on the ax to flatten out yeah well I know you to offer the money here yeah here's how much think my life would you accuse him I mean if he shot the guy was the guy was flattened out what about then do you think the same about me me no I'm saying like yeah do you think like they'd have the same reaction cuz the reaction they had when they saw him with his hands up honestly man yeah yeah I don't know how mad you yeah I don't how mad you are with the gun your head with a weapon in your hand to be like I can I'm playing God right out of this guy I can kill this man right now this person right here right so yeah it wouldn't matter would they accuse him what I'm saying is would they accuse him because they didn't he got away foot he got away with it right he was accused though right it wasn't charged for this they didn't charge him that's what I'm that's what I'm saying what that's what I'm saying he wasn't arrested yes he's deciding to stand your ground law I'm reading right here from the AP sheriff won't arrest parking lot shooter that's also they can't even charge him no that's what I'm saying that's that's like that's like you can't challenge that rule like in football you can't that's not a he a wrestler he said he felt threatened and the black guy was just like dude I was on the ground there's there's there's closed-circuit footage of it you know but my question was what if he had lied down lie down flat on the ground would then he be who I mean when would they what at what would the line be that's where they decide to charge him you know saying right okay will you charge me this lying down if the guys lying down just execute them right does that still stand your ground there there is a manslaughter trial apparently now updated I said 18 manslaughter oh he killed that guy I'll call the sheriff as a defense witness that's insane I'm sorry there's certain people that should have a gun right now there's certain people a lot of you know seasoned law enforcement people in people with good dispositions that would never in their can wildest dreams shoot someone who's on their knees would never threaten anybody with a gun and they have a gun purely for senseless for self-defense that's a different thing you know but there's when you have everybody can have a gun that's you're gonna get a certain number of those fucking guys yeah and they think wait a minute they think they're in the right yeah I think we all gotta get guns I mean like is that nothing is not that the move do we now get guns this is America we can be racist and have guns and be on drugs mmm well you have to be on drugs now it's new right there's gonna it's gonna come to a point toilet did you imagine how scared of you of your kids to go to school that scary right scare when you have children you're very vulnerable you know you feel you feel more filled with love than ever before but you also feel more filled with fear because you're worried I mean that's one of the things that the Romans always knew so make me about families you can control them if they have families oh that's fucking powerful yeah you can control your minds throat young dudes right everything goes with swords yeah we're single like you want him to get shacked up and have kids right that would they stop doing that yeah and then you got to kill somebody's kids every now and then keep him in line she did proud I mean that's what they did they did that from time-honored tradition you kill somebody's kid to keep him in line they did it with they've done it in the Mafia they've done it with a lot a people I mean it's it's always been something that people do to put fear in people you get people to when you have a lot more to lose when you have a family they look at it that way there's certain people that I mean when you study how to get people to listen to you and to behave and how to strike fear into populace that's that's why they don't want abortion laws mmm wow that's deep right there's if if there is someone that is really thinking we need we need to make sure that people have families so that they'll be more vulnerable yeah if there's someone that is following that philosophy which is not my thought yeah exactly you said this uh but it's been around forever this is like you're commonly like a human just human humans born they think that like we have to keep families keep them in line well it's when you talk about authoritarian figures like people that want to have an iron fist to control the population the last thing you want is a bunch of young single guys running around with you know attachments because that's how coos get successfully completed yeah watching young mercenaries just decide to take over your fucking building like the expendable style and shoot everybody you don't want that because they have nothing to lose right you want a guy loves his wife he's got some of his kids and you know he's got yeah he's got something to lose and that's that's how you keep a society in order and that's why you shouldn't be getting rid of babies no condoms no babies no birth control no babies if someone really was plotting out a culture that way like really masterminding it and really saying that not just knowing that that is the case that people do change but I have children but then doing this and promoting this on purpose specifically to control people if that was the case yeah they would do that they would do that too they would they would they would work against abortion because they would want more people to have more kids so they control them that makes sense well good so crazy to think that way but it's it would only be like one factor I think the major fact is religion because if you are if you're pro-life and a candidate is pro-choice in your mind a lot of times people decide that that person is against like God's law that person wants to kill children right so they almost feel like compelled to vote you know to vote against you if you're pro-choice I know but like are they thinking about well you know what if this mother doesn't raise this child now you have this you know this mother who's resentful of this child that she had that you guys made her have and this child who's you know this loveless child now and they both you know she's got mental illness he's got mental illness because you know he's looking first mother's love she's like this kid role my dreams you know this husband didn't stay that kind of thing you just you're you're making these communities you know depressed and sad you know and then you guys who said no you have to have that you're not raising this kid you know you don't put money in nothing you know and that's this family's pocket all these things you're saying are true yeah it's one of those things where you could see to to like distinct patterns but infinite different varieties of completely the world sucks because the baby was born or the world is amazing right baby's ball right Tim Tebow says that you know he's that's the thing man it's true though sauce is true I mean it's you never know you never know but it's whose decision should it be and what is it that's the real question like what is abortion right what is it is it killing a baby or is it a medical procedure like which one is it as a slippery slope that's where the debate falls in Pro Tours pro-choice or pro-life it's not that these pro-choice people are evil people no they just don't want anybody dictating I mean it's not like an evil organization that's created by Satan it's not it's not it's women that don't want you to tell them what to do with the reproductive system right that's what it is they want to be able to make the choice themselves but then there's other people that are pro-life and specifically the more militant ones which you know the assassinated abortion doctors I mean there are people that firmly believe that even if it's just a couple of days old right it's it's a baby right and that any sort of procedure to stop that in its place is murder you're murdering a baby and there's no if ands or buts about it and it's like the way they look at the the loonie left and that they they buy into this bullshit and right you know that that that's a narrative that you know that's how they that's how they really believe and people demonize people on both sides of it as if they're so different and there's no way you could ever think any differently the way then the way you're thinking it right now no I think you broke it down just like is it a medic procedure or is it ya know the other way and I think that's a that's that's hard to get into okay yeah I mean that's that we'll be debating that to the end of time well it's one of the most human subjects because it shows how complicated shit really is right and if you try to pretend it's not then you get into late term abortions like well what's up there when does it get weird for you what is right yeah six months does it get weird then look it's weird like I'm not saying you should be it shouldn't be to have an abortion or should be I'm not saying either of those things I'm saying to deny the weirdness yeah it's a very the nicest term that I could come up with weirdness right it is weirdest I had a UH I got a girl pregnant I was a teenager and uh she had an abortion I'm sorry she had a miscarriage nature's abortion and then she she would I was eight weeks or nine weeks and she was flushing out chunks of the she was calling the baby so I mean that's at like eight to nine weeks everybody Jesus yeah yeah so Wow yeah and she shouldn't have had a baby she was on crystal meth I mean that should have happened so they think whatever higher-powered did that for us but yeah that's what I'm saying like that I mean that that's when you said that's why it's so messy and it really is messy because you don't know what is what right now she's like it traumatized her yeah you know makes sense means a crazy process that the human body goes through that men will never really understand because there's never gonna be an opportunity where a body grows inside your body and then comes out of your body the way a woman experiences I mean that's mailing shit dude women experience something that is so alien to anything that the male's experience they grow a body inside of them yeah it's very it's so different we're so dead it's it's so different like veterans or how they interface with the world they them yeah nurturing they want to protect the nest and keep everybody safe and they're gonna have a baby inside right now they have to take care of this baby and care for and then the baby will become more people and they'll start mating and they get become adults networking server oh yeah Earthlings y-yeah comes out of their body and for us man we just we just shoot loads this is so easy this is like the art what we do when we don't have a baby and what we do when we have a baby is the exact same thing like you to when you have sex with a woman and she gets impregnated it's it feels like regular sex yeah us and we have sex all the time and you don't get pregnant and then all sudden you are so it's like weird like we didn't even do anything we just had sex like we normally up sex yeah we had sex and now there's a next and to person like whoa like whites but there's a lot of times you so you associate sex with pleasure right like it is obviously but when you have a baby you're like oh it does that it does that yes it does yeah sex does that so for a man there's no there's no difference in what happens to his body right like whether when he's having sex and babies conceived versus when he's having sex and nothing it's just fun there's no difference to him he doesn't feel a difference whereas a woman literally her body will fucking grow yeah a person a person with a brain that she serious she's sharing vessels and kingswood this thing's kicking inside of her like that experience the fuck you up for a man yes I mean I would look I do not like if there was an a way that you could record what it's like to be someone and then they give you like a little chip and you would slip it in there and I could put I could see you like you would allow people all of your feelings the way your skin feels the way your emotions are the way your psychology is set up you would allow people to de literally beat you for a couple days and the chip would do that yeah it's check but just sit in your head and you that's one beat Allison yeah I would I would like to feel what it's like to be pregnant really yeah you want to feel that that like that rip that pay or just like just not the birth but okay so fuck that I don't want the real answer right I want to get fucked I would I would wonder what it would like to first of all be a maternal woman I was I mean I'm really curious as to what the the hormones feel like what it must feel like cuz I don't think we you know when you see a woman you try to understand like what is what's the world through her eyes right you know you're never gonna feel the way she feels I'm never gonna look at somebody else and be like oh they can kill me right now all the time you know yeah that too that's a huge part but I mean even just interfacing with the world through a different type of human body a female human body versus a male human body in terms of like estrogen and the testosterone ratio and how your maternal instincts and oxytocin and always did heightened sensitivity you know in certain situations they have like superpowers actually you describe it that way they're making human yeah humans in their body and they have to like make sure that everyone's safe around them because every now and then men will murder them right yeah or yeah or a bow exactly Jesus crazy sorry ladies sorry yeah would you really think about it it's like what am relationship it's mad the relationship between males and females yeah mad that's why I always laugh at dudes who get you know when guys get Jack for their divorce money I was like oh come on you're gonna be all right yeah you know all the terrible things that could go wrong right that's just you just get Jack for some money I like that perspective actually I kind of puts it on perspective you're just like yeah that's how many raped in kill Jesus you get look people get into bad relationship I mean I'm not happy that someone ever gets into a bad relationship but if you get in a bad relationship and she's just a gold digger and it's one we're oh god yeah like I've had so many friends that have been like yeah my fucking ex-wife she wants more money I gotta go to court like yeah but you can't be with your murder player it's like you fucked up shit in the Meritor she didn't know him she know and she was crazy would you murder raped really yeah for sure you sure don't want either one obviously if a guy rapes me and I'm so alive then I get to murder him oh you gotta think about that well even get to murder no I don't get I don't get murdered I just get ripped okay I'll wait but there's like this is that trauma with that though you know yeah it'll be trauma not gonna enjoy it yeah it's gonna be terrible yeah but it's better than being dead okay I'm not saying it's good no but no I all right but for me you as a man as a human I get to go have a great then murdered okay sure there you go John wick after that a hundred percent yeah just so everybody fucking 100% rape me or I'll murder you yeah have a new goal in life but you gotta say goodbye to everybody before you do it how cuz you do doctor there Emily you're like I say what yeah it's not John wick John wick just drives home yeah they arrest you but dude fuck - and then you kill them and they go to you media I go hey what happened I mean what does the cop say just like dude he raped me though you're just like yeah well they're just law you can't order a guy because he raped you Oh J says there are rules so you can't you can't say yeah I'm just over the world can't murder make a shirt I wonder if like he would sue you right because like there's people that if you made a shirt like you may say he made a Conor McGregor shirt and you had some quotes on it you were selling it he could like maybe sue you if you keep his face off yeah or he come to your house like a bunch of days like take all his stuff back you have a picture of OJ's face like lean ins that selfie camera it just says hurry to the world yeah I mean come on Twitter burst by the way whatever name it what it was it's OJ's world it's a Twitter world he never even fucking once he did that shirt would be giant it's probably being made right now there's nerds that are listening to us right now that are going they're just gonna hit pause right now yeah and make whatever yeah you just made a go Jay submerge hate Twitter world I was just going to get that money the money I was gonna go to abuse women good and waiters waiters have been murdered by boyfriends damn well that knife 200 personal they never found that knife they never found that knife yeah who had that knife I mean damn oj damn oj p you know for he's like 70 and like an ex-convict he looks good was playing golf all day was it it's all he does even like golf Tom plays golf it looks great he seems to have at least a slight struggle with communicating right and walking he seems like he's got a little slowness to his voice we're just forcing it you know I mean which is probably CTE oh is that CTE yeah but he sounds pretty clear pretty clear pretty clear yeah there's a there's a hint there's a hitch you know you get it you see it in fighters or just there's a you never know because it might just be you're tired right I'm thinking yes but there's some days where I'm jet-lagged or tired I'm just really stupid okay I don't talk that good he also like you know he did beat two murder cases that'll make you loose you know Maddie's you know 70s right isn't he yeah he's in a 70s but still there's there's some fizzle there's a struggle stretch slight struggle to the way he's talking that makes me think he's dealing with some sparks oj simpson worried he has CTE i have days that i can't find words yeah 100% the CT makes you murder people right that's what I mean it could be I mean is that what that would use that today Oh Jay that's what his lawyer had said not really one of his lawyers had said that had OJ Simpson bail it was a lawyer or was it a medical adviser me medical advisor said I would bet my Bennett license that he has to see to you yeah but he was also saying that it would have been a part of the defense right it would have been part of the crime had happened today I mean that's what I'm saying right that's why but Aaron Hernandez they were saying dude with all of them yeah anybody when and obviously you're in a super violent sport - yeah most violent and then - you're gonna you're gonna have a high capacity for violence right yeah you know I mean that it does and then on top of that if you're your fucking wirings it yeah I've been smashed so many times and they do get smashed and they're wiring does go for some of them fighters and haywire yeah they get a little haywire Chris Benoit yeah that was terrible that kind of shit is so terrifying I could kill his family I mean and many people that have experienced extreme CTE have wound up when they committed suicide donating their brain like saying um you know like that one died dude Junior junior seau he shot himself in the chest so that they could look at his brain that's hard man that's hard I mean that how many fights have you been in every times you've been concussed I don't know I don't know how many times I've been concussed um I've never been knocked unconscious but I got a tko'ed in a kickboxing match the last fight I ever had I got cracked I had crack with a left hook it was like it was one of the weirdest times I've ever been hit because I had been I definitely been hit hard before but had never been hit where my legs stopped working I just stopped they just stopped like he hit me he caught me like right at the tip of my jaw with like a left hook that I didn't see coming and my leg just went whoopsies they just gave out they gave out like they said it shut off there's a nerve in here you're saying that's kind of like you get hit and your jaw goes sideways and your head twists and your brain sloshes around in there yeah and it's like a bolt of electricity it's like it's like everything shuts off just shuts off but I was still conscious but I was like oh shit what is going on here this is crazy and I was like all right get back up your feet so the referee was counting he got to eight or something like that I got up to my feet they dusted my gloves off and the kid came at me again and hit me with an uppercut and another punch and dropped me again then they stopped a fight so I was never unconscious but that was the worst I'd ever been like beaten in a fight we're just knuckle sandwiches the swords flying but that was the last time I ever fought but other than that there was a lot of like training sessions where you get kicked in the face or punched yeah there's a lot of those yeah just just happens most of the time you know if you get hit full blast it's an accident can you get tested for CTE is that I think the test there's no age they have tested a few people while they're alive they have an extra brain to find those stuff so they have no hole in your brain yet to prove to like have it under the nose you got to die first yeah the they like to do autopsies on people with CTE and they crazy atrophied brains right brain of an 85 year old person with with Alzheimer's disease it's really nuts man like their brains are fucked up there's all these weird proteins get developed from the concussions yeah fuck like with like that calcifies the brain or something does horrible things he eats way different parts of the brain there's like these little dark spots and holes Brett exactly sure what the mental processes but the the medical process is rather but they sounds like it does like dead spots like your brains dead days when they always just great they okay former NFL player confirm his first diagnosis of CTE and living patient yeah we talked about this before everything so they're able now to get some sort of an accurate run out of what your brain looks like and they can see the CTE without having to open you up but I think most of time it's when a person's already dead maybe their their detection methods are getting better listen if you look at that brain go back to that real that image when the guys poking at the brain and he's looking at the x-rays or the the MRIs look at look at this look at that just look at that thing the Hat which is protected by a thin layer of bone is where all of your fuckin thinking takes place all of it it's an organ and you get punched in the face all of that is just but like detaching from the walls all that connective tissue what does that stuff called that that that real weird stuff that sits between what kind of connective tissues that describe does between the brain and the skull there's like a specific name for it Oh like that then later yeah and that stuff gets ripped oh that's yeah tears free and your fuck which one you get hit you're saying yeah sometimes people develop internal bleeding after finds Jesus day yeah combat sports crazy I mean it's your wait another guy just died right another box or another box or two boxers died in a very short period of time yeah some people think that they should shorten fights now but they should make them like eight rounds well cuz guys are just bigger and faster strong I mean just people just want to mitigate the thing the damage right mitigate the damage but anything if you did that in the Highland level fights you'd miss amazing fights right like Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury if that wasn't 12 rounds when when Wilder knocked him down the 12th round and fewer dead we would have missed one of the greatest moments in the history of the sport I mean that was an amazing moment man for two reasons one is how fucking hard Deonte punches yeah and to that Wilder who looked like he was dead to the world rises up and then out boxes him for the rest of round survives survives Wilder chasing him down and then out boxes him then even tags Wilder has Wilder to covering up that whole round doesn't take place if you only fight ain't round cuz opposed be a test of endurance to right not just drinking power for sure yeah I mean maybe if people were only fighting eight rounds it would be worse because they would go harder execs what I'm saying yeah yeah and there'd be more fights because yeah you exert all your energy in the first three four three five rounds the only argument against that those kickboxing cuz in kickboxing they've always had less rounds like kickboxing like a Muay Thai fight a lot of times they'll fight three rounds or they'll fight five rounds yeah but that I never I mean come on I mean cuz that that's yeah like that's what insane I mean you talk about tree trunks hang somebody you know what I mean so awful yeah that should only be three to five I never got in a charley horse like a really bad yeah yes yeah I was like recently were like my whole leg stopped I was like this is possible I I didn't know was possible your whole legs stopped it from a charley horse there's there's levels to it but the worst I ever saw was Jose Aldo fought Uriah Faber really and Jose Aldo was one of the most vicious leg kickers in the history of the sport Oh God his leg kicks were insane what year is this I had two seen this fight 2012 maybe something like one of neighbors like what like fights for he he's like these becoming big at that point 2012 yes it was fighting for the title is for the featherweight title I believe or the WEC title boy I feel like that was like ok this is what it was if I'm correct I think it was I think I'm incorrect is that uh is that in the WEC yes it is so I think what this was was the UFC and the WC had a pay-per-view but it was just they did it wasn't quite the UFC yet so I don't think they called it anything I think they just called it aldo vs favor and the UFC promoted it i think that was how they got around something over trying to do that is aldo in his prime son that is that combination right there is called the duchy where they throw a left hook to the body and a right leg kick but this just showed you how goddamn tough you're right favor is the impressive performance for sure offensively I mean Aldo was in his full prime it was amazing huh but what's really impressive is how Urijah Faber was able to endure I mean it was how many rounds let's go it went the full distance full five rounds yeah what's that yeah then you see his legs Oh fucking crazy man yeah when did they start doing five round main events for the UFC that wasn't early or they I don't think rooted that I feel like I'm remembering it's been this way for quite a while so it's it's hard to remember the exact year but they they didn't used to 2011 oh this is like this decade 11 that's when they started going to five rounds four main events UFC Dana White says all you have seen might events to become five rounds right but before that championship fights where championship fights always five rounds trying to go back to the early early days at this point five round fights have been content or contests have been reserved for title fights on yeah that's what I said but when did they make them five rounds for title fights you know when did they decide that a title fights five rounds and irregular fights three rounds mm-hmm what is that wonder if that was from the beginning because you got to remember in the beginning days they didn't even have time limits really know what was just you go into like somebody got us a lot of fights where there's no time limits that were terrible he just fought so like somebody I tapped up yeah I like that uh look especially in Japan yeah like hoist Gracie had a fight with Sakuraba that went like 90 minutes to him yeah why well in Japan they they didn't they had a different way of looking at these contests it would make crazy matchups where there was you can't win by decision you can only win by knockout they would like Crow cop who's like one of the greatest strikers in MMA ever okay because he came from k1 kickboxing he was big and Kaitlyn kickbox and then made his way over to to Japan and started fighting and pride and the first time he fought he fought Wanderlei Silva it was like a big day but they had a special Rules match and the special rules was if it went to a decision it was a draw no matter what if no one got knocked out it was a draw and if they fought on the ground it can only be for like 15 seconds okay like some crazy rule so the best is just boxing in order that's kick Martin I forget what the amount of time was but there was a limited amount of time where they could fight on the ground yeah so I think it's been bad it's crazy yes cro cop had the balls to step into MMA like really with very little real MMA training mostly just as a kickboxer yeah but then he started as his career got further he got better and better at stuff and takedowns but so Japan would do that they would make like they would make fights where one guy where's Iggy the other guy doesn't they would make fights with they made fights with Bob Sapp it was like 370 pounds against the guy was 200 pounds just sit on the guy yeah smashes him smash they made a bunch of like horrible mismatches yeah they make miss they make Wanderlei Silva fight someone who was just deathly scared of them it was gonna get pummeled into the ground and they did it just to watch so you could watch Vandelay smash somebody oh yeah they don't like circus matches they had crazy fights man they had crazy fights and you went over there with the call to Fletcher just the one oh no I only watched him here I've never been in Japan to water fights other than the UFC we did a UFC out there once yes that was fun they're really really polite are they yeah and between like like while the action is happening they're sitting there quiet and polite like you don't hear a lot of like screaming and crazy I didn't know that yeah and then they get Lou they're very they applaud like when things happen they go for a broadcast it's interesting yeah it's got a bad but it is different yeah but like like house like Tyson a Buster Douglas like was that loud I wonder I wonder I don't remember like all those fights over there yeah you see like if it quiet mean that would that seems like it sucks but early on early on they were super knowledgeable like early on in mixed martial arts like if you watch fights from Japan if somebody passed guard everybody would cheer okay yes like smart audience yeah they know exactly what's going on okay they're well educated and someone gets a mount just start clapping and like this it's just a different completely different kind of reaction for the audience change it's cool though it's like when you watch the UFC events from Japan it's changing they're becoming a little bit more used to like being rowdy okay having a good time but in the old days you could hear the coroner's crystal clear the quarantine I suppose yeah press down with a butterfly down with the butterfly look out for the right arm we have the right arm okay keep that overhook keep that over hook and you would hear that like but he could hear it too everybody hear it so the guy who you're fighting is hearing the advice again yeah oh wow crystal clear because there's there's no noise I mean that must make fights I mean like yeah just long and boring cuz they all know like you strategy now no crazy just because someone knows you're trying to get their arm doesn't mean not gonna get their arm it's still crazy but it's um it was really interesting because you could hear everything you hear about Vegas yeah Vegas is like anybody screaming yeah well you know what I find the the sometimes the most enthusiastic crowds are the ones that don't get the UFC there very often so when it does get there they get fucking super pumped right can't believe it's there live you know like we're I mean there's a lot of cities where we've gone to like all Texas it always says wild ass you guys yeah that make sense yeah that's a good place for us but there's a lot of cities that just don't get it all the time Chicago whenever we're in Chicago it's big yeah you've never been in Chicago no oh yeah yeah go to Chicago all the time there's a big drinking times though fuck yeah yeah like I feel I get any like fighters town a big drink in town there's gonna be like doesn't get yeah there's matter what it is yes when we're talking about reparations earlier yeah like that I don't think they should give money to people money that's no say it but what I think they should do is definitely put money like if you if you were a guy who was the manager of a city let's look at that let's look at the city like the city was a store okay and you're the manager of the store and but the the section over near the cleaning products is everything explodes all the time and it's fucking dangerous and mops are falling and you're like what we got you know this everything's in order cities good revenue looks good babe a buddy bit the fuck are you talking about you're the manager what are you doing about this look at this spot yeah like what oh no that's the cleaning products I mean I don't know what to do about the cleaning products they explode the mops fall off the racks I just wave my hands at it I'm good you would never tolerate that no but a mayor like that people did you get judge guy who da yeah he could have all sorts of chaos going on in his town while he's out there campaigning for president right yeah let me cast nobody cares don't have to fix it you don't have to fix it yeah be like well how do you feel like that I mean I'm saying it's an infrastructure problem so how do you fix it I mean so you're saying take what 15 percent or whatever percentage from like all these big corporations and they're like they should be not even saying that right I'm put up a little what I was saying though if there was a direct line yeah I mean I don't know if you even can't do this anymore at this point in time but if there was a direct way you could show this is the amount of money that came from slavery and they still rough I mean yeah how are you finding that out though I don't know yeah there's no way because my way we can't even trace like you know what I don't know what but try what plantation I was even at my family lineage is well there was a bunch of Nazi money that they change they traced they've traced Nazi money they've definitely done that they've definitely done that it's a little more modern though I'm installations you're saying from 16 or 15 or 14 till you know 1860 something yeah we're dealing with like an 80 year gap yeah it'd be hard but if there's a clearly established business that used to be a plantation right you know also you know Jewish people like that can't keep things in account so like you can you can trace that money but there was no here's an unpopular thought this is this is what I think I think we should probably consider doing that with definitely areas that were impacted by slavery but then also areas that have been impacted by economic crisis to like not just the area's impact we have to fix the bad spots in the country all told yeah like . like we kind of fix those people that live in west virginia in the mountains yeah the fucking pill people i mean any any transient poor community yeah yeah but first like as a general acknowledgement of like what this country was founded on you got to fix the areas that were fucked up by slavery the idea that you shouldn't it's like you aren't we on a team together okay aren't we teaming america right well team america would want all of its members to be in good shape yeah good state we want less losers yeah right here's the way you get less losers you provide more opportunity and you fix the spots that are fucked up and there's nothing that comes with education though Joe I mean the illiteracy rate he's crazy down there so you're saying idiots you don't I mean but it's like it's no no no I'm not saying yeah they're idiots what I'm saying is they're stuck right horrible place right right you're an idiot if you don't want to fix that no I get that I think it's just unpopular like no like here's what everyone's say we want to get out of Afghanistan and provide free health care for everyone yeah we think that education should be free I'm gonna give you $1,000 a month Yeah right but no one's saying are our whole thing if we looked at it as an ecosystem there's disease spots there's lots where it's not going well sick it's not doing well there's too much crime there's too much pollution there's too much environmental factors whatever that whatever the factors are taking advantage of communities all right those whether it's environmental factors like the water in Flint Michigan or whether it is a crime-ridden streets of Baltimore or Philly or where wherever it is where it's bad but find spots where it's bad those spots have to be addressed but you don't just aggress it with law enforcement you got to figure out a plan to slowly reinvigorate those spots there's no severe poverty left I like what you were saying earlier even about the Italian cities how they do that the momma pop thing you know they keep the money in the community right they haven't sold out to the to the corporation's who were just like draining those those you know those communities right but the thing is it's like so tourism based they kind of don't have to because it's like this the places where I'm going to is like I went to the mall fee coast which is like really popular for ISM and you know you go to these places there's no incentive because there's people there all the time right I'm saying like there's no incentive to give in to corporation instead of like my parents having to go to Costco maybe there's like a hardware store down the street that you know has like I was gonna go to Pete's cuz he's got you know he's got cameras over here so you keep the money in the community yeah I kind of think we're like local grocers that kind of thing you know like oh hey I'm not gonna go to Bonjour arouse I'm just gonna go to you know Edna's because she's got you know the cabbages I like yeah but but if you don't have that then the only thing you got is Target or Walgreens like he's got a deal I'm saying but that's that's you know that's there yes yeah that's those poor communities I'm saying like they're putting those there and they're just draining those people just like you know maybe amazing opportunities that no they think they can thrive in like Italian communities do yeah it's they also make it financially almost impossible to compete like that you can't sell things as cheap as they can right they get better deals if you have a mom-and-pop shop and you're selling like shovels or stuff like that the shuffles would be like five dollars less and that's all anybody cares about that that's a problem yeah right well then how do you build infrastructure then I mean I'm saying sent device parents because like that's gonna like you know help those guys like maybe you know set up the whole family figure out what do we need to do about jr. here or you know little little lady here and let para how we're gonna make them better members of society I like that idea yeah I mean I think that if if we could figure out how much they would get and where the money would come from and if it did work it would be insane yeah I mean you think about how much money you have to spend on the criminal justice system on health care system from assaults and all sorts of things when people go bad yeah and what would you save if by and through incentivizing education and making sure that people get compensated financially for education so yeah and then all sudden it starts booming and then you have way less crime that would be amazing I'm saying bro I mean that that almost feels like it's it's a no-brainer you know I mean you can talk about infrastructure that that's infrastructure Hey Dude bunch run for president that's an awesome idea look I'm obviously a financial moron I don't know if that would actually how much that would cost but if it could be done how much cost I mean like I hear it keeps you know and they keep they keep saying we need to have it but it's like what does that mean is there an is that an infrastructure thing or we just giving people money you send it a weird one because he keeps coming up yeah it's like it comes up then it goes away and that's like hey you know we never fucking sorted this out I mean I'll tell you this I remember on a guy was bully hunter he put on sweater he but it's been more he said white people if you wanna give me reparations my bimbos okay and he made like out of like a hundred bucks and then we went on the road and then yeah we all he bought us skittles iced tea in Hennessey my price for money let's just say you can't do that with the community man do you ever see we're in hotep Jesus walked in a Starbucks Oh Ted he's a man in his reparation coffee interesting character my podcast but the he there was a Starbucks that got busted for telling these young black guys that they had to leave and it would became a big deal where they developed a new policy where they're never gonna just tell people to leave and so the problem with that was it like what about homeless people now you got homeless people inflected to hang around Starbucks and the policy is they can't even tell them to leave right but no these didn't I guess black people - people now Starbuck this story was really it was big in the news that Starbucks was racist and that they had cake so Starbucks it was like apologizing publicly so while that was going on hotep Jesus like I'm gonna go get some free coffee in the coffee he goes I'm here i am i get my reparations coffee I'm here to get coffee for free cuz I heard y'all were racist and so the lady's like yeah I heard that she could pours him a cup of coffee she gives them a cup of car I heard the lovely she heard that there was something racist going yeah socio free coffee to the Silurian hotel Jesus it's hilarious but it's um you know Starbucks you like anybody can go in there now yeah but it's all you know it's whatever coffee you still your big coffee again I'm not a big guy with MIT I'm a black tea guy dude yeah of coffee we got a new coffee from on it called fuck yeah coffee I'm scared to try it apparently did you see it you see the bag have some I've tried it it's fucking ridiculous but it's got caffeine crystals in yeah I didn't know what that meant how much caffeine does it have I couldn't I just made a French press of it so I couldn't tell were you off the wall I I don't even think I think just like we don't think half Ian affects me like normal people does robot Jamie takes edibles they don't do a damn thing really do oh my god have you yeah do not get into an edible eating contest with Jamie yo that's that's a million dollar idea he's red boy you'll kill people he'll he's a robot he just throws them down they don't do a goddamn thing to him is yeah what one out of 20 times maybe a small factory yeah yeah but like a small effect for like 500 milligrams thousand two thousand yen video games and yeah for hours later I was like alright I'm a little tired I'll stop you got ya you got like that gene though there's like a gene that actually let's go back to HIV there's a gene that some like people have like you can't get it yes there's some people you're like that was their movie about that where like they use a guy too cuz he's got the one gene Oh what is that goddamn movie I feel like I've seen it recently oh I did okay here it is it's called the man who shot Hitler and then Bigfoot and I saw it recently it's a Sam Elliot movie it says whoa okay and actually wow it is an interesting movie he came to HSN I enjoyed it I watched it on a flight and I downloaded it I was like what is this right what is the man who shot Hitler and then Bigfoot but I'm a big Sam Elliot fan and it got boosted so I said okay I'll give it a shot it's really interesting okay I mean he I mean it's they're not hiding it he shot Bigfoot and then Hitler the man who killed Hitler and then Bigfoot when did this come out I don't know and he can't get the thing was that he had a very specific gene they brought him back to service because after he'd killed Hitler he's an older man but he had a very specific gene that made him immune to this disease that Bigfoot had and that Bigfoot was sick and that his virus was killing all the wildlife that was anywhere near him and those in dead zone around big when they were tracking him and they had to have someone go in there and kill Bigfoot so they bring in Sam Elliott when he's like 70 years old coil alert to go in kill Bigfoot it's fucking cool enjoyed it man I mean it's not it's not you know 2001 a Space Odyssey but it's fucking cool movie it's a definitely a b-movie I mean do uh it's that Bigfoot where this little shadow thing no they see them pretty up house I mean maybe they don't show it in the preview but it's pretty up close it's gnarly I don't want to say too much yeah don't yeah completely much but he does kill he'll wear yeah well killed Hitler and then and then Bigfoot it says it in the title people really want to kill Hitler that's like a thing that movies are doing huh yeah yeah you know I was watching a video of Hitler tweaking mm-hmm Hitler's on speed you know he did a lot speed yeah he's not the 1936 Olympics and he's sitting in the audience like this like I was like for like apparently somebody had taken it and sped it up and made it unrealistic just to show like make it look like he's really really really tweaking yeah and then it was hard to find for some people to find the actual speed footage but this is this is the actual speed footage they believe so he's just rocking back and forth tweaking Wow he does have crack hit energy that's amazing percent tweaking so I mean there's no way you rock like that from that weekend he's like visu where's his left hand what is happening there he's touching his left hands got a glove he's rubbing a gun on his dick go back see that again replay please look at this how weird is that man how weird is it to see that guy go fullscreen so he jerks off with his gun okay masturbates in a way yes literally this joke about a gun but he's definitely got his hand on his deck he's like a a guy who's freaking out it might mean might as well be a meth head right let me see how they let this guy like I mean look at him he's got something he's touching his dick with see it yeah exactly it looks like his hands curled over it doesn't like he's got something in his hand dude he's rubbing something on his pecker you have a cane yeah always maybe this can hold like oh yeah maybe is that it yeah he's look go go towards the end of it and we'll pause when you can see the hand right next to his dick so weird it's moving no watch watch when you see his hand get that bar out of the bottom there it is over-the-pants hand job look it he's got something in his hand and that's something in his hand is in between his legs you said cane I mean you might be my Google you said I mean you're you were joking about the gun but I mean could be could be I can't could be a Ruger might be a gun I feel like small cane now that I'm looking at it but either way yeah he's definitely rubbing his dick a he tramples on TV just fucking trade relations fuck Jeffrey Epstein fuck all these assholes weekend just weekend could you imagine he knows Jeff right Jeff Epstein apparently knew him look uh apparently they had a falling out over our mansion and I was reading a story about it over a moat like when he sold him oh no they were both trying to buy some super exclusive property that was like the crown jewel on beach it was this six acre mansion that overlooks the ocean it's on the beach it's beautiful it's a hell of a plantation for girls well he's yeah well it's also one of those things where like if you're in a part of these communities there's certain properties that are iconic and to own them it would elevate your social status here Trump bought the mansion digital mobile boom so Alicia I like a name to it the places off the charts if you see if you see it

billionaire character I don't know think of name some famous man it was the Hearst Castle and Hearst Castle for sale there you all be trying to get it Trump and Epstein's friendship reportedly soured after they fought over a 41 million dollar Palm Beach mansion two weeks after the homes auction cops received a tip about underage women in Epstein's house yes I oh shit that was that was Candyland yeah let's see if they have pictures of the place that's like a Taj Mahal look at that thing yeah that's it yeah thanks gorgeous dude it's dope as fuck the images are insane that's it right there click on that look at that place so that you get it they're fighting over who's got the biggest dick on this if you own that motherfucker you bought that place like your king baller everybody wants to have the party at your house right I mean so I guess there's just a few of these type of mansions down in Palm Beach but there's a lot of them I mean there's a you know I don't know what the number is but there's a good solid number of them I mean against TJ that's fucking incredible it's sort of like like the White House well it's sort of like those houses in in Malibu like there's some houses in Malibu you look at like there's one crazy mansion overlooking the sea and then another one next to it like the I know let me I don't live there either oh sure they weren't mostly burnt to a crisp okay

competition no no no can't make years the same size either sorry not noses not eyebrows no your MIDI no eugenics okay yeah you gotta work harder get a little dick to figure out how to get by in this world like you're God's brain and the big dudes man they just don't have the motivation to hardly ever get anything done right they're just too busy slinging dick that's you skirt around them you pass them in the game take them on the inside turn I didn't know that that's what it is alright I guess I don't even got again look it doesn't make sense that there are sloths okay why is that fair they fucking hate it be big though they fucking hate them all can jack by Eagles you know that's fair is when the main thing that eats use a bird and you're a mammal how often does that happen if you're not a mouse it's not a few else in an owl that's hilarious by the way I didn't know yeah that the everybody talk should was lost in the animal kingdom brow they all talk shit on sloths yeah sloths move slow so slow that mold grows on them that's gross it's crazy is it really that's how lazy they are mm-hmm and they just can't be any better they just move real slow that's just what they do and mold grows on them and mole that's gross yeah I was at a Wildlife Sanctuary and like Sylmar I think it is yeah take my kids there and they got a sloth oh my god it's so cute I'm like why is this thing moldy and they're like oh it grows like moss grows on it like that's like a tree like look at that look at all that shit oh my god moss growing on though because they're so goddamn slow that plants can grow on them I mean is that healthy I mean it looks great but good works yeah it's almost like camouflage yeah but that one of the main things that eat them and is it love is this Eagle called fuck what is it called harpy eagle yeah yeah it's a giant eagle that lives in South America that just fucks up slaw just eats lost man sloth me and monkeys - it eats monkeys - but look at that caring sloth - ham I mean well yeah that's a that's not a big sloth oh no it's a big fuck it's a burger yeah yeah I mean look at those thighs yeah dude that thing is all power power and that's that I think that's the biggest eagle yeah the harpy I think that's the biggest eagle I mean damn yeah that's majestic I mean those are small sloth sleaze like baby sloths that it eats know like full-grown no eat a sloth sloth sloth anybody whatever I mean this off can't really defend itself oh my god army okay pushing the armadillos body how crazy is that how crazy is how it can crush the armadillos body with its claws that's one claw it's got it with one hand it's one handing that thing an arm a human arm oh right would tear your meat apart we're so doughy man yeah we're so like was so mushy it would just tear your arm apart just clawing onto your arm like that's why those dudes wear those crazy arm sleeves yeah when they have a falcon on their own right because it was just yeah we're really easy to slice up yeah we have no armor fucking thing with a rabbit whoa look at its legs that thing's badass it is a beast yeah it doesn't look real that one's got a little band on its old leg it's been captured so they're either is that a carving no that's real so they they leave the oh they leave the the rabbit there and it swoops in to get the rabbit it's hard to see what the fuck it is get all those water marks yeah so obnoxious with the water marks I get it bro what is that thing right there is that a fox is about to eat yeah oh yeah it is yeah they eat foxes fighting Hawks because the Fox is fighting their ego over a rabbit yeah Fox fighting over a fox the yeah the Eagle stealing you only eat the eat the Fox you Graham sloth from tree oh is that is that the sloth want to see a video of it yes a video of the sloth because it is kind of fucked up one thing they do do though is they pull they do do so you do have to say do and then do again one thing they do as well is they grab goats and fling them off the side of cliffs you ever see that no well that's hilarious they just sling them off yeah they grab looks more real but I don't know why do they do it yeah that's real bro that's probably real peace but there's video of it they do it to kill them so they could eat them okay I was gonna say yeah all right that makes perfect sense I was wondering why they're doing it they're just assholes that would be hilarious imperfect well that's what cats do you know house cats yeah never seen the numbers of how many animals house cats kill per year you're kidding it's in the billions you're kidding b.b billion beheads kill other animals by why just watch this yeah well we'll show that right after ruff this - look he's dragging the goat off the cliff and then drops it to have it smash against the bars look at that oh and then it hits the ground and then the eagle swoops down and starts eating it so it's like planning on throwing this thing off it understands the consequences it understands that that thing can't fly so it's not just grabbing it swooping down grabbing it broke its neck it's throwing it into the rocks yeah throwing it off the cliff so he can eat it that's brilliant fucking crazy it's brilliant what was the other thing we were just talking about this bird oh those numbers okay the sheer numbers of birds that house cats kill just house cats just marrow out in the backyard yeah just murder oh the murder okay okay I heard her death just jump up and grab birds I had this cat her name a spaz mm-hmm she was a fluff ball cap and she would bring me these birds 1.4 billion there's been a 3.7 billion birds in the continental US each year kill from 1.4 billion to his many 3.7 billion birds just Birds that's not mice thats not squirrels just Birds just Birds I had a cat when I was growing up and he killed a squirrel and was walking across the street with it in his mouth it was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen or just like just carried in his mouth he just his name we Nick we called him kitty mm-hm we were very unoriginal I had a name for him that was like the Black Panther in a Conan the Barbarian book but everybody fucking hated me the veto on it I never called him it they just called him kitty so we eventually just want to call him kitty but anyway kill yourself or walking across the street with a squirrel in between his legs so he had the squirrel by the mouth by its neck rather in his mouth and he was walking with the squirrel underneath them just dragging it with it in between his legs and was almost as big as him that's nuts I'm looking at doesn't mind what a creepy little thing I deal with because squirrels have like plague don't they know yeah it's like that squirrel plague let's go play black plague right wait a minute no squirrels yeah this was like this this is the last decade I think even like maybe even this decade it's the squirrel plague yeah there's like a black plague for squirrels really yeah dude well I know there was a couple I think it was a man and a woman right here we go whoa there we go plague-infested squirrel caused the closure of a California campground this week after it was found during a routine trapping Los Angeles County health officials confirmed actually don't ever touch dead squirrels who veronik play banach play holy shit I think there was I think that's what those people got that ate that Marmot liver uh-uh there was some people that got sick and died from the plague really recently like within the last couple of months mm-hmm because they had eaten a raw Marmot liver a Marmot is like some kind of a rodent they had killed this Marmot and ate its liver and this is here in the States mm-hmm it was in Mongolia I thought was in America it's Mongolian couple died right but they didn't die doing it in America thank God hey to make sure that they didn't come here and get it but this says I thought it I thought the story was they died over here and like they had come over here and try to reenact some sort of a ritualistic meal oh where they eat this raw liver mm-hmm and they ate this raw liver and got the plague son does it say where it happened okay yeah it's like certain countries in Africa to those like you can like eat human right like like cannibal like uh legally mm-hmm I love his legal I know there was like a story I read under something like that about uh these like places in like Africa you can like eat Hume at this ultimate just don't or talk it really is I know no I read about it I be read well do you remember the I don't know if you're saw this the Vice piece on Liberia I think yeah vice guide to travel Liberia weren't they were saying this guy who was his name was general butt naked and general butt naked he'd become a preacher later in life when he was younger but naked yeah when he was young he would go to war totally naked mm-hmm and he would shoot people oh that was indecent no nation was it yeah usually beasts the no nation now okay it's with the aegis Elba he plays like a Idi Amin or a um what's that thing called Kony whatever was anyway he's got these child soldiers basically and yeah they just go for my tribe to tribe and just killed and they just genocide hmm it's got much truck how about that whatever happened with that yeah Kony remember that I think he's still like a warlord but you remember how it was like this gigantic movement it was this big thing that everybody was talking about it and then this one guy in San Diego that was reward of starting in he wound up being naked wandering around the street masturbating in front of people and some crazy that made him like a credible did I make that up he was just along those lines right he he basically had a schizophrenic break or a psychotic break ER I'm not a doctor someone yeah that's the cat yeah they caught him tripod in that but I think you're talk about the same guy like when he went to war like a child soldier yeah he was butt-naked the thing is a different guy because guy his name literally was general butt naked but I think there's a bunch of him that did that but anyway on the Liberia show he said that he busted these street cart guys selling human meat and he said he knew because he knew it meat tastes like because he'd eaten it what the fuck's that he knew that it was human meat he knew it wasn't at work he knew it wasn't beef Liberia is crazy by the way bro I mean like they stay selfs no they have slaves out there imagine the the gall of going to the cops and saying that man is selling human meat well how do you know I cuz I've eaten it I mean fuck fuck would you eat human it depends on what you have to do to stay alive right right like where are you what's that like if you're in that movie alive when they're scooping okay broken spoon yeah like Donner Pass or something like yeah yeah yeah what are you gonna do but then the I'm saying like as a foodie like you know you go to like a restaurant as a food I'm saying like if they cook it up nice you know I mean you get some Tabasco you finally ting a dude's foot oh you got foot soup uh or dick soup oh yeah a dick burger well there was one guy okay there's another there was one guy story there was one guy that I had read about where online he requested that someone kill him and eat him damn this is death wish yeah and I think was in Germany so they met together and got together with a guy the guy cut his dick off and they cooked it and they ate it together he ate part of his dick and then the guy wound up killing him and away so this guy was alive and they cooked an ate his dick mm-hmm okay they ate his dick together they did they did it together it was German it was it was this guy's idea he requested it okay I'm like Craigslist or one of those things let's cut my dick off and then we're gonna eat it and then you're gonna kill me and he wanted he wanted to go to eat him too I think I did eat some of them but there was a question as to whether or not the person's a lot to eat how do you how do you prosecute that what do you do like if someone said I want you to cut my dick off and you cut their dick off I want to cook it knead it and then you both cook it needed I want you to kill me and eat me okay and the guy kills me eats I'm like what is that yeah a regular murder I think I'm reading the same story that manslaughter filmed it oh they filmed it yeah yeah they filmed it of like him cutting his dick up in the eating it yeah I think they filmed the whole murder what's the threshold oh so it's like a snuff film yeah yeah but the guy requested it that's gnarly yeah is that pull it up so we can we could read it this one from 2003 that's right yeah yeah that's that's the one yeah yep from my live body Wow see yeah he posted a personal ad saying seeking well-built man 18 to 30 years old for slaughter well for slaughter he what I offer myself to you and we'll let you dine from my live body not butchery dining whoever really all caps wants to do it will need a real all caps victim all caps mm exclamation point the two started swapping increasingly explicit emails and on March 9th 2001 Braden took a day off work never to return he sold everything he owned including his treasured sports car mmm wiped his computer harddrive and bought a one-way ticket to castle near Frankfurt uh-huh Armin met him off the train they bought painkillers at a chemical shop LA and headed back to the house that first Brandis got cold feet wanted returned to Berlin Muse said but he reconsidered swallowed painkillers and medication to make him sleepy he said now do it Mew set the video camera rolling and went to work with a kitchen knife Wow we went into the bedroom honey say some bad news the bathroom hey say his name's Muse and the muse muse told the police brain is lay in the bath so the blood to flow away and Brenda slowly began to lose consciousness Muse passed the time reading a star track the novel when the berliner finally passed out Muse cut his throat now this is zoomed over a number he was consumed over a number of months thirty kilos of flesh he had put in his freezer used when on the internet in search of a new victim oh so he became like a taste frustrated that he could only find people looking for cannibal role plays music an boasting about Brandes someone from the chat room informed the federal police who swooped in on Armin Meiwes house in December 10th last surprising the coy cannibal then startling the unsuspecting neighbors now that's that uh sociopaths Psychopaths think you were saying earlier yeah because are you a psychopath are you a sociopath that point I mean how do you not feel empathy even for a guy who's telling you to kill you but you're just looking you know to kill somebody because you have a taste for blood now it became his living right yeah I bet whatever he did during the day was boring and I bet that as psychotic as it is was exciting mm-hmm and then he became a serial killer chasing that that feeling yeah what is it Jamie what's the matter oh I found a website that had seven or something interesting facts about this guy this is the first one he sauteed and ate the penis with his victim yeah that was the story right yeah yeah they cooked it together sauteed it Wow look at that image that's not really what does it say like what how they sauteed the penis too chewy for them either of them to enjoy so they proceeded to fry it up with some of his flesh and fat and a bit of garlic that's not that's I guess it's like you're worried about the end right and then you just say I'm gonna take control I'm gonna bring the end on and here it is like we're eating my dick this is over this rock we're eating my yeah this is not gonna last eat my dick and then he goes into the tub to die out from warm water with this dick hole bleeding out mmm just really insane stuff I mean that's really yeah I mean to live through that by the way well you got to think that there's it's just such a wide range of crazy people right and there's some crazy people like that they want to be eaten and some crazy people want to eat and if they find each other now that's that's the beauty of the internet you can do that now you couldn't do that back and you know the Donner era or even the the 90s of them presenting soccer team ate each other how long do you think that guy could could have kept it together if he just ate that one dude before he could find another guy that will let him eat them and write if that was his thing would I stop surpress himself right exactly what do you know would he go Dexter you go clean and that's what I'm saying like that peaceful yeah that shit's fucking terrifying I mean the I mean just to just to go there kill the guy read a Star Trek novel by the way why the guy's bleeding out in the top yeah after you ate his dick that's some psycho guys shit there are pictures of this online oh no no don't do this what I don't want to see ya I was like don't do this whatever you're gonna do don't do this it said yours I didn't seek therapy after they watched the video oh of course they did you imagine being a juror and they forced you to watch that video yeah I don't wanna see anybody yeah I don't see me today and you're the only ones watching it right because you got to think that yeah it's not like they're broadcasting on television I mean on fear of fact you guys did it like a it was always like the big thing of like eating somebody's penis right or something one time daddy eat dicks alright yeah they're like bull dick dyrdek big dick or something like that I forget what the dick car but it was a bunch of different kinds of dicks no you a new dick it's just something something so strange I had a bit about it that like never in my life did I think that I'd be standing in front of a girl with a plate full of animal dicks going you can do it hang in there keep going keep going uh he's you're just you control your mind control your mind coaching them through it nice they're eating a eating pig penis redic but it's like you can't it's not legal to kill yourself it's illegal mm-hmm suicide is illegal and it's not legal to eat people and even if someone tells you to kill them and eat them you're not allowed to even injure me like even like that's assisted suicide right technically you have cannibalism to grow we don't allow that no sleep you manatee she doesn't allow that really yes there's some tribes there's a few tribes still practice right ISM particularly I guess I was reading I'm just not interested in lightness letting look like what a human tastes like well it's probably not good right yeah yeah we love trash cannibalism there's no laws against cannibalism per se but in most if not all states different for enacted laws that indirectly make it impossible to legally obtain and consume the body matter when you put it that way yeah doesn't sound too appetizing if you can get it the body matters somehow wait a minute wasn't there a show on CNN or one of their guys they they wanted him to eat charred flesh like he was examining different religions do you remember something along these lines there was like some outrageous thing it's like Gupta so Jared Lee oh no I don't think it was Sanjay Gupta someone else but there was they were he visited all of these different religions and people that live their lives and different weird ways and wonderful I know the show you're talking about yeah I don't remember that episode yeah you're right it wasn't Gupta it was a another correspondent he eventually got fired for CNN for saying something about Trump which is hilarious sparks outrage after eating human brain in new show it takes like charcoal see the problem with that too by eating a human brain is that I mean maybe these cults or these tribes or whatever is involved with does do that mm-hmm if the brain has prions prions are what gives you mad cow disease oh really yeah you can yeah you can get sick from that and die yucks felled CREP what does that name the vent Jake Chuck Jakob Jakob crux fell disease okay and it's it's basically mad cow disease and you get it from prions get it from brain tissue so any it takes they survive like thousands of degrees yeah crux Feld Jakob disease that's it okay so the most rare degenerative fatal brain disorder and affects about one person so some people get it without cannibalism but it also does happen see one person every million worldwide the United States are about 3 into 50 cases per year crazy so must be like really charred then it doesn't matter I don't think really yeah I don't think it does I still he's still alive yeah but he might not have had the prions of someone who has a disease okay but if he's if that person did that's why it like it has to be the temperature that it has to be cooked at its supposed to be insane I think prions can survive like more than a thousand degrees for a long period of time okay that's one of the fears of like mad cow disease like you really are not going to be able to cook it well enough to that shit from getting in your bloodstream oh yeah look see Google how long Jimmy or Google often change a lot of flesh talk today yeah how well looking up stuff what temperature do prion survive in because I think it's more than a thousand degrees and they can still survive which I remember reading that going oh this is terrible mad cow disease zombies zombies yeah exactly depends I mean I mean you hunt your food so you're not worried about the yeah but you should be worried because this thing called chronic wasting disease and chronic wasting disease is essentially a form of like mad cow disease like very sort of a degenerative disease that affects deer that it's affecting an increasing number of them they're spreading across the country know now it hasn't made the jump to humans yet okay but it could you can't deer the poor man and cannot be destroyed by boiling alcohol acids standard autoclaving methods or a bit more radiation that's um so they're like roaches they'll survive everything well you know what they are they're gods poison okay when gods like enough like no fire no flames no ice no water fixing this yeah this is coming in hot yeah and this is the you can't the ions are forever teens are in the heart to kill Hall of Fame or maybe more common than we realize see this is what I'm talking about so these things this is what affects people who when they get mad cow disease and this is also what it affects cannibals mmm crux felled yucca poor yucca Brooksville you get it the first way good crocks feldy okay crocks failed Jakob disease but it affects cannibals they found out that cannibals in New Zealand New Guinea the animals in New Guinea exhibited the same sort of symptoms as people with spelled Jakob disease Oh Google that Jam you know fuckin he pick animals cannibals that get crux felled Jakob disease those poor cannibals while they're eating brain matter that's what it is yeah just yeah just eat the flesh fries as well as eat the booty yes only only pork but they evolved their resistance to it because there's so much oh my god Wow cannibalism and one Papa New Guinea tribe led to the spread of a fatal brain disease called kuru that caused a devastating epidemic in the group but now some members of the tribe carry a gene that appears to protect against kuru as well as other so-called prion diseases such as mad cow so they along they evolved that generation Wow like a super like a super bud fuckin life finds a way man into E boy loves away and wonder how long it's gonna take before we're physically addicted to phones to the point where you needed to stay alive I mean like you need warm clothes mm-hmm right you know in a cold environment you need a warm house how long before you need a phone like here's the thing the phone's gonna help you okay everything better but I need it so it's like yeah it's almost like I like a heart monitor like I need this you have to have it Wow ah I think generations old and I can access point to the internet instead of a phone the way to access that don't call it a phone called an electron so I mean will neural the phone is only what the access to the matrix which is the internet and that things not real you know unless you live inside of it it's not really yet know I'm strong you in though how often use your phone everyday I mean obviously yeah Wow obviously yeah yeah yeah but it just gives in yeah yeah I'm using on it yeah I'm not saying I'm above it I'm just saying it's and I'm not even sure why they sometimes I'm searching Google News just to see if something's interesting yeah what do you got nothing in politics nothing nothing nothing how about side give me some science come on what do you got for me just constantly instead of thinking about what I'm doing constantly searching for some new data it's weird right it's I mean it's happening a lot yeah I mean yeah we can't get rid of it no I'm here talking but these are the like this generation of kids like this is the two girls one cup generation you know I mean like they get to see it at like five years old on their phone right that's that's got to change so I think when you're saying that's gonna take generations I mean it could be what a few generations removed from like where they you just you don't know any better if you don't have a phone wow so we beat the face as a death generation because I got parents probably ever saw it shit but we definitely did they saw in the war son they saw they saw in person we saw it on tape you were there man the first bitch-ass generation I mean look I mean my generation yeah we're definitely the chasis well when you go back to like World War two it everybody was signing up right right knows everything yeah people just signed up for the war but then they got around to Vietnam I was like what yeah well while we were there how could we do it yeah they manipulated that war though so that was their world war two you IQ you know Pearl Harbor happen you know there's no Pearl Harbor that happen for Vietnam even 9/11 like you know like the guys who signed up to go you know quote-unquote fight those terrorists you know this faction of dudes like how many guys came back from war world World War two with horrific memories right remember Sam Ryan yeah that was one of the best depictions of historical event and to put it into like real perspective what it probably was like when those guys are getting gunned down on the beach yeah you thought you were yeah you didn't know if we're gonna be you or not yeah it's also whoa this is real as fuck and then imagine leaving then coming back and like you just had to be normal yeah cuz most movies that we saw about war like go back to like John Wayne movies about war they were never gory is like bang hold the stomach you didn't see anything and then later even in movies like Apocalypse Now I mean they're still wild it still gave you this feeling of war but there was never anywhere near the gore of that scene in Saving Private Ryan you see people with their legs blown off and their guts hanging out you're like holy shit that's war that's what a war that's war if we never saw that you never see that unless you're there in the war or unless you're watching a movie like that because the movies that whitewash it they give it this feeling of like yeah I think what they're exposed to as far as their entertainment in the 1940s and then boom you're there and you're seeing real war I mean they'll fucking they'll scare you straight like why would you want to go fighting that they were scared the Germans taking over the world they said the world from the Nazis that's one of those rare they're able to put it save the world from the nuts it's rare wars where it's not that it's not that sloppy it's a pretty clear right you got a real these guys are yeah they're evil right wire you've a legitimate evil empire that's killing people they killed six million Jews yeah or whatever the number is what is the number they always they I said five million one time is some of you correct they always correct it's always six million whenever the number it's some insane number of millions of people were killed by this one group of humans genocide and and there was some something that history and pictures are one of the one of the Twitter accounts i retweeted a few days ago that had they showed all these SS officers laughing and with like kids in their laps and the caption was something to the effect of don't ever think that the people that you think of as monsters are not human like humans are k people regularly capable of horrific monstrous behavior if they all agree to it and so it showed these SS officers and they just look so normal and laughing and hahaha meanwhile there's these Jewish skeleton people in there in a cage just a few yards over well that would uh I think what a cabaret is about kind of right I was watching that of the movies on CNN yeah they're kind of saying like cabaret is like it's it's showing how like like all these funny like nice people and they just be there not sees I didn't see that movie in that movie I forget who's anybody knows like a musical Eisenmann there we go wow I never saw it it was really all about yeah I didn't know that either i watch that I've learned about it through Tom Hanks's the movies on CNN well you've obviously never seen the man who killed Hitler and then Bigfoot is my guy you understand why the Nazis are so bad yeah it's we haven't had you know you're right we haven't had somebody's evil as the Nazis right right but they tried to make guys like that you know you know Kong Saddam Hussein bin Laden but that one was clear-cut like yeah that was oh Jesus let's go get Hitler gonna stop this yeah this motherfucker when you see him scream in front of the crowd like yeah why would you follow that they're all high on fucking methamphetamines aren't they though let's say yes eat dead Nazis he was tripping any of him he's definitely tripping yeah he was rubbing his cane on his dick this weekend but a whole country's into that they're just like yeah this is our guy we're gonna do whatever he says yep yeah they didn't even know yeah they didn't even know like what it meant to have someone like him run a country back then how drugs like pervitin and cocaine-fueled the Nazis rise and fall Wow despite Hitler's anti-drug rhetoric Nazi Germany used a little courage pill called pervitin to take Europe by storm and it turns out it was pure methamphetamine why is pervitin methamphetamine hydrochloride who made that it looks like the fucking Germans did because it's yeah I know I'm saying like who like what company what companies making perfect in some Nazi company okay so they were just giving out everybody math yeah head of messed up country that'll kill six million Jews yeah okay it says still couldn't dick ditch an access power meeting so Hitler's personal physician injected the Fuhrer with a drug called yuca doll think oxycodone combined with cocaine to perk him up so physician took a significant risk in doing so after all Hitler was prone to latching on to addictive substances and refusing to let go but in this case the injection seemed warranted Hitler was doubled over with violent spastic constipation refusing to speak to anyone immediately after the first injection and despite his doctors wishes a revived Hitler ordered another injection Hitler then left for the meeting with the gussto of a soldier half his age okay so it was like yeah he was messed up man yeah that was taking like super pills or whatever he's faking liquid cocaine and meth and oxycodone Hitler reportedly spoke for several hours without stopping yeah at the meeting with Mussolini Hitler reportedly spoke for several hours without stopping the Italian dictator who sat massaging his own back dabbing his forehead with a handkerchief and sighing had hoped to convince Hitler to let Italy drop out of the war he never got the chance the wording as well my god so he imagined being poor Mussolini you're over there talking to Hitler he's method out of his fucking mind and you're trying to tell him look Italian we don't want to go to war we want to back out of this would like to just uh kick it back we you know we hope for the best and Hitler comes over all messed up have you heard where else we curse yes okay here it says Jamie's trying to show us this this is what he won't let it go yeah this is what one episode made Hitler's all's daily drug use which included barbiturates hey old school bull semen bull semen bull semen testosterone opiates stimulants such as pervert in a courage pill so he was taking meth isn't bull seem like taurine or whatever pulls semen story okay like sounds like it would be yeah like red bulls like it's supposed to be like something is supposed to be like small bulges yeah bulges yeah take that red bull yes again some serious don't I've heard Tory am i right is he right taurine is bull semen oh my god bro is here yo greedy and I think monster Rockstar and other energy is an organic molecule not an amino acid for named for the Latin Taurus which means ox or bold because originally taurine was extracted from Bulls red bull semen so originally taurine was extracted that way but it is an ingredient in bull semen okay so the taurine and red bull probably doesn't come from bull semen but taurine is in bull semen okay so Hitler was getting his taurine right from the tap the best way is to suck up on the dirt you get it from the tap when it is fresh the 700 pounds more potent the furious just gets down there they they hold the ball back with straps and buckles it's kicking and Hitler gets his sloppy Nazi mouth right over that fat oh and that is apparently the origin of that upper lip mustache catch all the succulent drops when he's choking on jizz flavor savor and that giant bull dick is pummeling the back of his throat and uh fills it up that when he comes out of his nose because a lot of the jizz comes out of his nose that's just enough mustache to catch the jizz so that's why he had that mustache a lot of people don't know I believe that many people have a guy I mean like numbers just all ever just cracked out it's a perfect kiss catching mustache oh if you think about it if it's coming out of your nose which it does do right like milk does hey bro right you know you coughed when you drink it it comes out of your nose so steam is coming out of your nose as Hemans coming on you know it he's just he's catching it savoring it no you're saying I mean I'm just saying how many people were in Germany at that time how many people were in millions were SS soldiers on one day that's a good question right how many people actually joined yeah well I think you had to be a part of it right right otherwise who the Hitler Youth as well yeah it was a whole yeah the whole society was that here's all yeah it became Nazi Germany National Socialist what is it it was the actual what is Nazi actually stand for I mean didn't shut up for seven hours dude National Socialism I guess that's a National Socialist German Workers Party is what it wasn't well so they were socialists now imagine poor Mussolini then he killed more people I don't know how many he killed how many Mussolini Stalin didn't he killed him oh he killed him oh yeah he's yeah he's like he's cookies Kareem abdul-jabbar of mass he's got the voice record dick man how do you when you're a person like that you didn't used to be a Stalin Yeah right you were just a person then Austin you're in position of power and then all of a sudden you're responsible for the death of untold millions of people oh yeah almost tens so Mao is the most by a long shot okay look at now it's Hitler and then Stalin 17 yeah no Mussolini on the list okay but Mao that mile was like 400 million right okay go Google Mao might have been responsible for 400 million because there was an article I was reading really four hundred million people that's that's a revised the amount of people that they think or were dead directly because of Mao okay also I getting direct authority directly killed 100 people some insane number of people were killed during Mao's reign what are they saying that's great there was a place called mouths kitchen five million maybe maybe I added a zero to it leap forward maybe I added a zero most likely so forty five million and the other ones had seventy so the eight so it's between 45 and whatever the other number is but doubt so he's number one with a bullet he's the guy responsible for the most deaths during his time again though there was a there was a kitchen there was a restaurant here in Los Angeles called Mouse kitchen Jesus that's disrespectful as fuck Tyson has Mao on his arm Oh does all I mean you know he wants to kill people why was in when I was in jail I think to probably read some philosophy from now I mean yeah those guys I mean those guys right think they write good books well my Kampf is uh it's pretty good oh is it did you read it and write in English uh be allowed to read it now like when you read it you're probably like if you brought I don't think you can buy it today but he tried to buy mine off on your Kindle if you're like sales stuff it's like it's a little it's just like talking about the sale I mean it's obviously talking about you know killing Jews but I'm talking about the sale of it's just it's talking about how they can overcome and it's like his struggle is basically just it so it is a propaganda book but it's like it's from a sales perspective you're just like I see where he's coming from not saying that I'm condoning it but I'm saying you're like okay there's so much passion in it mmm the only man like a moment it's like memoir so he's selling to the people that they can overcome the economic situation he's in and they could rise yes and if you tried to buy that today to read it yeah people assumed I was young I read about the one kid I would think it was on Amazon but come on son you know you're on a list you I am no I read in the library if you buy it today right yeah first you might better a flag you're on a list now oh yeah for sure if you buy it Dukes of Hazzard DVD set you're on the list if it's one on the cover the one with the generally leaping over the fucking canyon with the Confederate flag flag clearly book that I think it was the maybe the one you talked about a lot but I remember in the 98 nineties you people were saying if you went to the bookstore to buy this book you're on a list and you had to go buy with cash and like wear a hoodie and cover your face stupid rumors yeah what was the book I think it was the cross book that you've talked about the sacred cross sir oh the sacred mushroom in the cross was it really that's the one I would heard of it could I'm that my rumor might get passed around yeah do you remember a Course in Miracles of course in miracles' is a book that was going around I want to say in the early early 90s there was a bunch of people that were telling you to read some book by this couple and they were channeling and angel wrote this book and yeah it's one of those books were like I don't know if it was any good because everybody that recommended it was so annoying Pray Love or was that the other one the the secret Lois extremely spiritual air quotes okay and it was all about how to live and it might have been it might be an amazing book but I remember everybody that wanted to recommend it I always had leg up alright that might yeah and I was a young man at the time and I was very dismissive about a lot of things I wouldn't be dismissive of today but that I remember it was like one of those books where annoying people loved it you've gotta read this book right there yeah it's like this book transformed me it's a gift I'm giving you this book because I want you to read it and it's gonna transform you Wow see me give my love to you maybe I'm reading a book about someone who said they were channeling an angel and that's nonsense all right about that I'm a how about I have to think about the fact it's a nonsense person on a website for it foundation for inner peace look at look at the light oh it looks like the Dianetics yeah it's very cold ish but is the what's the origin of it is it does it am i correct did it come from someone who like channeled an angel or so I'm sure like that you know that the idea well let's Google what is the origin containing curriculum aiming at assisting readers and achieving spiritual transformation am i conflating this with some other book we were talking about in color someone was almost the same but where someone said that like someone wrote it for them that it was like written as they were channeling oh really like Oh Oprah to talk about it in 1982 did they say that and why am I making this up two quick so listen Oprah's Book Club son Johnny Carson - awesome Wow split got around 90 Bribie I don't think gonna follow it and find it from there just Google what is the origin story for a course of miracles of course in miracles' but it was one of those books where you'd like if you were dating a yoga teacher boomer house you write a coffee table on your way to the vegan restaurant let's go how makes you think like if the Nazis do win that does become like the coffee book my comp yeah you know if the Nazis wants super inspirational an inner voice she identified as Jesus began interacting with her and acted as a stimulus triggering us our experiences that were understood dirt to her as that and that's what you so the same goes the Mormon Bible said the same math yeah yeah so it's that's what it is so I'm correct so it's like a Bible well it's like one of those things like maybe that happened right maybe that happen I mean sold some books maybe you're crazy yeah we're maybe you're out of your fucking mind and you want people to think that you're special so you wrote these rules on how people should live and they're pretty good they're resonate well it makes sense cuz you're not so much the original bible - yeah yeah % crazy but this is good structure where we assume that if someone tells a crazy story like that they're a hundred percent crazy right I got any good ideas like you could be a fuckin crazy person with a couple good ideas mm-hmm like - fuckin crazy but I'm telling you they said JK Rowling was crazy oh she's gotta be crazy you know so this she's getting a lot of shit right there are little boys yeah it's are you writing about yeah little boys and magic magic you could be a little girl if he with those little boys everyone to be happy and happy and happy like you can be a woman and do that right you can be a dude and do that because then you're like yeah dude writing about little boys yeah not good that's definitely that's a flex I'm able to get away with it right mm-hmm dr. Seuss I was going about like Huckleberry Finn and those boys I thought that you're gonna snort that I was like oh well this this meth talked mushroom elixir oh you want some it's gonna do to me like me lion's mane juice me up no no it's good for the brain no perfect it doesn't taste bad either thank you why is that actual lines man yeah lines me a mushroom not lions like a lion lion right well it's a mushroom just drink it all the time and I feel like I'd be rude if I don't want to do something so I was incorrect something you asked me earlier UFC 21 was when that changed there was a significant role change and they joined out at the Council of mixed martial arts commission yeah you know c21 prelim bouts it had two rounds there were only five minutes then three five-minute rounds and championship rounds to change the five minutes they also that's when they added a 10-point must system so premium rounds were two rounds championship rounds were three chamber tips were five yeah everything else was three Oh before that cuz there were so before that it was two though you said but this was also pre Dana and prefect ITA's so they were still mixed like the Gracie stuff they were doing it so they just had five minute rounds until the thing was over unlimited five minute rounds that's right I remember that shit that was that was madness but it wasn't as bad in terms of badness as the Japanese ones the Japanese ones were fucking crazy they did so many nutty things yeah they had so many like crazy freak shows and they still do have this lady named Gabby Garcia she's like six foot to 240 pounds Amma's and they have her fighting like housewives she beats what his ladies and it's all consensual right like when they're signing up yeah okay they like freak shows right I mean yeah look at their game shows yeah exactly what is going on with that it's just because I think there's such a repressed country aren't they I think so yeah I think this is like I don't think they have like bending machines where like guys have like there's Gabby look at that she's spitting up housewives they're gonna look at the guns yeah well pull up a video of her giving a swan oh that's Ronda Rousey that's not real this is real ask Abby that's fights real so look at the size of that woman that she has to fight I mean like what is up with the definition though um Mexican supplements okay hundred percent nice I don't use get keep it 100 [Music] yeah bigger than your trainer like Wanderlei Silva yeah that's nuts that's crazy yeah she's a big lady yeah but so anyway Japan love that was when she was real thin yeah at one point in time she'd gotten like real ripped and small and then got right back up to gigant I again to win in these fucking Japanese events she and I UFC no she fights for I think I don't know which one mate might be rising it doesn't say which one but yeah why shouldn't like a so I mean look she's bigger than I go with every female in UFC yeah she's giant so she's gonna though she's in the division yeah she's dying she's just six to cheese I mean she's in the 240 pound weight class somewhere like this is a heavy weight be weighted a nail right you can't yeah Gabby oh maybe there's no no heavy weight female weight class is her a couple weeks ago she's not that big anymore oh she's shrinking down hey good for her what up still probably 200 pounds damn okay so she's jacked and tan again she looks great then yeah look good she's strong as full yeah and she's a world champion jiu-jitsu player too so she grabs a whole these girls Paul Muslim but they had Bob Sapp back in the day like I said he was like 375 pounds it was fighting guys were in like the 200s yeah smash so many people there was so many guys like that that fought in Japan when they have these freak shows I mean crazy I saw one the other day like that thing we're like a like a woman and her nipples are just like almost like like cones and it's like the game shows like these guys are just like put their fingers and that is wild I mean they're just so many wild things in Japan like you can see it's gnarly bro well they are the birth of a lot of those crazy game shows right I mean a lot of the game shows like even Fear Factor like that have even happened if it wasn't for the crazy Japanese shows what's in the water with it make him think like that and we were saying they were oppressed but it's also I mean why they so repressed yeah seeing bazooka man uh Zuka man was a Japanese game show where a guy with a bazooka would show up at people's houses okay like a real live bazooka lick with like missile in bed okay be in bed sleeping and bazooka man would shoot the bazooka at your wall above your head while you're asleep this is a real film it what they're filming this new explodes like your head shoots a rocket launcher through your fucking wall oh man this guy's yeah they wake up fucking screaming there's a hole in the wall above the head and the audience in Japan's like hahahahahaha you can find it you can find the videos bruh Jamie you'll find it what is that that's a really different name okay maybe rock and man okay so I pretty sure was bazooka man and it's a real rocket whatever it is it's firing out of a cannon that's on his shoulders and it's hitting the wall that explodes right Google Japanese game show where they blow up wall behind I mean how do you have like a heart attack and like when you wake up like that's all I get asleep yeah usually could yes I'm saying I mean you must like sound like a death warrant before you uh for sure you could definitely get a heart attack though Jesus unless there's like dead asleep and they all signed up for this is all consensual basically okay face down I don't think they signed up for it I think they're just allowed to do stuff like that then they give you money okay if you survive right well I don't think they have the same concept of lawsuits that we do over here you know okay you got it no no I'm my way to finding it though I found one this is called the bump show where girls would put their bum in a hole and a guy would kiss it or either ass yeah basically right on TV hmm okay can't comment on that one they have different ways of living they really do have a different style can't hate it can't be hating on them Jesus is it China or Japan where they have like they have like these crazy work hours right like like like factory workers or like you know just like the whole economy it's just like work all the time and they have bending machines where you can just like pocket pussies basically oh yeah and like the guys were just yeah they'll just use those things they'll toss them oh and just go back to work oh yeah Wow I wanna say it's that's Japan I could be but they both have they're both known for their work yeah hours right you know so like sex just isn't a part of the other routine I was watching some documentary on or reading something rather on wall way mm-hmm I'm always a Chinese phone company and the guy had a bed underneath his desk this craziest image he's in his cubicle and his stuff is above him and he's got a bed laid out under his cubicle and he's asleep was like glasses at work exhausted it's like a 18 hour day probably yeah making cell phone so we could take selfies like Charlie has like the biggest economy though the biggest yeah don't they did a Monday number one oh yeah the Chinese I've been pretty right on this whole episode Joe very right right damn mmm so largest economy China yeah and what's number two its American number two because that's something needs to tell Trump oh he keeps saying number one yeah yeah sorry do I hurt anybody that didn't know that but China is number one depends on what you're using a gauge economy as a general it's like not as the thing no it's not subjective I'm sorry or you know not giving people because it says our GDP is nineteen point three nine trillion and China's is 12 which is their nominal but over more people I guess it's 23 trillion so that's technically higher I swear guys I don't know what you want to okay yeah yeah yeah what you're basing your economy so GDP we're killing it but as far as largest economy it's the Chinese and AI way more people live okay so that's probably why though there's large kind of maybe because they more people a billion humans right yeah did India big are they the biggest country still China that's another good question yeah I think it's close not race China India other stuff from earlier this year saying in China and India are gaining on the US as the world's top economy or they're poised to take over next year I don't think max really just depends on what you want to imagine Trump is onto something with all these sanctions hmm imagine you're talking with the that health insurance thing earlier I learned a weird thing a British comic it told me I was over in London last year doing the the roast battle over there and he was like you know like you guys don't have free health care he's like but your health care is better he's like usually when I get like he had like a bronchial thing he's like normally takes like two weeks for that secure over here he's like went to America to play 48 hours mmm says we're paying for just the better drugs that make sense not just better drugs but like probably more motivated doctors but she's getting paid but are they more motivated to keep people in and out of their office and shuffle them quick and stuff them up with pills versus we're in England they're not motivated by like a quota right maybe they're just just trying to help maybe it's different because they get paid a certain amount and healthcare is free and they're not motivated to earn additional profit by you know suggesting surgeries or making someone get on medication I don't know yeah but it's all I mean if you're talking about a listen element I'm a doctor I'm making money over here right when you want to keep a guy you know sick as possible you can make more money out of them yeah but that's like they can't some dark conspiracy type thing definitely how many people are really thinking like that all right I'm saying like two weeks didn't credited like 48 hours if there's just a shittier system yeah that's what I'm saying maybe the argument to be made that profit based systems are more efficient because people are more aggressive because they want to they want to make money they get things handled quicker in they believe in it more it's almost like I'm getting what I paid for maybe yeah I don't know I mean I think it would be nice if people didn't go out without health care though the problem is like the idea that health care is not a human right well if that's not a human right what else to do it's hurt you just gonna let them die because they don't they don't contribute enough change you know they didn't put enough money in them in the box and basically bankrupt now because I got a great name it seems crazy that we would somehow or another key people from medical care mm-hmm you don't have enough money like that should be like the number one thing that they care food and medical care food shelter medical care those things you know basically in that order yeah the fact that medical you're on your own like Wyatt how come we can't pay for that well we can pay for though this and pay for the that we can fund that and fund this and we're gonna go to the moon and yeah yeah but you gave yeah but you can have health care yeah but then again it's like people are so resistant to socialism like they don't want anybody taking over the Nazis weren't no they fucked up don't look where that ended that's true terrible no they're all they're all not that's true they're messed up maybe non messed up somehow but the problem is people are almost all messed up here now with the fucking adderall thing yeah oh yeah or the other on Downer's like xanax dude yeah one of the other but the adderall might as well be math got me it's labor Sam yeah it's cocaine it's it's an fad me yeah it's an amphetamine it's fucking straight-up amphetamine you know and some people it helps some people who works wasn't but other people they just chew it all day long and talk crazy talk crazy told me at the mouth crazy I mean runs against them coke is the most annoying drug I mean in it yeah it's the worst yeah this is all annoying slow because the big people are just talking about nothing the whole time you know we talk to you yeah talk right in your face super pumped up like Hitler imagined they injected Hitler the two doses of oxycodone and cocaine yeah the doctors like you what can teach you again directly to Mussolini's house like oh god he's so annoying coke-fueled five-hour rant and rant poor Mussolini yes wanna make a pizza hang out I won't go to Capri when they go fishing with my grandson yeah it was just like know that you just losing his mom oh my god imagine that this whole thing was fueled by meth like that was responsible for the whole fucking chaos of it all because if you stop and think about history there's obviously been some horrific you know campaigns well whether it's Alexander the great mm-hmm Genghis Khan what are they on you know right that sounds gonna say like if these guys in the Nazi Party we're all on meth that makes total sense they were so psychotic yeah dude what would the fuckin Mongols on well they just drunk yeah was that yeah it was like were they with that the opium didn't time that wasn't dens I know yeah they definitely must have no pian Dems right yeah it must have had that is that their era I mean the Genghis Khan opions been around forever right everybody had opium but it's what did but L so that mellows you out though right and though I should make you a killer Wow the Vikings were into mushrooms which is we really yeah excited elk mushrooms psilocybin yeah okay they would take psilocybin they would fucking go on Crusades start smashing heads well that's what I mean well they're also you know they're grown to be like that so I think yeah yeah so I was gonna take you where you want to go yeah because it's also it's their world their world is like cutting and slashing right like they're not the idea of that not being there that's not even an option exact yeah have you talked about Valhalla so I mean that's what they're thinking about they're just like we're just killing people that's like it's heaven like we get to we get to kill everybody what a crazy reward from murder yeah you go to a heaven and you drink with Odin yeah gonna go to Valhalla can people apart these swords just can't wait to see Odin it was watch that show Vikings now people tell me it's great though is a great really fucking good man up until like season four or five mrs. Rogan how to stop no it did shake anymore a lot of fucking pretty extreme violence it gets you can't handle it it gets a little gnarly and there's not the combat sports guy is not enough good people okay root for that's the bike everybody's kind of a piece of shit why am i watching these piece of shits rape and murder each other and the brothers return on brothers I mean it's dark yeah those like those like the true Caucasians right yeah oh yeah there the message northern warriors the ones who escaped from the southern climates and figured out how to survive and the coldest fucking places in the world oh yeah and there's a there's like a nature rule that'll wrote like a law in terms of like the size of things that live where it's cold hmm so like if you have a deer in Mexico it might be a hundred pounds but if you have a deer in Saskatchewan it might be like 300 pounds because there was a species there's something about real cold climate makes things grow bigger and stronger because that's that's like it's reacting to the environment right yes yeah it's something about body temperature as well that they in order to maintain body temperature that you need a lot of mass and so like polar bears of the base of the bears right they live in the coldest fucking place in those Caucasian Vikings are the biggest dude in Iceland motherfuckers yeah Icelandic just giant dudes if that mountain from Game of Thrones he's a guy right yes yes that's what that is that's gnarly that's gnarly and he want to play basketball Oh play basketball you seen him in man yeah basket boat no no cat no I don't think he knows how to fight there was a video of him sparring with Conor McGregor huh Conor McGregor's fucking him up what yeah that guy yeah and Conor mean Conor's not he's not weighing in so he's probably in about 170 okay and Game of Thrones guys easy three three yes I would imagine he's in the 320 340 range and he's like a bodybuilder too so he's like chasing you Connor and Connor crack him in the stomach it's kind of a crazy video to watch v 9 this guy's what six seven he's taller than $5.00 might be five that might be 510 I'm 5/8 I won't disrespect you Conor McGregor oh he's a beast yeah you get the heart of an eight-foot person he doesn't give a fuck yeah I mean the guy fought Floyd Mayweather with zero professional boxing fights yeah just stop and think about that no he's 0 he took zero so he's legit so here's Conor probably about a buck 70 look at the size difference yeah and they're like sparred and Connor's moving around he's punched him in the stomach magnatag's trying to grab him but Connery let's let him grab but he's not doing anything he's controlling the guys trying to do something really spawning ground oh yeah yeah yeah guys try to grab him but he does know what he's doing and then he's like high-fiving cars like no no no keep going dude we're gonna keep going so now he starts kicking them so it's kicking him in the stomach leave it see he's punch him in the stomach and the big guy doesn't know what to do he's trying to grab him but he can't as like come on lot I'm gonna keep going monster yeah so prompt honor knows that this big motherfucker can't keep this up you can't keep it out he's not he's not able to keep up this pace so he's already hurting I mean he's already tired me come on yeah he's going back and forth no no no first of all he's just got to a minute he's not used to sparring right okay so everything he's doing is like these big movements and he's not breathing well so he's all tense and tight so right now one could take a deep breath see how this is tension for him he's very tense so now he's got all the leg but he doesn't know what to do yes Conahan fights with them all Connor has to do is keep it moving Connor in the stomach there you go and they're kind of like oh okay okay so Connor is gonna keep going oh nice try kicks out him and I guys didn't kick him in it can't believe it yeah it'll be too awkward no no Cano trip him throw him to the ground or something like that he doesn't know how to kick but kind of just can't keep punched him in the stomach but he eventually just gets really really tired and he gives up but it's kind of crazy to watch because Connor essentially made him fight see like he put the guy's knees just like that cop guy yeah that was that was that was the big the victim with the cop he goes knees and Connor didn't didn't allow him either kasnian when the body look at this bro he's gangster he's needing him and punched him in the body I mean there's a real kick so it's really like neat wow that guy is so much bigger than that yeah he's a monster so yeah he's not doing it in a training well that's I mean he could it wasn't there I mean he just doesn't know what to do yeah but if he learned it what to do Connor would never do that yeah that guy's a he's a walking weapon like liking gone Oh Francis and gonner who's probably one of the biggest heavyweights in the UFC mmm Connor would never do that with him yeah the Train yeah he's a fighter giant striker he'd fuck him up but that guy I got it know what he's doing no the mountain though he's a he was a basketball player he went to play basketball then he broke his uh his ankle or leg or something and every like healed properly and he just became a bodybuilder and then they put him in Game
