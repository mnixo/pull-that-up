the Joe Rogan experience they say that infinity is so intense like the idea of infinity this is the best way to wrap your head around it if infinity Israel that means that in the universe not only has everything that we've said in the exact same order and the exact same pauses and the exact same timeframe and fuckup of words or slip of the tongue it's happened exactly that way in exactly that order an infinite number of times not just one but an infinite number of times that everything that's ever taken place down to the millisecond has not just happened once somewhere else but infinite times somewhere else Wow that's how big infinity is that's what no end means that's so weird like just like when you're doing some mundane thing like jerking off coming to porn this is an infinite loop of jizz that's happening oceans oceans of jizz you could just see like just a universe filled with you squirting ah fractal like literally a universe that's real like so the sky would be absolutely filled from Horizon to Horizon with with you coming more than all that come from all the Duncans and all over the world at once drenched the earth we would drown and semen Oh how's the entire population would drown we'd be coated in like a million miles thick of cum because if you think about what infinity means how many different Duncan's would be coming there's no end to it now so one ounce of cum equals a hundred billion oceans filled with come instantaneously raining down upon those oceans would be filled with more Me's coming it's not only that the universe itself would not be big enough to contain the Earth's size just from the sheer amount of calm it was covered in yeah it would push the atmosphere way past the Sun it would light the earth on fire and turn into a big come one of those one of those fucking hush puppies a big hush puppy when the calm got Sophie touch the side in the deep-fryer it's so big it touches the Sun and then puts the Sun out and presses out into the outer galaxies that's how much come an infinite amount of people coming and then some like you did some God Chef would just come and eat it it's just a cooking show and then you know he lives in another world where you're coming on and it just goes on forever no that's how you impregnate the Sun you fill a planet with pom stop up a black hole we don't know what to do about a black hole we're gonna get an infinite amount of Duncan's to come in it well it's you know masts broken down to the stock being force-fed while she's lying on her back snots going down into her eyelashes that's the universe so symbolic so symbolic of gag porn you're coming to a black hole this the fucking hole of van arrives and starts sputtering you know that's spinning the spinning of the black hole absorbing matter it's all choked up like a fucking like a like a dishwasher disposal system with a spoon in it you know where those garbage disposals the spoon put your hand in there unn stop it do you think and that's how the universe was created infinite come an infinite convolute went into a black hole do you think that ever come into a black hole in the future oh yeah if we live long enough someone's gonna want to do that they're gonna wanna be the first guy some Richard Branson type makes me the first car to show the world I want to inspire you the you to can come in a black hole him with fucking black socks on so I always come he sends like a shuttle from his pod yeah all into the next shuttle and he's wearing an Aquaman t-shirt it's way too small and he's a little slightly embarrassing roll of fat pulls down to the bottom like a little waterfall and he's just jerking off with his black socks on into it you never know till you try I seek to inspire I'm seeking to inspire you that YouTube's a humble man [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
