four three two one boom guy will thing going on here now well circle Oh Jeff Merry Christmas what's up Joe you two not been the easiest weekend in my life for my career's last week but hanging in there to make this stand alone so that people don't have to go figuring this out on their own and I'm sure many many fans are tuning and already know that the gist of the details let's lay this out from the beginning Jon Jones initial failed test yeah so that was July of 2017 he tested positive for approximately 20 anywhere from twenty to sixty pica grams of a long-term metabolite known as the m3 metabolite of a substance called de hydrochlorothiazide own THC MT also known as oral Torino ball and this was over a year ago what was determined to be the source of this stuff never determined what the source was so John went through a full arbitration hearing was never able to determine where it came from tested all the supplements he was using you know went through many interviews with you sada had a full on arbitration hearing the source was never determined where it came from why was his suspension so low or so short well it wasn't a termined so I mean there's many factors that go into what that suspension was I would argue in the toe-tap totality of the evidence that was presented in that arbitration that it wasn't a short suspension because really one key thing came out at arbitration so John went to arbitration before an individual by name of Richard McLaren Richard McClaren has an arbitration group up in Canada and McLaren is probably worldwide known as one of the most credible guys in anti-doping I know you had that the Icarus producer director on the McLaren report was the report that came from all that he basically investigated the Russian state being involved in doping and Sochi games and put out actually a series of reports on it detailing it up to 1,000 Russian athletes you know we're breaking the rules and the Russian laboratory was helping them get around it so he's a very very respected guy he's independent of obviously the UFC he's independent of you sada he acts on his own and his determination was his determination and I'll read you kind of what he said he said I find that all evidence available to me leads me to conclude that the violation was not intended nor could it have enhanced the athletes performance so a non intentional so non-intentional ingestion I mean there's no argument that it was in his system but he found the evidence to show non-intentional use and then he went further saying that based on the numbers of what he saw in the evidence there was not even a performance enhancing benefit afforded to Jon for having this long term metabolites in his system and I think that's significant when you talk about hey 15 months was that that's you know kind of light being that this is the second time through I would argue that if there was an argument that maybe it's on the higher end and certainly you know we'll talk about the California Commission Andy foster took that position in John's recent California hearing he was a little bit critical of you sada he thought you know he's intimately familiar with his evidence both in the previous case and this occurrence that and he also saw that there was no evidence that an independent arbitrator you know made this statement and decision of John intentionally cheating so if anything you know I'd say that potentially there could be an argument that that it was you know on the higher end versus the lower end because of the fact that it was an unintentional ingestion exactly now what is Jon's excuse what is what is Jon said how he got this into assistant yeah well look you know and it's detailed in the arbitration hearing at all Jon Jon fully admits that you know some of the lifetime lifestyle decisions he was making you know the partying and things you know probably did not lead to to making smart decisions and making smart choices in terms of what was being ingested in the body but certainly his testimony was under oath that I have never intentionally cheated and did not intentionally put this substance in my body and not only this case but as we talked about the subsequent case here I think you'll see that based on the numbers you know coming out of his tests and based on some studies that have been done on some of these substances it would tend to support that okay correct me if I'm wrong but didn't John test negative then test positive for extremely low numbers this is the initial test before we get into the most recent filter he did so that's negative then test positive very shortly after with a very small trace amount correct so he had two negative tests on July 7th and July 8th I believe of 2017 and then way and day I think it was July 28th he was positive for a very low level of the M 3 metabolites and and we might as well start here so again going back to Icarus so remember remember the doctor I mean he's the main character than that were chenkov in 2011 he put out a study on oral tour in a bowl he actually my understanding is dosed himself and then studied the excretion of his urine and what was coming out of it over the weeks and months after and determined that there were multiple may be up to 50 metabolites that once this D HCM tea was ingested into the body the body converted into other substances and he was these metabolites stayed around he identified some short-term metabolites some medium-term metabolites and some long-term metabolites specifically the m3 that John's tested positive for so these long-term metabolites would indicate that it was taken a long time ago they would stay around for the longest why I was he testing negative and then testing positive for these extremely so yeah the numbers that's a good question and that's that's basically the question and point but what was not occurring and what has never occurred in any of John samples is any presence of the short and medium term metabolites and if you look at rich ANCA of study he identifies a couple of these medium term metabolites Roman numeral 1 in Roman numeral 2 and he says these metabolites based on his study will stay in the body at least 22 days well let's look back to the July 7th and 8th you know positive tests he's negative on July 7th and 8th for everything for the parent compound for the short-term medium-term metabolites and the long-term metabolites go 20 21 days later so within that 22 day window which his study shows the short and medium-term metabolites would still be showing up and there's no presence whatsoever of the short or medium-term metabolites now again we'll get into this a little bit more but I think the science of what it's showing is a pulsing effect for this long-term metabolite meaning once you ingest whether intentionally or non intentionally oral Tour in a ball into the body the body breaks it down produces short term and medium term which is you know visible for a short and medium amount of time and then this m3 which is produced for a long period of time I think with the issue appears to be and we'll get into this the UFC program is not the only program that's seen this there's another professional sports league that has seen it very frequently you sod has also seen this on the Olympic side but we're seeing this strange action with the long term and three metabolites and the theory is it may be hiding in the fat tissues surrounding organs and maybe have a pulsing effect where it's released at certain times and other times you can't detect it and this is not the actual substance itself puts a metabolite correct which indicates a reaction to this substance it indicates the body breaking down the parent compound the the world turning a ball and turning it into these other things which are stored in the bodies these metabolites are not performance-enhancing drugs that are the result of the breakdown of the parent drug in the body now what how much time is it detectable the actual drug itself so pretty quick it's a pretty quick clearance time I think we're tank off studies says you know maybe a week so it's not around for very long and that's why he conducted the study ironically enough and I was gonna go watch vigorous here last night and I just I've had too much going on the last week to kind of refresh my mind but apparently he knew this was part of his protocol for Russian athletes he knew a coach that was still giving the world tour in a ball to Russian athletes and he had a falling out with the coach so he goes off on the side and studies hey the parent compound is gonna get in and out of the body pretty quick it's gonna be difficult to detect that let's try to figure out what stays around and leaves markers in the body for a long time and so he developed these short and long-term metabolite tests and was able to catch some of this coaches athletes for using the world tour in a ball interesting so the actual drug itself is gone from the system but the metabolite remains now what is the window that this metabolite is supposed to be detectable in the body because we're talking now what are we at like 18 months yeah so here's the flaw was it initial ingestion yep because my question is these same long-term metabolites these existed a year plus ago it was more than a year how long ago that that's the that so July 2017 was the initial test so when all the experts and we'll get through this with all the experts are telling us is there is no evidence of reinjection and most likely this is still remnants from the July 2017 test however it was to enter into a system and we'll go through some of these testing numbers that have shown negatives followed by very low level pika-pika Graham quality question though was that the the ingestion that happened that he tested positive for in July of 2017 indicated a long-term effect right it was a long-term terminal that correct so meaning it had already been in his system for a year so it absolutely could have predated you know the theory the first time through was something had to have entered his system between July 7th and July 8th those negatives and this low picogram reading on July 28th over this last year there's been a lot of study into this long-term metabolites as I mentioned this isn't just a UFC issue there's another major professional sports league that for the time being wants to keep their their testing confidential but they've shared that information with scientists with you sada with myself okay they saw it on multiple occasions this pulsing effect over a year where you'd see but this well over a year we were trying to and a half years now right if it's a year if it's a if in July which a la 2017 you were talking a year and a half right half July 17 but right it could have been in his system a year prior I don't know yeah it could have been a couple months so you're I don't know he had never showed up for that m3 metabolite for he had been tested you know for it you'd been tested multiple times in the program you from wrong you're the same level isn't it approximately the same picograms that exists today in 2018 that were there in 2017 generally if you look and we can go over these numbers it fluctuates you know from single digits it never gets into triple digits to to mid double digits so there's some as low as nine pica grams over that time there was some at sixty pika gram a peak gram to some of this preposterous is it's insane and you know the the analogy that I heard early on was and I think John uses throw a pinch of salt an Olympic swimming pool and I'm like okay well that's you kind of wrap your head around now let's go the other side let's talk about something really small that we know of and how many times you have to break down that small particle to get to a picogram so one grain of salt and we all know what that looks like right you put that in front of you and you split that and I mentioned this week 50 million it's actually 58 million if you split that 58 million times a grain of salt each one is a picogram I mean it's incomprehensible the detection level and how small that is it really is it's crazy and how many pica grams did they find in his system so he's gone from and I'll read through it here so here's here's since the initial appearance of the m3 metabolite here's what John's tests look like in those pika gram readings so the first one was collection date was July 28th 2017 he had a concentration of ATP grams however let me caution and I'll read something from from an expert when you get down to these pika gram levels the science is somewhat in exact because such a small amount so the variable the plus or minus you know can be anywhere from twenty thirty I've seen in some instances fifty or sixty so with this scientist name is his name is Larry Bowers he was formerly the shot that you saw at a science director he's currently retired and independently consults before that he ran an Olympic Olympic Committee accredited laboratory at the University of Indiana the guy's got 20 to 25 years of anti-doping experience here's what he he told me about you know when you're when you're analyzing small pika gram levels although the two respective laboratories report a concentration I would caution against becoming too fixated on the numbers first the numbers are really estimates of concentration and probably should be considered a range about plus or minus 20 pika grams for ml and he said the December 9th result would be in the range of John so we'll get to that between sixty and a hundred second while the adjustment of concentration by specific gravity attempts to deal with the variability of urinary excretion rates it is an exact is inexact and adds variability to the estimates finally and most importantly science has no clear understanding of the variance of urinary excretion of drugs at ultra-trace concentrations so basically saying look I mean we have a general idea how this works in science but and I think this instance comes to play be real careful if you're gonna be the guy with the pseudoscience out there saying wait a second John jumped from 20 to 60 from September to December and that means here Ian jested it what he's saying here is slow your roll on that that it's such a small incomprehensible level that we don't really know what those variances are gonna look like now I think if we saw jumps and John from single digits eight or nine pica Graham to multiple hundred digit pica grams there would be a concern and maybe some readmit astray ssin but the experts i've speaking to when you're talking variability of 10 20 30 40 it's not that significant at the picogram level what is the window this long-term metabolites starts to express itself like what you said there's short term and there's medium term this is the long term how long does it take for the long yeah that's a good question I don't have the answer to that it may be in retain coves report here and I would encourage those that are at home you know playing playing scientist at their computer the Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology Rodchenko of rights report detection and mass spec spectrometric characterization of novel long-term t hydrochloric testosterone metabolites in human urine I'm not sure when that long-term metabolite how long it takes to show up here's the problem though with this substance he did a real brief study my understanding is administered it to himself that's the only study that exists hmm world tour in a Baldy HCM t2 my understanding is not approved for use for human consumption anywhere anywhere in any country so you can't have clinical trials ethically in the medical world because it's just not legal to give this to human beings so you know we're we're already kind of behind the eight-ball here and that you know it's compared to other substances where you can do clinical trials because they're readily available be a prescription or whatever this substance is not the substance was created by the East Germans in the 70s and 80s and was part of their state-sponsored doping program or they were doping their athletes can you correct me if I'm wrong but I believe what I've read is that this is particularly effective when people are cutting weight yeah I mean is that true or is this just more I don't know not that I think some may be confusing corinna ball with oral chair in a ball two completely different it's actually very important yeah there's there's very different effects on the body there's very different windows in terms of detection time explain that yeah you've got to be really careful in this world of performance-enhancing drugs there's names that are interchangeable there's different you know chemical names where you change a little bit of that chemical name that commune completely different substance there's instances where the chemical name is different but the substance is actually this so when trying to compare two substances you know make sure if you're at home doing that analysis you're comparing the right ones straight to R in a ball is different than oral to R in a bowl what is the difference yeah I can't tell you I'm not as familiar with Torino ball other than it's not oral to written ball so but there is a difference in terms of the detection window yeah there would be I mean different substances create and throw out different metabolites and different substances have different detection windows so I haven't done my study and research on straight - Rinna ball other than knowing it's different than the substance here so Gregory Burton cough that's I say right it was the only guy to do an actual verified study correct now is this study been is it been peer reviewed yeah I mean it's it's published in the Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology so in order to get something published it needs to be peer-reviewed right so the it's has it been replicated anywhere not that I'm aware no so just so we have one study which is really fascinating correct so we know that first of all we know this is an effective steroid we know it works yeah these Germans I think showed that they wouldn't have been using it it's not a difficult it's not an easy easy substance to get ahold of look when it's not approved for use anywhere in the world it's only available on the black market so you probably have to go to China to get a manufactured or you know research chemical supply company and it's not supposed to be provided to to humans now I'm certainly not attributing this to you but there were rumors this was one discussion was that one of the possible ways he could have ingested this and let's be very kind John likes to party okay one of the things about partying is people do cocaine and one of the things about cocaine is sometimes cocaine is cut with creatine one of the things about creatine is oftentimes you're buying cheap creatine it's but one of the things that we've had with on it on its our products are all third-party verified but in the initial goings when we try different manufacturers especially for alpha brain we found there were other trace elements that were in alpha brain that weren't supposed to be in there and it's because of the vats that they mix these things up with and one of the things that we had heard was that creatine oftentimes is made in the same place where they might be making oral to rent a ball they might be making Anna ball they might be making a bunch of different things and trace amounts of this stuff can get into the creatine they use creatine to cut cocaine with this is this possible or am I just yeah it's it's absolutely a theory I don't you know I can't sit here and said that happened but I will have heard similar thing I have heard similar things I know for a fact based on my previous career I worked closely with the DEA I was with the FDA I worked cases involving Street distribution of recreational drugs including cocaine I know for a fact that creatine is one of the most common substances that cocaine is cut with because look yeah some more color some more feel so getting back to McClaren's arbitration decision I mean this is publicly available record so I'm not saying anything new but if McLaren addresses at least John's lifestyle around this time and he says the athlete openly admitted to USANA that prior to and for a period of time after the reporting of his second adverse analytical finding on July 28th 2017 the athlete used illicit so-called street drugs including cocaine now for me to sit here and say hey that's where it came from I don't know that what's the time pretty talking about there the athlete admitted that prior to and for a period of time after the reporting of a second adverse analytical finding on July 27 2017 admitted so before that test and sometime after okay so does that make sense though if it's cut if that's what we're the the source of it is does it make sense that that would show up as a long-term metabolite doesn't it need a long time in the body to digest or do we not know enough about the window of time yeah I don't know if we know enough about the window of time you know my my theory and looking at it is even if there's a small amount of the oral chair in a ball in that it's going to for a period of time show that parent compound at a small peak of gram amount and the short and midterm metabolites in the small picogram amount we have never seen those in the history of John's testing it's only this long-term metabolite so that may be indication that it occurred maybe even prior to what we're talking about here is it something that could be accentuated in some way by the weight cutting process I absolutely think that could be a factor there are studies not necessarily with this but another substance clomiphene and look I want that while I'm cautioning people to be careful about comparing different substances the commonality between clomiphene which there are multiple clinical studies on because it is approved for use to be distributed to humans and oral Terina ball is they're both chlorinated so they both contain a chlorine atom on the molecule and there is a recently published study on clomiphene and its excretion rates again for those at home that want to look it up the study was published in The Endocrine Society publication it's peer-reviewed the name of it is HPT access effects and urinary detection following clomiphene administration and males so what they did is they basically you know got a group of males gave them a one-month cycle of clomiphene you know I think 25 milligrams a day and then had them get off and then continue to look at their urine up to 261 days after and what you saw and what you see in this study is that pulsing effect so you know I'm looking at some of the study subjects here subject 1 on day 121 still showed 147 picograms of Coloma Fein day 128 showed 174 pika grams day 135 shows nothing he's below the minimum courting reporting limit and then day 149 he's back up to 236 there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 out of I think 12 subjects in that study that showed this pulsing effect of this chlorinated substance coming and going again you know it's it's different than oral tour in a ball but it has that common factor of being chlorinated in this study they do talk about a fat tissue called the let me lick this up and make sure I got this right adipose tissue mm-hmm this is fat that surrounds the internal organs it's one of the last things that the body burns when it's going you know starving itself and going to fat it protects those organs but yeah you look at these you know extreme weight gains and cuts that the UFC athlete goes through I don't think you're gonna find possibly another human subject anywhere that goes through putting weight on other than wrestling may be that I don't think Olympic wrestling matches with an MMA fighter goes through at least you know in my experience over these three or four years talking to those in the Olympic world I think worth the extreme and it's it's something obviously we've talked about before we're trying to curtail but you know there's there's clearly never been a study for anybody who dehydrates and read-write hydrates themselves to the extent that some of our athletes do you could never find there would never be anybody with any ethics that would support a study because some of that dehydration exceeds World Health Organization standards so there's no studies out there you know on this stuff but clearly you know looking from afar I'd say that it likely has some impact over what's being released by this adipose tissue we should certainly talk about that in the future the weight cutting aspect of it so the but this adipose tissue loss at extreme weight cuts could potentially be the reason why this stuff is excreting itself it's it's definitely a theory out there what about micro dosing so here's the thing with micro dosing micro dosing is done with endogenous substances so only test it well I mean someone could try it was something else but it the reason you micro dosed with endogenous substances is there already produced in the body right so the theory of okay I'm gonna micro dose oral tour in a ball well oral tour in a ball still producing these short-term and long-term metabolites in theory whether you're taking a hundred milligrams or one milligram of oral to renob all those excretion rates of those metabolites are still going to be consistent they're going to be in a much smaller lesser way to bypass those excretion rates is there way to mask that in some way I'm not aware of any hi I'm sorry the only study we have is Gregory correct that's it correct but you know just taking it from a common-sense approach it's certainly you know those that know about micro dosing know that you micro dose with endogenous substances things that are already appearing in the body so your family knows what to do with them knows what to do and you're fooling you know not only are these metabolizing and there's no metabolites of them but you could also be fooling the biological passport that's the concern I think and why people micro dose so you sod is looking not only testing for specific substances but our testosterone at the testosterone ratios going up they're looking at at blood values how many young red blood cells how many mature red blood cells so micro dosing in those two areas wouldn't set off alarms in the biological passport world I've never heard personally of micro dosing of exogenous substances that are not found in the body micro dosing and my understanding is done with things that are endogenous body for people that are not familiar with this terminology we're just talking about micro dosing performance-enhancing drugs because micro dosing in today's world is a very common thing with mushrooms and LSD you know right I mean I saw a ton of micro dosing in the the cycling world that Brian was tested on testosterone EPO HGH all those natural occurring in the body and I don't produce any really red flagged metabolite if you do I met very very small levels bill the parent will clear quickly not produce any metabolites and will not throw off the biological passport analysis is there I mean when Victor Conte came out with clear and all that stuff with BALCO they were they were fooling people is it is it I mean one of the things we've talked about before is that it's a constant race to try to keep up with more advanced cheaters it is and you know what's interesting in this I mean what if I would have talked to you and maybe the first time we did talk a couple years ago it's come a long way from them but clearly if I were to talk to you 15 16 17 years ago when I got my start in the anti-doping world I would have told you definitively the testing is way behind you know what's being used out there they were testing able to test to multiple nanogram limits that's as far down as we can go now they can go down to single digit pika gram there's another professional sports league out there that recently had a 1 picogram and 3 metabolites case I mean do the math coming down from you know four or five nanograms which used to be the lower limit now 2 1 picogram 10,000 20,000 times I am almost under the theory that the pendulum has swung maybe a little bit too far in the other direction and that that certainly is part of my job to the UFC look I want to catch every intentional cheater that's out there I want to make sure we have a rock-solid program use all the latest and greatest you know techniques to do it but I also want to keep an eye on it to make sure it's being administrated fairly and when you're getting down to detection of one you know single-digit pika grams I have a concern that what kind of level of sensitivity we're talking about are we going to talk about environmental contamination where you walk you know through a room and somebody has just opened a container of something and there's you know miniscule powders in the air there are documented cases that some of the regularly prescribed prescription drugs specifically diuretics are getting in water supplies in some areas you know you get a lot of old people on them that flush their old pills down the toilet there's documented cases of it getting into the water supply and being detectable at that pika gram level so you've got to be really really careful about that and I think you know this case exemplifies that you saw it and and really the world anti-doping agency world and community are aware of that you know with greater sensitivity and testing in my opinion become you know makes greater responsibility to be objective and look fairly at what really we're doing here Lord detecting in that small amount but this this test of John's where he's testing for the same level of pica grams today as he was in July of 2017 is it safe to say that this is unprecedented repeat that again that John's test for the same levels of pica grams of these metabolites in 2018 that he was testing for in 2017 this is unprecedented no the answer's no it's so may be unprecedented in the UFC program but what the United States anti-doping agency did over these last five or six months as they reached out to the science community outside the scope of the UFC they reached out to other professional sports organizations they reached out to other why wada Laboratories and what they were seeing was multiple instances of this pulsing effect where over time you would see a reading right the next test it would go away and the next time you'd see that reading again maybe back up to or even above this much like that was correct yes so you see that in the claw in the Coloma fein study here too I mean almost 260 what they stopped the study what it was still appearing in pika gram levels in some subjects and they stopped the study at 261 days and you see those numbers I was reading to you see this one subjected 174 he's negative the next time and then he pops up to 2 in the 200s after so it's actually more than the time before again apples and oranges different substances but the commonality here is chlorinated substance fluorine based so is is it safe to say that this is an emerging science and that we're still learning and understanding this as we go along absolutely it's still very young look the first you know the the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles were established the first drug testing laboratory by dr. Catlin so really you know in the scope of science going back to the earliest days then they're talking about you know what 30 30 years 30 35 years again when I started off in their 16 or 17 years the science still wasn't good they were unable to detect anything in the picogram level again for reference very interesting so the the wada the world anti-doping agency's accredits laboratories across the world and they have certain standards that those laboratories must meet or to retain that accreditation and keep that accreditation so they have a technical document called the minimum required performance levels of their laboratories so what they tell the laboratories is you must detect these substances down to this amount if you can't get them down to this amount then you can't have an accreditation from wada so the class of substances that world tour in a ball would be in which would be other anabolic agents the required minimum level that they must detect to is only to nanograms hmm so look wada even says as long as you can get to two nanograms you can retain our accreditation well what's happening is an arms race in these laboratories they're saying well two's the minimum standard but I can get down further and you know these are private entities that you know are looking for for customers so to be able to reach out and say well even though wada tells us to is as low as we need to go we can go down to 1 picogram I think in a sense maybe you need to slow the reins on that a little bit that we're getting too far and too sensitive of a level of detection when it comes to implementing a fair program because you can't determine where a 1 picogram came from you could be breathing again contaminated air drinking contaminated water it gets real dangerous when you get down that low now how does this reflect on past suspensions this is what when you deal with some like look let's bring up Frank Mir for example didn't Frank Mir also test for aural turn of all okay I want to get back to Frank Mir but let's let's go back to John and and this instance and why you sada has come out and said look this is not a violation so if you go to the Wada the world anti-doping code there's a section ten point seven point four point one our UFC program you know basically mirrors that and we're bringing that up on the screen there so for purposes of imposing sanctions under 10.7 an anti-doping rule a ssin will only be considered a second violation if the anti-doping organisation can establish the athlete or other person committed the second anti-doping relation after the athlete or other person received notice pursuant to article 7 etc this is what's known as a double jeopardy clause right can't me sanction a guy test positive for something and if he's test positive for the exact same substance that is still in his system a year later or whatever the amount of time is you don't include that as a new positive test one more thing has to happen science has to determine that it there hasn't been a readmission so test positive for the same substance and science says based on other numbers we see there's no evidence of any readmit astray ssin and the non evidence of the readmission is the lack of short-term and medium-term GABA lights Zingo never ever in john's you're an issue though that this is only one test that Gregory which anko's test is the only study that showed that these medium and short-term metabolites exist it's the only study but I think then if there's only one study you have to go to anecdotal evidence right why do Studies on UFC employees because China ball-ball he'll do it oral tour in a ball is illegal to distribute in any country throughout the world is illegal oh they just let you do whatever you want to do I don't know maybe we can look into that but Shelby may be up for that that's the reason for living there I have a problem with that in that we're relying on one study this seems to me to be like a critical thing that could affect I mean we're we're hoping and we're we're putting faith in this study that this is the only way that these metabolites express themselves is it possible that what that these like you see with the pulsing effect that you see positive effects and negative or positive results in negative results that these sure term and medium-term metabolites don't always express themselves and that what we're considering a long-term metabolite could in fact just be a metabolite yeah I I mean I guess it's possible but what are you are you gonna sanction an athlete again because you know potentially it's possible and then the theory or not you can't do that let me read to you real quick what what these experts came out at in terms of readmit astray ssin so dr. Daniel Eichner runs the salt lake city it's called a smart Sports Medicine Research testing laboratory or Smurl they're one of two watered accredited laboratories in the United States the other one being a UCLA again one of the most respected minds in anti-doping PhD chemist his answer in terms of readmit astray ssin was this and you very rarely see scientists at his level talk in absolute in absolutes there you go and here he says there is no evidence that DHC mt has been readmitted that's in writing to us so very definitive on that you sought a science director now Dan Daniel is independent even of you sadhus and those who criticize hey you saw us in bed with the UFC Daniel Eichner doesn't work for you sada he runs an independent laboratory you saw to send samples there the NFL send samples there Major League Baseball send samples there the NCAA he's independent owns his own laboratory you sada also put out a letter to us in in writing upon careful consideration of the very low concentration of the DHC mt long-term metabolite mr. Jones's sample and taking into account the human pharmacokinetic characteristics of this particular long-term anabolic steroid metabolites based on data to which you saw it as access to and in consult in consultation with scientific experts some of whose and pinions are enclosed you saw it as concluded consistent with prior residual amounts detected and mr. Jones sample that the presence of DHC MT long-term metabolite is consistent with residual amounts from exposure prior to 2017 look I'm not an expert I don't profess to be my backgrounds in finance and accounting I traced the money back in the old days but I know who those experts are out there in the world and these are them there by putting these things in writing putting their reputations on the line now and forever going forward they're never gonna do something like that because you know the UFC pays you sada to administer our program or because Jon Jones is you know a popular fighter and they want to see him fight this week and that's just not the way this world works of course in fact it works the opposite way there would be a great benefit if they could catch him cheating absolutely and you know historically experts like this are very very conservative when it comes to talking in absolutes like this they don't normally do it in all fairness the real question is guys like you and me because we are UFC employees so yeah we got handle this fairly and I guess that argument of course you know and I saw that left and right that hey Jeff and Joe are paid by the UFC of course they're gonna come out in this way but look all these things that I'm reciting how would they ever do that in regards to cheating I wouldn't either I've I side with the UFC on a lot of things because I support the sport I want to excel I don't decide ever with cheating if I think that there's some way somehow that someone has given an unfair advantage and it's just somehow being covered up I would rather not work for them Joe my 7 my last 17 years of my career my it might my you know everything that I've worked for is to protect the rights of clean athletes and to eradicate cheating from the sport I can't tell you how strongly I feel about that Sports giving me everything in my life my dad was a high school basketball coach it paid for my college and scholarships it you know at least the good characteristics and me I can all trace directly to sports and entering into the equation the issues of breaking the rules the issues of the health and safety aspects when you have young I talked to many parents whose kids you know use steroids because they saw the professional athletes doing entering that into the body when you're hormonal levels are already out of control is very very dangerous both short and long term can't tell you how passionate I am about this issue and those out there that say are say and then I'm corrupt and my reputation is out the window I would never ever in a million years sales people I mean you obviously you have but you you can't listen to those people because they want to find things wrong one of the things that I've said about you is you're a guy who loves to catch people cheating you like it you enjoy it no that's not true man you do I don't come on if someone is cheating and you catch them well you know okay in the UFC program now with what we've established here absolutely back in the old days and we talked about this look when you had in baseball or in cycling no testing going on literally organizations were looking in the other direction I've often said look I don't agree with what they did but there's a portion of me and that's why I think a lot of these athletes respected me and shared that information there's a portion of me that said I don't agree with what you did I'd like to think I wouldn't made the same decision but I damn well understand why you did this you're fighting for millions of dollars in contracts you know your teammates are doing it you know you're you know competitors are doing it and you know your professional sports organization doesn't give a shit because of the weakness of the testing program or total lack thereof so when instances like that there was I never came away saying that guy's an idiot or an asshole for shoes and I came away saying I kind of get why he did it if I was 21 or 22 years old an immature I may have made the same decision now coming to our program here where you have an organization that cares very much that spends multi million dollars a year this program has done nothing but costs the UFC money causes money and how we implement the program counseling cautious money on canceling fights anybody who thinks moving this fight to California is that a financial benefit to the UFC is crazy we're taking a bath on this one people do really do need to understand that the UFC decided themselves they self-imposed you sod as sanctioning of fights correct nobody forced us to do that so this is this was a big step in the right direction of trying to make the sport cleaner because we recognized that first of all there was some legal stuff with the testosterone replacement therapy that just threw everything out of whack right where it was essentially it was sanctioned cheating I mean let's be honest about what that was it was it was clearly a my understanding being manipulated yeah very easy to manipulate when you get permission to use any prohibited substance like that and we went from that to unbelievably strict protocols and now what you're seeing is you're seeing first of all we saw a radical change in the physiques of some fighters where we we did have some suspicions and those suspicions at least in my eyes have been confirmed and now we're seeing the good side of this with what in your estimation might have been moved over into a position where okay now now it's getting a little bit ridiculous in terms of like what we can detect and what is what is causing fights to be canceled exactly so interestingly enough the world anti-doping agency owada their next code revision is 2021 and so they regularly put out hey what are the issues going forward that we want to address and one of the major issues is potentially establishing thresholds for these low-level substances that keep appearing THC mt being one of them austria being one of them and so the idea that wada is looking at and has a working group of worldwide experts is hey if something gets reported back at under 50 pika grams all the evidence is showing more likely than not this is from a very low-level contaminant issue we've never seen an issue of a micro dosing or an intentional use that's reached that level why are the labs even reporting at sub at quantities lower than 50 pika grams or a hundred pika grams I think very soon they're going to come out with a recommendation we are going to adopt that before 2021 once that working group and we're in communication with them comes up with those recommendations you'll see it implemented first in the UFC program again I've always said fairness due process in a program is just as important of the strength and comprehension comprehensiveness of that program you lose faith in your athletes you could have the strongest loophole free program in the world did you start implementing things unfairly you'll lose faith just as much as if you had a bunch of loopholes in the program it's got to be fair are you aware of the female skier that tested positive because of lip balm I see yeah it's vaguely recall about that what was someone else use a lip balm before her no no no no that it was a lip balm for sunburn it was for sunburned lips and it had some ridiculously small trace amount was it Austin seeing if her name is Joel Berg well there was the the cocaine kissing defense was actually won in arbitration so something similar somebody tested positive for you know low-level metabolites of cocaine and basically said look you know hey whether that was good or not but you know the arbitrator bought it and the science shows hey that that is a possibility the detection levels are so low if you kiss somebody who had just done cocaine they're now able to detect at those levels in the person that kissed that person that makes sense do you find this woman get this doping label on the label which is why they gave her a penalty okay oh I see okay what is the fucking labels on lip off you know see that that's that's how crazy it's gotten I mean all our athletes know when when they're using a creatine or a protein or whatever I think most of them are pretty careful right now but to tell them hey you need to read your lip mom and your deodorant I mean where what level are we getting to here right and these are the levels of detection so she 21 nine-year-old star of norway's powerhouse squad of skiing cross-country skiing tested positive for an anabolic agent listed in the contents of a treatment for sunburn this could be similar in some ways to what Chad Mendes tested positive for for something for psoriasis correct Chad Mendes has obvious psoriasis you see it on his body he's talked about it pretty openly and he used some sort of a cream and accepted his penalty wasn't aware this cream had something some type of a steroid into it yeah I'd seen him publicly say that now he chose not to present a defense or go to arbitration so I haven't seen anything in detail to my view he wrote knowledgeable opinion on that yeah he did so let's get back to the Frank Mir case Frank Mir tested positive was it also also same thing long-term metabolite of World Tour in a ball here's the difference Frank Mir was the same as John Jones his first time through was sanctioned John didn't get off the first time this showed up in his system he got you know he was looking at potential for years went to arbitration presented evidence enacted some other clauses in the policy that reduced his sanction what does that mean well one of them was substantial assistance where he assisted you sada in some way shape or form and he got a reduction for for doing that assisted in what way so I don't know and this is the exact reason why I do this so I insulate myself from that interaction between you sadha and the athlete they are the sole adjudicator in this they do not you know get me on the phone say hey we're thinking about going this way they adjudicate completely in a vacuum and you are you're just some people know your title is safety Health and Safety athlete's health and performance vice president of athlete's health and performance yeah so you no longer work for you saw I've never worked for you snot and that's that's a big misconception a lot of our fighters think that I've never worked for you sada I was a federal agent for twenty two and a half years the latter part of my career got involved with all these PE D distribution cases 2015 Lorenzo Fertitta and Dana White through a mutual friend contacted me and said hey would you come out and kind of talk to us we're contemplating maybe put in our own program together we've had some recent high-profile positives so I came out to Vegas talked with them and a week later I get a phone call asking if I want to come work for them and kind of implement this new program but I've never been an employee of USANA okay so that's that's good to know because that's been stated by some public figures that you used to work for you sada and now you work for the UFC never were they your shell that's my favorite words so you never work for you sada you brought you sada to the UFC or communicated with you sada and facilitated this agreement correct so I I never worked for you sada I did work very closely with you sada so you sada when I first started these series of investigations back in 2002 look I knew all about how to work a heroin distribution organization a cocaine distribution organization methamphetamine but when it came to performance-enhancing drugs there was no class that myself a really any other federal agent or law enforcement agent goes through surrounding distribution of performance-enhancing drugs so I was examining the discarded garbage of BALCO every week when they put it out to the curb began seeing notes rappers all these substances I had no idea what these things were I didn't know the difference between testosterone at potestas thrown erythropoietin eighty-eights I knew nothing so what I did is I figured out who those experts were who were the people that could very quickly get me up to speed on what I was looking at dr. Catlin who ran the UCL Olympic lie was one of the first and he started you know kind of walking me through this he put me in touch with you sada and you know they began educating me as well so over the course of those investigations I got a lot from them in terms of educating on these substances they were bringing some of their cooperating witnesses to me and then we go off and running on Criminal Investigations but never never worked for them so you saw - correct me if I'm wrong but the way they would work would be very compartmentalized like they would not specifically communicate with you on all of the details of this correct and they don't now I don't know that the independence aspect I don't as these deliberations are going on what they're looking at I don't know cooperation just for me to be frank would in my eyes would mean that something was done purposely illegally and this person had some knowledge of purpose purposeful illegal activity and that they would somehow communicate this to facilitate some sort of of catching of someone involved in a criminal act or an act of cheating yeah now that would make sense to me - yeah that would be what we're talking about you sada would allow John a shorter suspension if he actively participated in helping them catch people that were cheated that that's the understanding I don't know one Clyde that would be implied I don't know to what level that was done I don't know if it was that or if it was hey here's how this drug works in more general years oh I don't know what it was I purposely B that would mean that John would have to know about cheating if you're saying like this this is how this jug drug works is how I used it I mean this would he would that would mean his initial defense would have to be thrown out the window because it wasn't an accident well I mean I don't know about that if you knew something separate from you know that he did someone else yeah and again I don't I don't want anybody to reach that conclusion I have no idea what his substantial assistance entailed not right and that's a slippery slope it is a slippery slope and look transparency is important in any program but you know only to a certain level look if you were transparent about what everyone's you know cooperation or substantial assistant was and the whole world knew about it you're never gonna get anybody after that coming in and and and and cooperating I saw this definitely on the criminal side with you know informants you don't that's not something that's that you want to be transparent about or disclose right but there's gonna be a bunch of people that have a real issue with that the idea that John Jones you know one of the greatest fighters of all time is actually working as an informant I mean it's it's listed in the in the you know in MacLaren's ruling that that was one of the reasons for the the mitigating factor in the reduction but I don't again just need to tell nothing about to leave that alone nothing about it it's been stated we know what it is okay or we know that it's a thing when it comes to the John's initial tests where he was sanctioned and was suspended for a determined period of time Frank Mir also was sanctioned it was for a determined period of time as well he was two years John shorter than that John Sharan cooperate on a bunch of other deal to things he you not only cooperated he went to arbitration and put on a defense he put on a defense that look the evidence here shows no intentional ingestion of it and in fact McLaren gave him a further reduction based on there was no evidence that this was intentionally done Frank Mir didn't put on any he had every right to go to arbitration put on his own offense didn't do that what about Josh Barnett Josh Barnett you know completely different set of facts his came from a contaminated supplement it was a different substance he went to an arbitration hearing the arbitrator ruled with Josh and said yep you know based on where we are now based on the care and effort that you took you're right you deserve to have time served at the time of that arbitration so again I think that's a good example of the checks and balances in place here you've got me overseeing the program taking a look at how these things come out you've got the ability from the athlete to go to McClaren's group and judge you know the set of facts and in that case MacLaren's group said you sada i think maybe you overreached a little bit here and I believe Josh and Josh's you know basically time serve so you know you want to see you want to see them get it perfect right every time but you know and the reality in the real world is that doesn't necessarily happen and that's why you have these checks and balances available josh Barnett's take on the matter is that they tried to paint him as guilty even though he was not and that he he feels like he definitely got a bad deal and that he was labeled as someone who was taking this substance he was suspended for a long period of time one who's going through this and although he was found not guilty that he feels like not enough emphasis was put into establishing that he was not guilty and that you know he he feels like they chased him down over something that he didn't do yeah I mean well here's what he did do is he used a supplement that if he would have listened to anything that we educate on that you sada sends out regular reminders our fighters are required on a quarterly basis to go through videos and their whereabouts filing that deals with these issues if he would have followed any of that advice when it came to his supplement choices he would have never chosen the supplement he used I you know when when I heard about that supplement and what was on the label and how it was marketed I said okay well that's that's likely the candidate of where it came from yeah so I mean the analysis would be hey you know that pool be careful there's sharks swimming in that pool they can eat you and the person jumps in the water anyway saying look I didn't want to get eaten by a shark but a shark comes up and ate them it's like hey we told you that this was the case you didn't follow that now there also needs to be a differentiation between someone who's intentional cheating intentionally cheating and someone that's just you know makes a naive supplement choice there there needs to be a differentiation between that and there was in that case Josh didn't get you know the full penalty of what was what that substance you know would have rendered but he did have to go through a long period of time where he was unable to fight he did but you know again he had the prohibited substance in his body you saw it asked to look at hey even though you did that didn't do that on purpose did that give you a performance enhancing benefit did it allow you to recover a little bit better did it make you a little bit stronger and you know that's why those strict liability provisions are in there otherwise people would just take these prohibited supplements and say oh I didn't know exactly it was just an accident exactly meanwhile they're getting a benefit for exactly so they have to have some sort of penalty in place I think so you know I also think again there needs to be a differentiation between the intentional and non-intentional and we do have that in our policy there are definitely mitigating factors available in our policy that if you didn't do thing on purpose you're not you know you're not sanctioned as hi Tim means is a great example there so Tim means used a relatively benign supplement it was a creatine creatine you know generally doesn't have an issue as as opposed like testosterone booster supplements we tell our athletes stay away from anything marketing as a testosterone booster is one of the most common with contaminants or purposely spiking purposeful spikings Tim means uses a creatine it had Austrian and a very small amount we found it in there Austrian is a two-year sanction you got six months you know so back relatively quickly so I think the same thing with you ole Romero so correct Yoel Romero used a natural diuretic product that had asaram in it in all these cases not only does the the prohibited substance need to show up in what the athlete has says they've used already separate but to protect against making sure the athlete isn't purposely spiking it you sada will go out on their own on the market independently procure hopefully the same lot of product and in the case of Yoel and Tim they were able to do that test it completely independently of the athlete determine what level the prohibited substance is in that based on the interview with the athlete of how much did you use when's the last time you used it relative to this test do the science calculations just to make sure an athletes not saying well I know this creatine has spiked with aa strain so I'm gonna go use AA strain and then I have a built-in excuse when I test positive for Austria in order to be able to match contaminant levels with what's being excreted in the urine you would literally have to have PhD chemistry degree and I'm not aware of any are athletes having that to be very very difficult to do that and so these detection levels again we're talking about nanograms we're not talking about large quantities that were pika grams grams correct now what why was why was this moved from Vegas to California and why why did the California State Athletic Commission why did they accept this fight taking place here and why did Vegas say no to it so internally UFC wise we first in fact Donna mark Leaney who you know who works with me were found out to Donna exactly we're a two-person shot and the woman's a hawk's one of the hardest workers I know so she's she's awesome she's taking a look at something that we have access to called the Clearing House and it's basically a recording of all the tests on our athletes so we can get on there somebody says hey how many times was John tested last quarter we can get on there and pull that up the public also has access to our testing records not with a specificity that the Clearinghouse has but the public can get on and you saw it on a weekly basis updates how many tests and athletes done so there's some of these some guys out there on the internet from the day one of the program have kept track of what week their numbers tick up so you can go find spreadsheets on the Internet at least from Oh from a weekly basis of when our athletes were tested and how many times every week god bless those dorks crazy huh so the clearinghouse program is very specific we can get on there and see the actual date of the collection and next to that we see negative positive or pending so Donna came to me late November early December saying hey I'm looking at you know John's tests and I'm seeing pending still back from it was maybe August September yeah you think something's going on here and of course I'm like okay well he's fighting pretty soon I hope not but let me reach out to USANA so I reached out to them they said we're working on something were you know conducting a study we're talking other professional sports leagues we're talking to the laboratories out there and don't have an answer for you now that let's stand by so I think it was September 6th they sent a letter to us and they sent a letter to the Nevada State Athletic Commission saying just so you we're over the last six months early in this six months we've seen a real murder of this long-term metabolite in John's samples we saw is this so this was early December December sixth okay we and the Nevada Athletic Commission were notified you were notified but the test was from previous just so the test these tests covered from August through November okay so that's 2008 test several of them oh so more than one test showed this metabolite so what they said was August ninth negative August 29th eight peak grams September eighteenth eight eight September 18th so I mean there's a there's a good so he's negative on the ninth 20 days later so inside the 22 ten comes Tony dude a window he an8 pika gram no short-term metabolites no long-term no parent no medium-term no medium I'm sorry no medium only long-term thank you we then go to the 18th of September 19 pika grams and then that's followed by 4 negative tests September 21st October 2nd October 11th and November 14th so at this point late November early December you saw it says okay we've done our studying those to low levels in August are residual there's no evidence of any readmit astray ssin based on lack of short and medium term and parent based on our consultation with other leagues with these labs that are seeing this we're calling this this is would be double jeopardy if we did them again this is something that should be really emphasized because there's a lot of people that don't understand this this is not just this one test these are many tests that have been done over the course of John's suspension and then ultimately relicensing that are showing this exact same metabolite at a very similar level that according to previous tests specifically on clomiphene that this could be this pulsing correct result of existing and not existing but this is not indicative in any way that can be provable of micro dosing correct and not only that but this is over we're talking about this being over long term long periods of time many months yes okay and consistent numbers over many months yes so and again going back to to what one expert dr. Bower said you've got to be cared what you're talking about single double long number grams and you see some variants you've got to be careful about saying well it went from 9 to 18 that means readmit astray ssin no it's in exact science at that level the water labs this is a non threshold substance so all's water requires them to say to report back to whadda positive or negative they're not required to quantify however these water labs have also realized there's an issue when you're getting none topeka grams so what they're doing is going back after reporting the positive hey let's see if we can estimate what this level is it's an inexact science at pika gram quantities in my understanding - you know estimate what those levels are you can see some variations so Nevada is unwilling to sanction the fight based on all this information so they get they get the initial notice that we got also I think it was December 6 saying look there was an issue in in August these long term metabolites reappeared again but we've since had four negative tests we don't believe that the August you know reappearance is a readmit astray ssin there's no sanction here nevada you don't even have jurisdiction over the august tests again keep in mind these are UFC tests nevada doesn't mandate it but nevada says look closer to a fight we do take jurisdiction we will adopt these you saw two tests so you thought it didn't need to notify they thought out of an abundance of caution let's let Nevada know that this issue exists damn you sorrow what the so they said but hey wait that's that's all good you saw that against this yeah I talked with them they're like whoa this is right this is concerning but we don't see anything within our jurisdiction here so I certainly hope that no subsequent tests show up positive because that could be an issue and sure enough you saw two collects a sample from John on twelve nine they expedited the results because they knew a fight was coming up and they do that now when fights are closed or the collections are done close to a fight and here you know he pulses back up to you know between sixty and eighty pika grams so Nevada gets this this was last week man the days of run together for me so a week ago Friday we have in bob bennett who's the executive director well I'm a big fan of these great I say I talked about Nevada but a former FBI agent so we got round is he's one of the reasons why it probably wasn't sanctioned in Nevada was because they're so by-the-book I get angry because I wanted to fight to be in Nevada but yeah I understand Bob's position then implicitly so so let me make clear what happened Bob came in anthony martin l the chairman of the commission came in and representatives from the Nevada Attorney General's Office so they are the ones that prosecute and you know cases involving PE D use that violates Nevada regs so we share all this with them and lists like you did with me correct share it all with them and look there's some misconception out there they did not say this fight absolutely not happened in next week in fact they I think we're understanding these issues but said look you know optically this doesn't look great and we feel that out of an abundance of caution that we need to have a public hearing and be very transparent about this because this is this is some weird shit this was last Friday so over eight days out from the fight and so you know we start talking about hey when can we potentially have this and unfortunately Christmas holiday several of the commissioners weren't even in town and basically what they said is look we will absolutely do this if you want us to but likely that hearing would not be until today Thursday or maybe tomorrow Friday and you know Marnell is like look I am starting to get my head around this but I can't guarantee you that my other commissioners or me are gonna come out the same way so you're taking you know you're taking a chance here that that we could say well we need more information so so basically they were willing to listen to it I think they were starting to wrap their heads around it but didn't feel that they were up to speed enough on it they didn't have the luxury that Andy Foster and California have remember when Jon tested positive in July 2018 that fight was in California because that fight was in California California retained jurisdiction they've had two very public hearings on John when they suspended his license and most recently a week and a half ago when they reinstated his license so Andy and the Commission were very familiar with the world term in a ball they were very familiar with the long term metabolites and in fact Andy was somewhat critical of you sada during the last hearing he thought after looking at all the details after reading you know MacLaren's position that there was no evidence that this was done on purpose he thought men maybe they went a little bit hard on him and he stated that in that in that second hearing so with the re-emergence of the the picogram quantity of this m3 long-term metabolite Andy in the Commission unlike Nevada didn't need to get up in speed on it they've already had two public hearings on John's issue they were intimately familiar with you know some of these dynamics of this drug and the metabolites and that's why he felt comfortable based on their familiars ation with it and based on these written absolute statements by these experts so there was no reinjection one and then the second thing which we haven't covered is these experts said based on these low-level picograms there's no performance enhancing benefit and that's an important point because if you would have told UFC look this is still remnants from a year and a half ago but we can't rule out that he's not getting a performance enhancing benefit from it well in that instance I'll tell you and you know I stand by this I would I would leave this company if somebody told me otherwise if there was any indication that there would be a benefit from him even though it technically wasn't a violation I'm not gonna stand by while anybody licenses that guy to fight could it been could this have been somehow or another mitigated by communicating these results to Nevada earlier well we didn't announce the fight that John was gonna fight and in Nevada Intel October but in October so you have said hey well here's this issue sure potentially but issue was you saw it hadn't come to that they were in the middle of that point of consulting with other professional sports leagues with the other wada labs they hadn't reached their conclusion their science expert hadn't determined hey this is definitely residual no performance ancing they were still going through that data at that point so what they've told me is look we tried to hurry that along as fast as possible we wanted to make sure that that you know we went through this and very very detailed no smell let's ride when when did they reach this conclusion this so this was early December so December 6 that letter went out saying we've had these two low-level positives back in August well okay but here we are I mean this is the end of December what could this have been headed off at the pass well again when Nevada first got notified they thought like we were hoping well he's had four negative tests so he's probably gonna be negative going forward here right and that's what you know the layperson would think ok he's probably out of the woods now but you know again getting back to what period of time is this in John's preparation and if you look at some of these numbers and when these metabolites appear and disappear in early August John was preparing his defense for this arbitration I think he had an idea based on talking to his attorneys like hey we got a pretty good shot here of some mitigating factors where this is potentially gonna get reduced so I think you know he starts to get a little bit motivated gets in the gym starts training in clearly in early December that's the period of time when our fighters that close to a fight are bringing down that body weight right and their cut and body fat they're losing you know a little bit of water so it certainly seems to correlate these these these pulsing you know effects with winds just theoretical right that it's not most tissue absolutely it is so this positive result was announced when so a week ago yesterday this is you sadhas' announced you sadhas notifies us the UFC it always happens and they notify if any Commission has jurisdiction at this point this close to a fight Nevada has jurisdiction so I get the call and you can imagine what's going through my head I mean I I've gotten so many these calls now I literally for the first five or ten minutes can bury my head in my hand and think through exactly how this thing's gonna play out and you know it's going to be hey Nevada's gonna say wait a second what's going on here we need to root this out John's going to say Jesus Christ like what is going on in my life I can't get a fucking break I'm trying to be care I even went through what DC how DC's gonna react and he react he's gonna be I fucking told you this was the case this guy's a cheater you know you saw it as bullshit Novitsky bullshit all this stuff goes through my head in the first five or ten minutes what's how's Dana gonna react house hunter gonna react when I have to go over to his office and explain this out to them it played out exactly as I saw it it's it's it's some of the worst days of my career when I get these calls but you know everyone was notified and in Nevada was in our office two days later and again I mean there's been some criticism of them out there I don't fault them this is a complicated issue that optically doesn't look great and to do anything in a rush manner would be difficult they did everything they could to afford us having a hearing problem was it was just it was too close to to a fight so essentially to get this out this issue with optics right because it you go on Twitter everybody's calling them achieve everybody saying that you know anybody that sanctions this is your sanctioning cheating for someone to get an understanding of what this is like it actually requires probably more than we've done now over the last hour and 15 minutes yeah and I appreciate this forum I mean Dana and I went on SportsCenter and announced it in three minute hit and I came out of there doing absolutely everyone in the world is gonna say this is bullshit you can't this is we're gonna have a hard time doing this in two hours here yeah this is things yeah you've got you've got to delve into it and you've also have to put your trust and reliance on these experts they have a education professional career of 20 to 25 years to come up with these absolutes there's no one else in the world but maybe a dozen people that can to come up with these conclusions you do have to put your you know your faith in in their background and and their careers and their knowledge and education and you know I read which those absolutes were that there was no evidence of any reinjection this is by multiple experts and that John would not have retained any performance benefit based on these low-level picogram amounts well I'm happy that we were gonna have this out there so people if they have time if they're really that interested in it this is probably a more in-depth discussion of this than you're going to get anywhere else but I really wish we could have gotten something like this to Nevada and Nevada could have gone over this and looked at what what I'm seeing what you're saying it seems to me that we could have just had some sort of a meeting and kept this fight in Nevada and it would have saved everybody a lot of heartache yeah I mean I think things were pointing in that but there was no guarantees on that baby it's the hot come on it's Vegas you know the other thing that was being looked at was was fairness to these athletes really you're gonna clear athlete you're gonna put John and Gus maybe more importantly in a position where he doesn't know until two days or a day before whether this fight is happening or not I mean these and and not even mentioning the other fighters on the card and look you can talk to and I have to Shawn and Mick and and Dana and Hunter all these fighters want to be on the big pay-per-views they know the bigger the fight at the top of the card the more eyes are on that fight and when you have a spectacular fight and the first second fight on the card if it's on a big pay-per-view with a giant fight at the top of it that can propel your career your next fight you could be fighting the main event on you know a fight pass and progress from there so I think you know I think it's accurate to say that generally everybody wants these these cards to be as big as possible and when all the experts are telling us a 100 percent this isn't a sanction be he's not retaining any performance-enhancing benefits I think and clearly Dana and Hunter thought this we have an obligation to do what we can do for fairness for John definitely for Gus for the rest of the card to try to make this fight happen going forward is there any way we could ever prevent something like this from happening again with a similar situation in place like Nevada so here's I think we have a couple solutions to that and it's not necessarily relative to the Commission but one thing that obviously protected John a lot in this was the frequency of testing you know if you look at his numbers and and these were these were instances where they collected samples but in many of these cases they did multiple tests on him and that means you know the tests I'm reading were for the anabolic steroid but in addition to that they may have done biological passport tests on that same collection that may have done an HGH test an EPO test and this is all confidential that you sought it doesn't release all this information um burrs on the publicly available website but you don't see what those tests are done so the reality and they just told me this is John was one of the most if not the most tested athlete over these last six months when you look at total amount of tests on his samples excuse me one thing that obviously protected him here was that volume of testing and so you saw it came to us and said you know hey we think that you probably should you know up the amount of tests that you're doing so we just renewed a contract with you sada and we reduce we're increasing our testing numbers by thirty to forty percent we currently the first three years of the program are under contract for approximately 2,700 tests and starting this next year we're gonna up that to around forty three forty four hundred tests so I think they're it's going to be more of a burden they're gonna be you know you're Saad is showing up in more doorsteps early in the morning of more of our athletes but I think this is a perfect example that that increased volume of testing actually can be a protectant to the athlete especially when you're talking these low-level pika gram quantities and contaminated cases and things like that we just got to get a fleet s-- to stop taking any supplement that's not third-party tested great point so here's what we've done in that area so about three months ago you sada hosted a working group it included the UFC myself and our sports nutritionist Clint wattenberg who you've met were there Major League Baseball was there the Department of Defense was there there's been war fighters who have purchased supplements at bases over in Iraq and Afghanistan that contain a Federer and other bat products some of them potentially have died as a result of ingesting them so they definitely have an interest in safety and dietary supplements and you saw it as experts were there what we did is we invited in the major third-party certification companies and each one took a half-day presenting what their programs look like we went back and huddled after each one and huddled at the conclusion and said what is a platinum standard third party certification look like let's all these presentations we got what was strengths and ones weaknesses and the others and we have to put a perfect one together what was it what does it look like over the last month we've been authoring a paper that's going to be published in a scientific journal going over what that gold standard Platinum standard looks like going forward any third party certification company that can meet that and there some that are very close I think will be able to do it very quickly we are going to say you saw it is going to say this is an approved line of supplements we approve you to take this and this is something that we've been unable to do in the first three and a half years of the program and I tell you Joe it's the most common question I get from our athletes what you sought approved and as soon as I say you sada doesn't approve any supplements but here's how you ensure your safety they stop listening goes in one ear out the other this is a it's a silly suggestion but why doesn't the UFC come up with its own supplement line and provide them to the fighters and say you can't take anything else yeah I mean it's exactly true it's that sponsorships with other supplement line exactly there's a lot of dynamics to it it's not as easy as yeah doing it overnight its dysfunction method just if you could say hey you can take creatine you could take you know all the multivitamins you could take you know branch chain amino acids all these things that have been proven to be effective but that's that's where - right it's like they're effective meaning they enhance performance and recovery but they don't do enough to be considered a performance-enhancing drug yeah and they're present in the food supply - so like you know basically out of commute you can go eat ten chicken breasts or you know have a couple scoops of protein if you're on the go and don't have time to do it so I think again apples and oranges in terms of performance-enhancing or not so the theory would be we haven't approved when when I'm or Donner asked that question what's approved I can say here's let's say NSF NSF has 1200 supplements that approve I'd say all 1200 of these are proved you should only use these if something were to happen to an athlete the used an approved line of supplements it's a get-out-of-jail-free card if they can prove it and you saw it independently prove it there's no sanction I think that is going to go a long way and I'll give you a reason for that Major League Baseball does that they have for the last couple years now they have some advantage and that all their athletes are our employees and are coming in to the same facility for during the season so they have some control over theirs we don't our athletes are spread among sending 46 countries throughout the world so it's more of a challenge but baseball said the only supplements were allowing in the clubhouse or in a facility are and they use NSF supplements they had zero contaminated supplement cases last year they had I think they're testing numbers were four times the amount of our testing numbers and zero contaminated supplements I mean the proofs in the pudding right there so they deal with NSF I don't know if it's a deal other than they've examined who those certification companies are and they feel that they are you know at the top of the line we don't want to exclude any that's why we're contributing to this paper to say look anyone could be one of these approved lines but you must meet this criteria for platinum standard program but it's coming from someone who's in a supplement business me that's the Wild West out there boy is it I mean there's a there's a lot of shit out there that's just they purposely add performance-enhancing drugs to their stuff because it's cheap and people take it may experience these gains and then they sell a lot of it yeah then you get a following exactly I saw that when I was with the FDA there is and what they normally will do for maybe the first six months of the product they'll spiked it with something if they're going that route and then to decrease liability thereafter they've already got the following their stuffs working like like hell and then they back off just in case the government doesn't our consumer my body must have adapted exactly no you son ship this it's really such a shame because this is such a fantastic fight I mean there's so much drama involved already just having John Jones returning having Alexander Gustafsson looking absolutely sensational in his last fight with Glover Teixeira the trash talk and hype and intensity and the fact that this is really other than DC versus John this is the fight that people want to see in the light heavyweight division and look nobody's saying and I'm certainly not saying that John didn't do anything wrong he obviously did John has two times now tested positive for prohibited substance says however in both occasions arbitrators have determined that it was not done intentionally so anyone who says that all John's getting off light on this he's been suspended for almost two and a half years for a lack with a lack of evidence of any intentional use or cheating you know how much money he's probably lost in those two and a half years how many tens of millions of dollars reputation anybody who says that he got off you know scot-free on this I would argue the otherwise he was felled to the strictest of liability standards out there someone at the top of their game money earning potential like him there's also an incredible amount of stress and and human being he feels in here's what people are you know saying about them and that's that's got to be very difficult also coming off of this massive suspension so he's coming off of the suspension which was huge very very public very worldwide after the cocaine the car accident the the previous the the dick pills that had the the stuff and I mean this is so many things and then to have this happen literally the week of and have the fight moved to California I mean and I get the skepticism that's out there yeah yeah not without delving into this I've spent hours and hours and these experts have spent their careers looking into that that's really what's required to get a comprehension and understanding of it another thing another argument John's being treated specially because he's John but we had another athlete that this somewhat identical thing happened to but nowhere near at the level of John so a kid by a name of grant Dawson so grant Dawson last summer was in the Dana White contender series had an awesome fight Dana's like you got a contract kid we get them into the u sada program the reduce auto program requires you to disclose everything you've used going back twelve months or one year the idea being look even though you weren't under the program if you used you know oral to rentable eight or nine months ago there could still be an advantage that you beginning you know not going to necessarily suspend you because you weren't subject to the program then we're not gonna let you fight it right away you can have to be in the program for a certain amount of time testing clean so he didn't he didn't disclose that he was using anything his first test he tests positive for m3 metabolite low levels he goes to arbitration argues testifies under oath I've never heard of this substance I've never taken it I would never cheat here are all the supplements I was using I can't find it the arbitrator here's the hearing you sada goes of them says hold on a second we're looking into this matter talking to baseball whatever you sought it comes out that hey we can't prove that this didn't enter his substance a year before that disclosure required him to disclose what he was using so he was basically led off and ineligible so John's not the only person in the UFC that this has happened to not notwithstanding other professional sports leagues other Olympics it's happened to other athletes he's not the only one so I think what's important for people I get the skepticism but I think it's very important that people don't accuse someone of something that they didn't do and I want you if you're listening to this I want you to imagine if you're John Jones and you're trying to get your shit together and you didn't do anything new you didn't do anything different we've got to have a path of redemption for people you got you have to and if John as you're saying and all these tests conclude if he didn't do anything folks you got to stop saying he's cheating you get you got he's not cheating if he's not cheating and if it's showing that these are these long-term residual metabolites that are in incredibly small dosage it's there's real cheaters out there and John's fucked up he has fucked up and you were all right to be upset at him when he fucked up this is not as lisa's my conclusion after talking to you and and and I've talked to some independent scientists that were skeptical about some of the aspects of it but they're also they're skeptical because they're not up to date perhaps on the differences in this this pulsing effect or the fact that this is something that is relatively there's not a lot of a lot of documentation on this and this is this is something that's relatively new in terms of our ability to understand pika grams our ability to understand this pulsing effect all these different these variables that you have to take into account when it comes to this people love to call it cheap they love to it's good it's good that the people are out there keeping people honest I think you got a we got a look at this the right way and I think the right way is what you're the way you're laying it out here I don't see any holes in this so you know a couple things in the future that people can look forward to look we want and john wants to fight nevada again and nevada is basically said look i think we understand this is cheb we need to have this hearing there will be a public hearing on this my understanding is early quarter one so look you know don't take my word for it wait until january i'm sure they'll call some of these experts to testify introduce some of these documents to the public rather longer even than this conversation yes but I would be my guess so yeah I mean that's that's to come the whole thing such a disaster for everybody else on the card for amended Nunez and Chris cyborg and for all the people in the undercard I mean it's just to have them to move all the way to California what I'm happy about those that the fight is still happening I'm very happy the fight is still happening I am and again I have to take an objective look about is this fair as it relates to how our policy and what the rules are and you know when you have you know one of the experts in the world dr. Daniel act nura this Mertle laboratory issue an absolute statement like there is no evidence the DHC mt has been readmitted and that based on these low levels he does not retaining a performance enhancing benefit how out of fairness and implementing the program do you prevent this fight from happening you can't do that it would be categorically unfair moving forward from here what changes and what do we do to stop something like this from happening well again I think the increased volume of testing is going to help I think being able to specifically direct our athletes to approve line of supplements will help but you know hey we can Don and I can message the hell out of these things but you know it takes the athletes and their camps to listen to what we're saying so I mean if anything good comes out of this hopefully it's it's a warning to those other out others out there about how careful you need to be so to just to wrap this up so people understand if you if you want to put a button on this there's no evidence whatsoever of any micro dosing so this is one of the concerns people worried about micro dosing no evidence whatsoever of micro dosing wouldn't be a substance you would generally microdose you do endogenous substances not exogenous there's also no evidence of the short-term and medium-term medium of medium-term yep metabolites that were recognized by rich ankov again I think it is yes hey why do I agree I have a tough time with this is very it's very clear that's the only test we have no parent compound ever around as well these are these the only test we have that show these long-term short-term and medium-term metabolites these the short-term in the medium-term ones that would be indicative of him taking it recently don't exist in any point in time during these testing correct so this is most likely something that is inside of his body that is in incredibly small levels and is it safe to say that the detection levels that the detection methods are far superior today than they were a year ago two years ago three years ago increased by thousands of percentage points in sensitivity I mean again and how recently over the last five years and by how recently have they if they improved from today versus a year ago yeah I believe so again you know when I heard about the 1 picogram detection of the m3 metabolites you know that was something that happened this I'm not aware of that ever being that low of a number in any time in the past so I think you know literally week by week month by one month as we're going here that level of sensitivity is increasing essentially no possible performance enhancing benefits from these incredibly low levels that's what the experts are telling me look and again I'm not the expert I don't want to profess that I am but what what do I have to go to I need to go to those experts that have made careers out of studying these substances and the benefits and they are all universally telling me that there's no performance enhancing benefit full compliance by John Jones in terms of being there for you sada at every single test notifying his whereabouts doing everything by the book in terms of what the UFC requires and what you saw to require yes so our program has a three-strike policy so basically you know if you miss a test for an unexplained reason three times then it could be a violation John's never had one whereabouts strike he's always been available when you saw us tried to test them and again especially recency recently one of the most tested athletes in the UFC wasn't there one test in the past where you saw two showed up at the gym and there was some sort of speculation that John was hiding under the ring preview sada not really so that was pre USANA before I got here I've heard about that and all the details I don't know whether it's true or not I think there's a Nevada State Athletic Commission test my recollection is right but it wasn't you saw the test okay so there's no reason in terms of how you're looking at this particular case that this fight should not take place or that John should be sanctioned any further there isn't and look it's it's the least compelling argument but I think you know you have to look at it you have to look at the common-sense approach to this a guy who went through a year and a half of most suspension to very I would categorize as embarrassing public hearings in California along arbitration hearing before McLaren all this science is rooted out about how long this stuff stays in your system long term metabolites four months maybe years you're gonna choose to use oral Tour in a ball still after going through all that leading up to a fight I don't buy that see I don't think I think I agree with what you're saying but in terms of people fucking up there are no bounds on human stupidity and in terms of people's ability to do impulsive things that are irrational that wind up sabotaging their career there's almost more of an indication that people are willing to do that than not is it's very it's you're less likely and this is in terms of especially in particularly in fighters fighters are ridiculously impulsive it's one of the things that categorizes and it's a characteristic of the type of human being that gets involved in that line of work in the first place they're wild motherfuckers they're crazy they do crazy shit and I just I don't I don't buy that that would be new level crazy and look again I categorize a new level crazy guy least compelling argument I agree all these compelling but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't at least consider that I okay I see your point I don't buy it that that part I don't buy I buy all the science and I'm a big John Jones fan I mean you call me John Jones suck up all day long I think he's one of the greatest of all time and I think it's not over for him I think he still could reach I don't even think he's at his peak I think he still got time to be the greatest of all time if he hasn't already achieved that but I think that he's also he's a wild man you know it's one of the reasons why he's so great it's one of the reasons why he opened up the fight with Shogun at 22 years old with a flying knee and he's a wild motherfucker that's who he is and it's one of many reasons besides his talent that he's so goddamn good III know the lows of the lows he's gone through these last two years you wouldn't believe how low those lights are and so again look I don't disagree with you then that's not out of the area of consideration but man I I just don't I think anybody could be reckless I hope you're right I also worry that fighters often in times and I'm not accusing John of doing this but often times surround themselves with morons and these morons give them poor advice and these morons think that they have ways to skirt systems and and get around the rules and they have people that you know with throw much fancy words their way and they want to believe and this happens all the time this happens all the time with fighters in regards to financial management and an advice that they get with that I mean I've seen like world-class fighters do ridiculous shit in terms of strength and conditioning because some asshole with a good vocabulary talks them into some nonsense this is just one of the things that happens with fighters and often times they can be around someone who gives them poor advice in terms of what they can and cannot get away with when it comes to supplementation and when it comes to steroid use yeah absolutely and I see that that all over the place in John's case however to give credit where credit's due you know his team after the initial positive with the dick pills was very interactive with me and Donna and you know checking supplements hey what line should we go to show they you know to give them credit they definitely showed increased exercise of care when it came to supplementation with John well that's great to hear and I really hope this is a thing of the past and I hope this is the last time we ever have to talk about John in this term and that moving forward we just talked about him in terms of his performances and his his fights and you know what he's already achieved yeah champion of all time anything else yeah so I was gonna bring this up at the beginning but the Golden Snitch that's first of all that's Brendan jabs name he gave it to you so taking on a life of its own and I think I think you know the last time we talked about Donner asking Alexa who yes so see what Siri says it's what I'm saying let's see what seriousness but I've never tried this hold on a second who is the Golden Snitch Oh kwatak it's something in Harry Potter yeah last time on and I mentioned you know was in I think my Wikipedia profile it had me as aka the golden slash somebody took this hey Siri who is the Golden Snitch Oh Siri Siri keeps going with wattage so so someone took it down from yeah yeah yeah they do that well I think we talked about you're like I don't know they they just did it I got hearing them so I think I told you that's not I've already co-workers call me it yes my family calls me a call you the goldens friends call me it I was at the MMA awards last year and some Yahoo had a few pops back at me is screaming in between presentations the Golden Snitch I'm sleeping down in my chair my girlfriend is the golden UFC on the end I popped up beautiful just just fucking when they do that just put your hands up in the air make you one so you know definitely should make a shirt during shows I'll sit pretty close to the cage go out in between a fight into the bathroom and it's not Joe Rogan level well half the damn arena standing up excited to see you walking in and out of the fighter walk but two or three people and that walk when I go backstage to check on you side of the Golden Snitch so give them reckon you know Steve Reed you know Steve Reed are bald security that yeah I'd asked looking guy on stage he'll come backstage just mate they're calling me the snitch out there man I think I'm you that poor guy pays for it we were teams the scary guy dude he's a great dude that's guy is at the top of his game in security unbelievable yeah I saw him one time in Las Vegas during a fight he was sitting on the floor something's happened in the fight the crowd goes fucking bananas and everybody stands up on the floor Steve stands up and just motions sit down and the entire fucking section side down 200 plus people I'm like toot if you can without even having to touch somebody just stand up by your presence alone and control something like that I mean the best I've ever seen he's lost legitimacy to my story here it's not marketing but let me finish the story here so I'm in Chicago this year I think there was a pay-per-view you were there right yes so something happened and I was late getting to the arena and they had cut off kind of the loading dock I couldn't get to it so I had my oldest daughter with me and so we're having to walk through where all the crowds walking in and you know dudes Olive Golden Snitch they're gonna picture Golden Snitch my daughters like what the fuck's that what is going on so she's 22 so two days ago Christmas morning I'm opening up presents so I get the presents for my daughters the three of them and my middle daughter is very artistic and so they create these cool sculpted beer mugs and there's four of them one of them's like bald guy brewing nowitzki something and one of them says Golden Snitch Brewing Company so it's cool looking thing and she she drew me a black and white kind of rendition of all four which I'm gonna hang up really cool so then my girlfriend's there so she hands me the box and she's been telling me all along she owes I got you the best fucking present ever in the history of presents Michael the hell is this so I open up the box series of t-shirts I think what size are you large large there we go man so you since you created it you literally and figuratively have to wear it now so that picture there's some there we go baby so I posted pictures taken King man series Moscow I think I can say this hopefully they'll let me back in but it's out in front of KGB or FSB headquarters so that building in the background is KGB eff has now known as FSB oh wow so yeah so I posted a picture she got me like 20 shirts I put them on my private Instagram Facebook everybody in the world's like take my money man where can I get one where the weigh-ins tomorrow hi you guys created you gotta own it now I got one for Shaw to you can shops mad at you is he yeah he called you the golden rap now change I thought maybe he's informed misinformed he thinks first of all that you were an employee of USANA there yeah and that now you're an employee of the UFC he's misinformed about that and I think he he likes to call skeptical he's skeptical Hippo I am skeptical as well but I one thing that I've learned from doing this podcast over the years is that there's no fucking way there's it's a it's impossible to know everything it is impossible and you have to rely on the expertise of the people who have spent a lifetime studying these things that's very important here's another thing there's no way these people could be lying about this and it wouldn't massively damage their career going full they'd be done the someone would find out someone would get to them the other scientists without them there would be studies done there would be papers done the internet would find out about it everybody would know there's no way it's it's pretty unprecedented in writing with the lack of these studies they were chenko one being the my saying is even right how do you say it rich anko the change' it's pretty impressive they would put these absolutes in writing you know with this lot you know I think they looked at it very hard and detailed and obviously they weren't quick and turning it around and we were to love this decision to be made a lot earlier so we could have routed it and vetted it out with Nevada but they did indeed you know sign their names to these pretty absolute statements and what what else can the UFC and I do when these experts are putting those absolutes out there and I get that people go oh well it's good you actually do you gotta understand folks this would be career suicide this is this is this is cutting-edge science we're talking about there's too many people that would have a vested interest in calling bullshit it's it's not something you don't fuck around when it comes to these things the people that are at the the front of the line when it comes to catching people on these things and the science that they're imploringly they're that they're involved with it's this is not you get you can't like guess on the outside with no education it's just not wise and this is what I keep seeing
