all right here we go hello Shannon what's happening I'm doing well how are you being here appreciate it this is an incredible opportunity I'm glad you you're interested in the subject of American Indian history and I'm glad to be here to talk about it yeah I'm glad you were willing to come here yeah I became fascinated when I well I've always been sort of peripherally interested but never really delved into it until I read empire of the summer moon and then you know have you read that SG Queens book about the Comanches and about the Texas Rangers and it's such a crazy story that I just became obsessed and then I read son of the morning star and then I read Black Elk the black alcohol was particularly fascinating to me because it details life before like before they killed Custer to living on reservations to the desperation I watch it before we get started tell people what you are who you are what you do so my name is Shannon o'loughlin I'm citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma I've been a practicing attorney since about 2001 and I'm currently the executive director and attorney for the Association on American Indian Affairs we're the oldest nonprofit serving Indian country we've been around since 1922 alright and we should tell people if you ever listen to this in the future this is all going on right now when the United States is going through one of the craziest times ever in terms of dealing with a virus mm-hmm we're we're all sort of on lockdown all gyms are closed all comedy shows are closed all concerts are closed clubs bars everything's closed and some places are restricting travel and it it it's it's interesting to me that this is all going on and we've never had to experience this before but it makes me think of what happens when what happened when the Europeans first came to North America and encountered the Native Americans and they didn't have any immunity to all these disease is that the Europeans are bringing over and in some cases wiped out as much as 90% of the people that were living here mm-hmm but we're still here yeah we would have only shut the border is about 550 years ago we would yeah if you had a Trump Trump Indian back then wanted to build walls around everywhere not get there yeah what's on it it is me really it's though I mean it's one of the biggest times in human history where if you talk about the Europeans coming to North America and what what happened to the Native Americans just from diseases I mean it's it's one of the biggest genocides in history not now when you talk about 90% of a population wiped out by disease I mean that's almost almost impossible genocide didn't happen because of the disease the disease did what the diseases did but the genocide happened through colonization the genocide happened through u.s. Indian policy that continues today the genocide is ongoing so this is not something from the past this is something that continues today that we still are working to fight against that's why the my organization is here right that's that's absolutely true I just was getting into those no it's fine I want you to talk about everything you want to talk about but so let's let's go to that then since this is the United States has a very strange situation with Native Americans where Native Americans have reservations and on those reservations they have sovereignty they can they have different rules that can do what they want it's very strange it's like there's nations inside of our nation mm-hmm like how do you feel about that so it's a system that's been imposed by maybe the best way to start is kind of start with the beginning like how did how did how did we get to where we are today there phoof and there's a lot of information and so you got to stop me if I start getting to care all right no work we have plenty of time and a lot of interest so don't worry about that so there are three Supreme Court cases that happened in the 1800s and there was a Justice named John Marshall who was actually buying Indian land from from us the US government through u.s. grants and so he was interest he was an interested party but he was making decisions that that set forward the kind of watershed principles that continued affect who Native Americans and Indian nation governments are today and so those three cases the first one was called Johnson V McIntosh and it was in 1823 and it didn't involve any Indians it was a non-indians coming to court to try to determine who owned a piece of land in Indiana and there was one guy Johnson who was a plaintiff who had purchased the land directly from the peon cushaw Indians who were related to the Miami tribe today and then the defendant was McIntosh and he purchased land from the US government and so the case of course was who had the proper rights and threw that case through the narrative that John the justice marshal created he brought forward a piece of international law that affects us today and that's the doctrine of discovery have you ever heard of the doctrine and the discovery so that's that's any Christian civilized European nation has the right to conquer indigenous heathen peoples so this was the principle that this case was based on and it set forward this weird relationship the tribes in the US government have today so if the u.s. if the christian european peoples had the rights to take land away from tribes because they were in fee area race which is this this is language from the case they're inferior race they're savages they're unable to govern themselves and they only have a right of occupancy so that was the first of three cases that Justice Marshall decided and of course he was an interested party in the whole thing because he had purchased land from the United States and he wanted to make sure his land was secure the second case was Cherokee Nation V Georgia and this was a time during the Indian Removal Act that Andrew Jackson had gotten through Congress to remove the eastern Indians west of the Mississippi River into Indian Territory which is of course now Oklahoma Kansas Texas area and and again this was a case that actually the Cherokee Nation tried to bring before the Supreme Court and before the supreme court could even make a decision on the and I just realized I didn't even tell you the facts of the case so there was I'm getting ahead of myself I apologize no this is this is incredible experience to be here so I'm a little bit nervous so in Cherokee Nation versus Georgia Georgia was trying to assert its laws over the Cherokee Nation and so the Cherokee Nation brought this case before the Supreme Court to say you know the the this the state does not have any right to assert any of its laws against us and what justice Marshall did is said well you're not a foreign nation so you can't bring a case before the Supreme Court and determined that tribes were a pseudo sovereign nation that they were still under tutelage and they needed to be civilized again the same kind of inferior savage language in this case and held that the federal government had plenary power over tribal affairs and that the Cherokee Nation couldn't bring this case to court so what ended up happened is some missionaries who were serving the Cherokee Nation actually developed a case and violated Georgia laws so they could bring a case before the Supreme Court and that case was called rooster V Georgia and I think that was about 1832 1831 and in that case it was ruled that the United States had a guardian and ward type relationship with tribes and so we were the wards they were our guardian and that set up this weird dynamic that still exists today the Supreme Court's and other case other courts cite in in decisions today to basically take away more and more rights so so that was that's the watershed basis for this weird relationship that we have and it's based on racism it's based on tribes being an inferior peoples they not be civilized and and so here we are so help help direct me into another question here well that's a fascinating thing the idea that the United States government is that they're like the big daddy yeah look over the tribes and that the only way the tribes can exist is if they exist the European Way right the great white father yeah mm-hmm and so all this was happening wild they were trying to conquer the west so all this was happening around the goldrush time and this was happening before then so this was opening in the most of all the gold dress was 1850s okay so forty-nine eggs a little bit before that and they're trying to they're basically trying to take over land right oh absolutely absolutely so Georgia wanted that land for themselves they wanted to remove the Cherokee and of course the other quote/unquote civilized tribes that were in the southeast at that time and that's what's so interesting is because you see throughout time and this is a this is a little bit why I have a problem with some of the books that you've read is because they've taken small pictures of what was going on and kind of removed the context of what was really happening there are so many tribes across the United States that tried everything to resist or comply or assimilate so that they could maintain their way of life maintain their lands and continue to prosper as they had been but the United States was obviously for a formidable opponent and regardless of for example the Five Civilized tribes and their their tactic was to assimilate was to go to school and educate themselves and learn English and even though they did that and they did everything that the United States wanted them to do they were forced off their land to the west into Indian Territory the Comanche who you've learned about through the book they that those events happen during a point of time and that was their effort at resistance they saw how disease wiped out their brethren from other nations they knew that folks who are coming to get them and so that was their way of resisting being assimilated and having everything taken away from them in the defense of the authors of those books they did cover a lot of that they these books are in no way taking the side of the United States government you know most of them I mean the most amazing thing about Empire the summer moon was just how special the relationship that the Comanches had to the land and about how and Jess can Parker's I wouldn't know Cynthia Cynthia Ann Parker who's she's the photo out there the woman that's breastfeeding her child she was kidnapped when she was 9 and assimilated with the Comanches and then was wreak it nap by the United States government when she was in her 30s and didn't want to go back she missed the Comanche life and threw her and threw her depictions and her descriptions of the way they lived and the understanding of it they got a better sense of like what she missed about that life and that they had an incredible relationship with the land they lived basically just in teepees they were very nomadic they just followed around the Buffalo and they had you know in in her way of looking at it on a magical existence in comparison to this really boring life that these settlers had and when you know she looked at it it was interesting because she was a girl who was born you know a how would you describe it a white settler and then from the age of nine on lived as a Comanche so she had like sort of a view of both worlds and you know she very much took the side of the Comanches and she wanted to go back like she had spoken Comanche in the book there's an encounter where they bring in someone who was a Comanche to speak to her and she grabs him she's like take me back we're gonna leave let's get out of here now like her thought was like we got to get out of here like this way of life is bullshit like I want to go back to the Comanches but she just didn't understand that that way of life was slowly going away and her son Quanah Parker who is that photograph over there that's on bullets that somebody made for me I don't even know where that came from somebody sent me that but that he was the last Comanche chief and they by the during her lifetime and her son's lifetime was the last of it and it's a very sad story but you know the Comanche still live today right sure in Oklahoma right there's quite a few of them under I've actually been in contact with some of those guys oh that's awesome yes it's very cool but the do but they don't live the way they did right I mean their way of life was removed I mean they were wiped out in in in that in that sense but cultures aren't static right and we're not static and I think one of the the major issues that American Indians have is that we are often stereotyped into this this picture and if we don't fit that then we're not legitimately Indian when you when you first met me what did you think do you think well sir brown skin where's where's the feathers I mean this is no no I don't think you did but I guess it's a rhetorical question oh hell yes so are you 100% Native American no absolutely not just a Georgia um and that's that's let's talk about that let's talk about that what other so blood-quantum is an imposition from the federal government that is that has been used to weed out Native Americans so the whole the whole idea of US federal policy has been to assimilate Indians to rid themselves of the Indian problem so that land and resources could be obtained right and so blood-quantum was one way that the US government could do that so if you if you didn't meet what they thought was some kind of purity test then they could write you off right but that is not how many Indian nations view tribal citizenship or membership it's through other types of cultural continuity family relationships and it's not about race that's been an imposition on us so I'm polish and Choctaw so half and half something like something like that Cynthia Ann Parker is probably a good example of them right because she wasn't 0% Native American but was purely to mansion right right we're absolutely absolutely Italians are very similar I'm at but I have a last name that's Irish because I'm one-quarter Irish so growing up around Italians it was always like a way they made fun of me you know it was like it was always a funny thing like are you sure you're Italian like this this it's you know it's like it's a purity test like Italians like a nice last name with a lot of vowels you know it's that's what they like and it's really interesting so as executive director of the Association on American Indian Affairs we get tons of inquiries probably the top inquiry we get are people wanting to do DNA tests to determine what tribe they belong to so everyone seems to want to be Indian and even some people are emboldened enough to say you know hey I did my DNA test it says I'm Native American where's my Indian check really there's so many misconceptions about what it means to be Native American that's a real issue yes it that doesn't exist but there's some kind of fantasy or myth that many people in the US have kind of believed about Indians because we don't know it's not like it's taught well in school it's it's not like this is part of a normal dialogue and correct me if I'm wrong but I don't believe that it can really clearly identify what nation you're from no DNA test can you can't identify whether you have certain genetic traits that might be from North America like Canada or might be from South America as well right right yeah so if you really want to learn about your history and heritage you have to do that genealogical research and if you weren't aware there's 574 federally recognized tribes and about 300 other tribal groups in the United States and other on top of the 400 yeah that aren't recognized by the United States for many reasons and so each one of those tribes have their own laws they have their own systems of governance their own whether it's a more traditional form of government or written constitutional government each one of them have their own eligibility requirements for citizenship so you have to do your own genealogy and then if you do find who you may be affiliated with and you go to that nation and you talk to them about what their eligibility requirements are some of them are residency some of them are familial relations and in some of them are blood-quantum the term Indian is that okay to use that's actually a legal term of art so Indian is a defined legal term in federal law of art it's a legal term of art that was sorry I'm a lawyer that just means that it's it's a defined federal term that has a specific definition in in u.s. code we tend to like to be called the nation that we belong to right who are people so for you would be Choctaw rock top right and for others whatever a lot of people use native-american and that's that's more that's a broad term because that really can define folks from south of the invisible border north of the invisible border mm-hmm and in the Western Hemisphere so it's a much broader term indigenous peoples is a great great term yeah a lot of people in Canada they use first nation first nation you know they have a very interesting relationship with First Nation people up there it's similar but different mm-hmm you know they have very different rules in terms of like hunting and fishing and they basically could do whatever they want whereas the people that live I have friends live in Alberta yeah and First Nation people can you know they don't have hunting seasons they just do whatever they want they basically say look let's just pretend like we never invaded and you just live how you would normally mm-hmm but with modern equipment yeah so it's it's a little odd but there's no way getting around it being odd I mean I think one of the things that I got out of this recent obsession with American Indian culture and these stories was realizing how little I knew about the history of this country you know you you might know you might have a basic understanding of what happened that you learned in school it's real peripheral you know it's very surface and then upon reading these books and made me realize like what happened here like this what happened here over the course of a couple hundred years is almost unprecedented in in history like that this nation was conquered by all these invaders that just kept coming in kept changing the rules kept breaking trees making treaties breaking treaties wiping people out calling things battles when they were really just massacres of women and children I mean there's some horrendous horrendous stories of the justification of these massacres that were no different than any other horrific barbarian slaughter that you might have heard about in history that's looked down upon but for years in this country they were taught as if they were actual battles I mean the history of this country with in regards to the tribes and American settlers and the soldiers is terrifying it's terrifying that this just happened a couple of hundred years ago and that people are capable of these things and that the ancestors of these people are just roaming around today and that's what this country was founded on this country was founded on massacres right and and and that policy has been studied by folks like Adolf Hitler and it was even included he talked about studying how the u.s. treated American Indians in his book Mein Kampf really yes so and but it wasn't just the battles there have been many different types of battles that we consider warfare though it hasn't been done with you know guns and legal right legal battles exactly I mean since the 1600s Europeans have been trying to educate us and assimilate us and civilize us and have passed laws once the United States became a new country in the 1800's passed laws to take our children and move them far away and and punish them if they spoke their language cut their hair put them in the schools that were military based and they studied academics in the morning and then they did trade in the afternoon and in those trades were to help pay for the schools so they were basically indentured servants slave labor making sure that the school could have enough funds to pay for their own education and the boarding school history in the United States and Canada has horrendous horrendous stories and the these schools were funded by the US federal government and the Association and other groups are trying to get the United States to release records of who were the children in these schools we think there's there were about 500 boarding schools across the United States and about at least 20,000 children that we can figure out were were killed were duck died in these schools yeah so there's the Carlisle some of this work has been done at the Carlisle Indian School in in Pennsylvania which is now owned by the Army Corps Army Corps of Engineers and there are some tribes that are trying to repatriate their children that are in graves there and bring them back home so this has been a process all over the country trying to figure out you know who these children were where they belong in and to bring them home and it's it's been a really difficult process for the organization's all of them died disease not being fed working too much all those things that could kill a child and all these things there's records of all these different children and the places they still no we haven't been able to folks that are doing this work have not been able to find all the records and like I said the federal government probably doesn't have the records probably has mismanaged a lot of the records of regarding these boarding schools and and there were different times there have been different eras of Indian policy where the federal government was like oh wait this isn't working let's let's get out of this business of teaching Indians let's give it to the churches let them do it for a while and then it would come back in to the federal government and but the churches would have it and of course we've heard all of the horrible things that that different churches have done to children and there are still many boarding school survivors today that can tell those stories of abuse sexual and physical and who still live with that today there's a organization called the Native American boarding school healing coalition that is really working on these kind of issues and have are pulling together the stories and are also working with survivors to try to heal from that that trauma that's not just theirs but it's it's this insured intergenerational historic trauma that has been with our communities for a couple hundred years now so there there are a lot of stories like that and this again this is US federal policy you know they would while they were while the US was building the reservation system and and and putting tribes kind of in these blockades if you did not send your child to school you weren't given rations you weren't given your food if you practiced your culture you you could be killed for practicing your culture using your language because and because this was the assimilation policy of the day and this happened I would say 1850 1870s through the 1920s there was this horrific period of federal Indian policy of doing trying to do away with language communal type living cultural practices and religion so this isn't just you know done warfare this has been a continuing policy that even affects us today so it was gun warfare until they got the Indians to move into the reservation and then it was basically an annihilation of the culture right and it meets all the definitions of genocide from the from international law one of the things that they talked about in Black Elk was the practice of the Ghost Dance the this idea that they were going to somehow or another bring back the old ways and it's a sad sad story yeah when you hear them talk about it especially because it's coming from the words of Black Elk who was a guy that was there with the Battle of Little Bighorn and then from then now is an older man talking about what what his experiences have been like haven't had seen his people moved to reservations and seen basically every single treaty broken I mean was there a single treaty the United States had with the Indians that it didn't break mm-hm that would that's insane I mean every single one and most treaties had some similar language a lot of them talked about they had bad man provisions so bad man provisions were basically if armed in the US if our men come in and to your jurisdiction and do something bad we'll take care of it for you you know just some simple provisions like that but that never was enforced the u.s. let let their people come in and take over what we're supposed to be protective areas of land and and that was just constant that happened that happened everywhere so there were bad man provisions there were a lot of provisions a lot of beautiful provisions that that tribes still talk about today you know as as long as the the grass grows and you know we'll have our lands and and none of these provisions were ever upheld and a lot of the East Coast tribes there their boundaries were changed and new treaties were made and accepted and and removal happened in and there were new treaties and nothing was ever maintained where did you grow up did you grow up in Oakland Oklahoma you grew up on a reservation so Oklahoma is an interesting case so Oklahoma did have set aside land so Choctaw had their area Chickasaw and the other tribes that were removed to Oklahoma and by the way because of that removal their tribes that were already there were removed so there were already tribes there that Caddo and Comanche and other other tribes that this was already their land so new tribes moved in and land during the hmm I'm forgetting my dates now but there was a commission around 1906 or so where there was a census and individual Indians were allotted about a hundred and sixty acres apiece and this was an effort to decrease the amount of land base that tribes held in common right and this happened all across the country not just in Oklahoma where there were allotment policies and I believe there there were about heck I'm not good with numbers I think there were like 19 million acres that that were removed this way of land but what happened today there is a criminal case before the Supreme Court that is actually addressing these issues because even though our lands were allotted the exterior boundaries of our reservations the area that we had agreed to live in they've never been extinguished they've never been diminished and so the Supreme Court says act Supreme Court is actually looking at this issue now as to whether we still have jurisdiction within the exterior boundaries of our reservations in Oklahoma would that extend to cities other cities in Oklahoma that are in those areas now yeah so if you think of Tulsa yeah so that's Creek Nation so it also would be owned well so not necessarily so so it's raised a lot of fear with with non-indians about why yeah the Indians were taken back the land oh my god but what would actually happen there's a lot of places in Indian country where there's allotment and there's there's non-indian individuals who have feel and within exterior boundaries of reservations and then individual Indians owning feel and within the exterior boundaries reservation land feel and so just how you woody no no so how you own land it's called it's not restricted it's it's in fee you own the title to that land right a lot of land held by tribes is in trust or in restricted fee so a common area land like like let's look at them the Onondaga Nation in in New York State they have the exterior boundaries of their reservation they own restricted feel and so they own it but they can't without us permission right trust land is similar and it's treated the same as restricted fee but it's held in trust so the US has more control of what happens on that land or has been seen to have a little more control than it would and just restricted fee but within the exterior boundaries of the reservation you can have this checkerboarded ownership of land of non-indians and Indians and and but that doesn't necessarily mean that the tribe has jurisdiction over the non-indian feel and and the the civil and criminal jurisdiction issues on an area of land like that is extremely complex and continues to be argued in the courts and most of the time our jurisdiction most of the time we lose those cases especially since the 80s and 90s and up until today we've there was really a change in kind of how the Supreme Court decided Indian law cases so if we go back into the history of federal Indian policy you see this kind of weird schizophrenic you know those those those Marshall cases that I talked about they really set forward kind of schizophrenic principles that the Indians are sovereign but they're they're just a ward and they're uncivilized so we have to take care of them but their sovereign and so you have a different areas of eras of time policymakers who who support tribal sovereignty and we'll use those cases to help support that sovereignty and then there are other administrations that come around not talking about any current administration but that that used those cases against us and in degrade policy and degrade any kind of rights that we may have gained in other eras so it's it's really been you know Indians today live in this live in such an insecure world you know our statistics are horrible you know the suicide rate for our youth our high school graduates everything that you could possibly think of there's a statistic on we're usually the lowest or the worst and it's because we live in a society that is constantly changing we can never depend on whether or not our rights are secured whether or not we're going to have land jobs be able to practice our culture we're still trying to you know there were a period of periods of time in our history where people would steal our religious objects and our sacred items they still do and loot our graves there there's a law called the Native American graves protection and repatriation act that was meant to repatriate those stolen items and those stolen ancestors back to tribes so that we could help with our cultural revitalization as well as put our ancestors back to rest there are still at least 200,000 ancestors in boxes and museums Jesus that's just in the u.s. 200,000 in museums in the u.s. just in the US so our ancestors and our cultural items and religious objects have also been taken all around the world imagine if it was French people it was 200 thousand French people in boxes and museums in the US and France is one of the the worst so there was just a case a recently French loved to auction our sacred objects for some reason there was a sacred shield of the Pueblo of akima in about 2016 that was being sold at auction in in France and the the tribe the pueblos fought and even went to court in France to try to stop that auction and get that item back because there was evidence that it had been stolen in contemporary times and France said you don't have standing in our courts so even though they're considered sovereign or a pseudo sovereign nation here in the United States we didn't have standing in in the French Court and couldn't protect that item this way so we had to use other means of negotiation and arm-twisting that item has finally been repatriated but it took it took about four years to for that to happen so it's finally been properly yeahit's but that's that's just one case this happens where is it now it's back it's back home at the acoma pueblo and no this is a sacred object you can see on display right these are items that are used for religious purposes they're there they're protected sacred items and the Association we were fighting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year in the year before because they were displaying items from a private collection that were sacred one item was even a funerary object was an item that is never supposed to be seen because it's buried with the ancestor and it was on display and without any kind of consultation with the tribes affected it's horrendous the way we still look at Indian people and and our cultures and our practices today we're still being called heathens there was an article I think just last week there was a religious man saying that were heathens because we we this sage that I gave you because we burn sage as one of our medicinal and spiritual pratt was the reason why they were calling you even yeah and this was just in an article last week from a what from a Christian group oh well yeah yes the it seems like the issue of what we're talking about but youth suicide high school graduation drug addiction all those problems those those are the most massive ones and what could be done to try to mitigate these problems hmm like if you had a magic wand mhm and I mean it's been I mean if you if you talk about Native American reservations in this country you people talk about poverty they talk about drug addiction and alcoholism they talk about despair I mean this is something that was also brought up in the book Black Elk so this seems to be something that started when they were forced into reservations in the first place and then were ashamed of their heritage because of the fact they were subjugated by these these I mean whatever you want to call them the the soldiers the the military what could be done what if you had a magic wand and you said and I said Shan and what can what can be done to give you you you have all the money at your disposal what would you do well there's there's no quick fix to issues like that and people have been trying to work with tribes regarding poverty and addiction and there's no quick fix there's no quick fix well I think what what there is and and what we're working to do see my organization's almost 100 years old and and we're looking forward to the next hundred years what are we going to do and there is really important work done being done regarding healing from historic trauma in its community work its work that engages the entire community so it's not just directed at young people it's not just directed at a segment it's it really involves a whole community coming together and healing but what also really needs to happen is we need to bring people like you along with us so we need if if we can't clear away the myths that euro America or white America whatever you want to call it if we can't clear away those myths that we continually face every day every time I go into Washington DC damn it every time I go into the Wegmans there's a big Washington football team Tostitos potato chips with the Washington football team name on there and and the Redskins and I was that offensive word that's an offensive me even saying that like right there is that offensive yes yes not to everybody but the majority of Native American groups tribes they've all let the team know that that that that name is offensive and they still won't change it they don't they say it's honoring it's honoring Native Americans that term is used and you see it in historic records to count Indian skins or scalps that have been taken from Indian people it's an offensive it's not just derogatory or demeaning but it's we should be really clear what you're saying we've seen skins and scalps I mean dead people yeah yeah yeah and sorry oh no no worries listen this is the number-one reason why I wanted to have you here yeah I want I want it from your perspective because for us we get oh yeah that's an offensive word here that's offensive I heard that's offensive mm-hmm the majority people are not talking to someone who's deeply ingrained in Native American issues and culture like you're so you get explained to us that you know it makes sense right if we of those it was you know think about some auditory term for someone somewhere I mean even if it was like kind of derogatory like if they were called the Washington Krauts and it was all based on Germans like a lot of German people probably be really pissed off at that like hey you know that's kind of shitty like why you calling us that but it's the Chiefs Kansas City Chiefs are like what other Native American names there's been a ton of them right yeah Braves there's a lot of Britons other Braves still around yeah yes they still have that name so all is anybody give it given in and change their name I'm I yes there has and there's been really a movement with high school colleges and I don't know the status of any you know as far as NFL or national teams Syracuse Syracuse University had a derogatory mascot that they changed some years back because of the tribes there they're now in the state of New York fought for that what was that mascot I can't remember but now they're there there's some kind of like orange it's an orange super orange yeah yeah exactly but but but if we're ever going to fix these issues I think we really need to start with our public education system we need to teach people that Indians are still here we're still alive it's amazing how many people don't even realize that that Indian people exist outside of casinos it is kind of crazy if you think about it there's not another culture that gets named it gets teams named after them we're we have Indians all around us all the time just go to the grocery store and buy some butter or some baking soda look at look at different yeah it pop culture Tomahawk missile the Indian motorcycle and and the the Pontiac had a I think an Indian head on it's a car back in the day I think you know it was a yeah it's it's all over our our culture it's all around us but yet we don't even realize that that what that means yeah and so it really to many of us you would think it would open up a dialogue about about Indian people and and whether we're going to choose to do something different with this history because it is our history it's our collective history and we have throughout time changed the narrative and stories of our history you know when when we've all realized that Columbus wasn't such a great guy that took a long time yeah yeah well what do you think about that you're Italian crazy it's crazy that it took so long to figure out that he was a sociopath and a murderer I mean what would you read the accounts of the the different religious people that were traveling with Columbus wrote I forget what they were what what their designation was but there was one journal that detailed what they did to Native American babies shattered their heads on rocks and cut people's arms off if they didn't bring their weight and gold to them I mean horrific horrific tales of torture and murder mm-hmm and it's like how is this the guy that we have a day off for how is this Columbus thing you realize what Columbus was a conqueror I mean he was just a symbol of the times music 1492 it was a brutal time in human history and when they arrived in what they mean that really didn't even arrive here but when they arrived wherever they did arrive it was the worst thing that could have ever possibly happened to the people that were already living there and that this guy is somehow or another you know a part of our folklore you know 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue and all that nonsense and meanwhile he's a fucking murderer and it's it's kind of crazy yeah that they knew this but it took until now I mean didn't they change it to indigenous peoples day well there are still cities counties States that are still in the process of changing that I'm not sure I think there are some cities in in California that have already done that and you know celebrate indigenous peoples day Columbus Ohio not named after Columbus though right is it named after another dude no what's it named after Columbus it is giant statue of in front of City Hall change that shit so late you got a Columbus hat on bro you piece of shit I'm sorry I was trying to ignore that okay I'm sorry thanks a lot thanks a lot I feel really welcome that's right the Cleveland Indians another one I forgot about the Atlanta Braves the Washington Redskins it is nuts when you stop and think about how many American teams are named after Indians animals and Indians Columbus man fuck you Columbus change your name what would they change it to name it after a lake or something well name it after a cool Native American did that be okay yeah all right whoo I would I would I would consult with the Native Americans before right they would have to be someone from Ohio like what what nation is in Ohio well there's not any now there are indigenous peoples there but there are no federally recognized tribes in Ohio Wow so who are the indigenous people that are not federally recognized I'm not sure but I know that there was Indiana Ohio that was Miami tribe there in Oklahoma but there are say Miami you mean Miami this city no they're a tribe people okay because you were saying that earlier and I was I was gonna correct you I was gonna ask you rather have you meant the city no no I'm so much Jimmy is did Miami get named after Native Americans I don't know I don't know but I would I would think so there's a lot of place names that are named after indigenous rivals so Miami is a type of it's a trosset yes yes and and they're in Oakland how confusing there in northern Oklahoma they probably said the Miami people you can keep it but what's interesting in these states like Indiana and Ohio where indigenous peoples have just been removed whole heartedly is that tons of archaeologists and other people that like to loot they have taken so many things out of the ground there was a case that the FBI actually got ahold of in Indiana gentleman by the name of Don Miller who had a huge ranch house and farm and it was just full of Native American artifacts including human remains and there were even items from other countries that he had had looted and taken and the FBI actually investigated that and and because the man was like 90 years old they didn't prosecute him but they were able to take back those items and through that Native American graves protection and repatriation act they've been consulting with tribes to repatriate those items back but that looting and collecting and in areas like Indiana and Ohio Jimmy actually has it up on the screen oh yeah I find two thousand human bones among antiquities seized from man's home so where this gentleman get all this stuff his collection was Native American including the bone Tim carpenter of the FBI told media outlets yeah there have report Miller reportedly admitted he'd conducted illegal digging expeditions but he never faced criminal charges before his death in 2015 right so this guy was just digging stuff up and just showing it around his house and there were rules against this oh absolutely absolutely and oh with if it's on land that say if he like just what if he owns a ranch how does that work like if your own it's it's dependent and a lot of the things that that he had it wasn't clear where he had got it from he didn't even know or remember keep any records of where he got a lot of the items so our laws are really screwy with this too so federal and tribal lands are protected so public lands parks and tribal lands are protected lands you can't go and dig in federal or tribal lands without a permit among other things but just in state private private lands it's really dependent on what the state laws are and and it's it's really inconsistent whether those whether looting is protected or not mm-hmm and so that's where it's interesting because there's a lot of gigantic ranches in Texas that are privately owned that were originally Native American hunting grounds they've there's ones that a friend of mine has hunted on that they have these pictographs you go inside these caves and this is on private land someone owns this you go inside these caves and there's ancient artwork all over the walls of the cave and signs of fire like you know soot on the ceiling of the cave where they lit campfires like this should probably be some sort of a historical site right and it's it's usually not protected and and people get real angry when Indians try to get involved in where there may be developments that will have an effect on a burial site a sacred site or other other type of site people really get angry and so it's really hard for tribes to work to protect these areas work to learn about what the areas are even about there's been so much amateur archaeology in this whole country was founded on amateur archaeology let's dig up look at what we found in this grave you know everyone was looking for for gold and other special things and oftentimes they just took whatever was in the grave and and and created the Antiquities art market which still is is all over the world today so the Association is constantly looking at at auctions and trying to return items that that private collectors have obtained improperly we just got a human vertebra removed from a u.s. auction just a couple of weeks ago they were selling it because they said it had an arrow point still in you know so that that has value and in some markets and this they had done DNA on this to prove that no it was they were selling it as a Native American vertebra it was from a collector in in Massachusetts well how could they prove that it wasn't just a settler that was killed by an arrow right I don't know and that's the thing about that's the thing about trying to work with auctions and private collectors as they often don't want to work with us because they're trying to make money so oftentimes items whether they're religious objects or human remains they have a story or what's called a provenance associated with them that is often made up to drive the price of the item so whether that was a legitimate vertebra of a Native American we don't know because we can't get that collector to talk to us so the collector is under no obligation by law to talk to you know why we try to send the FBI in our friend Tim carpenter to them so how would they determine they mean wouldn't they have to do a DNA analysis of the bones and try to figure out where who the person was well the DNA analysis isn't necessarily going to tell you where it came from it could tell you that it was Native American would they even be able to get that out of bones I don't know and I'm not a scientist but you know there was a there was a case really not that long ago called the Kennewick Man case I don't know if maybe you heard of it but it was a an ancestor was uncovered in in the state of Washington and he was old old old old and the universities involved in the Army Corps who had possession of it we're going to repatriate it to appropriate tribes and what ended up happening is that you know academia stepped up and said hi wait this isn't Native American we think he's something else and for years Native Americans fought to get that ancestor ancient one back and finally after a court case that deemed the item wasn't that the ancestor wasn't Native American DNA test was done and it was indeed Native American and and the ancestor was finally repatriated to how that works so yeah listen there's you said there's five hundred recognized tribes many more that are unrecognized who would that go to right so like say if you won and it's brought back and given to Native Americans to who and to where right so so so let's look at the best-case scenario and in in a lot of museums have maintained records that may have human remains and associated funerary objects and have enough information to know where that came from what side it was located at what County what state and we know from tribal histories as well as federal us documentation that that that area was likely affiliated with with you know this tribe or that tribe or maybe several tribes and so consultation occurs under that law about those ancestral remains and funerary objects and it's determined where those items should go back in the worst case scenario where there's not any information oftentimes evidence of well who were the collectors that were giving to institution what has been the history of the institution and where has it obtained different collections and through that you know it's deduced who may be affiliated with with those those items or the the ancestors so it can be a pretty long drawn-out process but what's interesting about it as museums and other institutions fought this law for a long time and they said well you know all of our collections will you know we won't be able to fulfill our purpose as a museum or an academic institution to study these things it's like well hell you haven't studied it in a hundred years ya know most most of these when when people work to consult with museums most of these items are in boxes and often poorly managed and maintained so they're just sitting somewhere in storage right so the museum owns it and they're kind of hoarding it yeah interesting yeah so this Kennewick Man can you pull up some information about that yeah great because I'm getting my dates yeah I'm very curious about what the dates would be now when we're talking about Native Americans um do you agree with the idea okay let's see here kind of Wick man finally it's free but they did so much study skills and ever found in North America there's a handsome fellow let me see that picture looks normal why didn't you just ran into that guy at 7-eleven like what's up bro click sticker he's like hey a modern American a modern human I should say that's the bones Fairs bones Wow his rib bones so what is it what does it give us a date on his what they have Carl go to that picture the teeth again that's crazy so so just let me tell you that looking at human remains for many tribal peoples is difficult it's like looking at a naked body I mean it's it's the essence of someone that you know we shouldn't be seeing Oh seeing even these images that that should have been in the ground that should have gone and disappeared it had a journey it got interrupted and and you know it some tribes and cultures believe that that's harmful to interact or look at or just a little bit humiliating hmm it's exposed right it so so seeing them on display in a museum it's particularly oh yeah and and and I and at least in the United States you won't find that in any kind of public museum now you might in some kind of private institution or private collection well I do with mummies right you-you'd but with Native American people they've decided that that's offensive to the culture so they've removed as well that's also happening you're finding another in other countries who in Egypt for example in other cultures that they're trying to get those back to imagine we can go and look at Ronald Reagan's head Yeah right some people would probably enjoy that for sure I'd go but is one of those things where it's like okay I gotta get it right so if you have the bones of Sitting Bull on display in some sort of a you know Plexiglas case in a museum and people like oh wow that's cool okay what would that be cool if that was Ronald Reagan you know would that be cool that was someone from our you know our lifetime the die was that Janis Joplin's head you know in a box somewhere and you can go stare at it wouldn't that weird you out or how about Amy Winehouse how about someone that died yeah see what I'm saying yeah someone who died really recently it'd be like what are you doing well and now we need to look at it that way yeah well and that's the thing is that we don't seem to look at native people in that way we don't seem to go oh that's not okay oh it's not okay to outlaw their religion well how would I feel if someone did that to me right right this it's it's a double standard or I don't know what you all it but it's just recess someone yeah in a way we're yeah racism is the right word can you go to the Kennewick Man again and find out what the date is I'm just curious as to what the date is of his demise like when what they date his skeleton back to because this is something that someone actually had brought up to me that there are many Native American cultures that don't believe the story of people coming across the bering land bridge from Asia mm-hmm is that something that's just one story so that's just one theory about how the Western Hemisphere was populated there are many of those stories and what's interesting is it's like it's a lot of indigenous peoples have and have stories that go back hundreds and hundreds of years and there's a great book so if you really want some good books we've got to get you into some indigenous authors one of which is vine deloria who is passed on but he he was an attorney and a scholar and wrote a book in the late 60s early 70s called custard died for your sins and it was no it's known as the Indian manifesto right but he also wrote a diver's custard Iverson's vine Deloria he also wrote a book called red earth White Lies and he talks about Western science and and it's arrogance of of creating these theories like the Bering Strait land bridge and never really considering never going and asking indigenous peoples who who lived on the land and whose place was the land how they got there because they do have those stories of how they got there and and and what is the story the most Native Americans accept is it the idea that they came from a bunch of different places it's it's their own origin stories for example the Choctaw Nation has a few origin stories one of it which includes coming out of the ground at a certain certain area in the south East come out of the ground coming out of the ground so being birthed out of the ground in a certain area and then there's another migration story so a lot of I have one elder said okay you want to hear an origin story do you want the 5000-year version the twenty thousand year version the forty thousand year version and he would go into the story about how many people in the southwest and southeast and up into the Northeast actually came from the south and were slaves of Aztec and and other civilizations down south that had been released and began migrating up through the north and there are other stories that that have us come from other places by boat I mean that there were also great canoe and and water fairs and so I think there's a lot a lot to unpack there that science really has ignored and vine deloria is great though when he talks about these things in red earth white lies because he has a sense of humor about it and he talks about oh yeah here we are in in in Asia wow there's a big sheet of ice up there that looks like a good place to go let's go and he talks about how there's theories of trees and horses that at a certain period of time that that migrated back and forth among the land bridge and how that could have occurred and how how sometimes it doesn't seem quite logical what science has put together there so he knows a full story about the land bridge though like the scientific diversion story yeah I mean it really was a country I mean it was it was not just like a thin bridge we're trying to know it was as a big sheet of ice that may have had one little areas of the where you could survive but from what I understand about it yeah maybe I probably don't know it well enough but there's a Nigel I mean it's it's it's the way they're changing the way they look at it but the way that they're right but the way the theory began when it was just a very small group of scientists who who made a determination that this was the way that the Western Hemisphere was populated and and what a lot of indigenous scholars contemplated was that was an easy way to basically devalue our place in the Western Hemisphere we came from somewhere else yes that's the resistance the the science behind it was that the oceans were lower the oceans were lower during the Ice Age and they believed that that area between Asia and North America was not just like a land bridge but was a land mass that was populated with animals and that this it would have been a natural progression for human beings to make their way across that in fact it's a funny story there was a guy who was a Mormon who was trying to prove that Native Americans were The Lost Tribe of Israel right and do you know the story behind that oh yes yeah so he did DNA tests on Native Americans and find out that they actually came from Siberia that's one of the scientific substantiation of the landmass theory but there are other there are other migrations that are still well I'm I'm a hundred percent convinced that people have been traveling the world I mean just like the Polynesians land Hawaii you know I mean we people have done wild shit from the beginning of time I mean there's so many confusing artifacts and things in North America and South America particularly the Olmecs that the believer somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,000 years old and have very African looking faces and their carvings or at least you know like very thick lips and thick faces I mean it's really interesting and then they don't know where they came from they don't they don't much about their culture at all and there's many myths of people arriving places and in boats and traveling around in boats so there's more likely to me is that just people have had wanderlust since the beginning of time when we traveled all over the world and some people came to North America and they're like holy shit the spots awesome right yeah but but we have a tendency to take a few facts that we understand from science or a few few sites that we're able to find this happens a lot in North America and and then base a theory on it without really critical investigation and and not getting all the facts and so that's a indigenous peoples if it been left out of those stories have been left out of haven't been at the table to have those discussions about what they understand to be true about Canaries what am I questions coming from is it offensive because the insinuation is that Native American people aren't really American any you a they came from somewhere else as well that everybody came from somewhere else they just were here a little bit earlier so it's not theirs right that that's that's one idea but yeah but if you know we've always been considered an inferior race right and the fact that we're still left out of decision-making about our own lands and our own rights and our own sacred spaces we're still left out of decision making or or our ideas are not even considered in science they're not considered in journalism they're not considered in medicine or they're not considered in what way what way they're not considered in science there there's traditional environmental knowledge that a lot of people who deal in an environmental protection have utilized to help protect large areas and it has to do with how different environments how different flora and fauna work together as a collective versus oftentimes in our Western Way of thinking we kind of you know we kill all the wolves or we kill all the Predators we get rid of all these plants and animals that used to all work together symbiotically in order to create a healthy environment and and and there's really important traditional environmental knowledge by many wisdom keepers across native america that are trying to re-implement the things that have gone wrong in their environments and trying to replace what has been screwed up when you hear an origin story like the one we were talking about people coming out of the earth mm-hmm how do you decipher that well I've actually been to that origin site and it it looks like a female it's a place where we were birthed it looks like a female wood it looks like a place where we were we were birthed out of Mother Earth it's a beautiful amazing and almost shocking place where is this place this is in Mississippi so you think that that might be true that's that's our origin story or that's one of our origin stories right but you understand how scientifically that would be a real problem right people coming out of the ground like like poppies maybe maybe not maybe not I think there are there are stories and narratives that were no longer connected with and it our lives today are so out of context with the natural world that we don't know what's possible anymore we've been so separated from that even to imagine yeah but we have a clear line from ancient hominids to modern human beings science has been able to piece together mm-hmm that's one that's one story right that's a story and other stories we came out of the ground like roses mm-hmm do you think that's possible don't that seems highly unlikely look if I give you if you had money to bet I give you a thousand bucks and you could put it on this or that you could put it on well we've probably people got here by all sorts of means the way people got everywhere by all sorts of means or they came out of the ground like flowers or Adam and Eve and all that other these stories whether there are origin stories that they create our identity they create who we are at the center of our being yeah and they have lessons to teach us and they also remind us what we're responsible for and that's what I'm saying that we've been so separated from that part of us in our connection to the natural world and to the earth right so we're a part of the earth we're a part of come from the earth whether or not we actually born on the ground is we're really responsible for it so we were put in certain places to be responsible and care take for that area so a lot of these stories what they're they're essentially trying to connect people with the idea that they are part of this great earth they're a part of this beautiful ecosystem and maybe this origin story is devised to sort of explain to them in a way that makes a clear connection mm-hmm does that make sense no absolutely absolutely but but but it's but it's part of who many tribal nations are this is our place this is our homeland this is what we're responsible for and we haven't been able to do what we were put here to do our purpose has been ripped away from us so so a lot of the work we do is to try to you know work towards environmental healing and try to bring lands back into our land holdings so that we can care take for that land that's not that's not all over Indian country there's there are some places in Indian country that that extract oil and and do things that that could be harmful for the environment you know and and we do what we can is you know with what we got and nations are sovereign the tribes are sovereign so they get to decide what's best for them and whether they're going to be sustainable or not what do you think would be best case scenario for Native Americans the United States like I'll sort of give you the magic wand again like what would be best case scenario because the strange thing that we have in front of us here is that there is one country the United States but there's not just the United States North American citizens here there's also Native Americans of various different tribes right that have their own reservations and as you said they're sovereign and they can kind of make their own decisions what would be what's the magic walk how do you clear up all these problems associated with the mean that the horrific treatment the everything from alcoholism to the problems with schools to self-esteem issues all these problems in North America while also not the the Native Americans in the way I'm looking at it they want to stay a member of their tribe and they don't necessarily want to be just Americans they want to keep their heritage right universally mm-hmm how does that how do those two things work together how do you how do we all live together in America and yet have these tribes and do it in a way that works best for everybody right well that's a that's a complicated ask question you just freaking have even with a magic wand I'm not quite but I guess but it's a process and part of it is is these myths that we have to correct and that we have to we have to find a new way to be able to tell our stories and not rely on non-indian authors to tell our stories but you need to hear our stories from us we need to be able to tell our stories and to reteach the general public about who Native Americans are where we've been and where we want to go where don't we we we've had this kind of pretend fantasy world about about Indians uh you know Pocahontas Columbus stories Custer they've all been stories that have fed into the American politic in a certain way at certain periods of time and what I want is that this is the time now where tribal nations have a lot to lose and we're in a current administration that is trying to terminate us once again what are they doing differently than other administrations well they they just they are taking land out of trust status they would there are groups that are attacking the basis of federal Indian law and the rights that we do have so there's there's an act called the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in 1978 and it's an act that the Association was heavily involved in to get passed and it started with some work with the Spirit Lake Sioux tribe and a woman came to the people back then and said they took my kids they stole my children and after investigation it was found that it wasn't just happening at Spirit Lake but it was happening all over Indian country were state welfare workers were taking Indian children in a disproportionate rate a quarter of all Indian children during that period of time were taken away from their own families and adopted out to white white families and so the Indian Child Welfare Act required state courts to do things before a child was taken away from its tribal nation there are groups now that are working to dismantle that act and that's being support because they they think it's racist so they so it's it's like they've taken it and and are looking through the backwards mirror yes so instead of it being an act that was passed to protect our children and to make sure that that children had ties to their culture and their families they're saying that that's not in the best interest of children so they're still looking at Indian tribes as we can't take care of our own kids that our way of life is is not acceptable and other adoptive families would be better and what's interesting is that the Indian Child Welfare Act doesn't prevent non-indian families from adopting children it just requires a certain process to make sure that the the affiliated tribal nation is involved in that placement and adoption process and and so that the child can maintain those those connections or that they tried to find a family that's more culturally appropriate for the child so there's just been actually came out of the Goldwater Institute which is a Goldwater when he was a what was he a senator he actually voted for the Indian child well for act but today the Goldwater Institute is is actually funding cases around the nation to attack the Indian Child Welfare Act what is the what is the reason behind it I mean what are they trying to achieve they say it's not in the best interest of Indian children and even though there are child welfare organizations around the country that say the Indian Child Welfare Act is actually the gold standard in child welfare and that we should be utilizing those principles that are used in the Indian Child Welfare Act to protect all all children to maintain familial connections when I'm asking this in terms of fuck if you had a magic wand what do you do the reason why I'm asking you this is because I've thought about it I've sat down and tried to go over it myself and I don't see a solution that's it's what's so strange to me is that we have nations inside of our nation mm-hmm and I don't I don't want to end it and I don't want to continue it neither neither one makes sense to me like to to end it would be to say you're forced to assimilate you no longer have sovereignty we're gonna break the last treaty and disband the reservations and make everybody just be in the United States citizen that seems crazy well everyone is a US citizen so citizenship was forced on us in 1924 I believe but I mean this isn't like I'm a US citizen where I can't start my own casino and I can't just do whatever I want do you understand what why that is I mean I guess we know I do know I mean do you know the reason why I'm saying it this way is because I'm just I'm just trying to look at it like from an overhead view like if I was an alien and I was trying to sort this out I had no no ties to either culture I'd be like what do you do with that like what do you do with that like I understand these people have been massively fucked over that the genocide was perpetrated on their their their race that they were wiped out both with disease and by military actions and soldiers and treaties were broken I get it but the state they're in right now when you look at what we're talking about with these reservations the horrific conditions and the problems with drug abuse and alcoholism and suicide and despair and self-esteem and all these issues like what is the solution what would be mean if there was an unlimited budget like what what would you do if you were like if it's president Shannon if you got elected you could win right you could be President anybody was president I think so right so you won and you became the president and you you ran on the part of what your platform was was fixing this gigantic soar that we have in this country our relationship with the tribes what would you do unlimited resources you do whatever you want well it I don't know if it has anything to do with the tribes I think it has more to do with the general public okay well it's about changing perspective I think I think if we're properly educated about about history I think if we really understand who Native people are and and their importance here and their importance to continue as sovereign tribal nations and it has to start it has to start with with public education we have to recreate what's important to us here and and I think Indian nations have have been here I think they're a symbol of amazing prosperity that the country could have and we've just never tapped into it and I'm talking about just principles and values that that we don't seem to to hold anymore in this country appreciation of nature our symbiotic relationship with it I feel like you're kind of being sarcastic no no no no no no no no no no not at all I think that's one of the major problems we have in this country is we don't have a appreciation of nature we really don't you know and it's not just an appreciation of it I think it's a connection to us we can't survive without it and and we're so interrelated to everything that happens on this earth and and we we don't look seven generations ahead of us to see what our decisions today are going to do to us in the future we're constantly looking for the dollar today and how that's gonna reward our efforts today and we're not looking how you know what the lives of our children are gonna look like with the lives of our great-great-grandchildren are going to look like and and I think those are the kind of values that that we need in our country now and I think that's what's being debated in the Democratic campaign right now you know where are our values are we going to you know continue to support corporate society and and corporate sponsored everything or are we going to start looking at at what we want you know a hundred years from now well that's certainly what's going on right now with the devil you know debates yeah yeah and it seems like corporates winning even though their spokesperson could barely talk which is hilarious I mean it just shows you how strong money and media and the influence of the DNC is what would all this education do though and explaining to people to the American citizens that are outside the tribe's how is that going to help the tribes themselves what what could be done to help these problems that we've already detailed the problems with alcoholism the problems with suicide and despair and self-esteem all these horrific conditions that exist on many many tribes well part of that is is is not anyone anyone's problem about ours that we have to deal with is as sovereign nations within our our own communities and how we how we choose to fix those issues but I think looking outside how how we can really affect change is there's something called prior and informed consent and it's in its contained within the UN declaration of and did as peoples and it it requires a state or a government to include tribal nations in the decision-making processes that affect them so this general this administration has been horrible at it absolutely horrible at it the Obama administration was much better but we need to be part we need to be the decision-makers in the things that affect us so if if you are going to bulldoze and blow up our sacred sites to build your border wall it seems like the proper thing to do first would be to have a conversation with us and for us to to make a decision about how we may can do that a little bit better to protect those sacred sites and and natural springs and other things along along the border instead of just blowing up everything where was the situation that was happening during the Obama the Obama administration where they were trying to put a pipeline through and they were hosing people down and it was on private land and they were going through private land and people were protesting it but they were they were forcing it through anyway where was that that was standing Arak right and in North Dakota and that's still going on today in fact I think this week there's a hearing that well it Fort Laramie Treaty I think is is affected by that so there are some land right issues there but we're talking about burials and sacred areas not to mention water quality and the tribes Obama stopped it but as soon as Trump got into office he he he he pushed it forward and and did not consult with tribes and it's been a fight ever since same thing happened when Obama was going through it initially and then they put a stop to it right before he left office right right right yeah I just I'm so cynical I wonder how much of that is horseshit how much they would have stopped it yeah you know and just let you know it's going through don't worry boys well you know the Obama administration was probably one of the more favorable administration's to Indian country there were many presidents that had never even gone to a reservation like the majority of presidents he did and he did actually he was adopted into the crow nation I think so he he's an adopted tribal member that's pretty cool do you think he's visited since then I don't know but that's but but that that administration really did a lot of work in Indian country that had never been done before and they actually were looking to tribes and building a government-to-government relationship that no one had ever really done as well every year they would hold a big tribal consultation in DC where tribal leaders would come from everywhere and consult with Obama and his administration it was really unprecedented and it was it was a really happy tunnel I mean as soon as Trump got into office the doors closed the doors closed so even though he appointed assistant secretary for Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney who's Alaska native that administration and the Department of Interior and under the president has just been so closed it's been hard to get anything done or to get heard or even actually have that government-to-government relationship anymore we've been left out of a lot of the decision-making process that's going on all over Indian country well that's a it's a very good thing to hear about Obama that he did that it's sad to hear the the Trump administration is abandoned that but it's nice to hear that someone was making an attempt to do that so what I'm getting is that the do really is know no long-term solution there's no solution you're saying that the tribes got a lot of solutions I think there's a lot of solutions and a lot of moving parts and I think I think you know Indian nations need to determine for themselves how best to handle the problems within their communities but outward-facing to have a strong government-to-government relationship that takes into account not just takes into account but actually requires the prior and informed consent of those tribal nations before affecting their rights or or at least some diplomacy or negotiation with varying interests before decisions are made I think that's that's the heart of what needs to happen outward-facing and also we need to take a new look at at our curriculum in schools we really need to most of our curriculum our curriculum and in public schools is about looking at Native American pre pre 1900 so and not carrying that into today and who contemporary Native American tribes are and what they're doing to help their people and and what's so wonderful about Indian country today is that though there have there are some places that are still there are some anti Indian hate groups out there that fight tooth and nail against anything a tribe and in their area tries to do to develop economically there are other communities where tribes have been able to bring in economic development whether that's through gaming or otherwise and by the way Indian Gaming is like no other type of corporate gaming and I think a lot of people don't understand this so if you're a gambler go to Indian casinos because that money goes towards Indian nation governance it's not like a private business it is legislated that that money from those casino go back into Indian nation governance and are used for jobs and employment and Social Services and all of that relieves the state and other government agencies from from having that that responsibility so are those the success stories of modern those are the success stories I mean if you look at so Oklahoma the state Oklahoma is fighting Indian nations and in Oklahoma about gaming trying to get more money out of gaming but the that Oklahoma tribes have brought in tons of money a hundred thousand jobs have been created and in casino and other economic development and why the governor is finite a governance governor stit I think is his name and he's trying to rid Goshen renegotiate gaming compacts in order to bring more money into the state so essentially trying to tax that for state purposes even though it's on native land right right interesting so it's almost in a way another attempt at violating a treaty absolutely so denying the sovereign nation right well in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which was passed and there's so much federal legislation it's insane of federal Indian law I mean it has its own 25 USC this huge code of stuff man but the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed because Indians were finding success doing gaming in states were getting pissed off because they were doing it without any interference which is their inherent sovereignty to do so so this so this this Act came which was kind of a compromise where where tribes can do what's called class to gaming which is based on bingo and and there's electronic bingo game that are kind of like slot machines so tribes can do class to gaming without any interference with the state but if they do class 3 gaming that's card games and other types then the state they have to work with the state in order to develop some kind of compact and revenue sharing for class 3 gaming so the state the federal government again allowed state to interfere with that inherent tribal sovereignty to regulate their own economic development yeah that's an issue with all of these Native American casinos isn't it they don't get the full Vegas treatment they can't have all the games that Vegas can have they can that's the class three gaming but they have to do it through the state services through their sovereign government it's so strange right it's like four in one under one hand they get no help at all and then when something comes along that allows them to economically thrive then the government's like hold on where's our piece so why do you think this is so so as it can and and so much legislation looks at tribes as if they're inferior so back again to those watershed cases of justice Marshall yeah they're inferior even being able to assert jurisdiction over non-indians who come into our territory and do something wrong we can't right so if someone breaks the law in a Native American reservation there under those federal government's guidelines or the state governments laws the tribe does not have criminal jurisdiction over non-indians so if someone comes in and Rob's a casino mm-hmm then the state has to take care of it right state or the federal government depending on what type of crime ideally would it be that the Native Americans would take care of it yeah why not yeah be funny if they brought back like hanging capital punishment she lets just hang people in the streets you see how that works look no more robberies do you think that's what we did know back in the day no no I'm just saying imagine if they just came up with their own rules right like you know arbitrarily like out completely out of the state's laws and the federal government's laws I don't think that's what I'm saying I'm just saying would it be crazy if they just you know went like let's pretend as their own country we do whatever we want we're gonna hang people mm-hmm saying it would be pretty it is strange that there's this there's this push and pull here right there's their sovereign they can do what they want they have these casinos but hold on hold on hold on with this dealing with you want now you're under the guidelines of the federal government and the state government and now we want a piece we want a little bit of this and regulations and this and that it is it's essentially not accepting the fact that they're sovereign right it's a fake acceptance it's like yeah yeah you're you're on your own until you start doing really well and then it's like hold on there now you're not on your own yeah it's this really weird triangle of power state federal and tribal yeah jurisdiction and it's completely confusing when I was a student I was in fellow with a program called Udall fellowship that was named after Stewart Udall who's he he was very strong and environmentalist who did a lot of work to protect Indian lands in the environment and so in his name there was a fellowship created and it's funded through congressional appropriations every year and so now you're making me forget my story here I'm sorry so when I was a an intern back in the day and I was in the Clinton White House that's a whole another story I've completely lost I completely lost my story I'm sorry no worries I need more tumeric coffee we could build it back so what we were talking about was the federal government not allowing the Native American to have real sovereignty over over their land and then we went from there to you having a story that I interrupted by trying I went that guy's name was damned or what he did what was him Stewart Udall what did he do again he he was a senator a congressman and he did a lot of good things for Indians that's it it's gone it's forever gone no were sucked into my brain somewhere so what when you look at that situation the casino situation where now all of a sudden economically these tribes can thrive and the the reservation that owns that casino can thrive and as you're saying the money goes straight back to the reservation and to the people that run it and and it it legitimate ly helps the people that live on that reservation correct absolutely what other things like that can be done to also take advantage of the fact that there are sovereign nation and allow them to economically thrive without things like fracking and shit that's bad for the environment are there other things that are being implemented that could also help oh yeah absolutely there are all different types of economic development going on in Indian country that can be very successful for external businesses too because there are certain benefits that an outside business would get if they did for example manufacturing within Indian country they could benefit from certain tax exemptions and and and and rebates that they wouldn't get in in a state so if if if corporations would would go into Indian country instead of you know going across the board or going somewhere else there would be great opportunities but and some tribes are taking advantage of those business opportunities not just game but out of gaming has grown a lot of a lot of investment a lot of entrepreneurial ship in tribes and a lot of the money has gone back to help educate and teach language and bring items back that are religious items and in ancestors and and the things that are important for that tribal nation so there's many different ways of investment that that tribal nations look at it it's not necessarily economic but it's about healing their people and and helping us survive and live better than we have in the past so investment takes many forms in Indian country are there any good documentaries that can educate people on the the reality of what happened to the Native American tribes because it seems like it's one of the best ways for people to absorb information and get people excited about things because it kind of entertained them as well as it educates them is there anything that you can recommend so much has been produced I think you know PBS has put on some really good I mean if you look at at PBS even now there are some great stories that are being told yeah no no it seems like something that someone should do right but it's got to be done in Indian country and it's got to be done with Indian country because so much has been done without us yes and without our even input right so much research and kind of one-sided storytelling that that just doesn't make sense it doesn't have the cultural competency it doesn't have the real-life lived experience in the flavor I guess for lack of a better word to tell these stories properly ideally when you look at the future of Native contrives in the united states and again as you said you know Native Americans that are in these reservations are United States citizens mm-hmm but it's it's such an unusual situation that really we only have a comparison to Canada with their first nations mm-hmm what what do you think happens in the future when you we go from 1900 you were talking about the the the the pass of 1900 to today it's a abysmal 120 years other than the economic success of the casinos what do you what do you anticipate happening in the next hundred years it's it's hard to tell I know a lot of tribes have been diversifying their economic development without our culture's we won't survive in fact many elders and you may have read it in Black Elk speaks that that we're no longer who we are without our culture without our languages and likely will no longer be recognized by the federal government unless we are Indian enough you know so those things are really important to who we are in the next hundred years and I think it's it's those things that we will be rebuilding over the next hundred years healing from the last and and moving forward with a newfound understanding of who we are and a stronger identity and self what that actually looks like and what's important I think that we are so still so dependent on the great white father and what happens with the u.s. politics and whether we have a voice there or not we've got great organizations that help advocate for Indian country in general there's a National Congress of American Indians which has been around for about 75 years and it helps lobby and educate Congress and keeps tribes informed about what's going on in politics and advocate for many of those interests there are groups like ours that are advocating for more cultural revitalization and strengthening identity and protecting our youth so I think part of what we're we're we've been building is is really a coalition of organizations and tribes to strengthen who we are and kind of correct the misfortunes of our history I know we we still have tribal nations out there that are living with egregious poverty and and and issues that still seem so far away from being corrected but you know like my grandma always said where there's hope where there's life there's hope so I I think we just continue to I mean we've frickin survived for this long and this coronavirus isn't going to take us out either I mean we're gonna continue to push forward and and and try to have a better future for our kids just like anybody else just like anybody else and I think that's that's what's important is that we're not we're not on the stage with everyone else we're not at the table where decisions are being we're not in the room where it happens that Native Americans are not being treated with the same respect as other people from other countries so like the culture of Mexico or the culture of Guatemala or hell they're not in they're not being treated well but we respect them as a culture like they're they're thought of as I mean we're not invading Mexico you know I'm saying I mean whether whether you're not you really literally border walls and we're not looking at them as something in fear we're looking at them as another country mm-hmm we don't look at Native Americans the same way we look at any week and maybe it's because you are also United States citizens they don't look at them the same way we have the same like the respect for people that live in a sovereign nation another sovereign nation even though this is a sovereign nation inside of our nation it doesn't I think you would agree doesn't get the same respect that other sovereign nations oh absolutely is there a great record like a written record of all of the origin stories like you were talking to me about and all of the various languages I mean is all this documented to make sure that we don't lose this some better than others and a lot of that is done there's no big text that I can I can give you and share with you that here's all all what you ever needed to know about Indians that doesn't exist I think probably should oh no no I think that's up to the the Tribal Nation to decide whether they want to share that and and and and how to best educate people about who they are and that's what you know so many other people have told our stories and have taken down those histories and all those people are telling the stories from a Western perspective and none from not having the cultural competent copied competency and having lived and implemented that way of life so it's really dependent on on the tribes to determine for themselves how they want to to put that forward there are many tribes that actually have research protocols that if you want to do you want to study you want to research you have to get authority from the Tribal Nation to do that and and they have to have a say in whether it was done appropriately so again it's back to us telling our own stories us being part of our own narratives and us being part of the decision making that affects us I respect and appreciate that 100% what I meant was inside the tribe is there a documented version of all these stories and of the language so that can be passed down I think the real concern seems to be when you're talking about these incredibly impoverished communities there the real concern is that some of these stories may be lost or some of these some of the language may even be lost there I I think it varies like I said there's 574 federally recognized tribes and 300 other tribal groups let me tell you the story about the chittim Aceh who are in Louisiana like just surrounded by marshes right there in the Gulf of Mexico their last language speaker died in the 1940s and even though they had you know language speakers around them none of those languages were related to theirs their language was more closely connected with people's in in Mesoamerica so obviously there was a trade there was a relationship between who the chittim aceh are and were with people from mezzo and South America yeah I mean there's there's amazing histories and stories out there but but what happened with their languages is in 80's and 90's the Smithsonian had all these wax cylinders of tribal languages and songs and dances and they started repatriating those back to different tribal nations so when the chitta matza got these wax cylinders they're like oh we have a responsibility here we have to do something with this and so they pulled their community together and everyone everyone you know got their grandmas and their auntie's and everyone to pull together words that they knew stories that they knew different cultural practices and building and and and crafting and all of those things pulled all that together with the wax cylinders they got some money from rosetta stone and Cree recreated their language that had been lost and today in their schools and their tribal Lee run schools they speak their language those children are speaking their language from kindergarten up so an incredible success story now they were able to do that because they had gaming revenue to help support that and and when you go to the school and when you hear the story about how that happened it's it's it's incredible so there are stories like that among all tribes of how they've been able to recover from what was lost and so it's it's a long process to correct what has happened but there are warriors all over Indian country and that's that's what they're doing every day is is trying to recover what was lost well that's a great success story and it's beautiful to hear I I just hope that that can continue with all the different stories it's just when you read books about Native American culture and you just get sort of the like the most surface taste of what it must have been like it seems like there's this incredibly rich history that could could be lost in time mm-hmm and that would be a horrible horrible shame it's right here in front of us and it's it's here right now and the fact that someone like you worked so hard to get this message out here and to let people know what what is actually happening and the the plight of these American Indians and the tribes and what they're still going through today and that this is not a battle that happened in the 1800s this is a battle that's happening today right every day every day yeah what what is currently a major focus for you hmm well the repatriation and sacred sites issues so returning cultural items and ancestors back to their affiliated tribes and is there a lot of that out there so like I said there's that that law the Native American graves protection and repatriation act that requires any institution that received federal funding or federal agencies to work towards a repatriation of items that they've received over time back to their tribes but there are also tons of ancestors and items in international Museum so we're working on developing strategies to go after those because a lot of those countries they're there has been kind of a rethinking about the purpose of museums and and public education regarding indigenous peoples and how do we decolonize these institutions and so we're trying to work in some countries are easier than others because if you have sacred religious items from American indigenous societies in some museums across the waters their country considers it their cultural property so you need an act of their country's government in order to dia session those items and return them home so there are some countries that are much more difficult to work with than others but we're in the process of developing strategy to help internet with international repatriation we're also trying to watch private collectors and educate people about the importance of returning cultural patrimony and other sacred items that they've received over time whether or not there is a legal obligation to do there there's definitely an ethical and moral obligation to return these items so that that cultures can be revitalized and that those items can be put back to use so that's one one area we have a repatriation conference every year that we work together with tribes and institutions and in foreign governments to work on these issues sacred sites I just was before the indigenous peoples subcommittee in the house a few weeks ago talking about what's going on at the border and that Atum chairman was there as well to talk about those issues and as he spoke he was he was telling the Congress representatives that he just found out that they were blowing up another section you know so it's it's and that is happening because there was a law in 2005 that allowed Department of Homeland Security to waive all these environmental laws and if there was an emergency to do so and so the administration is is saying that the border wall is an emergency that allows them to waive all these environmental laws and so it's not just about protecting sacred sites but all the other environmental concerns all the the animal migrations birds plants as and water quality that are being affected by this border wall because people strongly think we need a 30 foot you know tall border so so we're working we continue to work to protect sacred sites so along the border what we're we're they're doing this and putting in the wall many of these areas have been designated as sacred sites and so is that what's what you're saying yeah our known sacred sites and there's artifacts there and all sorts of different things that can be destroyed by the construction age they blew up an area and found human remains oh Jesus mm-hmm yeah no do they stop when they do that they were paid created those bones and they kept going yeah so this this is how that's it that's it that's it they're just moving forward they don't identify the bones do you know for the rest of the culture that might have existed moving forward and and you know what they're saying and so and and the rhetoric around this is so detrimental because during during that hearing it was clearly about how do we protect sacred sites and and how do we make sure that the tribal consultation and other options can be presented so that the environment and other areas are protected and the Republican congressman that was there it was really quite seems like not a nice guy basically said there is more damage caused by migrant traffic trash and defecating then there is by blowing up the ground and so that is the Department of the Interior Homeland Security and and Republicans in Congress are saying about that border well stop and think about how that's unchallenged yeah how ridiculous a thing that is to say you could pick up trash you can pick up shit mm-hmm you can't pick up once you blow up sacred sites yeah it's forever and it's irreplaceable these are irreplaceable resources the fact that nobody challenged him on that like that's such a ridiculous thing okay we challenged them and Deb Holland who is Native American congresswoman definitely challenged him about that but you know it's I think the law is on their side is it safe to say that there's many areas that you're talking about along the border that are probably undiscovered because you're dealing with things that are potentially thousands of years old so remember undiscovered has different meanings so tribes may have understandings about certain areas that other people do not that they try to protect and so that's why consultation is so important and working with tribes so you can understand what's going on on the ground but usually they do some kind of minor investigation and supposedly that was done that is being done but nothing's being done to protect it so it's known but so even if they consult with the tribes and the tribe say this is this area is essentially a burial ground from a thousand years ago and our ancestors use this yeah there you go that's cool story we're gonna put a wall here yep yeah but that happens that's not just happening at the border that's happening all over the United States yeah yeah so and that's nothing new what's new here is that all of those environmental laws and those opportunities for public comments so it's not just tribal consultation but even public comment have been completely waived those stories always weird me out when someone's building an apartment building and they stop construction because they found some sort of a burial site underneath and you're like right like how many of those are out there I mean how many how many areas where people are digging into the ground they are gonna find some incredible archaeological discovery and it's it's getting you know smashed by a bulldozer yeah it happens all the time and so a lot of our a lot of the context for what was happening here before Europeans came is gone yeah because we've just destroyed all the evidence of it hmm you know so that's why often the way archaeological investigations have have moved forward as they look at discrete sites without connecting the dots in a more holistic way about what's happened in a certain area so all most of our archaeological context and all that evidence is gone and it continues to be looted by amateur archaeologists and of course you know I've worked on many different developments across the country where you know the bulldozers come oh they see there's human remains there and they just dump it into the fill really yeah because they don't want to stop the report money is stuff yeah across the shell on them yeah it's amazing to me that there's some sites that you could just visit like Buffalo jumps where they ran by flows off the cliff like a friend of mine was telling me about this is a site that you could go to and I'm like you could just go there he's like yeah you find Indian points there I'm like really you find arrow points so you find laying around what should be these priceless archaeological record of Native Americans and you just pick them up yeah just go to any little little town across the country and you'll see a little antique shop somewhere and and you go look on their walls and there's gonna be archaeological evidence there without any context without any understanding of where it came from whether it's pieces of funerary object arrowheads or what have you Arrowhead was unbelievably calm oh yeah I found one I found one in Nevada I was on a hunt and we were in the mountains I found this little tiny chip you weren't on federal land were you I don't know what land we're on it's it's public land it was a public land hunt it was a draw a tag for it but we found this old and it was crazy to look at you know I'm looking at this little tiny piece it was like a white I don't know what type of rock it was made out of but it just it was stunning like to hold that and to think like this this was someone's weapon that they were using to hunt with who knows how long ago who knows how many hundreds of years ago I just stumbled upon it and I think that's why we're so fascinated Americans are so fascinated with Indians is because they're all around us I mean yeah you know we're standing and that's one thing I forgot to do when we started this interview is to recognize the land where we're standing now which is original land at the 2mass and Tongva people right here we're still here today yes right here Allen yes yes these are indigenous lands everywhere where we stand are indigenous lands and what's interesting is that we don't recognize that here there are other countries like for example in Australia they have any kind of public event or governmental gathering or what and they they recognize who were there before them you know there's an acknowledgement there's a recognition we've forgotten all that history we've forgotten what was here before even though the people are down the street the two masses is is north of here the Tongva or south those people still exist and did they have a reservation out here so Tongva are not federally recognized 300 right right and in in California I think there's a hundred and four federally recognized tribes in California California history and I'm you're aware of the mission system right and in in California the mission system mean religious missions yeah the Spanish missions that were built up the coast in California and and the effect that those missions had on the indigenous peoples that were here I know about the effort to convert them to Kazakh Catholicism there was a huge issue at the turn of the 20th century right right and and there are you know mass grave sites at every one of those missions of indigenous peoples you know thousands of indigenous peoples died you know building those missions and and from disease and and otherwise I mean I mean think about it if there are some teachers and professors that that do different kind of work with their students and and there's this one kind of exercise of giving everyone in the class a role that you have in your society you know so whether you're you know tending agriculture or you're making clothes or you're protecting the children or you're getting food or whatever it is and then ninety-six percent of you are gone what do you do I mean can you imagine what's so our ancestors must have lived through and and I know for myself personally what's driven me and my life as my grandmother telling me those stories of what she and her family had to go through to be here and and saying we did that we went through all that so you could be here and you could do something better for us I mean that's what drives us all is is the pain that our ancestors went through and trying to make a life for ourselves that are better hey we want to we want a piece of that manifest destiny - and we want it back right you know so these issues you know we should take you to Indian country so - that I would love that where should I go um oh heck where do you want to go so I I think it would be important if you or anyone else would be interested you know most tribal nations have web sites where you can learn about who they are what their history is and different policies and things that are important to them I think it would be important to go to a more affluent tribe and also to go to a tribe that maybe doesn't have that same level of Economic Development and you can find that anywhere you can find that here in California and Nevada in Washington State and in New York there are many places we could go you tell me and I'll tell you where you can go well let's work something out I would really like to do that I have my friend cam Haines went to an Apache reservation in Arizona I believe last year and he said that there is actually a cave that they wind up putting bars on to keep people from stealing the artifacts but there's arrows in there and human remains yeah and they've left them in there I mean just something like that is unbelievably fascinating that this exists and it just exists on this reservation is sitting there and that but most people are not even aware of this is like an unbelievably sacred part of history that's right there right right and in those places are constantly being looted there was a time in American history 50s 60s 70s where you could get these beautiful cross country maps right and many of those maps would have places where there were Indian artifacts and places that you could go and and and and and get stuff so so a lot of things like that have been published throughout time and so folks that are interested in doing that and make their living doing that you know they rely on those those old documents and and stories of where things are and and are still looting and and selling those items today I think we in the West have this idea that if something is historic we should be able to look at it you know we should be able to go to a place the Smithsonian or the this sort of a tour and go see it mm-hmm I think what you're saying is we have to kind of relook at that and that it's not ours to look at and that this is a part of the tribes in the part of your culture mm-hmm and this is not something you could just gawk at even I mean I never even thought about looking at bones that looking at bones would be disrespectful until I thought about like Amy Winehouse is head sitting there at a museum and I'm like yeah every kind of fucked up yeah yeah yeah that's it is a it's a it requires a shift in perspective right and I think that's all tribal nations are asking people to do is to think differently about these issues and and recreate a new and more appropriate myth about our collective history and let us decide for ourselves what we want to share and what we don't want to share and I think what you'll find is is as that Indian nations have shared a lot so this this work on Native American graves protection and repatriation act where those museums thought they were gonna lose all their collections and their shelves would be cleaned out and no exhibits anymore what they found instead was that they actually figured out what the hell they've been holding on to this whole time because now they're actually talking to the people who who have experience expertise and cultural knowledge about these items that are in their collections so all of a sudden information that they never had before and so the relationships that have been built between museums and those institutions and tribal nations has has built something completely different than nobody had contemplated before just from talking to Native people and in understanding what those things are and where they come from and what should be shared in and what shouldn't be there's still a lot of museums holding out though and usually those are the big well-funded institutions what is their what's their argument they don't have an argument what's interesting is is I wrote somewhere once that you know we're just waiting for a lot of old white people to die I mean that's that yeah that's really the case that there's just this old perspective this old philosophy this hoarding philosophy not wanting to give things back is also in their defense could it be that they're really concerned that that stuff would be lost and that it is yeah important historical right and so the the mission of many museums is to educate the public and there is this kind of arrogant what I would consider an arrogant way of thinking about about the world like everyone should have access to knowledge and and and tribes don't necessarily feel that same way so there is that kind of that philosophy and so those institutions will often use the law to work against the repatriation situation and delay mostly delay most tribes that want to fight against institutions like that because for one thing they don't have the capacity to fight that because there are so many things on their table already and and another reason to bring that kind of discord around these sacred items or around ancestral remains is is difficult so you don't want to bring you know that energy around something that you need to care for and respect and and put back in the ground so you know there's a lot of reasons why these bigger institutions are getting away with not following the law and they take advantage of it and so that's why my my organization is important because we try to help bridge that it seems like some sort of cooperative effort could be reached where the things that the tribes would like people to see and would like to educate people on could be displayed and maybe some sort of a National Museum of Native American history really that is an awesome idea so there's this exist it's called the National Museum of the American Indian where is it um in Washington DC it's also yes it's also in and it's it's got a I'm coming up with ideas that are really pretty it's got a pretty screwed up story though of how the National Museum of the American Indian got started but I also want to mention before I forget there's wonderful tribal museums so there are tribes out there that have their own Museum in archives or Tulalip in Washington Washington State Washington state where Zetas that Tulalip it's outside of Seattle okay bulb Cultural Center a Saginaw Chippewa tribe in Michigan I hope I always get my M States wrong in in Michigan they have the zippering center of honest Tanabe life ways and cultures amazing Museum I think they're there they're one of my favorite Choctaw Nation my nation in Oklahoma are building a new cultural center and museum so those are probably that's in outside of Durant is there a timeline on that when they believe that's good very soon very some in Oklahoma and a couple months supposedly yeah well yeah if you can travel doesn't it yeah yeah I'll tell you exactly what I'm supposed to be there I'm doing gigs in Oklahoma I'm supposed to be there I think sometime in July do you know where in Oklahoma I'll tell you what I know you know I'm at September so you don't even know what month it is timbi twelve okay Tulsa right yeah September yeah September 11th I'm in Lincoln Nebraska and then September 12th I'm in Tulsa Oklahoma yeah so Tulsa is up north I know talked ah that's southeastern Oklahoma so it's a bit away what is the name of that place the BOK Center is that what it is in Tulsa well I think it'd be done by then oh yeah if not the Chickasaw Nation has an amazing cultural center so that's in Sulphur Oklahoma I believe they've got a great museum there and and really that's a that's a great nation to talk to I often considered affecting to be Chickasaws really can you do it I don't have to be adopted in I think the Chickasaw are kind of like our little brothers but they have see our nation's were heavily affected by Christianity and so the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is very proud of the fact that it's been able to maintain its languages through Christian hymnals in singing Christian music so so my nation really is is Christian but there are many other nations in Oklahoma that I've spent more time with than my own and that's Chickasaw and Ann Creek and Seminole nations that are also in Oklahoma that still maintain their stomp dances and other traditional pagan rituals so I tend to favor those yes yeah makes sense yeah it's it really is an amazing story and a sad story but a fantastic story as well the story of the Native American culture and life in this country and what it's become and I don't think it's told enough I don't think I don't think I mean I think I'm you know I've barely scratched the surface of it you did I mean I could keep you here all day I'm sure and it's been it's been a very interesting dialogue because part of this is trying to figure out what is it that you want to know and you think that your listeners want to know about this because the last thing I want to do is is to offend your listeners because I really want everyone to come away with learning about Native American history and what's going on in Indian country not offended and not with any kind of distaste because I think this is our history that we share together and I think the only way we're going to change things is if we change you know the general public and how the general public sees sees Indian company I don't think you have to worry at all about a fan I don't think you offended anybody and you know I've been being nice well listen my answer bring me back and I'll be offensive I would love you to my answers is of my ancestors I'm third-generation so my ancestors have nothing to do with any of this we came over from Europe we don't know anything like what the fuck was going on here before we got here you know my ancestors all Italian and Irish right and they had to give up a lot of their culture yes when I came into this most of it yeah yeah yeah I remember talking it's it's interesting too because so much has changed I remember when I was a boy talking to my grandfather my grandfather would talk to me about what it was like to immigrate here from Italy and how horribly they were treated and the racism against Italians was just so prevalent in common and and horrific the things that he would tell me were terrible and I've never experienced racism against Italians it doesn't exist anymore and in just the three generations Treeing my grandparents my parents and me it's gone it's essentially this being an Italian is country I mean there's some people that have prejudice about all sorts of different cultures but that's just rare it's weird you know whereas Mexican prejudice is super common right prejudice against Mexicans dealing with this all this wall bullshit and what's going on between those are indigenous people sure yeah well not only that they own fucking California not go to the 1800s right I mean that's part of Sun in the morning star some part of that book is talking about Mexicans and US troops fighting over California that's a big part of it does that ignore Native American no I mean it kind of does but I mean it's look in some ways Mexicans are Native Americans right the Mexicans they absolutely yeah so and not only that I'm sure they share a lot of DNA I mean there's a lot of Mexicans and I'm friends with it look like they could be you know a complete Native American yeah where do you think man is right Spaniards came and met with Mexicans the original Mexicans and introduced their life they weren't Mexicans they were indigenous people right exact and and just like you know West fainted everyone um you know they they sent there they actually trained dogs to rip people apart they I mean that maybe I'm getting off off the subject now but you know Catholicism came over here and they had this thing called a papal bull and it was basically the Catholic law and so these Spaniards would hammer the papal bull into a tree and speak in Spanish to the indigenous indigenous world saying if you don't convert we will slaughter you right that's what you're a heathen you must convert or you know we're gonna kill you and of course nobody knew what the hell they were saying because they didn't speak Spanish and they would SiC these dogs on them I mean there's there's these horrendous stories that are told by the missionaries that were there with the Spanish you know to bring their their salvation and it's just horrendous some of them the accounts of this and that's just and recent that's well that was 1500s but no it seems like it is it's five lifetimes five human beings living to a hundred five five lives ago people were doing that but we still carry this with us I mean these stories are still a part of the narrative that we told and and and I guess we're still telling them telling it because people haven't listened or they're still these stories haven't been taught yeah it's they haven't been taught there's almost too much to teach and it's very convenient since you know we air quotes are the victors so we kind of can rewrite history or at least at least make that part of history not important you know had a bit that I did in my act about presidents about electing presidents and I was like you just gotta realize the United States was founded in 1776 and that people live to be a hundred and that's three people ago like we we just got here we just got here and now in the course of three people's lives we have skyscrapers and planes and pollution and we're sucking all the fish out of the ocean and we've wiped out most of the history of the indigenous people mm-hmm and it's it's it's crazy I mean it really is a very strange fact that is so often overlooked if the on a day-to-day basis how often do we discuss Native American history how often do we discussed the the the battles that took place the lives that were lost the people that died from disease the Trail of Tears how often is that discussed in this country I think there's five or six million of us that talk about it every day but that's you know that's that's in yeah so we're keeping that alive and and like I said there's a lot of there's not many of us comparatively but we're out there and we're all doing double-time to work to push this out into the public narrative and it's been really really hard well I really appreciate your efforts and I really appreciate you humoring me and coming here and and and teaching us and educating me about what's you know how you feel about things and and the stories that you came here to tell and I think what you're doing is very very important I'm very happy that you're out there I'm happy that you took the time in this calamity and chaos and pandemic to to risk your health and come and make this trip yeah I'm gonna be isolated when I get home my families put me in the basement for two weeks Jamie doesn't have the cooties he told me he's fine and I'm clean as a whistle so you're good I eat healthy is there anything else we could talk about before you leave we can talk about tons of stuff but I think what I need to tell you is that the Association on American Indian Affairs has been around for a long time and we are rebuilding our capacity to look into the next hundred years of how we want to move forward I would love to have input from your listeners about what they think they need in it or their questions are about Indian country about an email no I'm not it'll be fun we have it we have a verbal we have a website Oh God only good enlightened people can watch out but that's a wonderful thing there's so much we can do together and people who are interested in getting to know more about what's going on in Indian country or getting involved and helping out it's unbelievable where they can go Indian - Affairs dot org Indian - Affairs or okay we will send people to there and thank you so much Shannon thank you very much for being here I really appreciate it
