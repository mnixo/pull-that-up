boom-boom-boom-boom what's up dad how are you man great thanks for coming your manner appreciate it thank you for extending you the invitation well I love your Instagram it's very it's very informational and what tell everybody what you do so people get a handle on this yes I'm a non-permissive environment specialist basically I teach people how to live move and travel in places where they probably shouldn't be traveling you know how to get our handcuffs how to get our zip ties and you know I show people how to survive in such environments my background is in law enforcement in Mexico so you know I spent a lot of time down there and over the years that's kind of led me into teaching myself how to survive in that environment and apparently after a while that made me kind of a sought after as far as teaching other people how to survive in such environment so I've been doing that for a while here in the US the military law enforcement civilians oh yeah and you started working and law enforcement what year it's 2004 2004 you started before everything got really crazy yes yes so you can you can kind of trace back where it officially kicked off by the the start of the Felipe calder√≥n's presidency which is the the second-to-last president we had he basically said you know full-on war against the cartels and by that time I was kind of just getting done with my training in northern Mexico as a police officer and what I thought was gonna be you know community policing and stuff like that turned into a full-on you know here's a assault rifle and just go climb up on that tongue be with those military guys and let's go arrest cartel members oh Jesus Christ so you thought you were just getting a regular law enforcement gig yeah I mean realistically there was no such sort of kind of job description this was post 9/11 I was actually in med school and that the economy and all over the border with the tightened security and stuff like that kind of went down you know down drain and most most of the money that I was using for med school you know went away and you know that in the newspaper young unmarried individuals that don't have any kids welcome to join type thing young unmarried individuals with no kids they want that specifically yeah that was probably a big alarm Mill suitor Center in my head but the but the but the you know there were there weren't a lot of opportunities for somebody my age there that didn't have a career and I thought it would be you know everybody said don't go you know but yeah I what who said that what's your friend like but it was it to me was a challenge and a lot of people said I couldn't do it and I did it and then it turned into something that wasn't what it was most people expect the one they went into it you know as a full-on urban warfare type situation Wow so post 9/11 the borders get tightened up and the economy gets very bad in the border towns is that what happens because people can't get through as easily it's uh yeah heightened security so commerce isn't uh it's really done on both sides border weights that you should take an hour now would take three hours or four hours depending on the time of day so you know things got affected also you know a worldwide recession a situation kind of happened so everything kind of went down the toilet you know I have a lot of family in the border region and all like most of our family businesses that that we had you know basically kind of tanked and that during that time so from 9/11 to here we are eighteen years later it's been a pretty radical change yes safe to say yes a hundred percent change like what if you had a like to try to describe it so I mean basically the the part of the country that I had most of my experiences the baja sonora juarez type region northern mexico basically what happened is that all the cartels started fighting for the most rich drug routes on the planet one of them of course being the city of Tijuana so the city of Tijuana is that's the corner of Latin America it's the most it's the most cross border on the planet and with that you know there's a lot of Commerce that goes on in that region a lot of things that ship to Tijuana and then drop joven up into into San Diego and a lot of people have businesses on both sides and amongst among all of this movement you know there's a no giant organized crime war going on and it used to be overt like on the streets middle the day you would see these cartel convoys arriving at a restaurant and all the cartel guys outside with their aks and stuff like that this was 2004-2005 error and what is the military or the law enforcement attitude towards that like having here so we go back to 2004 when I first got it started and it would look the other way really yes look the other way and look the other way that was specific and instruction that you got it was one of those things where I went there and I got I got a firearm here you go here's your Glock 17 here are you two magazines here's your Mossberg 500 and you see all those cars over there we don't ask them for anything let them pass that's you know we don't do anything well that nature and then it would see members of the military as well kind of a go the other way type situation mm mm four do you think that this was just to avoid conflict or what was it because of corruption it'sit's always corruption I'm always at always levels at all those types of levels down there during this time there was a lot of corruption things changed but you know things in a way in some levels are always the same mm-hmm there was definitely some sort of pact going on some sort of fear-based pact during that time and when Felipe Calderon finally said you know enough is enough we're gonna declare war he basically militarized a lot of the counter narcotics efforts in Mexico so the military went from being you know in their in their bases or Manning stations out there to actually actively going out and looking for cartel cells and trying to eliminate them right so basically army on the street type situation and another thing he did was basically all of the police chief a lot of the police sheeps around the country were being traded out for former military officials or military guys uh officers one of them was lieutenant colonel is Iola I don't know if your maybe your audience's audience could look him up he's a very famous lieutenant colonel from Mexico actually as a documentary on and called Mexico's most uh bravest man very pretty interesting guy he was the one that headed us up he directed us at the start of this these operations against the cartels and he basically said you know this is this isn't a policing problem this is a counterinsurgency problem so we're gonna well we're gonna militarize it basically and after he kind of took control everything everything in it changed you know there weren't as of the cartels want to subvert as they were so they started going underground so when you joined you expected it to be regular law enforcement when it became this counterinsurgency militarized effort against the cartels was there every time you were like I gotta get the fuck out of this job this is too dangerous yeah I mean my generation I was part of the seventh generation of officers going through this this program policing and out of my generation the first year we had two of them in jail for corruption charges and three dead you know just proud of how many out of 23 guys so I guess twenty-three guys 205 gone five gone two of them very dramatic that's two of them were kind of the origins of how I got into the whole counter abduction type thing two of my guys got picked up outside of a hotel in the downtown Tijuana and by by cartel members dressed as federal police officers the whole nine yards uniforms the car everything cloned they got they got asked for their papers outside and got put into a van they found them a day later you know but horribly mutilated and all this type of stuff tortured tortured you know and that kind of you know that was the this is real this is real and I should probably have a you know escape plan yeah and but it wasn't uh I didn't know anything else basically so it wasn't like I had something to fall back on right and it was good pay for what it was and yeah but fear that that's when fear got you know this dress must be insane yeah you're always on you know there's a you know we always had this thing on the on the meeting wall it said there's no vacation even when this vacation you know you would go on vacation you would get your gun to go on be caged horse yeah it was pretty insane now have you ever been confronted yeah yes yeah of course I mean there's no there's the there's no it's not you know I have a lot of friends are in military up here in the US and it's not like it's not like them they go off overseas and they they do something in a different country with different people with don't speak the same language I was doing all this in the place I grew up right so I knew some of these people at time you know I am we had every now and then I would say hey I know that guy from when I was a kid or we were in school together and now he has a plate carrier with a an ak-47 and a gold gun on his bands right and it's like whoa and the gold guns big giveaway all gold guns are you know that's how you know yeah there's some amazing websites that document all the different stuff that the cartel has but they love gold guns yeah that's El Chapo got like a gold very special gold gun when he was uh when he was named one of the top earners and for the Forbes list I think he got his number on a gun and everything the second to last time he got caught because he got caught a lot of times and escaped somebody somebody in the military that got him took it you know and it ended up in the museum I think it's I think it's in a museum somewhere in Mexico City where a lot of these gold guns that's up that's a war trophy for those guys right so this is like a gold gun section of the museum yes yes mostly Mexico City Wow yeah that's pretty wild that gold gun gold akk xlvii you know now if everything is so corrupt down there how does a guy like El Chapo keep getting popped because when I when I saw his escape yeah I was like this is hilarious the fact this guy goes to the toilet and then he opens a door and Boop he's in a tunnel and on an electric scooter and goes a mile pops up on the other side and they had everything set up for him with electricity like I mean you know the I think the the thing that people kind of don't understand about the corruption is it's not just corruption because people are greedy it's all good it's also fear-based corruption so if you don't do what I say we're gonna kill everybody in your family even your dog that type of thing I mean so after the little chapo got escaped that last time you know all of the staff at the jail got you know put in prison and really so they were all part of it there's rumors that they were you know it seems like somebody had to hear all that digging of course you know I mean it's um only a mile away they well it was pretty deep yeah some some some things that should have been patrolled weren't patrolled it was a pretty good well made tunnel for what it was really well made so a lot of the people that El Chapo actually used for these tunnel operations because the same people that he used for the tunnels in the border region all the active tunnels there are somewhere you know along the border all of those guys were pulled in from from silver mining companies that used to operate all over Mexico that kind of went into the toilet so they were looking for jobs and Wow get a chopper out it's good job that's for drug tunnels you know when you saw all that shit go down with Sean Penn and Sean Penn visiting El Chapo and Sean Penn writing an article for Rolling Stone lots were you like what in the fuck is going on here yes for a lot of some reason that might not be you know mainly was why are they giving him a wire to give him this celebrity status yeah you know there's a lot of glorification and a lot of you know people venerating some of these people down there you know and they do a lot our arm you know so there's basically giving a voice to somebody it would be the equivalent of somebody up here giving a voice to somebody that was responsible for a lot of damage that done to the US you know it's why do you think they did that like what what what was the roman it was it was romantic write something about it's like here's Sean Penn one of our biggest movie stars yeah well one of the biggest drug dealers ever I mean he is a Chapo down because I've been to Sinaloa and I've done classes there which was pretty surreal he is uh he's a folk hero he's uh he's he's Robin Hood basically to these people and like witness a real moment that I had down there striving along this bad bumpy ride highway and all the sudden turned into a nice that kind of highway and the guys that I was with told me oh yeah this is the cartel made this highway and the back part of it that's the government the part of the highway you know schools careers lawyers doctors all their careers paid for cartel immigration processes of people that want to come over here sponsorships and all the type of stuff on both sides right so the the span of influence that's you know that's how he kind of got to where he was mmm he was always helping people and he was investing in people and these people this is these investments would pay later on you know in a lot of ways it sounds like he he benefited them he benefited some aspects of the community yeah I mean the reason why the military couldn't get him you people so could take eruption but because the he was basically he had a human shield around him you know all these towns odhh you know schools hospitals every instead of Christmas town that they celebrate the day of the Kings you know so you would get presents Mother's Day they would all get presents that type of thing so why would we want to help the military come in here and get chopped oh he's doing this type of stuff you know that's and that is the same all over Mexico with some of the cartels you know the hearts and mind carts and mines type approach is what makes some of these groups long-lived so how much of an effort is there to eradicate the cartels because if you can get a guy like El Chapo who at least in terms of like popularity is he at the top of the list that's priority but at the top he's at the top of the list as far as popularity but when as far as like the actual drug dealers is he at the top of the list or they're more clever folks that hide underground yeah there's rumors of people above them that are still out there somewhere that's what everybody like that's the great conspiracy is that like El Chapo is basically the bank manager look it that well you know there's a he has a compadre you know compadre somebody that if you're the daughter if you're the Godfather of my my kid you're my compadre right so he has a compadre out there my or sam bodda and he is still out there right and the the the extent of how he works and where he works is unknown so he's more slick exactly he tries to stay more low-key well there's you know some people get sick with the fame probably and you want to go outside once that move that TV show narcos came on yeah then every what people do I don't I think there's a lot of people who did not realize how crazy the life of Pablo Escobar was yeah and what really went down in Colombia yeah I mean it's crazy Pablo Escobar was a single you know he was a phenomenon in his time and age but he was one man I'll imagine replicating that type of insanity over the span of Mexico and it's about eight or nine guys you know mmm that was the 90s early early 2000s because these guys were you know Legion of Doom type thing where they would be enemies but they would have reunions and they would meet up and kind of agree alone you know certain things and stuff yeah just like in in the Pablo Escobar show yeah yeah yeah so they really do that they get together and have meetings and sometimes they kill each other that's that's the that's the that's a reality you know they do and at times or did at times because things are currently after al Chapo you know things kind of shifted and change what happened well main thing is a power vacuum and with the power vacuum and legalization on this side of certain subsistence substances like marijuana the the the pot fields are now poppy fields yeah and new new things like like like them now dedicating themselves to heroin instead of instead of the weed was that's mysteriously they're still weed fields down there for some reason you know you guys are way better at making it then anybody down there but for some reason they're still it'll bleed fields well I think it's a lot of access especially in the states where it's prohibited yeah just there probably more willing to get it to the people it's probably it meth meth precursors being brought in from China and to Mexico are now being made in Mexico mmm like in just real level stuff right and a new a new up surging cartel down there that is trying to overtake the Sinaloa cartel the new generation cartel is coming out of wall ahora and they're kind of really militarized kind of wing of cartel activities that are trying to you know take control over the whole thing what is the plan in terms of the government means if they can take out a guy like El Chapo what is the plan to eradicate all this and is there really a plan to eradicate it or is it one of those things where it's sort of a plan on paper but realistically they sort of accept the fact they're never going to get rid of these people so I have a I have a thing like that like basically cuts out Catholic quatl was a feather chirpin and I have a image of feathered serpent biting it sale Mexico has a problem with amnesia as six year cycle of amnesia every person comes in has all these plans to eradicate the cartels president goes out nobody likes them anymore new guy comes in says well I have a better plan you know and that's the cycle we always go through yeah so it's a big issue in Mexico yeah and current currently we have a leftist president that doesn't want to have anything to do with the past administration there are motor on the right of the spectrum his name is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador I'm low vocally supporting Venezuela that that type of guy apparently he has a good relationship with with Trump that's what's what people say but his whole thing was abnesti for the cartels that's a campaign promise amnesty yes and what does that mean exactly nobody knows what that means that's what he was saying that would you have a plan for this amnesty or is it just like a statement it was a statement and now if you cede counter narcotics operations throughout the country they've the military is not as active as it used to be well some of the cartels are growing and influenced because of amnesty could be you know basically I don't see the efforts that were there when I was active down there Oh things change you know so I don't know IIIi I truly think that the absurd because we're on route of b2 to having the most violent year in Mexico as far as cartel related deaths right when I got out Tijuana had been on the top most dangerous cities on the planet list and I actually worked there when it was on the top and through efforts both before the from the government and and through people like Lieutenant Colonel Isola he wanna was gone off the list of most dangerous cities in the world and now it's again at number one right yeah you sent me that I was pretty shocked because you don't hear about that here it's six murders a night you know I was down there two days ago and it was it's basically cartel on cartel so they're cleaning each other out and just bodies appear in the morning you know bridges hung from bridges tortured shot you know that's you know but again the there's nobody's doing anything about it they should you know but kind of turning a blind eye in a lot of ways Oh and so with this leftist president this guy with who has this idea of amnesty the the people that are in charge of handling the cartel the the military and the police officers they've got to feel like a little abandoned yeah or maybe some of them I'll have a business plan and they're working at one side so that's a problem too yeah so so the people did aren't nowhere you know we have a separation of powers down there as well so the army constitutionally shouldn't be engaged in combatting the cartels they shouldn't be engaged in police roles but there were some amendments done to the Constitution and you know laws passed but you have to realize that some of these people that are fighting the cartels and a policing type role from the military some of them can't read right or some of them come from rural parts of Mexico that shouldn't they shouldn't be doing that type of activity so you get a lot of you know a lot of failures on that side of the fence we do have some high-level SF community members in Mexico that are doing the work but they're few and far between and then you have the federal place which has gone through about four or five name changes in the past you know ten years because every time though well not gonna call them that change your uniform because they're all corrupt Jesus but now they're now they're this police right so so they just changed appearance it changed the name you know but like either refresh the public opinion of it there's a famous you know model investigation federal investigation police called the AA fee and they were like modern investigative federal police it's gonna go after and they were corrupt as hell and they all they did was even get a name change and all these guys got shuffled around and literally I was like hey I know you like what what no no I'm I'm this now you know but there's still the same person compromise yes yeah so those are the federal guys right currently they want to do like a national national police force and you're like wow they're gonna get new people they're gonna be national police force know it's the same guy change uniform change a hat so that's on the federal side you know so we're pretty wanting their state side each state has their own police force investigation police force and a preventative type force and these are politicized because each state government may be opposed to the federal government so there's a there's some static there and I foo and each municipality has its own police force and they me it might be completely different politically than the state and federal so it must for you to have your life on the line over there and see all this chaos and obvious either lack of organization or outright corruption it must be insanely frustrating yeah I mean the that be putting people in call there were clearly guilty of things you know and then seeing them come out or the legal system down there that I got that I had to endure you know you would have to go and do a face-to-face with all these people all right go into a federal courthouse leave your firearms behind I could do a face-to-face with these people inside that you just got that you just got for however many tons of cocaine or pot or whatever and then go outside and they're outside you know now now I know who you are you know there's no anonymity in that in that regard so but you would have to sign things you know and then seeing some of the people that were with you working on your side and seeing them how some of them would fall into corruption charges and then sue the government and then get your jobs back but now you have somebody who's compromised within your own unit Wow all right so they did try a few things to try and clean out police forces one of them was a plan they called a c3 plan it was like a like a filter for police officers down there it's still in it's still in action but you know it's questionable if it's effective or not I'd saw a lot of people go through it and later on hunt they would turn out to be cartel guys basically they would do a background check FBI background check polygraph exam drug testing all the all of these things to see that you were you know clean to work on these police forces the problem is that the polygraphs turned out to be unconstitutional to fire somebody over them so a lot of these people got hired back after they would fail Pollak polygraph exam so again it's a lot of attempts to clean it up you know and I you would be on the on the level and all these people won't be on the level but they were still there so what what percentage of people are not on the level if you had a guess roughly I mean I'd say would depend I'd say 30 percent probably that's a lot look I got my experience of the people that I worked at 30% went on you must cherish the 70 of like family yeah like family and you you would know when some of these people weren't awful level because you know I have this running joke that I have this I I went in with the same car that I drove out of the office with you know shitty truck that I had that I bought that I bought when I you know about my own dime first truck first car and I drove out of the office when I quit that when I quit the job that same day you know I drove it I drove out of the office in that truck but a lot of you guys would come in with their you know Hummers and H shoes and just weird cars or like oh wait a minute doesn't make sense like we are working the same office why do you why do you have a 3-story that's so obvious though I prove it you know yeah but but the obviousness of it oh yeah blatant you're driving a nice car living in a big house and everybody else is like what yeah there's you know there's this obviously these of this than these unwritten rules of you know you won't you wouldn't tell on this guy of course but you know it's obvious yeah and when it came time to share information of a certain kind or we're gonna go over here and you would have to turn around and look around see who was listening you know you know you wouldn't trust a lot of these people so how are we gonna power gonna do our job if we can't trust the people that are working with us well who was it that recently called for decriminalization they got was it your president they called for a depolarization of all drugs in America to go along with Mexico so what it was yeah all right to do something about the cartels yeah we're on the brink of legalizing marijuana and in Mexico right now like there's been a few landmark cases and you know it's Gold Rush type situation right now there's a lot of companies down there that that have had experience up here that want to go down there right so the culture is ready for it I think do you think that would help I don't know when it comes to legalizing pot up here it hasn't helped down there as far as lowering things actually made things kind of worse how does it made things worse they changed they changed the they changed what they were producing so that the reason of the reason why there's a heroin heroin epidemic up here and fentanyl epidemic up here I think has some relationship with how things got legalized up here and how they switched um product down there so lighter colored heroin is coming down from Mexico and I've seen I bet I work with law enforcement up here in the US doing classes and kind of you know they send me things like what do you think about that is that and I've seen that lighter colored heroin pop up in places as far our officers cause that's you so you know because of the color yeah the color or the smell the consistency you can kind of tell if it's asian or how it works it's a different strain like it's it's a probably a different strain and it's also the amount of Sun it gets in the region where it's been being grown whose height higher altitude so it's lighter color not a stinky I don't know but I think it's a relationship that that kind of relates to the legalization issue down there they didn't affect them in the pockets they just switched product it's got to be it's such a strange relationship because the reason why these drug cartel have so much powers because they're selling drugs to the United States yeah so it's like you have this connection to this country that has this great big wall that it wants to build and on one side everybody's buying up all the illegal drugs and the other side everyone's killing everybody to try to make and sell these illegal drugs yeah I mean and there's a lot of holes underneath that wall and drones your own technology is that wall gonna help anything well the wall has already been up for a few years part of it and in place like Tijuana which is like one of the richest drug routes on the planet and it's the drugs are caught the same you know it's the same it's yeah and what about like the ocean can't they just take a boat I've seen one large submarine in my time working real arge like like military size like like scientific sighs where the fuck does somebody buy a submarine online apparently really yeah you can buy a submarine you can buy a small submarine for a small amount of money I think the main part of the submarine ownership is maintained maintenance that was the reason we found it is that it wasn't properly maintained so it sunk yeah it it actually no it actually floated couldn't sink oh and it had a bunch of things hanging off behind it but somewhere you'd scare the shit out of me you can't see where you're going well so there so yeah I've seen submarines drones like a squadron of drones with a bunch of loads on it Wow how heavy can a drone get still fly wrap types I've seen fool like 2 kilos on it really yeah so just fly in the coke over the top yeah the only reason we I found out about those one of those crashed in a roadside next to the border fence were you around when that CIA drug plane crashed in Mexico with tons of cocaine on it yeah I wasn't there but I was aware of that situation what the fuck is that about I I mean realistically there's there's a lot of Americans running around in Mexico yeah that's that's that that's in there's a lot of cowboys right yeah a lot of people say listen we just make this one run like the government doesn't give a fuck about us my pension sucks it could be you know could be you know every now and then you know and this is this is this isn't a secret every now and then you would see a dude out there that's blond tall and has a bunch of tattoos that don't belong down there working on the military side of things in Mexico or some dudes doing something in someplace and then you will get a call you know oh they're they're fine just you know just leave him alone enough so who knows you know who knows so if it's three out of ten we're corrupt where you were it might be like one out of ten CIA guys I mean you know usually we would get to since I have a pretty good spoken English I would get I will get sent places for training or for liaison work with some people that would go down there and I would never know what the hell some of these people were from you know hmm so who knows you know it seems like it's very loose like there's a lot of room for fuckery Calderon era a bush administration era it there was a lot of there was a lot of stuff going on Obama administration era after the whole fast and furious thing things kind of cut went dark for a while yeah explain the facts a lot of people don't know what the fast inferences it was a they had sold guns to the cartel under the guise that this is the way they would track the guns yes it seems so fishy oh I I learned about it from CNN and I feel my friends were killed with some of those guns down there which is you know everybody talks about the the US agent that was in Mexico was killed by some of these guns but there was a lot of you know Mexican agents and people civilians killed by these guns as well so there were very specific types of guns you know so like imagine somebody giving you a shopping list about the types of guns you want right including in these lists were 50 Cal Barrett Barrett rifles and FN five-seven s which are a very it's a pistol with a very high velocity round that it goes through [Music] soft armor like this type of stuff that was issued to us all right so all of a sudden we're seeing these space pistols in the hands of the cartels and very specific parts of the country were like but what a preposterous idea that they're gonna sell it to the cartel they could track them well like that sounds like horse shit to me that sounds like someone's trying to make money and they said ah we'll just say we're selling it to them to track it well the the suspicious part is that all of them went to one specific cartel the Sinaloa cartel so it sounds like such horseshit the fact that I mean who went to jail for that Eric Holder didn't go to jail oh he should have he should have he should have I mean there's there's blood you know people died there was a I can't say the name but somewhere in in Baja a little girl lost her arm an agent that was a friend of mine got killed and the wife got killed with FN five-seven that looked directly related to that whole thing right so you can go to jail for fucking tax evasion I just got I can get away with that just think the idea that you would run that by people and they would go yeah good idea yeah give them gun and to be clear I don't know the realities of that operation on this side people say it was it was it was happening way before all I know is that when that happened nobody told us and there was definitely some weird resentment on part of the government down there people down there as far as you know and and there was some the weird conspiracy theories going on as well down how could two not be yeah I mean that seems like it's a conspiracy theory right in front of your face yeah did the fact oh yeah we just sold them to drugs or the guns so that we could track yeah no one's gonna die it's not like a bad idea the main thing you would hear is the people settlement and fast and furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and House just this is how it and wrapped up within the last two weeks I guess really this is just wrapping up yeah just some settlement on my cuz this is from what nine years ago Tunisia at least and the guns are still showing up so I don't know many of them I don't know I've never known had what numbers but I've last time I we found some and I actually have images of the ones we found they were buried in somebody's backyard inside of a water barrel and all of them were obviously US origin guns and like what do you mean all of them had very specific accessories on them that nobody else in the world puts these accessories on their guns at the US because they're pretty ridiculous accessory like what kind of accessories things that had things letters on them like see you in hell type things partnerships calls monasteries girls of the big one yeah and that's hilarious that a cartoon skull has from a Marvel comic book has become a gigantic part of SpecOps yeah it is it is pretty ridiculous well the main rumor down there is like with conspiracy theory wise and you would hear all sorts of things you know because down there there's there's no such thing as top-secret clearance in Mexico you know there's like there's like hey don't say anything you know that's that's about it you know so you'd hear crazy crazy things a main thing was that the US was planning an engagement you know they're destabilizing the region so they could put boots on the ground oh Jesus you know that was the look like a Cohen conspiracy theory going on the u.s. invaded Mexico yeah how fucking crazy would that be well you know as far as a reaction on the side of Mexico people want Pierre then this is again this is purely speculation and and weird rumors that I would hear people were planning to do poisoned drug loads on that side to create a health crisis in the US as a reaction oh that was pretty like when I heard it's like well he was talking about this yet you know and so full-out war almost could be you know and then you would try and see well who's doing that you know cartels so the cartels of the government are the same thing like what's going on right right right and again this is just weird stuff you what accredited there's a crazy perspective right the cartels would poison the drugs punish the Americans for the military invading the country yeah yeah so to create a to create a health crisis in the US so they would you don't have to go back Wow I mean ours you know they know how many guns they brought over I've heard all sorts of numbers we never got told the same number nearly 2,000 firearms were illegally purchased for 1.5 million according to the DOJ inspector general report fuck hundreds of guns related recover the United States of Mexico yeah may 50 cals were so the the and it saw was an escalation with the cartels right so we they would get ak-47s and we would get German mangy threes that were say around the same caliber and we could fight back right mm-hmm and then all of our leadership started rolling around an armored vehicle so let's get 50 cows to you know make holes in these armored vehicles so so it was all it's always been an escalation now he's just Christ you guys were giving 50 cows so you could shoot holes in the armored vehicles yeah though the cartels were getting them first and then then we had to get them because they were rolling around in armored vehicles so Mad Max type armored vehicles they would make they would first first they would make them like homemade Mad Max armored vehicles that they found a few of their online somewhere one of them was called la bestia which is like a giant they all that all that was missing was the guy with the guitar on the back of it you know and they would use these to roll into town and like how would you fight that right and then you had to get a 50 Cal or get the military to shoot them from the sky oh my god there's a there's a famous video from somewhere down in Mexico where they shoot a Vulcan rifle down at a cartel member in a car number vehicle but then you see well you know well checkmate checkmate government against the cartel but then you realize that the cartels like the new generation cartel Guadalajara have actually downed helicopters in wall ahora military helicopters because they have anti-aircraft capabilities jeez Christ so that then you now you're like checkmate cartels you know that's that's how where does this go like where does it escalate that's that's that's the thing that you know you you have to think about the so killing and death is not at the industrial level it's that is being done in Mexico not just killing but you know disappearing bodies making body disappear I was I was a I was around when they got the stewmaker the stewmaker was a guy that worked for the Sinaloa cartel in Tijuana and he would get rid of bodies using caustic soda right so he would get bodies every night and he had these basically these industrial level just barrels of it just going his caustic soda it's a chemical mixture yeah you can get most of the components at a hardware store basically it dissolves bodies you know it would get get some of this mixture he said and interviews that he got trained by Israelis that how to do that so who knows is that true or not but in the night he said he would get rid of you know dozens of bodies and just get rid of everything you know DNA bone everything so there's a lot of families on Mexico that are looking for their kids for years and there's just no way of giving them a body and the amount of youth that goes into cartel work and just gets you know kill there and it's just it's a whole generations and whole towns of women and old men you know they're out there which is the coal generation is just God you know all the men in the gun I've gone to gone to a few small towns where like they looked at me like youth you know a young man it's like so it's rare at some places that it's because the men are all getting killed all getting got got in the you know in the cartel operations and killed or just recruited now forcefully recruited or voluntarily but you know whole generation is just wiped out now the people in your line work the people that are boots on the ground to really understand the problem what is the thought in terms of what could be done to fix this I think main thing is any sort of any sort of plan any sort of plan to fight the cartels that involves just a six-year plan won't work because that's what that's what the main problem has been with Mexico each president were your presidential each term six years each president comes in with a six-year plan he either does very good or does really bad and then it gets forgotten and another one comes in and there's also definitely an addiction to money from the US side for countering cartel operations there's a blonde Metis that it's called it's a international plan where the u.s. pays for counter narcotics type operations in Mexico so there's an addiction to that money on the side of the government so there's a lot of interest for that to keep going you know so they don't want to resolve the problem as much they want to in some ways you know you know they refuse to professionalize the police horses down there they don't put enough effort in that in that regard you know good people that are there that I know there's some amazing guys down there doing amazing work and they get passed up for a promotion because they don't they don't have any they don't know anybody high level they don't work for either side of the gang you know so a lot of these people just get cast aside you know and you know it's kind of hopeless in that regard you know a lot of a lot of the good guys when they get when they come out of the job there's only a few options to them right I had I had options but a lot of the guys that go out of job don't so they get recruited by the cartels did you did anybody ever attempt to recruit you yeah yeah you get offers no you get offered any offers there's a there's a famous there's famous corrido which is like a Mexican folk song called I'm going to talk about my past right and it's pretty interesting song it's about a cartel guy that used to work as a cop and somebody from his past approaches him and says you want the kids haleh you want to want to do a job that's what you would get you know people within the police force is asking you you want to want to work on the side mmm that was the entry you know and or you know we'll pay you this much what is it like when you say no it's pretty pretty hard it's a it's a it's not it's not specifically saying no but just saying I'm not the one to ask for this and you say you know I'm not the one that asked for this you know what I'm I'm only in this for the money of for my paycheck and you know I don't want to risk anything so and how do they leave that they don't they're not happy usually you know so you get on a list sometimes and you know something that follows you but it's a much better thing than actually going getting into some one of these guys pockets no once you take something you're theirs right like the mom like the mob you know a lot of thing it's a lot of these guys actually took but you know they have a lot of these cartels down there they kind of venerate the whole gangster era the US it's like a thing oh so it's like a thing they looked up like look up to you know right so like you see a lot of gold-plated Thompson machine guns take picture with him so there's a lack of professionalizing the police force yes and that you think is a conscious effort I think I think it's uh so keep them fairly incompetent I think so you know a lot of ways we we were we were as a group that were the group that I used to work with we there was a lot of efforts to professionalize us to like getting getting that a career path to actually being you know making it a career there's no right now where I used to work there's no pension no there's no retiring Wow if you want to get any sort of a credit for anything the credit the credit companies won't even touch it because you're too high-risk you know to our risk cuz you must get shot yeah Wow yeah well it is the most dangerous city on the planet right so they they wouldn't touch us and realistically culturally being a cop in Mexico is you know male porn actor and cop or probably a lot of same range as far as shame you know wow yeah do I I wouldn't eat at any restaurant that we didn't know the people you know because it would spit in their it reasons a lot of he has escaped it was hate or by the hate cops so much they bike as a as a culture in Mexico the police police culture of Mexico has earned a lot of guys working both sides a lot of guys being you know again the whole you're gonna be a cop because you know somebody in there and people that shouldn't be in any sort of public service mmm-hmm so there's a lot of corruption again a lot of corruption a lot of a lot of things done wrongly by the cops a lot of abuses you know a lot of human rights violation type situations so it's earned you know so the big shift over there in terms of crime turns with cartel crime occurs first with September 11th the tightening of the borders then it starts to ramp up after that because of what the the government first started targeting certain cartel heads you cut one head off Hydra and yeah to head spawns who had three heads pop up power vacuum power evacuate will fight to try to gain power you know and the cartels realize you know what that we are standing on the riches drug routes on the planet so we should probably you know start fighting over them yeah and also what also what happened is that you know a lot of these people is something that people Americans kind of don't don't get yet this isn't a Mexican problem anymore specifically as far as the cartel violence going on a lot of these people had their kids up here in the US in the 90s a lot of these cartel guys you know Hill Chapel has kids had kids in the US and a lot of these people are now coming of age and so cartel influence in the u.s. is a thing you're gonna start seeing if you're already seeing it but you're gonna see more of it because a lot of these people are actually american-born the US citizens now working in tandem with any sort of interest down there so that's gonna be the new shift you know and you know people are sometimes kind of horrified by some of the stuff that I post up some of the cases down there people can look up the los Pollos gang in in Southern California there were actual cartel group that would kidnap people in the US dressed as federal agents in the US and drag them back down to Mexico now this happened a few books almost I think about nine years back but this is happening the u.s. no it's not something foreign anymore you know a lot of people want to think that you can build a wall and keep all that down don't get me wrong build that wall I have nothing against it but selling it as a security thing it's just I don't I don't think it makes that much sense and a lot of in a lot of the parts where it's it is up the violence is rampant on both sides but if the the argument would be that if the wall didn't exist then it would be too easy to come back and forth look at all spies yeah it could could you know but again drug tunnels catapults yeah drones are drugs and arms of like kidnapping people and a lot of other things that you cut off at least some of the vehicle I guess yeah I get it I get it and I think again I'm not against the wall you know build a wall that I interviewed a guy I do articles for a few magazines and I interviewed a guy who was a Sakai out you know Quixote he moves people from the border and he said this about the board's asking them to the interview about the border wall he said it's good for business you know you make something seem like it's harder when it is it and it's good for business so you say listen I can't get to over 3,000 was gotta be five yeah it's tighter yeah or fly them to Canada and they walk down which is that was his one of his one of his new favorite methods so northern United States probably got a lot of Mexicans now oh yeah the candidate boat board is hilarious it's a path yeah it's a carved out 100-yard Pat we we put pictures of it up the other day like look how hilarious this is the difference in Mexico and Canada Canada they make it easy to know where the border is like just get across here eh and be fine snow Mexicans you know yeah it's really strange well I mean it's the the amount of creativity and problem-solving that goes on on the criminal side you know mm-hmm the if if your best plan is a wall of a secure wall these guys have been working against that best plan for the past 20 years so they are they're already way ahead of the curve mmm you know in that regard you know there was an interesting time in John and people can look this up drone technology had I had an upsurge in innovation in Tijuana out of all places in the world for a time you know mmm like why that's funny what could be done to radically curb this you know like if you were the king of the world said Edie what are we going to do first off legalizing sums up some of the substances would probably help that would help a lot that's a pretty good question but even some substances that are legal like fentanyl is essentially legal because you can get a prescription for it but you're never gonna have like fentanyl just over the counter it's just too deadly you know another thing that you know I think about and that's a very good question I wish I could answer I think everybody wishes they can answer it and everyone just sort of like shrugs and so the the cartels aren't just a drawed field business mmm they also have money that is in property and legitimize businesses they work in human trafficking like they actually it used to be you can cross that border and go to the desert and cross it yourself but now you have to pay a toll protection rackets across the both sides of the of the border sex trafficking piracy like you name it they have they have hands in it right so so they just essentially took that drug money and just did a crime business he's diversified they've been diversified for a long time like yeah there was a recently two three three cartel members from Sinaloa in Malaysia released out of all places so you just think about that to Sinaloa cartel guys somewhere in Malaysia got caught somewhere and now they've been released and they gotta like a hero's welcome in Mexico to get a hero's welcome oh yeah really let's see the law that you know that getting Sinaloa's pretty that's uh I have this nickname for Mexico I call it the upside down you know because everything's basically upside down now right and yeah these guys got funny thing is that the Mexican government was involved in their release and then they you know sent them back and you know hero's welcome what were they doing all the way over there and in that part of the world diversifying diversifying so no one has a real plan here goes Malaysia pardons three Mexicans on death row oh they were on death row damn you want to talk about a kick-ass Corydon like a folk song song about either those guys are probably gonna get an amazing folk song you know so there's a lot of Romanticism time yeah I mean it's it's romanticism its religion there's definitely some some occultism involved in a lot of the higher-ups into these cartels I remember when I found out about the narco music these what are those songs called corridos yeah the folk songs there's a lot of them you know there's a and they all of them have a secret language in them sometimes or they're all a history of something that happened and you pay somebody to just to make one for you or somebody makes it for you and then if you do a good career song for somebody and the rivals will send somebody to kill you so like even even the musicians are on other side of the cartel kind of groupings as well it's pretty weird I don't but it's Wow so if you're if you're for the wrong cartel if you make a song you kind of have to like go into hiding or or not play any in any places where the rival cartels no territories are oh Jesus Christ will they come to your territory to come get you if you yeah no yeah there's there's finna be up in a few high level singers Mexican folk singers that got their you know killed for messing with girlfriends with cartel members or for singing the wrong song in the wrong place so that's in the culture and and the religious occultism the cartels have as well you know it's a pretty interesting thing things like Santa Marta they're the the death cult that is kind of in different parts of New Mexico it's like think of a very dark Freemasonry type thing right certain levels you have people that are part of the part of that cult from the cops to the military to the cartels it's kind of to prostitutes to drug dealers it's interesting how how that kind of also has an influence on on the way some people go into very risky businesses like being cops or cartel guys and how they wear or the empower themselves by some of these occult iconographies you know like or or there's the Trinity is a hisui small Delta which is uh it was a folk hero from turn over the centuries you know law basically a bandit that got caught and killed and he turned into US eight and now there's a giant Church to him in Sinaloa with a bunch of money stuck to the walls and and pictures of guys in the US with like a f-150 truck or a Hummer and like Thank You Mel Berta I'm living the dream now because of you Wow two roadside altars with with a statue of the Virgin Mary and then you look behind her and there's a Reaper behind it because it's a hidden santa marta shrine and they do that so the military doesn't destroy them because they have standing orders to destroy these things which shouldn't be but you know kind of religious persecution but they actually do that it's so it's so different than the united states in a lot of ways it is i mean i don't think we understand like all the stuff i think the average person has no idea about the songs no idea about the culture of it all they have no idea the depth and how deeply it's connected society down there i mean the death the death cult wardship is i think you could probably trace it back to the aztec days alright so there's definitely when you see all these highly graph highly violent bloody cartel executions and and and things like that i don't know i mean yeah i think there's some sort of genetic memory from that of those times it's not abnormal physically for some of these people do that type of thing you know ripping somebody's heart next to a tree is of there's videos of that stuff out there I remember getting contacted by people that I knew on this side of the border in the u.s. that were very curious why all these people from the Middle East were looking at all these cartel execution videos and then a few years later you had Isis doing some high production execution videos then we're inspired by the cartels you know wow so he's not interesting that we don't think about that we think about oh my god look at Isis they're cutting people's heads off why will they learn from Mexico which is connected to us by lambs right they're fucking walk they're like you'd have to fly to Afghanistan you could walk there it's not Libya it's near La Jolla yeah it's you go to La Jolla you see these fucking multimillion-dollar estates with his gorgeous view and everyone's driving Ferraris and Porsches 20 minutes drive you're in Tijuana yeah the most violent city on the planet right now that's so crazy yeah and when I go to San Diego that's one of the first things I think is how what a juxtaposition how crazy it is that this is the border to Mexico and it's all military San Diego is filled with fucking seals and Rangers and Marines basses it's just all military down there sits so military influence and it's right next to the most violent dangerous city on planet earth more than Karachi more than Pakistan we were as we were insured by MetLife and the MetLife agent said said something along those lines like you're better off going to Afghanistan or Iraq than you know working here basically numbers-wise and I was like thank you for that you know that felt that felt like a good pat on the back but it seems like they're getting cartel on cartel crime yeah fused with regular person crime so but that's how it always starts you know usually starts off and again this goes back to everything cyclical down there that that snake eating its tail so you get cartel on cartel crime and then they finish each other off and then they realize well now now what do we do so they started producting people extortion just for money just extortion comes into play you know protection rackets cross us guy and now they're very bold that now they're at the party somewhere and somebody looks at them funny so they come back and they shoot up the whole party I like your daughter she's pretty hot I'm gonna steal her and if you do something I'll kill you and you're never gonna see your daughter again that's how it starts you know that's that's how it starts kind of growing just bold brazen cruel that's how you get it in sociopathic that's how you get say get to that point and then again I experienced it back in the 2006 era and I saw it get into all the way to when the whole of the municipal police were they basically the army surrounded the municipal police office of the police in Tijuana and they took all their guns and a few of them were taking on a plane ride to Mexico City and there for a few weeks there was no armed police in Tijuana and the municipal armed police imagine somebody imagine somebody disarming the whole LP all of the LAPD and just having the army in there instead you know wow so you would see you would see these events and then things calming down you know the only success story as far as us as far as the city coming back from the brink was Tijuana with a wouldn't all that like the raging drug war went down lieutenant colonel Lisa all of the guy that I used to work with he took numbers down like everybody down in Mexico he had got hired then on to go to Huaraz to try and replicate his success the only successes were there because he basically treated the problem as a counter insurgency problem not a policeman problem mmm and he had he got nine attempts on his life the last one took the use of his legs and he's currently currently running for mayor of Tijuana believer huh and he's he's in a wheelchair but he still I wouldn't wanna want to mess with that guy Wow yeah we were Fatma myself and some numbers on my family are actually helping out with his campaign that he's you know he's got a is one of his campaign offices got shut up shut up recently so is there any plans or the is there any push to try to treat the entire problem as a counterinsurgency problem to replicate the success that they had in Tijuana no it's it's uh that was a solution brought in by the right side of the political spectrum in the in Mexico so it's it's a no-go right now because everything's still left this guy just got in office he's he's has a few months in so yeah he just got into office so so you got five and a half more years of this dude we're in for a ride that's all I can say yeah kindness doesn't seem to work when it you're dealing with cartels it seems like no you give him a hand a little take your feet that's that was that said Mexican say ah man it for you to have been in that business and to sort of be connected to about side of it now it did it seemed like does it seem I mean it must be incredibly frustrating but it also must feel futile like you've wasted time almost because not there's no no progress is ever going to be made I have a you know have a weird experience that I had burned about 2 acres of pot somewhere in Baja right towards the end of my career and then things happen politically a bunch of sheiks a bit Jacobs over the office I got called in and the director at that of the institution that I was in at that time was a shady character and I decided to assist you know what my my my mom had just passed away and that kind of affected me a little bit a lot of a whole lot a bit you know and starting a family and stuff like that and you know I said you know what this is this is not worth it so I left quit my job handed everything in um people were suspicious about why I did it you know let me probably found $1,000,000 somewhere in your writing or shit like that right so I had to leave in a hurry you know got a few threats gladly I gladly I had luckily had some great people on this side of the border friendships that I developed for a long while and they helped me out you know I went to Denver about two weeks after I got done with the job and old lady handed me a special cookie at one of the dispensaries and I saw the people walking in you know and it's like this is this what I've been you know right burning and chasing people in the middle of the night and looking at drug planes and violence and all this lady with a cookie now it's a store it's a it's a beautiful store in the room there's a store in front of La in front of the improv that I have to I have to put a video up cuz me and Andrew Santino were there last night making fun of it I'll send it to you Jamie right now because it's so ridiculous they have shit under glass like you look you're looking at art pieces I mean again I don't know why they're still producing pot in Mexico with you guys have it have it in the stratosphere as far as an art form I'm gonna send you this right now Jamie yeah well they definitely have it down now but it's just it shouldn't be illegal in the first place and that's not hurting anybody I just there's a bunch of there's a large shamanism and occultism all over Mexico and mushrooms and we use down there for scent like forever yeah and you know growing up stuff like you would see it and it was you know the demonization comes from the conflict around it not that it's right you know when it comes to things like this like it's just weed it's just weed man that's an antique road show type level style produce is that they give you a magnifying glass and they had all these displays with it this is a hybrid this is an indica strong hybrid this is a sativa straw sativa dominant are you supposed to smell it that glass good questions yeah right the right doors have a little jar that you can smell through it's a very good question we would just grab all of it machetes and just put it in a big pile and just chop it up and look it up or the wind coming from over there Wow yeah you know you would get a pass after that so it was fine you got a little fucked up Oh burning all that stuff for secondhand a better Eminem's that was my head it was there a sense of frustration when it was legalized in so many states in the United States in some regard yes what are we dying for what are we fighting for what lost brother exactly you know a lot of people were killed over finding tons of pot somewhere and now it's fine yeah now you could just buy it and it's I mean but you know the frustration is in isn't with the pot itself again it's it's it's what happens around the politics around it the amount of money invested into fighting it and and violence and interests around it but the plan itself again my my mom used to grow it and put it in a jar with alcohol and rub it on her muscles you know and now it's a thing you know it's it's always it's it's always been there you know all of a sudden you have full full auto machine guns protecting it and agro somewhere and full auto machine guns in another place people coming in there to burn it because you shouldn't be selling it it's just wow while I was doing it you know my mindset was these are bad people when I when I started you know these are bad people that are doing drugs and later on I was like just just just a plant stinky plant so people are smoking it and never never in my life did I encounter a hyped up you know pothead they wanted to fight you know so I was like they should they should make this as Colusa every would calm down didn't a different focus different methods if of course but you know pod when you were talking about how everyone with a six year plan it's not gonna work it's never gonna work it seems to me that with the romanticism of the cults and the way that it's engrained in a culture and that they look at these people like folk heroes that this is a generational problem many generations before it changes and calms down and I would struggle to think of what would be the thing that could cause it to calm down like what what could be the catalyst for change yeah and and more so than things kind of uh things are getting even more complicated now with migrant caravans going through through Mexico now and now you have all these displaced people from South America now adding on to the problem of an already I think is the caravan we hear about it on the news like from Fox News talks about it like scare tactics so I was I don't know and people can fact check me on this but I was probably one of the first ones to publicly say that they were going to go the first care but it's gonna go straight to Tijuana everybody was now they're not gonna go straight to Hana there this is too far off they should just go to Texas and they went straight to Tijuana and you know there were about 3,000 strong when they got there maybe a bit more and you know the the bunch of memes came up because of it as they were going through all the Mexico most of the people were pretty welcoming because they weren't gonna stay you know they were like you know here's a lot like when somebody is doing a job right marathon they would hand a bottled water bottle in you good riddance they finally got to TJ and TJ is very conservative like politically is very conservative place and they met with a wall of protesters wearing make Tijuana great again hats no yes no yes and I may or may not have produced a few of those myself and and all of a sudden you see the mayor of Tijuana with a make him make the quanta great again hand on his head and the reason why they were so adverse to these guys coming in is that they were a lot of them gang members you know 14 Street gang members the reason why they didn't go the other route is because they would have to have crossed Los Zetas territory was a cartel that has problems with the 14 gang so they were curtailing that they were complaining about the food they were getting at the shelters this is a third world country feeding durable migrants and we were feeding them tortillas and beans and there's a famous lady that was like I'm not gonna eat this this is pig I was Pig mean it's trolling on another level Wow so these guys came in but people started calling MEC the the people from Tijuana racist to brown people who Tijuana raced against other brown people Wow and you would see some of the the you know some of the news agencies from the US come down and volunteer groups who hippies you know with sending all their donations to these people and some of these major Caravan camps they would grab the donations turn around and sell it on the backside you know all these things they would sell the backside so we would they were we had just absorbed about two thousand three towels and Haitian immigrants after the earthquake in Tijuana no problems at all they're integrated into the culture all of a sudden now we have Haitians in the culture you know no problem at all but these guys came in and they were really kind of disruptive in that way right so you know do you think it was all the attention they were getting yeah that's what they wanted you know they wanted to create some sort of situation on the border so they rushed the border a few times I was I was around there when they the famous picture of the lady with the kids running towards the border happened it they were throwing rocks at the Border Patrol's they put Border Patrol guys and that's you know they got the gas in you know in response and that's when she was running away yeah and they had people there throwing rocks yeah that they threw rocks constantly that was everything and it's funny how a photo can give you a totally different perspective anybody that's doubting any of this go down on Tijuana and ask the people in Tijuana Tijuana people did not want those people there they saw them as disruptive crime went up one of the campus that they have was next to a school the school had to be shut down because of all the needles and stuff that was competing and getting found outside of the playground the school it was a mess a nightmare and then we would see it on the news and it was like flowers and you know the narrative was like I don't know what these guys are talking about well Trump is such a polarizing figure than anything that would would be anti-immigration like that like antimatter they just don't want to hear it but they've you know the Yalie the weird thing is how a lot of people love Mexicans like Trump you know yeah which is really well yeah why is that I think the whole art I'm gonna defend our people type thing mm-hmm that's like that yeah and a lot and people have to remember most Mexicans are very conservative you know Catholic conservative you guys so it kind of resonates with them a little but you know again we're divided as well as you guys are politically so there's a lot of a lot of to the left type leaning people down there so they you know again narrative divide and conquer but the people on the left what is their perspective on the Margaery Caravan Oh support it you know open the borders you know let him fuck they're not boots on the ground no well they're not not that you're not boots on the ground their cities are not the ones that are hosting all these people right right right they're not right there yeah it's going down they don't have a realistic perspective yeah it's a narrative so imagine these caravan came into TJ and affected the businesses the cross-border and tourism business of all the people that live there mm-hmm so a lot of businesses actually closed down because of these people coming in really and yeah and the only reason they came in you know was to disrupt and create an international scene which is what exactly what they did so did they plan on actually trying to get across or they were planning on jumping the fence and claiming asylum and asylum on the other side and the famous lady freeholders that I kind of made famous on my Instagram account she jumped a fence claimed asylum went to Texas and then her and her sister assaulted somebody somewhere and then she got arrested got deported probably so you know that's kind of the story of these people and then you would attract some of these people on social media so they would be all poor in the mire carob and videos they would have on the news and then you would see them on their social media accounts from back home Louie Vuitton bags it's not like that you know maybe a fake one but still you know they were fun thick they're flossing you know it's it's a weird dynamic on the border and as far as I I think it's being utilized in a lot of ways as a political type thing is currently because of the president you guys have up here and it corrected from wrong but they they do make an effort to not go into tourist areas into resort areas and the cartel well this is the thing because they own it or they have investments in it that's well so like if you go to puta Mita or something like that you think they have investments it's in their best interest of have things you know quiet yeah a lot of people so I do a lot of training as for do a lot of classes stuff like that travel safety things and people are amazed with some of the cases that I bring a fourth that they think they're gonna get abducted or drugged by the cartels and some discotheque somewhere down there yeah and it's usually American Americans traveling down there doing their thing down there against other Americans and then coming back up it's a perfect deal crime oh really yeah there's low did not happen with a guy who killed his girlfriend down there yeah there's a case of something like that where in the Caribbean if that makes sense like there would be a good way to get rid of some of those cases made a mistake the cartel got her I miss her so much man a lot of the a lot of the the drug gangs that happen there down there during that Spring Break type era that type of timeframe mm-hmm it's always Americans against Americans kind of doing this and people think it's the cartels or drugging people no it's sometimes it's Americans taking advantage of the whole being in the foreign land type thing I was staying with my family and put Tomita at the four seasons and we we they we have these golf carts and you can take the golf carts out of the resort and you know like when we take the golf carts to the town they're like sure go ahead we leave the resort the first thing you see is military vehicle armored with soldiers standing at the border of the fucking four seasons with machine guns on the roof of this thing standing there ready to rock case anything goes down yeah they're probably waiting for the rival cartel guys to come through so again a lot of these people who legitimize their businesses your years back so a lot of the money in those in those resorts probably probably trace it back to cartel interests Wow so it's just deep because it permeates the entire culture yes it's it's it's it's part of the business my model and you know a lot of the money moves around down there there's some sort of relationship with it Jesus Christ man it's kind of feel for you for a guy like you who gave your blood sweat and tears and was a part of trying to stop this it must feel so strange to watch this nightmare sort of play out you know Mountain so being up here and most of my friends for some reason I have attracted so many like Marines to my life why a lot I have a few seal friends and most mostly just crazy marine guys and I've been learning about what post conflict is post conflict or being a veteran a combat marinates is through them through their eyes mm-hmm you know things like post-traumatic stress disorder and and and stuff like that is TBI are things that I didn't even know we're a thing till that came up here no one talks about it in Mexico it doesn't exist it's not you know it's not discussed know you if you go into a situation and you you know do something somewhere you get a few days off you know that's about it and come back to work Wow and medical wise you know you like I've been discovering all these issues I have from that experience down there and it's like what kind of issues yeah my nose is pretty as pretty husband's pretty substantially destroyed and my I have a few you know head injuries and now I didn't know what they were you know I just it stress you know where on the body it's my age I'm 36 I shouldn't be feeling like this you know and through them they kind of pointed me and like you probably have this because this is what I had because I was in Iraq it's like I wasn't in Iraq might as well been in Iraq well that's that's the thing that the the the and and also you guys recognize your veterans you know no not enough not enough there's no such thing as a veteran down there you know somebody somebody but my asshole friends marine friends I gave me a Mexican drug war veteran hat because all they all those guys had their own hats you know so I think a Mexican drug war better than hat and had an eagle you know being strangled by a snake and it was pretty funny you know but it but it made me realize how there's a bunch of guys that Mexican amazing things and they're getting a recognition because it's a war that they deny right there's nothing happened there's no war happening this is so good the cartels and but there's no war you know even the current president said you know this is the end of the drug war because I said so kind of oh so there's no war anymore okay because why the boys over did you have any involvement is barely related but did you have any involvement no anybody that had any involvement with those Mormon cults that are down there yes I do know people that in the horrors region that some of the Mitt Romney's family members in that region area yeah I knew some federal I know some Federal Police guys and military guys that were curious about the amount of firearms that these guys have because they had some they basically fought the cartels off how crazy is that well it's you know it's pretty it's pretty interesting being there and finding a white guy that speaks amazing English and it was porn in Mexico and he's in there are Mormons they're Mormons and they they have to get like a visa to travel to us but people don't know that like Mitt Romney's dad the reason why Mitt Romney's dad never ran for presidents cuz he was born in Mexico yeah yeah yeah I mean there's a lot there's a lot of white Mexicans which is another one thing that people don't help or Canelo Louie CK yeah Louie CK Mexico Canelo yeah anybody that's of Irish ancestry if you go into a bar in Mexico some bars in Mexico you can probably get some free drinks if you tell me why rich because the Irish betrayed the Americans in the last Mexico American war and a lot of them stayed down there and married some of the locals Irish last name on one quarter that's how you got a problem right yeah the that the the the the Mormon community in that area basically a few of their members got abducted yeah and the cartels were you know wanted to do more against them and these guys apparently got some high-powered long-range rifles and they were shooting at these people from afar and they set up this whole security apparatus around their town and the Mexican government basically looked the other way and kind of said well it's fine and just don't you know don't be get too crazy with it yeah there was some sort of interaction as far as uh them trying to appease things with them you know because realistically the the town that they're that they made out there is a paradise I mean amongst other towns in that area it's a beautiful place really the beautiful plates very organized what is it called this it Jamie this is a Mormon little town so what kind of military did they have that protects this town like if they've they've made their own military so I actually got to do a few reconnaissance things there just this this is passing by and what I saw that they had were a bunch of basically machine-gun nest on some of the hilltops and they lit the the limited the amount of access points to that little town so they had the bare basically there what happened when the people got abducted I think one of them got killed and then you know they wanted to kill other people and there was this whole thing they went to the government for help and they didn't say anything so somehow they you know procured firearms down there so they start defending their own what a strange story that is because they left the United States when polygamy was illegal yes when they started making polygamy illegal in Utah they went well we'll just go to Mexico because back when they did it there wasn't even cars so it was like no big deal to live in Mexico like you're riding a fucking horse no matter where you are yeah no didn't no difference no and they said we'll go over here but it is a nice I mean again it's a weird American like town in the middle of Juarez I mean how many people go Ayla it's probably the thousands tens of thousands maybe Wow yeah all Mormons all Mormons and a lot of Mexican converts now so really yeah there's a lot of Mexican converts down there as well and are there more than one family more than one of these towns I think so yeah yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of family names or in that region they're kind of famous you know one of the Barons are one of those but it's only this one town it's it's one upset there's there's a few out there there's a few there's a few more Murray communities out there Wow it's all the same sort of deal armed to the tits the discretely armed you know I don't know if it's it's open as it was but it's it would be back then and when it was really rowdy they were they were openly doing you know things to keep people from not coming to their town and their full-on Mexican citizens yes Wow but there but they speak English in their wine so it's they don't speak Spanish some of them do but they don't need to because they live in this community they don't go out of it a lot so you know it's a wait it's a weird place that's fucking really weird yeah yeah yeah just like and when you when you're over here and you look at do you see it any differently from looking at it just looking at the situation over there and how crazy Mexico is from America like how ignorant Americans are to how bad it really is yeah I mean so I've been up here for four years now as a resident right and I came up here at the weirdest time probably in the US history as far as you know when I was going through my immigration process Trump you know got elected so it was pretty interesting you know and you know being pulled to the both sides of the political spectrum you know you and seeing how people would talk about Mexico in ways that were like you know realistic or you know just weird things that you would hear it's like that's not how it is you know that's not how it happens it was a big misconception that it's a Mexico problem only and that the the and the cartels are out here in the u.s. - you know they're not they're everywhere outside the border the border thing is like that's a border but they're on both sides you know there's definitely cartel here in the u.s. so then most Americans are getting thinking of it is a foreign problem mmm it's foreign if you live far from the border maybe you know but you know it's it's everywhere it's everywhere that's one thing that I always see like and also that that it's a problem that Mexico should fix itself you know that's a lot they also hear that no they should fix their own shit yeah but they're only them you know the problems down there you know stem from firearms and money coming from up here and the big drug market and you know the money going into some corrupt hands down there had times and and basically them burning the manual every six years and just starting anew on their fight and the cars anybody else say this other than you like does anybody say that politically over there I there's a few people there's a few people I was actually in charge of the governor of bajas security detail towards for two years - almost three years I was put there because he was a very good friend of Felipe Calderon he was compadre and he was very high level and you know there was a lot of threats in his life and again he was heading up the tip of the spear for the counter cartel operations and the whole of Mexico and he implemented a plan and TJ that was then replicated throughout the country and he would be very vocal in his encounter cartel rhetoric and how we could do better and how we should all work together he developed these groups called boon groups basically army municipal police state police all of them working together in these operations groups and just going out there and it's the jurisdiction of everybody here to do whatever we need to do and he was pretty you know instrumental his name was a tsunami young and he's out of politics now and he had a lot of threats on his life and it was pretty interesting working with him he's one of those people think that all politicians corrupt out there it's not true there's some good ones he was wasn't definitely I work directly with him and I and I could tell you he was a he was one of those good ones and Lieutenant Colonel Azolla who's now running for mayor of Tijuana he's one of those vocal guys there's a reason why he's been try to kill them nine times you know he's saying something you know he's he's represents something right there are good people down there willing to fight it's just that you know there's a lot of more bad people wanting to kill you must have seen some horrific shit over the course of your career yeah yes yes bodies the the brutality torture all that all that type of stuff downer again I tell people working down there is the closest thing to the Wild West you have currently it's basically people and when the people say third world country there's a lot of cosmopolitan places just across the border that aren't necessarily alien to Americanize all right you know I imagine all this you know crazy things happening down there like there was a famous firefight in Tijuana the cupola which is basically there was a big cartel stronghold inside of this castle type thing you know it had a big giant dome on top of it the cupola a shootout and when you when that happened basically a bunch of everybody responded to this thing and it was next to a school and kids were being evacuated from and it was pretty horrific a lot of the people on the inside they had a lot of people abducted on the inside and they had they basically executed all of them and some of the people on the inside with the cartel guys would put zip ties on themselves and you know kneel down the ground so they were you would think it was them and you saw a uniformed police officers inside of there shooting outside two uniformed police officers so you would see how the crazy corruption and you know le shootout happens bank robbery two guys with ak-47 North Hollywood that one militarized the whole policing in the United States that type of thing happens in t in may in Mexico in Mexico every day another gap it's nothing changes you know that's that's that's crazy part you know how how somehow that just is part of the normal now down there nothing changes no no adjustments no adjustments no evolution you know these guys used to roll around dressed as cops with cloned vehicles and now they roll around in taxicabs and are more discreet and how they move these guys used to use drug mules and drug tunnel Sally use unmanned drones and other means to cross their drugs so they're always kind of evolving and adjusting and the government is trying to smash it with a hammer for the past you know 10 15 20 years just whack-a-mole whack-a-mole what made you start your Instagram account because your Instagram accounts excellent it's ed manifesto and it's all you you talk so much about the problems that are going on over there and you also do a lot of situational awareness stuff you show what's wrong with this picture yeah what you see here yeah main thing was when I started I was still active down there so it was kind of like a reporting you know mm-hmm so I was trying to share things with people to try and you know raise awareness but after that became more of a thing of I just spent over a decade working in this environment down here and I have nothing to show for it so I need to take that experience and make it worth it for people to share some of that experience with other people and to make it you know just to make it I had to justify to myself just I need to make it worth worth the while worth my while to haven't done that there's not a lot of people doing what you're doing though no no I think the the the the strange thing about me is my English and the fact that I worked on the border so I had the opportunity to cross that border and you know share some of those experience of here like I've been to the FBI Academy so real you know this kid from TJ is now at the FBI Academy showing some weird some weird people hmm Secret Service Academy some lose some of your SF guys have you know contact contacted me and I've done work for them and I'd show them like wow had like that trick to get our handcuffs that's pretty cool where did you learn that like who showed you that 15 year old kid you know and TJ showed me how to flip handcuffs in and weaponize them that's pretty gnarly fuck them and weaponize them yeah so there's ways of releasing your handcuffs and flipping the side of the arm of the handcuffs so it looks like it's still on but it isn't and somebody approaches you and you flip it open and use that thing as a meat hook and a 15 year old kid showed me that after we applied tried to apply that on one of our guys and that's the stuff I wrote on in my little manifesto it was basically a manifest it was a notebook I would write all these things down document most of them and when I would come over here in the US to do training like I did some training with NCIS and in Coronado during my career and some of those guys were team that I seal guys that's how I met a few of them and they were like hey ed this is how we do executive protection and in the Middle East I was like wow that's how I would do it or I crossed the border right down here what yes yeah what really yeah Wow that's crazy god yeah and you know we'd show them a flash drive with a bunch of pictures from stuff down there and they would like be blown away by it and sharing information and and and kind of that basically making use of that experience a lot of people down there a mute they don't share that experience they don't think it's worth anything I think I realized that that experience in that gnarly place is worth something to at least as far as sharing it yeah not a lot of people think that you know kind of you know we downplay ourselves we have this problem in Mexico most Mexicans are very doubtful about themselves you know there's a like where Mexicans like what what what would we have to share with these high-level guys you know and you know being in a place like that low means low equipment low training being creative that's a lot of things that come up from those that experience of being you know solution wise as far as you know keeping safe well I think part of the problem with the United States in Mexico is our view of Mexico and someone like you what you provide is a real list expected and real information real photographs real stories go and just enough and then this conversation just enough where enough people hear it it'll shift the the idea of what is happening in Mexico a little bit that I mean I again thank you for for this invitation and I thank you I have a like I've I have this uh weird comparison that I have with you as far as you know this podcast it's got I've listened to it way back when you know and I remember this whole feeling of being around a campfire in hearing people talk about their things and kind of you know passing the pipe that's it's pretty interesting that's something I've only kind of seen as far as exchanging information of that like around campfires or shamans or sweat lodging type situations down there a lot of our guys were native so they would you I will get invited to these sweat lodges stuff like that you know you get that exchange of information but yeah I definitely start talking about it that's the first step and a lot of people don't want to talk about it because of fear know people are like hey aren't you afraid of talking about this so I was afraid for 12 years yes I am but I I know that nobody else is gonna going to so I if not anybody else you know well if you stop and think about how many guys have worked on the board or how many guys have worked in these counterinsurgency operations and how few were talking about it and how many of them died nobody knows where they are all right how many are still out there nobody knows where they are or you know Sicario that movie Saqqara yeah those people are looking at that movie so a lot of the followers just suspicious of that van detail total having an mp5 I was the only Mexican rocking an mp5 submachine gun down there right so that's like that is that you know what did you think of those movies horrible horrible unrealistic you know they should hey if somebody doesn't hire me I'll do it for free just you know I'll consult for free on that and I'll make it look a bit more closer to what it is but it's the main thing is how how I everybody saw that movie and that that's how they would you know that's that's a reality you know how is kind of a basis for reality so Sicario 2 comes out and it's basically the United States declaring the cartels a terrorist organization you know and I saw that and I was like hmm usually fiction kind of pre kind of has a way of influencing reality further online you know that Denzel Washington movie called siege were budget terrorists attack New York and then militarized New York and that's kind of like a president for 9/11 mm-hmm so you see Sicario too and then you know we're gonna terrorists Trump now says they're gonna just thinking about declaring the cartels as a terrorist organization that's pretty interesting mainly because realistically Mexico has been calling them terrorists forever yeah what did you think about that about Trump doing that do you think that that actually is something that can happen if you're gonna militarize efforts against it and not just consider two law enforcement type situation I think people should be afraid down there if you do go that route but just realize that's gonna be open warfare not in a foreign country across the ocean that's gonna be right next to your border yeah where people can walk across yes or make things happen down there that will affect you up here yeah in a very real way you know and it'll get ugly before it gets better you know III hopefully doesn't you know but that's realistic but if that doesn't happen if they don't treat it as a terrorist organization and try to have some sort of impact on it what could be done I mean I think I think culturally they're trying to get us ready for that you know hmm I don't know I mean I think that's what's that's what's happening you see a lot of the cross you know borders US military assets training Mexican Marines down there and having a open relationship with them you see that and that the push is to maybe you know preparing for something you know I think they're preparing for something you know what what could that be I don't know so the what we get about it publicly is just a small sliver of the actual conversations that are being had and and also there's a lot of you know misdirection there's a lot of misdirection I'm personally yeah but listen II D I really appreciate you coming down here and enlightening us and telling us all about this and I really appreciate appreciate your Instagram account and they the Instagram account is at manifesto what else you have a surrounded medium its manifesto on Facebook as well and its manifesto calm all right beautiful thank you brother appreciate it man thanks for coming in here thank you bye everybody [Music]
