Hollywood well you look at mean eating eaten well we eating avocados caring about your future what does it say Jaime 26 no cause of death was immediately released you know for a while see that's what I saw I saw they didn't figure it out yet no I saw something on yeah that's a problem with someone you get a bunch of different versions of the story I went down an internet rabbit hole last night man this is a very disturbing one do you know anything what's going on in Boyle Heights no Boyle Heights UCLA right yeah it's just LA and apparently the hipsters are starting to open up artisanal coffee shops and art galleries there and they're not having it and Gabriel is pushing back it's more than that there's a lot of videos it's like straight-up racist it's anti-white racism which is apparently totally acceptable you know if cameras are blaring in your face will Boyle Heights be ruined by one coffee shop oh it's not just one coffee shop they forced a gallery under is this an older story in tuned yeah they forced a gallery out just through constant harassment and they broke the windows of this coffee shop and but when I watched last night that was disturbing was these air-quote activists standing in front of this gallery it's a fucking art gallery and they're screaming get the fuck out get the fuck out of our neighborhood get the fuck out we don't want you here and the guy was like trying to talk to him like you know some hipster guys like you know I'm identified as a feminist like one of those identifies it you know one of those guys and he was on your side mitts like yes I'm here to support I'm here to support you we don't fucking want you get the fuck out get the fuck out there chanting get the fuck out get the fuck - great chant get the fuck out - great chain thought up a sign that says fuck white art white fuck white art the coffee shop they broke the windows hit the coffee shop was even more fucked up because one of the guys is actually a Mexican no they've hacked up property okay right yeah one of the guys who own the coffee shop they were calling it it's they called it like weird coffee or something like that and neither they put a sign on it calling it white coffee and they broke the window but one of the guys who owns it is a lot no I don't know if he's Mexican but he's definitely it'd be funny to open up a spot called white coffee yeah why people come on people coffee just called white people problems like a new generation of ant identification radicals are on the march in Los Angeles and around the city this is not a that is not an accurate way to frame what's happening no that's crazy this is not anti gentrification of radicals this is these are rioters they're writing these people have fire in their hands they're walking on the street and they're yelling a bunch of racist shit and they cover their faces up look I get it I get what's going on like they're they're afraid they're gonna lose their neighborhood and they're afraid their neighborhoods gonna be pushed out yeah the dinosaurs felt the same way so to say yeah so did cavemen everybody feels the same way the world is a fucking fluid moving thing you can't just save neighborhoods forever it just doesn't work that way you can't save anything forever no I mean and there's nothing wrong with a goddamn gallery moving in your neighborhood that's crazy right that's that right right like like I fuck I see when people do this whole thing about like Walmart's moving into small towns and that they don't they panic like I get that I understand it's changing industry a dude selling fucking lattes is not gonna dynamically shape and and if it does it'll take 15 more more years yeah it'll take 15 more years but they know it's coming they know what happens in these neighborhoods it's like these hipsters move in first because LA real estate is so ridiculous it's insane it doesn't make like I was looking at places near where Carolyn lives Callen lives in Santa Monica and I was looking place he lives above ground yes I know he lived in like the sewer system or something like that countless system he lives in a very nice neighborhood I mean I'm not but I was just looking in Santa Monica in general and a regular house like a regular house is two million dollars yeah bullshit house like it was a fuckin normal house house yeah nothing like you but like you bring a gal back home I gay ma you know look at the view of the city no there's no two million dollars you get a shack to bed one and a half bath yeah with fucking old bullshit linoleum yeah shitty sink with the ring where the fucking water the dirt has just stayed just in those old la la la doing like in the 60s they love doing like or in the 50s maybe pink like pink and green bathrooms so is like pink tile oh yeah and they leave that and I was just looking today Cozart yeah or just or just bad decision making some look please today yes just where I came you guys looking just Hollywood Hills on the other side yeah it's just all so nice yeah but it's a nightmare all that stuff you think about they're like all the drainage I went to a super rich Jews house there how much does that one take a guess twelve million dollars to point to well you know because it's a duplet it or two apartments they rent right yeah that's to one side is a door oh the right and left are doors yeah yeah so what la does is they take these old buildings split them like that so then they can make twice the money the property is the property can't be worth that much it's just the fact that they can rent it to two people that's a lot of money man oh my god one point five how big is it a thousand square feet one that's the size of this studio right cause that's the size of where the mics are inside of here it's pretty close a thousand square feet is really I mean if you're one dude living by yourself like maybe you got a dog yeah but like then that one dude would just rent he probably should unless he's just real simple like there's those people that buy those miniature houses ever seen those tiny house yeah yeah do you like that you want to talk about wormhole shit I got it so deep dude I was like what if I did that what if I didn't tell ya sure it's why you know there's a show that I'm addicted to it's called life below zero I watched three episodes people in Alaska yeah you loved that show I watched two episodes uh the other day and one actually yesterday but the one I watched yesterday there's this dude who lives in a place called think it's called Chandalar it's way above the Arctic Circle right his fucking guy lives by himself and apparently he used to be married and he has kids somewhere yeah his name's Glen Glanville new or some shout out to Glen smart dude - which is weird he lives so low so low no one's around he lives in a room not even half that that's that's homeboy right there he lives in a room not even half the size of this studio and he just has a bunch of shit like stacked in that room maybe it's like I'm like maybe it's half the size that's his tent above the Artic she make it there we see his hot his hog the show is diesel see here's the thing about these things like you got to realize that on these shows there's a lot of the stuff they do is just bullshit they just do it for camera well would be good episodes a well maybe I can make my own sauna yeah make a song perfect like what he'd really be making a sauna I don't know but what this guy does is just he goes out and shoots moose and caribou he eats almost exclusively meat he lives where there's fucking no plants I mean there's tree hey girl you're not growing jack shit okay wolves in his yard he had a shoot wolves once they were in his backyard shoot him cuz they were coming for his food I see him training the Wolves you know the training heaven shit see you don't really train wolves you train those bitch ass half wolves that become dog that's right that's they turn into they turn it to his his sonna wolves his sauna dogs unless you like Beastmaster you have like a special bracelet you walk to the forest now follow you master that show fucking do like always head like a hawk landing on his shoulder and shit just go like this and a bird would land on them yeah fucking mount line or something that hung around with him to walk with his guardian yeah yeah like here he is yeah those those ferrets are like pigeon kite pigeons in New York you know I mean the parrots distribute messages throughout the forest do you know ferrets were illegal in some places for a while as to pets too much anal what people shoving them up their ass I don't think that's ferrets they'll get him with a hawk on his it's an eagle why looked at a why do people why were ferret silly I got it they thought they were aggressive which is hilarious do you think about how many dogs people have that are just people's faces off and shit fucking golden retriever attack my golden retriever and bite his face when we were on a run the other day what do you do I just pulled him apart and he yelled at the God and control his fucking dog and what does he do the guy was so weak like he the dog pulled and the guy comically fell to his ass feet up in the air from a dog I mean it's a 70 pound dog it's not a big dog and it yanked him right now he said like the dogs a problem it bites things and tries to bite people Mike bad dog man put a fucking muzzle on it or something or figure it out but he can't even hold the dog like there's people that have animals that they're just hoping nothing goes wrong they have zero control the right thing and this thing pulled and this guy like whoop feet went flying like a cartoon who's so weak and then when I separated the dogs he tried to pull the dog back he couldn't pull the dog back on my come on man like you shouldn't have this dog it's not even a big dog shit I'm a fucking Chihuahua emasculating moment for a guy to like have another man be like hey what are you doing guys I control your fucking dog I don't want to hurt the dog but the dogs biting my dog well you have to stop it in some way yeah do something in some way so if it takes two instincts instinct number one is like kick it and knock it away like yeah push it away instinct number two is grab a rock and smash this fucking thing it's that passion standing and fighting that instant yeah cuz that dog is like my little buddy you have to protect yours yes yeah well he's a sweetie to like he doesn't he's not growling at anything any time ever right this is just a fun just got attacked happy dog and his dogs biting onto his face and he's - and I'm trying to figure out what to do and this fucking guy feet up in the air whooped of no use and not so I have to assume his dogs not gonna do anything to me right no it's biting my arm what the fuck is wrong with his dog that wants a bite another cuz it's a pit bull or something like that if it was a pit bull I would have known like okay we got to go wide berth here yeah fuck away from get away I know how those things behave but this is just like why is this dog doing this that'll be the next uh that'll be the next like reality shows fight fight fight the owner like you know the dogs getting their thing and then you're like alright well mean you have to fight now there's people that have dogs that don't even understand dogs they don't know that they have to be the Alpha they don't know the right they don't know how to go hey cut the fucking shit cuz they just get a dog okay they just get a dog and they just figure everything he'll figure itself out you know his badass with dogs who Whitney coming you know I just got a puppy and I called her she gave me a crazy good advice dude she doesn't fuck around in her house she goes I walked through my dogs I don't walk around them I walked through him yeah she goes and they don't lie on top of me and they don't get to lick my face ya know she told she gave doing that let me tell you shout out to her she gave me so much great advice cuz she was like I literally I was like hey Mandy little bit of time to tell me what and she I mean like a computer she was like dude don't do don't do don't she like named everything perfectly that she's like don't make this mistake don't do this people do this shit all the time it's wrong she laid it out great and like now the puppy's like almost perfectly potty-trained look and I just got it I saved my best friends true adopted dogs yeah she's one of smartest people I know but yeah but a puppy's an asshole by the way puppies are assholes so puppies are as well oh so hard to deal with me I'm waking up in the middle the night pissin and wanting to piss like every two hours babies yeah I know I know I know trust me I was a blood I learned fast that I was like I was like it'll sleep a little bit nice last time you had a dog years ago do you have crates to keep being a crate yeah yeah you gotta keep the crates thing they don't mind that's the thing they think oh we put the dog in a cage they like it they like it yeah yeah cuz they feel like well even when she even when she shits she finds a thing that feels like it's covering her mm-hmm she likes to be like covered when she shit I mean she's a lady first of all you know she wants to she wants to hide her shit but what same thing when she goes in the crate she likes it when my shirts on top because it's like it feels like it's a little cave you know it's the most bizarre to me is people in New York City who live in these little ass apartments stacked on top of each other and they have dogs Great Danes like why the fuck is this crazy how are you doing this like you have to that is a job you have an extra job yeah like it's not like you just let I can let my dog out in the yard hey buddy gosh it could open up the door is gone goes takes a shit there you got to take it down an elevator stairs yeah what if you're in a walk-up right you're gonna walk down seven flights of stairs at two o'clock any morning cuz your dog has diarrhea fuck what is this this lady is walking down the street with a goddamn horse that is one of the biggest dogs I've ever seen is that Mary lives in a 400 square foot 2-bed 2bath my friend's daughter just moved to New York City she got a job in New York City and she moved to this place where she plays $1200 for a room that doesn't even have a sink in Manhattan in Manhattan yeah they have a community bathroom down the hall yes she's a hot blade in her room and there's no room for anything no refrigerator no none of that you know it's a room No you bought a room it's so little a bed there's a bed that sits there and then there's like she has this little tiny area where as a shelf and then she has a hot plate that sits on the shelf that's it that's it if you have clothes you gotta stack them up and boxes on the ground the best city in the world baby $1,200 for a rake if you're a kid like is she's only 21 think of your kid and you moved to New York how much you makin what do you even making 1,200 bucks a month I mean you might make you're probably clear four hundred five hundred dollars a week before taxes right and then the taxes come you might be down to four right so you what are you doing you're paying $1,200 you making sixteen yeah you're living off of $400 a week to walk around take cabs and get food fuck all that's literally why I moved to LA when I started comedy I was gonna go to New York and I thought my buddy was like you can be broke in LA and get away with it yes you think you can't be broke in New York yeah when I lived in New York I was doing road gigs and I couldn't afford to live in Manhattan so I lived in New Rochelle I got a place in New Rochelle with a little driveway I rented like I was a bottom half of a house and like there's like a little Drive where I parked the car right in front of my bedroom so if someone fucked or that I could hear yeah yeah it was the only option that wasn't cheap either but like living in the city was just impossible it's like hundreds of dollars a month just for a parking spot yeah I just couldn't afford that no no that's why I'm ooh-la cuz some someone was telling me they were like you you can get away with paying you know 400 a month in LA to have a room in a place with roommates and I was like you know that's perfect well I think comics are doing it right like there's a lot of like Tony Hinchcliffe when he lived out here when he first moved here he lived with like three other guys and like they all split the rent all right a small one-bedroom apartment or two-bedroom apartment you can get away with that and that's fun it's like it is fun you know it's not fun though hmm the one guy who doesn't make it no shit he still calls you yeah what do you guys up to hey yeah you think I'd get a spark hey man you're breaking up I gotta go I'm in the hill I'm on the hill yeah but that's always funny cuz I was actually out of the there's always one the guys that I moved out here or the guy when I lived with when I moved out here they're all doing good stuff not comics but they're all doing stuff which is wild this is good if they're not comics yeah they weren't they weren't causing better that was easier for me because I didn't want yeah I also think competition in those places gets kind of thick you know it could some guy gets on some guy you know isn't some either you watch one dude get a lot of like rise and then everyone else is like why the fuck is he getting someone's rise becomes a you know I lived with I've only lived with the only comic I've ever lived with was Duncan that was only for like six months loved him must've might not even been six months somewhere in the neighborhood of six months I never lived with a comic I think he got booted out of his house though he was living with a gal and then they had a little bit of a struggle mm-hmm and called me up from a motel and I'm like come on live with me man fuck it come on dude party this big old house living by myself like let's have some fun and he actually used my isolation tank to get over his breakup really yeah I ain't got in the tank every day he would smoke weed and getting the tank and think about life and yeah wrote a journal and then left it behind so I've read every page call them up I was like dude what is all this case shit what is this what do you got here first couple of pages I love anal you don't mind if I put it online right page four mate this day I don't know where that is might have got lost in one of my moves might just turn up somewhere as I said you should do a time-release like every day a new page gets released online it wasn't really that bad it was just him you know like getting out of the tank and just sorting his head out what's the first thing you think of when you get out of the tank oh it's very different every time I mean most of the time when I get in the tank I'm just trying to chill out I've always had always have so many plates spinning you know there's like so many different things I'm most thinking about like this podcast who's the future guests when am i doing stand-up what what bit am i working on it's go the UFC is coming up like Oh have I watched this guy fight before are gonna make sure that I you know get my my views in on different styles and stuff and have my ideas about what I think about these matchups and you don't sleep you don't sleep I sleep you sleep in there like no in the tank yeah oh no no I don't sleep in there can people sleep in the tank uh yes you definitely can I would imagine that your own snores though would echo off the walls a little bit maybe that would wake you up I'm sure I've passed out in there before I'm sure I have over the many years that I've been doing it I first got one sixteen years ago holy shit yeah that's when I first got a tank I got one in 2002 that's wild yeah do you do the cryofreeze to do that do ya what man I really prefer sauna takes more time but I really like how saunas make me feel but cryo gives you a firt I shouldn't say I prefer it here's the problem I have a sauna here so like my mom biased so I could just turn it on and I'll do it way more off right I have to drive the cryo place park my car it's a whole photos off just get a cryo machine here no no it's very complicated and you have to have a license you're carrying just get it just stay here get a cryo dude Jamie would like that you want a cryo dude hang on yeah I was thinking about that one girl who died in Vegas cuz she was doing it without supervision was she how long was she in afore she did a different kind see there's two different kinds there's the kind that uses liquid nitrogen and then you stand in this liquid nitrogen and in that kind it's only from the neck down so your head is not being frozen right that's not as effective it's effective it definitely does something but doesn't do as much as the one where you're standing at 250 degrees below zero air that's the one that I go to that's cryo healthcare there in LA on La Cienega yeah and then they're about five miles away from here in Woodland Hills so you just getting like a chamber yes under wearing gloves yes you gotta wear these right you wear like Crocs on your feet something rubber and your feet like rubber clogs rather right because you're you're gonna wear socks socks go up to your ankles or up to your calves rather like because your skin can freeze like you can get frostbite like I know people that have been in there too long and they've got a little bit of burning sensation on there how long is too long the most I've ever done is 3 minutes and 40 seconds they don't let you do more than I think a minute and a half on your first one they won't want to make sure that you don't freak out you're not too sensitive and then you build your way up to 3 minutes as the max the only reason why I went further than that it's because there's a guy worked there and we were just trying to figure out what you can yeah if you save you you did it because you wanted to I wanted to see if you have court I could take did you do it I've done twice I think been two minutes Max's for me I felt like at full I felt like at four minutes I would have had real problems I was like I was on the door of real problems at 3 minutes and 40 seconds does your brain start do you feel stuff he likes is your head start getting fucked up it's it's it's hard to concentrate it's hard to stay cool like the whole the whole deal is just like stay chill cool it about Manuel we almost kill your body always give praise you you keep it together you don't want to freak out but then my legs started involuntary buckin they were doing this yeah that's your body saying this this isn't we got a yes not I was like okay so my rational brain was still like 30 percent operational maybe at that point maybe 40 percent you look you know thinking that you couldn't do math problems you're not thinking clear you could do math problems for the first 30 seconds and then you'd be like holy fuck holy fuck what if you just thought about one math problem over and over in your brain and circulated that shit until the end mm-hmm and you've you focused on it so hard then then when you started to forget how to do it then you know you're out then you can't do it anymore well one thing I do do is I do that wim HOF breathing method or I take these gigantic breaths and then I let out 20% and then I take another breath like as deep as I can get my let out 20% and I concentrate on doing that and time flies by that's what they do that's what those deep divers to write those guys they go to those don't they do that I think cuz they learn how to store breath know what they do we were seeing those videos with those guys they dive like you know and those dive tanks that they have set up but the way they do it it looks like they take in tons of breath they let a little bit they keep taking it in as if they're like just storing it in there you know and the sacks and their lungs I would think that that's not just storing oxygen to that you'd be storing carbon dioxide right because you're not breathing it out yeah but they breathe it out a little bit at a time how the fuck do you convert oxygen to carbon dioxide I've always just just accepted that I know just a lot of thing the fact that air goes in why isn't air going out what the fuck is happening it's only going right there yeah like how does it turn into carbon dioxide a little dude it's just going in there and that comes right like that's it then second I converted Yeah right now that's ridiculous you're a big Machir conversion machine that's what we all are yeah big conversation carbon dioxide conversion machines you learned that kind of stuff like of how how quickly things happen when like like my college roommate had gout you know I mean we're like blood turns around a friend Jeff and that that's crazy so like it's like your fingers or your hand anything where blood has like a long feet yeah feet it's usually legs and feet yeah and I never understood until I looked it up when he had it and I was like how do you get gout and everything online is like 50 plus is at risk you know like high blood pressure music he was 20 years old Jesus shouldn't add it you know they call it Kings disease yeah because they were fat and ate and drank all day he's drink more and their feet Walden yeah you know fucking awesome that it especially everybody else is starving like please sir yeah let me rest my swollen dead feet on your head I've been watching Vikings I get into that show Vikings I mean I've never seen you know pretty goddamn good shit good I was super skeptical people tell me was good I was like it's on regular TV how the fuck can it be any was on it was on History Channel oh yeah which is another one it's not a History Channel but it's a but it's a drama how the fuck it's based on historical facts apparently right Ragnar Ragnar lothbrok that's his name but it's fucking bad-ass show but one of the thing that's crazy about the show is you really stop to think well this is really how it worked like how Kings treated regular people totally they really got away with that and all they were was just a regular guy I didn't have superpowers and everybody would just bow down to him sire and they would kiss the Rings and they would just let them do whatever the fuck they wanted yeah it's so weird fear of death dude but it's crazy that even the army would listen to this guy like that anybody would listen occasionally he's weirder that the army listened to one dude occasionally they would go fuck you and they'd kill the guy and then a new guy would rise that's what we should be doing we should do all that shit now dude did you see the video of Trump talking about taxes do what he says I can check it out what guys say yeah I'm gonna charge you 25% it's I sent it out yesterday fucking amazing that that's the price there's two parts of me man there's one part of me that loves this oh do I love one part of me that's good it's great material there's so many fakes and phonies and ridiculous career politicians that have to watch this guy say listen motherfuckers you're gonna pay 25 percent taxes and everybody goes crazy and players yeah because like they can't believe he's really saying it but it's this stuff that they would say too if they didn't have any reservations well it's maybe but I think it'll just like that let's play it because it's hilarious 25% tax I could have one man say weight reduction 25% and I could say another listen you motherfuckers I'm telling you man look I'm not in favor of the wall I'm Pro immigration I'm not a favor these ice busts and all that jazz but shit like that one's me over I said the guy is the fucking president and he said listen you motherfuckers you gonna pay 25 percent taxes he says it years before the campaign he doesn't say how many but what well you know what I was talking about on stage I'm so tired of being yelled at by like online about people hate him like listen I'm not a huge fan of them either but so many people are like I hate him I hate him I hate him that now I kind of like him like you know enough people say shit like fuck you I'm so tired of you telling me your opinion it's all the same to also what annoys me is when someone goes fucking moron that's like that's it that's all that's what you did you you you put like that's not doing anything by going hey Trump shook my dick all right dude well you got him here's my take on that if it's that if it's fucking moron you're not even supposed to listen that's supposed to not even go in I know cuz it's not if this is not effective communication so if you engage that guy don't I just completely waste your time even if you get upset it you're completely wasting your time I wipe it away I bet I see it now I'm like oh come on this the work the one that gets me is Nazi fucking Nazi Nazi yeah he's a Nazi and you're a Nazi fascist they throw these words around they really don't even know what the fuck they're saying like if you really think that everybody looks likes Trump is a Nazi you're missing that's insane you're missing a giant point you're fucking up everything you're ruining this conversation right you're right about a lot of the shit he does wrong but as soon as you say he's a Nazi right and that there's not seen everyone's a Nazi well then when real Nazis come around you're gonna better have a better name new yeah yeah you can't the cool Nazis do you can't fucking take the word Nazi and apply it to shit that's not Nazis that's dangerous like they say the Pacific word like cost him on a murderer why'd you call him a murderer because he yelled an insult at that man okay that's not a murderer right but you can't do that the same thing we calling someone a Nazi that's not an onsen he might be a moron he might be a fool he might be into Trump just because he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact there's a white guy in office but that doesn't mean he's a Nazi it's also like the the biggest problem that I have is like you're it's still illegal to be an asshole it's not illegal to be a dick right if someone someone said something you don't like where it's not against the law right so like this idea of you tagging someone like they're the biggest criminal in the world because they said something you don't like it's crazy to me like people are allowed to not fucking think what you think is right right right and they're trying to redefine what's acceptable by calling words violence like right they're calling saying things hate speech is real right I don't know though see it's funny that's real if you say something like fuck the Jews I hate all Jews Jews should die that's hate speech okay it's to me it's this if you said if a guy said fuck the Jews I disagree with what he says well you should say how do you fuck them you fuck up Jenny asked if I run the mouth fuck come on G go go around the world that chapter no listen that person that person what hate speech to me is like it's just a big huge term that can encompass so many things I don't really know what it is right does it incite violence if I said fuck the Jews does that incite violence it shouldn't no that's just that if I said fuck your shirt it only said I didn't incite you to tear a shirt I was pretty close as soon as you the way you said shirt I was like yeah liddie a shirt revolution you have fuck your fucking shirt fucking shirt bro seriously bro you sure way fuck the Jews works is if someone also thinks fuck the Jews and then you like find like-minded shitheads but that's gonna happen no matter what but it's not gonna have if you don't say it then so the idea is like can you suppress it here's a with stopping hate speech is like who's to decide because they're pushing the boundary with hate speech so far and right like if you call a trans woman a man that's hate speech like that there's it's Nina what if that's just an accident yeah it's still accidental hate speech why that's crazy because we live in a new world no see I can't accept that you don't if you do it out of malice like if you're if someone's like hey I'm Margaret and that guy goes no no I'm not gonna call you that they're that then that's them being proactively prejudiced right them being a dick they're being an asshole but some people are of the opinion that this is all nonsense nothing taking their point but I do want to play devil's advocate because I've had conversations that people who are pretty intelligent people that say this is all nonsense and then this trans stuff and this is this is a trendy thing that people are really getting into in summer or really distort their perceptions of reality is really distorted and they're being talked into this because it's a thing that a lot of people are doing it and so they're getting and I'm I hear that I go wow I don't know if I believe that people are willing to transition to another sex because they're confused that's a big leap it's a giant a sleep but here's the other leap the leap is you telling someone whether or not they feel a certain way and then the other leap here's the other leap what do you give a fuck yeah you know if Bruce Jenner wants to become Caitlyn Jenner I'll call her Caitlyn yeah I don't care but if she thinks I'm gonna stop making fun of her she's out of her fucking saying okay that's what but that's what I mean so you should be allowed to just you should be allowed to mock at a freedom that you would anyway every six-foot-three person with size-14 high heels gets mocked just let's round the clock anybody would get made fun of for any of that in any other way yes if you used to be a girl or used to be a dude and now you're a girl someone's gonna make fun of you and that's just the price you pay for being a person but people make fun of everyone for everything everything you have red hair never it is my whole life your whole life but what I can't start a group against it being like people it's enough of this enough no just it is what it is everyone has these flaws the kicker gin ginger day yeah I wasn't cool no but no but you know what's so funny about that those guys are so subversive what they're doing is showing how quickly people jump onto things and go yeah fucking strong Kamal so they're so smart I love that episode because it was like that could be a real and that's how dumb people are people in the real world have told me been like dude I wonder where to kick her ginger day is they but that's real to them mm-hm but that's that's by the way I played I played golf with a buddy at the Country Club that Caitlyn Jenner belongs to my first question does does she hit from the women seats of the men's tees and the guy was me goes she hits from the women's tees I'm like bull see that's bullshit is it bullshit yeah dude because you you're a fucking Olympian you you were usually it's the difference because you still use the men's tees I mean like distance 30 40 yards yeah ah yeah that's like doing those push-ups on your knees bullshit yeah but wait a minute he used a she what she had she has man structured muscle and then go away that's all gone no with no muscle there's no muscle well she's still pretty fucking jack not really man no no I'm gonna be honest I don't think she works out at all and she's old already so it's not on your body has I still say you go back to the men's tees but she still has a dick right nope she had the operation cut it off it's Hollow is it gone yes no you okay now you get women's tees the dick was there you got to go you got to go back to the black yeah there's a lot of fence riders out there in the trans world dude you got a cup you got a comer go that's another thing they're saying this is in this I don't agree with this is they're saying that if you are a person who is male and likes women if you are unwilling to date a trans woman it's because you are transphobic bigoted including if that trans woman still has meanness that is that's of no regard you know the you know the funny thing of all this is I'm just so happy to just be a cisgender like a fucking I'm so not have to worry about it I don't have to worry about it no one's gonna call me a bigot for not liking a sub-sect of a kind of a thing that I like I just like a well I like women that's all I know I like that so from now they'll come around to you soon they're gonna get like they got Bruno Mars he didn't see it coming come on that was that what do they write in black culture cultural appropriation you see how many people came to his rescue down a bunch of people are like that's bullshit he's a musician course yes what has he done now is he appropriating black culture made zinging awesome made good music yeah that's all he did that billionaire song is a wonderful song he made some fucking great songs it's bullshit to think that people now can stab at anything that you're like now you're just trying to cause a stir they try they take swings and sometimes don't work like remember they were trying to block bossy stop oh yeah that's right shot down so fast and he didn't say anything back good for him that's my favorite shit yeah that's kind of like you know how like Samsung and all these other phone companies they make ads about iPhones you know other all their ads are based on fuck iPhones and Apple never makes a response of course that's the coolest movies to be like whatever man yeah that Samsung ad is stupid that's how you know when they walk past the people wait in line I've always had those Samsung's always been like hey hey hey hey hey it's like the annoying little brother and you're like oh dude get the fuck out of here we're just do your own thing they make the best second best phones set gear the second best phone in the world make the best second best fasces number one yeah at making the number two found sort of the Google phone is probably better I think the Samsung probably sells what you got here what about this ad that was the iMac I'm a Mac yeah those were so dumb but those are in the 90s man yes I'm saying I'm saying currently they don't run any ads like that's the guy from drag me to hell right no was the movie he wasn't him Justin long what was that movie who's in he was in a great fucking horror movie like a real classic can't be horror movie he was in Kevin Smith's one no no no no he was in tusk right but that's not what I'm talking about it was one that he was in put up pull back up with that right though that is funny I forgot about those ads that's how long ago that I've been using Windows 2 right lately I use Windows 10 it's fucking great there's nothing wrong with it like Windows 10 is in my opinion just as good narrowed pretty boy oh they're arguing with each other Mac versus PC Windows 10 is just as good as as Mac oh yeah in terms of light it's a little different but it doesn't crash I'm not having any problems with it it works great but I'm not even gonna lie I'm not gonna be when these people you know like like like like Jim is a fucking tech genius he knows wizard yeah he's a genius I when someone when someone says the excuse of like why do you have a mac and someone goes well dude it's great for the Arts and it does this and this I don't even lie I go do times pull up for screamers cheaper school he's in that but there was another one there wasn't that was a good one that was a good one fuck you the guy who drove the old truck the main devil guy with the wings that drove the old truck loved it it probably made 18 bucks was probably just eighteen what's the other movie but you're thinking a die-hard no no no he was in C go to his you know that you don't have no the restaurant movie was pretty funny turning good was gonna be he was definitely in a horror movie like recently no no just go to the stop looking at images you're like a little kid with your fucking Instagram you can't look at like real words whose words picture of the movie was in what is that right there in there what's that truck what does that say try confusing him with somebody else yeah you gotta be it was like a some hell movie where like he he had to go to hell I feel like drag me to hell is a movie about a chick that was like Murder two came back to life yeah that's a great that's the story that's a great story I think that's what it was I never saw it in that guy he's the boyfriend he is he's in that one too well maybe that's the one you're talking no that was just a year ago let me see what it looks like okay that is it that is it what the fuck I never saw okay that's that is it it's um it was like a a witch yep that's it Clayton Clayton there was another movie that sounded like drag me to hell what is that is that guy shoving his fist in her throat I was a good movie that was a good stupid movie that dragged me to hell movie that is what the name of it was I was right I was right but I was confused there's a one with a woman like there's a woman on the cover that looks like she's like a silhouette and she's screaming it's something about drag maybe drag you to hell so what it is drag me to hell it's another one movie same movie yeah but that's not it you just name that you're like the woman's scream but that's not that that's not the same cover perfect shoe houses in the back that's her that's not it no there was another one I might I might have the name completely wrong for the movie but it was about a woman see this is hard because I didn't actually watch it but it's about a woman who got killed and she came back and got the people got her I don't know like High Plains Drifter remember that cleaning squid oh yes he was killed yeah came back to life and fucked everybody up in the town yeah that's good Western horror oh yeah Western horror right but a sneaky Western horror movie like you don't really exactly know what that's gone where's no there's not a Western horror anymore do they do this shit like that was the last Western horror there was a Western UFO movie Cowboys and Aliens remember that yeah but that piece of shit I guess you know what you could call now like you could do Western like No Country for Old Men could be like a Western that was a horror movie that guy was a monster yeah no way ANOVA tour of it's a like more like terror yeah terror yeah like a tear yeah and that guy was a monster yeah I mean might as well been fucking awesome dude is that fucking actor what is that gentleman's name with the crazy hair just the mop on his head what come on what's wrong with me sorry what movie No Country for Old Men Javier Bardem pardon yeah yeah it's so good he's a beast like you really believe that guy with murder people well you know when you look in some actors eyes and you're like something real so inside that he has that thing where you like oh fuck you know some actors just are like now they just playing a character yeah when they don't have it it drives me nuts no no that guy look at that shit look at this fuck look juban on his eyes too movie is this from it's not a new movie I don't know oh Jesus Christ he looks exactly like him did he gain a bunch of weight for that he's always been kind of a thick dude though but look at the picture of him above on the blue shirt right above that yeah oh sure he's kind of a thick dude nah I'm not like that pablo picture that pablo picture looks he's about 70 pounds head look at that look at how fucked is psycho he was a good psycho that movie's a fucked up movie cuz he just ends yeah that's when she for old man like just what sometimes bad guys get away fuck off what Coen Brothers Coen Brothers wasn't it he was Frankenstein knew Franken's a new frankenstone all the new monster movies he's got bleached blond hair it's gay Frankenstein that's what happens a guy dies on the operating table getting his cheeks done gay freaking side was I okay back to suck your deck hood go to the picture above that she's got to change the two dicks in his neck instead of bolts a tan suit above it right there a tan suit right there yeah look at that that's the gay Frankenstein yeah is he killing you oh he's a Bond villain that's right he was about yeah it was that dead dudes a beast eyeful but the problem with a guy like that is every movie that he does that's goofy takes away from the great way you see him if you see him in a movie like this right like every movie like No Country for Old Men is so 100% legit yeah that if he does a Bond movie he's in some stupid karate scene where he's gonna like throw sidekicks the guy kicks him in the balls and he bends over the guy uppercut something it looks corny shit it takes away but there's like only so many actors I got away like Daniel day-lewis is like the only dude that only did shit he wanted to do yeah almost everybody else does things where you're like why did you do that right I mean they all like they all have to well nobody fucked it harder than De Niro De Niro dude did some of the greatest movies of all time and possibly the worst movies and it's done toilet water yeah just mostly toilet water ever since did you see did did the Al Pacino paternal thing come out yet when does that come out have you seen that pregame show Peter no yes dude oh look at the picture he looks identical I mean it's fucking creepy one next month one next we're gonna show that Joe Paterno knew those kids are getting molested come on dude of course of course he look at that he looks added looking identical to everybody knew the guy was a pervert he was running a fucking children's charity where he's taking care of kids I don't want to sound like one of those guys but I don't give a shit I remember when he got caught when it when it can when it came out I said to a bunch of people he's gonna die soon within like a month he'll die for sure and sure enough he died shortly thereafter this whole thing yeah because I knew was gonna kill him Oh God that Sandusky you know so in this scene right here in the trailer he's saying his wife is like his wife goes well you know he was he was with so-and-so their kids names and he goes he was with so-and-so like his own kids and then it hits him that he's like he was watching them so then it hits him like me oh fuck maybe he know if he fucked my kiss it's insane what the fuck man that wasn't that long ago now when was that that Sandusky arrests 12 2012 see shake probably 2013 easy thing is they've already gotten rid of their all their sanctions and whatnot Penn State's already back all their penalties and whatnot well no no I'll tell you what the real college money baby crazy thing is the original investigator into Sandusky turned up murdered his uh they found his laptop with a like a destroyed harddrive and I think they never found his body I think he I think he fucking vanished trial was in two thousand twelve twelve thousand twelve okay so that was a trial so he's arrested in 2011 right find the guy who is the original investigator who turned out missing either turned up missing or murdered in his laptop was found with a destroyed harddrive like someone clearly got a hold of this guy that he be fuckin iced him because he was gonna destroy Penn State I mean he was going to take down this he disembarked a billion-dollar industry what happens to pay for car Wow soon as you get the story scroll make it larger there so I could read with my old eyes ten years ago prosecutor in Centre County Pennsylvania took the day off work in vanish since then the case of rhaegar car has been one of the most intriguing and I don't know if I'm saying his name right GRI CA are Chris Carter Carter Sartre car noir yeah is one of the most intriguing talked about missing-persons stories in the country investigators have taken dives at the bottom of lakes dug up a grave chased more than three hundred reported sightings from Arizona in North Carolina dropped fliers all over Slovenia consulted a psychic interviewed a member of Hells Angels and enlisted NASA technology but no one's been able to find the veteran discs district attorney who was 59 he disappeared he went missing that Friday morning April 15 2005 left behind a live-in girlfriend beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast approaching retirement Oh where the problem was yeah he drove a red Mini Cooper well that was just make people kill himself evidence goes it's a ball the police have the best lead they got was a sighting of a woman who has not been identified ba-ba-ba-ba-ba but let's listen find out the the conspiracy because the spear see was that he was a part of the Sandusky investigation prevailing this is suicide D did you google Sandusky there it is okay 2011 when Penn State Coordinator Jerry Sandusky got arrested in charge of sexually abusing boys revealed that jerk are who decided not to charge Sandusky when his first victim came forward in 1988 Drakkar cited a lack of evidence the intrigue already simmering in the jacquards case exploded sluice desperately trying to find a link between the two cases but investigators said there's no evidence that your car's appearence disappearance had anything to do with Sandusky crimes hmm that's not what I've read in another story it's this guy saying I don't think it was a great stretch he was one of those guys with very strong sense of justice and professional discipline in light of what evolved and came to be disclosed I speak as a forensic pathologist who's done some so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point it's pure conjecture not state-centered factual knowledge hold on a second go back up scope stop scrolling it says the forensic pathologist said he considered writing a book about your car his ties to the Sandusky case and whether or not it led to suicide so he said it's not enough evidence you'd have found him when people kill themselves they want to be found that's why they killed himself and sometimes most of the time sometimes they just go in the woods and blow their brains out but find him in the fucking woods you don't you don't he got rid of all that you don't mean it here in the woods every year thousands and then in North America but a guy this prominent in his like in his work and in his life that has like that many he's got too many trails do you know I mean mini-cooper that was in that fucking thing he's like I got a backpack and a bullet and I'm just gonna fucking hike deep enough to use all my water sixteen hundred people went missing from our public lands without a tree but a lot of those people are hiking and shit that's in every year okay I'm wrong that's like ever I've been reading people have been getting messages about this that this happens a lot right but was it but that one was saying sixteen hundred people are missing you know what I'm getting here's where I'm getting my if how many people kill themselves outside getting my information from Bobcat Goldthwait's movie about Bigfoot this is realize where I'm getting my numbers from because he has a movie called Willow Creek it's all about Bigfoot sighs what people are cooped up with a growing number of missing persons international parks yeah but a lot of these people go fucking hiking they don't go to kill themselves that's just people being foolish well here's the thing man you don't have buddy of mine found a skull when he was elk hunting human skull Wow elk how long does that has to be dead for to be fucking deteriorated like that it was me it was deteriorated like at first of all animals would get to it almost immediately they smell that birds come down they start breaking it apart coyotes find it everything far to be cleaned down as a skull that's gotta be a long time quick really yeah you'd be surprised Wow they'll clean you down to nothing in a couple of days holy shit you'd be down to bones and days like that happens all its if there's a population of animals that are scavengers that are near your body dude a buddy of mine shot a deer okay and it wasn't the best shot in the world so he decided to let the deer bed down to die like sometimes you'll hit the deer like in one lung or something like that it wasn't the best shot right and the deer bent down and it was dark it was getting dark like he shot at last light where you're legally allowed shoot so they said we're gonna come back in the morning because it's 30 degrees outside the meat would be fine they go back in the morning there's nothing like on the coyotes ate everything except the fucking head like I mean everything holy Sh like he didn't get any of the rib meat all the organs were gone the legs were gone chewed down to the bone he said he'd never seen anything like it 300 pound mule deer it's a big Carmel gone he said he saw like six or seven coyotes that day so he knew that coyotes were in the area yeah but you just take a chance you just like you could do one of two things either you bump the animal which means you you go and it gets filled up with adrenaline because it knows you're coming close to it and then it runs and then they could run for a mile before they expire or you just let it bed down there peacefully it'll just lay down and die so that's what it's was just let it lay down and die but the Coyotes got to it fuck dude 300 pound animal just seven eight coyotes whatever it was that did it maybe they called maybe other ones came from fucking half a mile away I mean yo there's this deer this guy left there's a fucking fresh deer it's my it's Mike from the West woods yeah I think he was in an area with no wolves so I think it was just all coyotes just coyotes the Coyotes out here in LA are so small they're like little tiny house dogs they're not weird man he had a little like bitch frail weird like where I golf up in the mountain up there we there all the time yeah and they sit and they wait for you to pass before they can like cross you know through the fairway and something but they're like little house dogs they're like 15 pound house dog we are lucky those things are here this is this is the truth because totally they weren't here there'd be rats everywhere yeah they eat every - those motherfuckers keep the rats in check they keep the rabbits in check there's a system there's a ecological system and it makes us uncomfortable because we don't like to think about our own mortality and something that wants to eat us right but I like coyotes I like them I had a chance to kill a coyote they killed one of my chickens but I'm pretty sure that she had a pretty sure she had puppies or Cubs I guess they were Cubs yeah yeah I'm pretty sure she had that chicken could have had it coming - you know didn't could have run its miles bombed to go down chicken you have it coming my daughter kids and I'm gonna eat you my daughter's got rabbits oh we're gonna take care of it you're not gonna take care of it you're gonna play with those things twice and then you're gonna leave them alone no no we're gonna take care of it of course they don't take care of it yeah give a fuck about those rabbits do they have a dog right dog his belly kisses he runs around circles you throw something he chases it it's way better rabbit nothing grab it just sit there you go near it bite your finger oh you can't throw that fucking thing but anyway the rabbit they live in the chicken coop it's big-ass chicken coop and they follow the chickens around and today one of the rabbits was trying to eat the other chicken's ass and so just falling around literally with this little rabbit face buried in this chickens ass hole and just this chickens trying to get away kind of liking it the chickens like this just bouncing around I mean nose to asshole all around the entire chicken cage for like five minutes it was so ridiculous there's a subcategory on pornhub for that there's got to be chicken rabid porno there probably yeah it's might probably animate though yes yes it's like animes subcategories at porn dude some of the animation that I stumble upon is so fucking and like the tentacle stuff is the stuff that freaks me out the most it's weird people love people I don't know who likes watching a girl get fucked by like 19 tentacles like jamming her eyeballs her mouth in her butthole and her ears and shit people jerking off to that started off with with Japanese for some reason somebody gave me an explanation why Japanese dudes like that yeah I think the explanation is the Japanese porn you're not allowed to show insertion iteration yeah yeah it blurs you can't even show cartoon dicks going into vaginas but you can show tentacles shit that makes sense so the fact that tentacles look remotely similar to dicks you've decided to just go with tentacles and your mouth and spits flying out of your mouth and and they can't show jizz they can do but they can show tentacle juice you know what they can show where the jizz is all pixelated like you can see the jizz through a prism dancing jizz pixelation you can't see the actual like HD 4k jizz no that would be too much for cages when I was a kid you couldn't have hard-ons in porn magazines they didn't have hard-ons all the dudes had to have like limp dicks what it was a law it was a federal law you better put that you better get that dick serious like these guys had half our dicks they were always like half hard and it was so confusing cuz you'd be a little kid you dick would be like a fucking total what's wrong with mine and you'd be so horny and you'd be looking at this magazine like this guy's right there and he's not even horny he's right next and he's like barely interested but they had to have good limp dicks that's the trick right see that's what's fun inside lip you couldn't have a mushroom Kaplan I'm a girl I'm a grower not a shower yeah you'd have to have a real hog like a heavy one I'm nice when I'm sick but when I'm soft I can't be in the magazine so I had a bit about it before that the girl would be like her mouth would be open lipstick her lips purse and her tongue hanging out and the dude would have his limp dick rested on her back like a drowning victim he pulled from a lake is this you just take the time to get a hard-on before we took these pictures and that's so whether that's a law that's how fucking that's how crazy standards and practices a certain companies are as I listen will let you show penises but they can't be filled with blood I don't think it's standards and practices I think it was a federal law but why would will be the difference if she in previous tapes once VHS tapes came along then people got to watch actual hard porno in there it was like a loophole there was a loophole that exists at night because the pornographic magazines they weren't allowed to show insertion and they weren't allowed to show erections so there was this it was his weird and was another tightening they couldn't show the lips of a vagina they had to be covered up by like hair right it was something like that like they couldn't show Hustler always did though I think well they were the first one to do it Playboy never did I know I always had Bush Playboy would have like bear you'd barely see Bush you know you'd see like a shadow of a bush like girls looking pretty right it was like I want you piss shit on this guy's chest page one it was a different thing you know but when when we would find these magazines like in the woods by the way always in the woods yeah yeah yeah I have a whole bit that's based on a true story about finding and now what Larry Flynt's like trials are kind of about I think so I think some of them were about that yeah but see obscenity is one of those weird things and I know we attributed to Vincent Scalia but people corrected me judge Scalia is that his name it's not him that's Thalia Scalia yeah it's not him that said this it's another guy who said this I don't know what pornography is by know when I see it oh yeah yeah it was that but there's another version of that too that's like I don't know what Blanc is but I know when I see it yeah it's a few probably probably a few of those that erroneously attributed to people but there's a guy named max hardcore do you remember that guy with a porn actor yeah yeah that guy went to jail for obscenity and he did hard time and he had some hard to watch stuff like he had stumps some stuff you like wait a minute what like I found out about it cuz people weren't like hey man this is the great stuff to jerk off to right they were like what gotta watch this what in the fuck is this right this guy used a speculum to open this girl's asshole up I'm interested he pissed in her asshole and then put a straw and made her drink his piss out of her own asshole I got to get out of here for a second I gotta go finish up but it was like there was a lot of like really really fucked up there's a website that basis do you know II fucked do you ever heard of that mmm-hmm that's all they do it's fucked up crazy like there's nothing sexual about it's just it's just like defacing some but it's just fucked yeah but the point is that this guy went to jail for that like nobody else sorry Flynn I almost did primed to battle obscenity charges in Connecticut and Cincinnati rather that's in 1998 25 years in prison Wow that's incredible porn magnate house or publisher their place well that's crazy oh wait a minute chart in a same locale where a judge and jury sentenced him to 25 years in prison more than 20 years ago he did so he did he actually go to jail time yeah Wow yeah and he was living in Columbus from from and he set up his big house which he from what I heard he had planned on making it like a Playboy Mansion type place and it was right next door to the Columbus school for girls and I think that caused some of the first problems for him well he was just prospects that's just smart that's a smart real estate yeah it's a good place just setting up shop just learning the territory location location location yeah if you're a coyote you know where the cats live right yeah that's like perverts I get in the selling ice cream to kids it was like you can't blame him that's very intuitive well it's like people think of that and they dismiss that that's not a big deal like the Larry House the Larry Flynt hustler think that's a very big deal yeah it's a very big deal they were trying to push this guy in jail for something that people enjoy buying yeah people bought it yeah they liked it then went for you got hustler yeah what do you know guys get its hand in his pants playing pocket pool like they like it they want to buy his product and you're like no you can't like it what the fuck it's it's my favorite thing in the world you can't tell me what I had yeah I mean there was this wasn't that long ago man think about that 98 that's 20 raisi that's crazy 20 years ago I almost went to jail I remember going with my dad to the movie rental place by his house and I'd wanted like those back rooms no yeah you know I mean saloon yeah and as like a kid we might have to be like where you going I was like I look at a zoo section over here and then he'd be on the other side and he tried to like sneak in that take like a peep at even like the boxes and then they got smart so they put covers over the boxes and like move a thing back to see what the box was well the thing the weird feeling was when you would go through those beads and you would be in that room with those other perverts it's like super uncomfortable to each other we're all gonna be doing the same thing in 20 minutes one time I went to an actual porn store well it was like a hardcore store I was like xxx videos yeah like a shop and shop like they sold dildos and videos right and that's all they sold that was their bit like let's stop pretending let's cut the shit cut it out I'm not gonna go to the back room of a mom-and-pop store which says adults-only no no this is like the whole store and you just felt so weird and the guy behind the counter is talking me like hey man what's up like hi talk to me no I'm uncomfortable that you guys have sexual urges you're got you guys are all creeps not me I'm different that's why I have to every guy in there yeah I'm not like these guys he's fucking the other guys in there but that's all when they try to talk to I went to there there's one here and there's one in West Hollywood that's like a sex store and the guy was like being really friendly and he's okay but so what's going on it's like you know what's going on dude it's this isn't target I'm not maybe here for a vacuum or greeting cards yeah we're not gonna fly I'm here for no shit I'm here for weird porno shit just let me get the thing it's not making I feel we should tackle you're gonna tell me about the best spots now these bombers are pretty good man but those dildos will do the trick tell you what if you just want to take the drive Sacramento the fucking salmon fishing is off the chain anyway 42 bucks for this anal bead here you go what we sold bait and tackle and anal beats that bigger that's fucking the place to be called like the fuck so I opened up this shop dude it's called fishing and fucking totally work totally work but the problem is nobody buys things from a store anymore you can just now order a BAM as a fucking dildo online you get it shipped to your house and one day yeah that was on prime prime

that though it's real is it real 100% you're so funny how real is that well how many people have micropenises four we think it's a real issue guys have like one-inch dicks I think it's a real issue an inch when it's filled with blood Rock our heart that's an inch rock-hard you got this that's the that's their penis hold dick not even my full flow your throw fingers big just too big because a lot of guys are seeing this right now and going my dick is that big jon said the girls don't care about toys bro it's not that's not that's not what I'm after they say two guys with little dicks they go it's fine I love it I'd like it here I don't care really so a minute you're saying this is a man that the half of that that's a man's penis girls have no problem mocking it they would just mock it their marketing front their friends in front of you like guys with little dicks the size well cuz you can't retort you can't be like a new pussy's big but if a guy did talk like that he would be a monster like a guy was talking about a giant pussy yo dude I had a breakup with her my balls would fall in I've been fucking I'd be strapping a 2x4 to my ass now see I was laughing from getting sucked into the void for question man's life for the micro penis reveals about only 0.6 percent of the population see it's enough that's nothing that's dude that's if you have a hundred people that means what how many people's are less than one not even one no yeah point six it's 200 ppm one to put to one point two yeah that's a lot 200 people six out of it so if you're at the Comedy Store six out of a thousand that's right if you're at the Comedy Store there's two people in the room on a full house on Saturday night that of my one guy has a micro deck well you got to think it's 5050 men women so one guy in that room was a micro dick so if you make a joke about a Michael Jack one guys like but the joke before he loved so much he's still laughing but in his head he's like no don't you were great when you're shitting on giant pussies this guy's the best I love the major pussy joke they're too big too big and they are too big wait perfect if when I have to urinate it's there for me but that's crazy to think if a girl dates a guy with the micro penis and she just sticks around cuz she's like ma'am he's a good dude well um I know a lady who had a few chillin she had 40 chillin with a microp decided no no with a regular penis guy he's a handsome fellow I'm sure is quite a sturdy cock product ax handle hefty he looks like he's a Viking but anyway those kids had blown a hole through the old carport and so she decided to get everything all stitched up she said it was the most painful thing that she had ever done totally more painful even than childbirth because they go in there and cut I'll say that again cut and then they stitch that bitch up to like a finger gets broken when you put it in there it's like tighter than anal and unbelievably painful and I can't even strap yourself in numb what numb numb it goes numb because like you ever have surgery when they cut all those nerves it's a nerve damage yeah like my knee I had a ACL reconstruction on one of my knees with what's called a patellar tendon graft they open you up they take a big like 4-inch slice they open you up and they take a piece your patellar tendon and screw all these things and stitch it back up that whole area I had that thing done in like fuck 1994 it's still numb like my knees numb none of the nerves have repaired no not over where the incision is it's touching it right now I literally it

testing you for shit and they fucking shove up - oh my god dude that's a pain that I never want to feel ever again well I just would assume that they would have figured out a way to fix dick I think they think that's funny I think they're just like fuck them I don't think there's anything they can do definitely around prisoner crispers gonna come around and that's gonna fucking you know what CRISPR is this Jeannette this is new tool that they have to alter genes and alter DNA where you can like pick baby shit you're gonna be able to pick baby shit for sure that's a lie that's a hundred

his biceps and his shoulders I'm like the guy's jacked there's no leg strength there but he's got zero in his legs which means his mind is weak that's what it means his mind is weak he wants everybody to think he's strong but he's not doing the real hard work nobody gives a fuck if you're doing squat you don't nobody notices right if you do push-ups and you do bench press and your fucking tits pop out everybody sees it watch this dog shit you ain't even gonna believe this this doesn't even seem real look at this this dog flies I think that's a Belgian Malinois flies whole just legalize and then they have them land on a cushion which is pretty sweet listen he jumps off that guy's shoulders I'm saying the guy's shoulders but that's got to be 20 really jumps I mean it's at least 15 he's at least 15 feet in the air what's even cooler is he's flying the it send it official on Instagram want all one word send it official that's one of them Instagram page that has a bunch of crazy shit on

fucking sand it have you seen hold this beer on Twitter you're seeing that called my beer yeah yes I think it's hold this be able to hold this is the actual Twitter account but it says hold my beer is the name of it I write that one is that's a hole my bigger can't go wrong with that one no that's stuffs hilarious if you can deal with it if you can deal with it because sometimes you're gonna watch people that are gonna get absolute brain dam yeah but I love it it's not me there's one where a dude is standing on a hill and a bale of hay is coming towards them and this bale of hay looks like in my way six seven hundred pounds right and it's huge he's taken he jumps up into the air like he's trying to get over it and he doesn't make it and he goes fucking flying and he got hit by a bus I love that shit I mean the dude goes if you ever have seen a bait one of those big-ass yes circle bigger than this table a huge those are so fucking hairy than a truck tire yes they're so heavy and this dumb fuck thought he was gonna jump over it my favorite is uh mostly overestimating how well they come on dude this again I mean the fact ezel I this he's like he's not paralyzed look at this boom I mean he did a full flip through the air that fucking thing is so heavy you there's no way you would pick that up you know my favorite is the medicine balls when people bump them you know and they would be able do medicine ball challenge where they run at each other no well you've never seen that they'll both grab a medicine ball run each other full speed and jump and whoever gets hit the furthest but sometimes people do with their kids and like a dad he's just fucking her you see a kid go flying 30 feet in the road Jesus Christ oh that's my favorite shit I love there's one on there that's like failarmy or FAIL Blog or something and they show the same kind of fucking stuff where people just have this crazy idea of what they would do to get away from things that other people aren't doing totally fucking sidestep sidestep that was it that I would jump over it that's always been an inside joke in MMA forums about sidestepping that if someone is coming after me I just fucking side side up man I just sidestep broke most people just don't know what to do they stand there freeze I sidestep get out of the way like I got it planned out people are gonna swarm you swarm you like a zombie try to bite your face like wait which sidestepping them dude sidestep sidestep them all but people think they could do this if their fucking bull was coming after me I just step aside range Matadors are faggots with total fucking poncho I'll use your uh we'll use your fake martial arts videos those guys doesn't mind fucking - doesn't my favorite I resist putting those videos up because there's so many of they get sent to me they're so funny I can't keep putting them up the guy there's like a wind book technique it's like with his breath is like comes the other guy great page on Instagram Mick dojo is it McDo Joe or McDo Joe life I forget which one it is we told you a life wait a Mick dodge Oh Mick dojo they call mcdale like a dojo is a martial arts school nick dojos like a mall martial arts school that's what we would call like cheesy shitty martial art schools mcdo Joe watch this guy watch this guy go full screen on this one this one's fucking preposterous the guy comes down with a sword and he uses his power and the guy goes flying I buy any of this I buy every second of old Japanese guy i buy this goofy white guys who would have been the guys in Boyle Heights they were saying we're here for your community we love you get out get out we don't want you they would be the same guys these old dorky liberal guys who probably call themselves feminists and they just flying through the air with our Aikido suits dude he is fucking this guy up he's fucking this dude he leads him around and then shoot him to the ground well you know as a feminist I'm more likely to get tossed around it's almost like a coordinated dance it's so silly they're all so silly what is that one next to it the guy with the karate outfit what is he gonna do it's not a girl or a guy oh my god he's doing flips on his head breaking the boards and then flipping onto his feet so he's crushing by the the blocks of stone with his head yep what does it sound like do you something oh my god he's doing it like like flipping one more yeah he did it if that ever comes up and you need to flip and land on someone's dick that guy's at Taekwondo outfit on that doesn't make any sense to me that's so weird what could those be made out of the shittiest rock known to man like if you pissed on it will probably break it can't be rock yeah it's it's some sort of shitty ass bitch ass concrete you got that bag of bitch-ass concrete we ordered hey man you got some bitch has a chance fuck people oh shit with my head this but there's a lot of people out there that buy into that stupid stuff man but my point about it is like there's a lot of people there buying anything that's probably the joint cults that's why people that's they fall into these ideas and they believe them wholeheartedly and then you know what do you know about all these new religious like - all the new cool religions where like the dudes are like remember I think I talked to you about it where like there's these new motivational speak speak churches where it's like that's all it is yeah I read about one recently that uses a friend of mine synagogue front where a friend of mine goes for his service he's Jewish where he him and his family go these people we'll rent it out like on some days right and they come down they have this rock and roll's versus rock-and-roll Church but the guys like this charismatic sort of half-assed Waco dude and they're all good-looking yes they like Koresh nice yeah that's like five or six of these yeah it is with varying degrees of bullshit a tude and they're all they're all Mitch they're super rich yeah tons of money man well especially if they can get like young really wealthy people good-looking kids yeah my friend went to one he was a huge like dude you have to see that he's like that women that were there were every one of them was gorgeous yeah my buddy had a personal assistant he was a producer of a TV show and he had a personal assistant and his personal assistant was she was nice but she was off like she was just it was there were some wires that would just yeah just weren't connecting right and she started going to this church like you would love it cuz it's not like a regular church like we just sing kinda sounds like all things we talk about real thing they give us a haircut life like okay you have to give them money like how's that work let's talk and then you give me money how are these services I give I'm not really big on services but we'll all get together and talk and this is great and then I like mansions I like the living imagine so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna regurgitated any robbins quotes and i'm gonna tell you about life and then a little bit Jesus I'm gonna throw some Jesus in there to see little sprinkle of Jesus ringlets Jesus we're not heavy Jesus you know we're like paleo ask but we also like spaghetti it's like it's okay well snack on it it's okay it's not spaghetti cheese saltines I'm gonna I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna lie can't say no I'm not willing to give up my salty nope you know I would go paleo if it wasn't for crackers yeah I like grits I like to put on bits every now and then I want to put on the Ritz what I like putting on the Ritz give me money yeah man there's a lot of lost people out there and then there's people to come along and then they capitalize on it on those lost people and then they figure out like oh there's a market and capitalizing on lost people and they ramp that shit up total oper you know what I find is the big who like makes now that now that like because I'm like buying all sorts of stuff for this puppy the cut this stuff I should have gotten into is I tricking people into needing pet stuff like if I could event a pet thing like what thing would you met let's match that one right now we can just see no started out in the front of fucking fish dish just put it out fishing and your dog toys right when you get to that register I'll tell you what that's when you're most susceptible to impulse buying that's a puppy toy or some shit puppy dildo I'll be great if the store was empty and all you had was stuff by the register cuz you're like they don't buy out there man they buy right here that's all we doing fucking fishing right the register it's a robot fuck doll for your dog nobody thought about it I've been thinking about this for 25 years it's a robot phone there I got these Japanese scientists involved we figured out the perfect height you don't have a dog can fuck it don't snip your dog man don't don't fucking don't neuter or spay tor nothing just tell you what can you rub my finger misconception is that a big dog can't fuck a little robot dog because again watch they'll get low so this is like you don't really need one that you can't sell after your dog dies man you got a dog dude you know ever since rusty died his robot fuck dogs just been sitting in the garage I've been whole but it's it's sad someone come on and comment if you bought one more humans and if I get justice for their use that is an issue when your dog tries to hump your kids like a very fucking problem yeah my my Mastiff has his humped people before you got to let one kid go you gotta go yeah you gotta sacrifice the one you like the least you think disturbing about 140 pound dog named Johnny Cash and wants to hump your leg you know he's a sweet dog but if he wasn't if he wasn't to be a real issue problem you're a real problem yeah what do you say hey hey cut the shit and look at you and go that's how you do it all the time this is what feels good to me it feels good to me and I'm doing it do you ever have moments when your dogs I've ever seen you like jerking off or having sex or anything like that out in front my dogs never or have sex in front of them no I doubt it I do it first day just let them know I've heard about people that are having to do it at all times and start to look in their feet time for that kind of shit yeah and then they come harder yeah and the girls like why'd you come so quick last time look at my feet right they'll probably bummer out the trunk with my balls like came like a wild cat wow he's got a bunch of dogs around like your feet sure people are doing that I mean that was been always been the old thing about peanut butter peanut butter peanut peanut butter on your pussy and dogs peeing putting your ball sack your dogs looking up the peanut but I mean like come on you have to be so fucking you have to be so out of options to make your dog lick your lick your nuts in your asshole go hire a human hire a human man's a lot of people that are really desperate you know like you think about it the human touch like touch from person is mandatory like people need it is a requirement like vitamin C and yeah it's just a requirement that your body needs but there's a lot of people that just don't get it yeah I never knew how how much a requirement was until when I first moved to LA when I first moved to LA I moved from LA from New York to LA I didn't know anyone out here didn't have any friends yeah and I was on this set and I'm doing this TV show and I was there for like a couple of weeks and I guess I hadn't hugged anybody or done touched anybody in a couple of weeks and this girl on a set gave me a hug just gave me a hug and it was like oh it was like I got filled up with like affection and love yeah that's it's real but it was it was the weirdest feat like I'd never experienced that before cuz you know I always had a girlfriend or always had friends there's always some sort of physical contact right but out here you were alone I was alone and then when this girl hugged me I was like and I remember never forgetting and I'm like wow that was a weird moment like that's a that's a physical requirement yeah like when that girl hugged me my body was like yes this is what we needed like whoa like when you're thirsty and you get a glass of water like hahaha that's what it was like when she hugged me and it wasn't even a sexual thing it was just a human affection yeah just well that's why that that's why they say kids I don't get touched when they're young getting like that don't get hugged or any affection they grow up so fucked up mentally the part of your brain doesn't develop that that that like needing that chemical react because the transfer of chemical skin-to-skin that's like such a big deal for the development your brain so when kids don't get it if fucking ruins them yeah they say that about babies in orphanages the babies and orphanages they don't get they don't get less they die yeah they can literally die from not being held that's a trip meanwhile animals just fucking put their kids out and like go go fuck out of here get to kick them out of their nest okay fuck face fuck no fly you ever seen those birds that fall off cliffs who showed us that was it Sturgill no I think I did last time I was here I think it was you yeah the birds that fall just to see if they can stay aloft the rocks and half of them died yeah because right before I came on I saw that class right yeah dude that was fucked up there's a lot of like dark shit in the in the animal community you think about the survival of these little beasts absurd I was just reading about how many deer every year freeze to death in Idaho don't ask me why but as I was reading it's thousands it's like sometimes these they lose thousands of animal and they ever tried to migrate somewhere else I made up those numbers might be hundreds it's like six it's a lot it's a lot they call it winter kill and when they have a hard winter like a real hard winter they lose hundreds and hundreds animals this dead frozen to death imagine living went in a place where you barely make it like cryogenics right when you go to cryo health care and your legs are shaking and you get out of there three minutes and 40 seconds if someone stays in there to 6 and they just become an ice cube that's fucking insane that's what you live you don't have a house you're stupid fucking deer wandering around through the woods that's it that's your life to get eaten that's like back in back in the Midwest they would send out those Flyers all the time for registered gun owners to go hunt because the overpopulation of the deer was so bad yeah that they would die or then they would try to eat each other which is crazy turning the cannibal odds yeah cuz there wasn't enough food you know so there was overpopulation it wasn't a food not enough land mass and so they would try to eat each other Jesus Christ I never heard of them they get they'd get they'd pay they would you know they would give you incentive to go to go hunt if you were you know a hunter to go take care of some of the deer well there's two options either you hunt them or you bring in something else that hunt them that second option is always a bigger problem way bigger problem they change the change the whole makeup of it yeah well California's kind of done that California's done a weird thing because every other state manages their predator population California you can bear hunt in California but you can't do it in any effective way what that means is like there's two ways that are really effective ways to hunt bears one is over bait so you would like leave some food down right and you'd wait in like a blind and hide and the bear would come to get the food because otherwise the places where bears live they don't live in an open country they hide right and they smell everything they smell you miles away like literally miles away if the wind is at your back and the wind blows across a valley and a bear is two miles away he'll look I don't know you're there and that's not even a joke I mean it's a different kind of thing and then on top of that they hear way better than you can imagine and they see pretty good too so you're fucked if you're not gonna find that so they have a bear they have bear hunting in California but it's very ineffective like most people don't don't you care for bait down I mean it was just had to be circumstance that you found yeah the only other places where you can hunt bears effectively and it's not over bait are areas where there's like wide-open spaces or these cut blocks what a cut block is where a lumber company comes in and chops down a bunch of trees and then these little roots grow up and these little tiny saplings and stuff and the Bears like to come in and eat those and meadows like people so people go to meadows and occasionally you'll spot a bear there but the others it's a predator control and then the other thing is with dogs the dog one is very problematic because people don't like that look the idea of dogs bang up a bear in a tree and then you shoot it out of a tree just really fucked up right that makes sense to me the mountain lion one is another one like they stopped all mountain lion hunting in the state and I think not going extinct no there's a lot of mountain so why would why they want to get rid of it's a political thing yeah the same thing is there's a grizzly bear ban in British Columbia you can't hunt grizzly bears of British Columbia but they have a lot of grizzly bears no problem but it was there was a ban that was put together by animal rights activist and then signed by just it was really just a few thousand people that took like an email Pole and then they passed this seven seventy five percent of them and now now they're gonna have a real problem with crizzley bears because the people that passed this they all live in Vancouver Vancouver is beautiful it's it's a city just yeah great there's no grizzly bears now but those other people that live like north you go like four hours past Vancouver and you live in the forest they have giant ten-foot monsters that eat cows that live in their fucking woods and you just said you just made it illegal to shoot the monsters but you don't even live around the Mons honest you know what the fuck you're doing you're the highrise also where those people live you can shoot as many wolves as you want so it's gotten so bad up there with wolves you could shoot a hundred wolves a day and every day they want you to give you money for it in some cases get up and shoot wolves holy shit dude let's go shoot some fucking Wolf's dude I don't want to be around wolves that need to be shot I want to I want to be around wolves where there's a healthy population where I don't have to do anything right the last thing you want to do is be around wolves where there's so many wolves they have to shoot them that's when shit gets catch yeah that's when the kids that's when they come after you that's yeah that's when there's a fucked up there's a balance there's an issue and that that's what happens if everybody's like well leave the animals alone they control their own population yes you're correct but it'll take 30 years are you willing I see this overpopulation the grizzly bears attacking wildlife attacking people attacking dogs and breaking into people's house because that will happen and will we include crouching in their land sort of but guess what if they find out where our food is they're gonna encroach into our land shit like there's no do we have no land I just give up give up your house man you know what is this what are you doing like people don't have a realistic idea of what animal life is like animal life is beautiful but it's also life with its own ideas about survival and it wants to do and if you don't manage the Predators you're not gonna have the other animals you're not gonna have the deer you're not gonna have the move slowly you got to manage everything like and biologists know how to do it but then we get involved like men I just do want to see the Bears die and people are talking about bringing bears back to California he's crazy fussing and Shipley's embarrassed yes yes ship I'm in well we have a grizzly bear on her state flag yeah I know but the last grizzly bear was shot and killed in Labette California there's a city well I don't know if those kids I like back up north yeah like near Bakersfield on the way to Bakersfield and it was I think the his name was Steven Lebec see if he could find that led ici I believe he was the last man in California to be killed by a grizzly bear oh shit and they want that's a wrap there is Peter Lebec Peter Lebec and killed by experts bear what is that but it says a X bearing a X bear by experts like a space it's like a cross like a side because it's not totally an X October 17th 1837 Wow October 17th 1837 and that's when they just went hog and just killed all the Bears they had huge bears in California - they were like coastal brown bears like the kind they have in Alaska right those enormous ones yeah any like they look like buses that's what they had here wonder that was a Kodiak Kodiak yeah yeah that's a weird place what is this the mystery of Peter Lebec and the X bear oh so it was they did call it the X bear I wonder why they call it the X bear okay so it was out in the back because it's now it says it's now Fort Tejon there's a fort off of the off of the five at the time it says just the wiles of the Tehachapi Mountains which by the way is the exact same area from their worldly bud where a Daniel day-lewis that movie there will be blood oh yeah that's that's where they scored oil that's right it's out in that area is that him right there no that one boy that's homeboy they got jacked no no that's that's that's Robert Williamson what is Williamson leading a government expedition and passed through Santa Clarita in 1853 as a part of an effort to find a practical route for a Transcontinental Railroad and then and then they found bears 1853 he noted an unusually large number of grizzly bears in the area there's a lot of bears here we should keep going okay well hold on stop sub sub sub sub scroll down it says party led by Fitzgerald Beale lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale commissure the Indian Affairs at the time found the Lebec tree a tree in 1854 okay so it's a tree where they they like had something that they left to market this is by 1890 the tree bark had grown over and cover the Lebec inscription yeah so there was a there was a tree that was why that like had written on it this is the where the body was remained the remains of a man approximately six feet tall who was missing his right forearm both feet and his left hand along with two broken ribs on the left side all consistent with a gruesome bear attack yeah baby that so that's what they did when they had these bears in California they were just jacking people so they killed them all like they literally have no bears left not just in California but there's brown bears but no no grizzly bears brown bears a much smaller bear there's not only are they not in California like I don't think they're close to California here along its back and shoulders appeared to form an ex huh what it where's where's all the Grizzlies in and they're all north yeah you got to go to like I think if I'm correct I don't think you can find them until you get to like British Columbia I don't think they're even in Washington State I think they have them in Idaho they have them in Wyoming they're starting to find them in Colorado in fact my friend Adam green tree the guy who shot that Bowl up there that giant buffalo yeah water buffalo on the top of the flag that dude spotted and filmed them in I think the San Juan Mountains I think that's where it is I think that's the name of the range in Colorado where people are saying there's no grizzly bears anybody found one get a video of it it's like that is a fuckin grizzly bear because he's from Australia fucking that's how he talks which state is the most grizzly bears 600 more live of 1500 left in the lower 48 states that you have about 800 live in Montana okay say they got to be up there 600 more live in Wyoming there's an estimated 70 100 living in northern and eastern Idaho okay so I was right and two of them in Texas for some reason but they're in there in Colorado now um Adams right I guarantee he's right because first of all Colorado borders Wyoming and it borders a lot of what that area is like what's on the edges of Colorado I know Wyoming's on one side I guarantee they've crossed in because well Utah allergists are they're questioning this the validity of this but Adams been around bears not always he'd been around bears he's filmed himself getting charged with bears why he's holding up a pistol and put it on Instagram he was on a 28-day backcountry hunt in so what do we got here Colorado what's off to the left that's Utah Utah one side there's no bearing on the top yeah so they come down from the top man guarantee you yeah Fort Collins is right there I guarantee you there's some grizzly bears there Adam knows the point is this is not like a like me if I went into the woods well there do his little grizzly bear don't listen to me yeah I don't the fuck I'm talking about he knows he knows he's sure Joe he can see one you know a mile away look at it through a spotting scope and say that is a grizzly bear right where I can't I go it's a fucking bear it's a big ass today there might be a big brown bear but he was positive it was a grizzly bear about big fucking grizzly fucking nicely but people of other people spotted him too and people called bullshit on him but there he is right there this is him hold out the pistol and you see right by that tree to the left of that tree in the fog in the distance that's a fucking bear standing on its hind legs watch this see it see it standing me fuck you indeed that thing rushed him three or four times now here's where it gets crazy he had a gun but the the gun had the wrong size bullet and he didn't even know it but it was jammed so even though he thinks that he would be able to shoot that bear he really wouldn't be able to because the bullet isn't even in the fucking chamber look at that three hundred four thousand views I think that was in I believe that was in Idaho no you know ho you I think that was an I know that's where he was and then here's the other big thing you shoot that fucking thing and you know you're in real big trouble you have to prove that that thing was trying to kill you well if he had video that's fucking amazing yeah he did this is why I filmed it to let it because he had been charged Bluff charged a few times I run up to within stop it's always a woman with her babies like she's just trying it in a woman female bear with her babies she's trying to protect these bitches are bears fucking bitch bears charging me so momma trying to protect her cubs yeah it the the dudes don't do that they won't charge no they just eat you the fuck you are yeah but if a dude is charging you it's over you're fucked and but it's also really hungry just want you to go where most the time the males are just a way unless unless you kill something and then it decides to take it from you like if you kill a deer and it wants it yep you better let it fucking have it you have to fuck off well in certain places you have to like you're not even allowed to scare them off I think I mean I was dates there's some states it might be Montana know there's some that might be Wyoming Wyoming maybe there's one state where once you shoot something if it might be Idaho it's one of those dates we just keep chomping keep jumping they could be North Dakota if a bear finds your your meat you have to leave it alone you have to leave the bear with your meat you have to give up I mean yeah well who's fighting that yeah I would let that shit go most dudes won't I bet they'll shoot that thing shoot the bear just because and you know how hard it is to if you're on a backcountry hunt and you you finally get a deer yeah hard that is to do it's so hard yeah but it'd be like circle of life type of shit where you're like man if I can I mean you know I mean boom I really know right you're in their restaurant yeah it's me again Sam fuck you in the dick I just wouldn't go to a place they wouldn't let you scare off first of all I want to go to a place that has them no see that's my shit I'm not no thanks yeah I only burped on him when I was a kid burden deer actually I did deer but a bird hunted a lot when I was a kid my dad loved bird hunting the thing about deer and I mean even bird hunting is like if you're in the right place you could run into a wolf or a bear yeah you could if you kill a bear and defensive life life and property bears killed in defensive life and property belonged to the state if you kill a bear you must remove the hide from the carcass and also salvage the skull by the way that happened to my friend cam Haines he this is how crazy bears are bro he shot a bear with a bow and arrow killed it and then another bear claimed the body and started burying it this female bear holy she just decided this is mine I'm gonna eat this and because they cannibalize each other I've totally 100% of the time 100% of all bears are cannibals they just all can't have one bears dead the other ones start eating it babies they start eating it this is how fucked up my buddy lives in Alberta and his son watched a bear kill a cub and then watch the mom eat the baby I'll fuck that's crazy but the mom chase the bear off that killed the cub and then she ate it yeah well coz it's dead at that but what's she gonna do but it's just what nutrition yeah literally how they mean that's that's how they roll up there you've never looked at your kid and been like I'm gonna fucking eat my kid look at part what part would you eat first for the fat whatever the fat East is you know I mean just pop the legs off I mean when you're down to that point like if you're in like one of them situations like the like like a like a move alive crap yeah like when you start eating people do you look for the place where you jump off first like once you get to the point where like I'm killing myself yeah I'll probably jumping off a cliff I'm jumping I'm naughty unwanted fucking people people would walk out bro but there's some places where you're just not walking out yeah okay you better get that out of your head cuz you don't have any food yeah there's no water like there's nothing nope you're not gonna make it yeah that's a lot the real guys wow that's crazy you're a soccer team right yeah and so they ate dudes who died is this when they rescued him they took pictures of him that what it is right that has them going back to the scene they look very happy yeah you look happy must they must been rescued that's crazy shit is that the movie that's the movie at the movie that's the bull shows the movie what's the real image that's the real image wow that's fucked man chill imagine how long do they live up there for oh Jesus that's a long time to be eating people you know you'd get old - he's like this guy's fingers don't taste good they're eating everything frozen - I don't even know if they can make fires they're scooping like the using a spoon to scoop your asshole out what they use your bottle as a fucking bowl they're just putting stuff in your bottle as a bowl had they figured out fire like how to make a fire up there I think they did I think they did would they even burn oh wow is this real bodies now you keep showing us pictures of the movie but what would they burn they broke whatever is inside that plane leftover like clothes quick yeah that would go quick you got to find some woods you got to find some trees you know there's nothing up there they're way above the Timberline yeah and probably a bunch of people broken up there probably have bad backs and fucked up well they're all fucked up in the accident I remember that movie was so fucked up it's uh it's a terrifying thing well thousand feet altitude you oh wait twelve thousand that's like literally just above the tip or no no no Timberline is like thirteen five or something you know what they give you when you have altitude sickness and you're at that height huh cialis boner pills boner pills then when you get hard so you just telling the girls boner pills yeah down the hill which is a fucking hard dick the what those things do is dilate they dilate your vessels and apparently that helps you breathe easier when you're at high altitude it definitely is because they have like we go to Breckenridge every year we have family up there and we sleep there house is you know halfway up the side mountain mm-hmm we sleep at about eleven to eleven easy that's not easy well you if we go to Denver for three or four days but three days beforehand you get a little it's easier you had a little bump easier but not what else is but not just there's there's another one that's just that almost the same kind of a brick is one of the highest out there but yeah we sleep it like 11 to like 10 it's like anywhere from tech 10 7 right outside right near like near the house and then to like 11 to is where it usually ends up because I've got my altimeter on my phone I'm always like I wonder how high yeah I use one of those too I just like knowing and doesn't it work even if you don't have service yeah how's that work well do the things are still sending data even if you're a service GPS yeah yeah we've just accepted that the government's tracking us right I'm fine with it well do when this thing when I first got to Japan the first thing that I did I was like no yeah it flips over and it tells you exactly where you are without there was no service on it it was like booop pinpointed Google Maps look you're right there whoa this is a trip dude it's never not sending and receiving data right Const even on airplane mode still sending and receiving data well I knew this lady used to work for CNN and when she would go to places if they if you had an iPhone like she would go to these Middle Eastern places to have to talk to people in the interview them they would take your phone away if you got an iPhone got an Android phone they take the battery out in the olden days right but if you had an iPhone they just say no we're taking that phone she had you're being tracked and listen 200% period you're in some fucking Bahrain place some weird fuck can they take away your eyes take away your phone meet with these people do you do that at shows by the way do you take away two now you did you do the pouch thing the yonder patches poses rather do something it's a great idea I've heard is a game it changes this show it's like first of all you could always if you have important phone calls life to just leave the room the phone will ring you leave the room you open the pouch once you get out of the room you can come back in put it back in the pouch you come back in so wait the punches are not with them that their start is with you oh you save the perhaps they have the key yes that's all locked up right and when you go out they open it up like people hope no giving my phone up you don't have to give your phone out using your hands but you're in this pouch and when you go out they open the pouch takes three seconds it opens up you get the phone out so if you like save you have a babysitter at your house or something like that right general issue you can check it but in the pouch it doesn't disable the phone from not getting service or anything no see that's what I think they should figure out well because it's a service to the phone if there was an emergency though see that would that would prevent so what the thing is that's good about the pouch is that if you really like if there's some critical issue that you think could come up right I know your phone's ringing like okay I'm gonna leave but then it gives people incentive still have their phone on to ring do you know I mean that is true that is true that's to me is saying like you know what's true how often to the emergent if it if the shows two hours right and an emergency happens within that gap of time of two hours isn't that the universe just being like this is life totally I get that but it's also like I just feel like you know this show is so much fucking better - way better without the phone have you done one of those shows now you should come with me will do do a gig together yeah I would love that yeah because the idea of it I thought when I heard it I was like that's the most brilliant shit I've ever heard in my life it's phenomenal telling you it's phenomenal I think gets people mentally in a place where they're like I'm just gonna enjoy the show exactly yeah I don't the fucking thing of sitting on dude everybody's got their phone up everywhere you go they have their phone up film and everything they want to film everything won't take pictures everything and it's a distraction I just want to go see a friend of a friend play you like band and uh even out like small nonsense venues people still different I'm not talking like you know it's like fucking you know a massively Fame like Bruno Mars like every kid I'm sure is that good the whole time of course this is even like a small tiny little venue where I was like eighty people all have their phones out too I thought those would just be a little bit more chill I think it's less of an issue with music although some people do have an issue with it but with music you're you're the you already know the songs yeah with jokes like say if you're working on a new hour right and you go to the Laugh Factory and five people in the audience are filming and they want to put it on YouTube like your your jokes are half code early you're trying comedy is one of the weird art forms because you have to practice it in front of other people right you could write it alone but you really don't know how it goes together until you try in front of other people and out of all the bits that you have how many of them start off and they eat dick most there's like one or two that you do that you right away that hits and you're like alright fuck yeah alright that's what are desperately bad yeah try to figure out how to make it work somewhere where the fuck is it you know you and you're trying to convey that to them you like trust me this is not your you just haven't heard it yet yeah it's just you'll hear it in a year come back in a year that you like it golden and even then like even when you got something down like sometimes I take a chance with it like maybe I'm not totally done with this I'm you know take it on a left turn like oh I like stuff when I find that I tried once and I hated it and like a year later and then I tried again and it works yeah that's weird and I love yeah well you don't even know why like what's wrong with me then and right with me now something about the rhythm of the way you even thought about it like I think sometimes when I get an idea of a joke and the rhythm of the joke I can't even find like I'm like I don't even know why I just kind of like the idea that for some reason and then year to later you're like something else usually happens that goes that's just like when I felt blank and then these things kind of like mesh together it was just like the missing piece well what's in your head is so important that's why Theo von so fucking funny it's my guy because Theo's act is like so ridiculous oh yeah and when you see you know if you saw it on paper there's a lot of bits the you see on paper how is that that's funny and then you see him live like yeah yeah it's amazing in his head he knows why that's funny right knows why that's funny and then he tells it to you in the way that it's going on in his head and you start fucking howling right but like if you're not totally sure if it's funny which you usually aren't when you're trying something out on stage they can kind of tell totally you're not totally sure honey so if someone films that and then puts it on YouTube that's not good like say me maybe I'm an Andrew Santino fan and I go as new bits cops are like no yeah this is a embryo yeah yeah yeah yeah you saw the beginning stages of what is going to be yeah that stuff that's the whole filming in shows and they still they bust people at the store all the time for do that but there's still people that try to get away with it that you see people you know who are just fans some of them are just fans I would say most people are just a fan they just want to have that little piece but I just think there's always fucking people that are up to no good well there's always people that are just first of all there's people that if you're a performer and they're not a performer they don't give a fuck total like they're not they're not looking out for you they hey I'm fucking audience remember you worried about you you're doing I'm a fucking guy who films I paid to be here pal well yeah that's what I do I tell my guy and you're a performer guy so fucking perform performer well I film this next performer guy coming to the stage you're gonna love him someone said this to Sturgill Sturgill Simpson comes up to him in an airport and sticks the fucking camera in his face always talking to his friend him and his friend are talking and the guys like holding the camera it's like what are you doing man hey it's a price you pay bro he says to him it's the price you pay that nothing drives me more insane when people say shit like that the price you pay I just decided that's what comes along with the territory hey attacks bro no time to pay the same tax front anyway you talk to your friend like in any other world that would be so rude like if you were just standing by talking your friend and both of you were insurance salesman and a guy came up and put a phone in your face you'd fuck is this guy you're coming I'm insured by State Farm so I get to do this it's price you pay you want to be in public I get to film you like this that's a thing that they people have decided right some people in their head like this guy with the camera that if you are a famous person like anything you do yep I'm allowed to film you everywhere you go mom take pictures because it does this because there's this big disconnect that that people that are famous are people there's this thing that's like now you're ours now yeah we we made you famous so now you're ours whatever we want from you that idea is fucking crazy to me that someone's like they're barely human sometimes they don't treat people like they're not human they're just you know it's pretty good at it pretty good is the TMZ guys for the most part they come up to with the cameras they're very good guys like for the most part a lot of them are actually comics they like do it as fewer comics yeah they're struggling and bright they meet people the airport and asking weird questions and sure most of time it's no big deal I see I go cheese or cheddar what they have the fucking weird sometimes the questions are so like yeah well they're just trying to get something but that's how they're getting by you know totally but it's just there's almost never a good idea to answer those questions no fucking idiot no matter what like someone got Anthony Bourdain at the airport they said if you were gonna cook dinner for Donald Trump and Kim Jong hoon what would you serve he says hemlock and then all the Magga assholes went fucking crazy that's a poison he's threatening to kill the president it's it's someone it's actually called a super service and getting arrested fucking maggot hats all filled with sweat around the brim like a foot his hat smells like a foot it's gonna kill the president I want you to rest birthdays there's no joking about the president meanwhile all he does his crack jokes yeah I wish he really did say that that motherfucker line as president oh yeah come on I mean that shit would be hilarious if he did that as president will would everybody do huh you're not allowed to do that so right you were right now the press do not do not cuss that's kind of like but I think that like when he tweeted at Kim Jong Un's all the little rocket man that was aware it was so funny I was Larry it was just plain funny he goes did you see the one tweet he goes I don't know why Kim jong-un said I was old I would never say he's short fat turd - like comic yeah as I go I don't smack the did go to your work it's my good ticket like the exact same thing yeah that's so fun but I mean the fact that he just like this was this is the president saying this it's fun like it's fucking hilarious but meanwhile Kim jong-eun now wants to sign a peace treaty they wanted me they're gonna meet they're gonna meet yeah he wants me nobody wanted to meet with him before no no that was like there's too dangerous we never call him short and fat over I tried so hard to be his friend and maybe someday that'll happen yes shits on you shows you the consequences of you fucking with him and that's kind of what we do anyway that's like what friends do that you like you shit on each other and then you're like dude I love you it's cuz I fuckin maybe someday that will happen oh well I try so hard to be his friend this guy come on man look I'm not there's a lot of things this guy does wrong but totally fucking entertaining very entertaining there's no never been a more entertaining president not even close no he is the fucking grand champion of being an entertaining as long as he doesn't blow us up and he gets out without getting in a box like it's it's highly possible he doesn't make it out of this one alive but if he does yeah he gets through the whole thing I think he's gonna be good you think so I think he'll be fine let me say this the weather at last four years or eight years and look at all these and a lot of liberals are like what never never whether or not that's true ever Trump if it lasts for eight years the one thing though that we will all say we'll look back on will go man that's crazy it took that thing for us to talk about a lot of things like the me to movement yeah would have never happened if Hillary got in office um yeah would have sure I don't think sorry Weinstein got exposed that's the ones but I think we're tumble affect your of what happened with him I agree too but I think it all helped in together yeah I I'm just saying like I bet you the Harvey thing wouldn't have been so real when Hillary got in because because all the Liberals that condemned all the liberals like all the liberals that called out people like Harvey and everyone in our business they would have been so gleeful of this Hillary thing I think that would have still been like well we'll cover it up like we've been doing for the but it's not like it just started it's been going on why why not suppress stories before but cuz they got these people to suppress I don't I just didn't think the power of social media is I think the timing was perfect with Trump I think I'm just saying like I think so I think those things led to it just being like alright that's it we have to do something I think it was definitely a factor but I bet you wouldn't happen so fast with Hillary I bet you that would've been a longer road oh yeah dude because liberals would have gotten exactly what they wanted the only way would have been a longer Rose because Weinstein supported Hillary's camp that's what I'm saying that is pops they're all part of the same because there was a lot of photos of them together him with Obama dude he's got photos with everybody yeah everybody him just hugging up on all these people to call him a monster now yeah throws out he's a god like Meryl Streep say he was a god yeah a godsend that's the same thing with Trump though like how many celebrities you see the pictures of Trump it's hysterical there are diehard liberals that are like they asked me to give you presents LEDs and all that shit they asked me to do the apprentice when I was doing the second round of Fear Factor when you said - no way I want to live in New York for three me and my kid was one of my youngest kid was very young who was gonna be on the show I'm I don't know no idea I would love to see who you would have gone up with dude I would have been so Dennis Rodman noncompetitive I would have been high as fuck long time oh to try to come up with a good idea and if it didn't work out get you the one that's why cuz you didn't care again do ya the people that care that's who that's who loses I don't know man I cared so little I thought I probably would lose I think you'd win I probably that's a person that's like man don't you have to be good at business I'm fucking terrible at business like what would you see some of the people on that show they just they're all doing in it don't know I mean they're like who they cast on it they wing it it's like whoever they says I've seen literally 13 seconds of that show and it's all clips if I if I had your fire that's the best clip you know fired I just I don't know I just it just didn't seem like a fun show I wish you came ad you're fired I would add big Don olds with you hmm I don't eat that shit I do belly yours heats fried chicken with a fork a knife dude that's a disc he's a cut he's a comic act she's a comic he's a cartoon he's a nod you man that's for sure do you think he's gonna run again 100% right when he's gonna win again a hundred percent he's gonna win yeah Wow and I'm not saying like of course there's people that are probably like good what does his fuck dude just need to come to my boil hearts gallery and see my never Trump exhibited that was burned to the ground by Mexicans how ironic cannot see coffee I just think I think he's gonna win again I just do I think unless the Democrats can pull something together in the next year and a half two years there's someone that actually is like a formidable component well I just I just think he's gonna go again he might nice especially if something look if he's smart and he clearly is a very clever man if he's a clever man it's entirely possible that he's got one round in the chamber for like right around six to eight weeks out totally before the election one thing where he like let something happen or shit goes down and he has the perfect solution to put out that fire he's good to go they plan that stuff man totally many people working on it right now the moment you get into office they're trying to keep you in office and sometimes people die but sometimes people die people die yeah sometimes people die and it's just hey we're gonna do what is this president Justice Marines what do you say you want soldiers in space he wants to create a space force Oh what dude fuck yeah why are you saying let's shoot up and see I don't like the way says there's a space force they even have us for whatever the space force with the Navy and a space for us so what he does is he has a bunch of buddies that make spaceships so what he's gonna do is when they make fucking deal mechanize deal recognize deal we sat down we've got a nice deal and they're gonna take another four trillion dollars and pump it into the space for us and then they're gonna they're all gonna wear like Luke Skywalker outfits right they're all gonna wear some sort of crazy spacesuit that looks dope yeah and we're gonna be all on board yeah space war they swore dude tight you imagine if we start seeing like overhead like we're in the sky a button would like a tan night sky and you see like Rakesh wine backing so cool part of that uh the Tesla thing so cool he was showing the US Air Force some maneuverability thing whatever that was like the last hour of the the test the experiment was showing them something that they could do that wasn't really being talked about because if a lot must shooting that car into space is so funny Trump must make so many people nervous in other countries like this like just have him talking about it space war justice just talking so flippantly i thinks a lot of put a lot of you in all other countries like him i think they're i think they're enamored by his his just complete disregard for rules i think people love that he just doesn't give a shit you think so I think so trees are terrified this guy is running America I think like our friends do but I think the majority of the other countries I don't give a shit about us or like that guy's great I think our friendly countries you know like England I'm sure is like he's a nuisance you know but I think I think countries don't give a fuck about us or like that guy's hilarious that guy's a weirdo space war imagine we have space war with Russia that would be fucking awesome be a great movie like how do we stop a war from breaking out who who was gonna stop a war from breaking out nobody it's like it seems like they just keep pushing each other like someone's gonna throw a sucker punch yeah let's do it yeah and then finally they're in the fucking hallway they're pushing each other right no one wants to step we keep hitting one or two books out of each other's hands yeah and it's always right there so always right there then finally someone takes the hit yeah I mean it could easily happen with some little Banana Republic right that could started off some crazy dictator in Venezuela or socially it could send a missile that some other dude and fuck him up and like a whole bitch that we're doing now and then we back this coming and the Russians back the other guys the next thing you know it old Jed's a millionaire and we're in a fucking war I mean which we're so weird about war it's like we accept the fact that war exists but only when it's not near us I'm really interested in war that's close can't be here like we have war in Afghanistan yeah yeah but that's inevitable but war over here is like new no way no way not on my land you can't we don't but if we're gonna have war over here I hope we can contain it too like you know like North Dakota or somewhere where I'm not near fair some weird spot some spot where we're like to fight in the middle where there's a lot of shit all over this spot you can have that area go fight right here yeah if we flow right here be good would be the one look we all designated this this place with me we fuck each other up what's date yeah Connecticut Connecticut yeah yeah nobody nah fuck it yes that's like that's like after school fistfights of like we chew in the secret garden dude I'm gonna fuck you up you know and you'd wait all day people be talking about it like your mother fat ass bro bro meet me in Connecticut you want to solve this the right way dawg meet me in Connecticut oh no but we're in one yeah see that's the thing we all run with some dudes who ride goats and they live in the mountains yeah we're in one with those guys but yeah yeah yeah but this over there it's doing I go to Starbucks every day I don't feel it that's what it is that we're at the war I go to me get my Nazi coffee out in Boyle Heights and I'm straight it's white people coffee weird white people coffee wp coffee it's just crazy that they could just scream fuck white people and everybody's like well you know they don't want to be gentrified no they don't know some of their saying I'm not saying I mean they don't want white people moving in and opening up galleries you know what's another part of it this is where it gets really weird so I went into rabbit hole I started reading a lot about what I read was that part of it is being hijacked by white artists that don't like the people that own the gallery so they get on the side of the people that want no gentrification and they sabotage the gallery because they have a personal feud with the guy who owns the gallery that's so far so there was a lot of that there was white artists that were teaming up against the white people they're teaming up on the side of the Hispanics to get yeah Mexicans Latinos I'm you know if it's all Mexicans I mean the East East Side is heavy this Honduran yeah I mean it's just that neighborhood it's just it's generally known as a Latino neighbor totally and these people want to keep it that way but it's just so fucked up imagine if that was white people if brown people were moving in and white people we want fuck Brown aren't fuck the Nazis hate racism fuck Brown but if it's against white people we don't automatically see it as racism including the people that are saying fuck white art like they don't think of it as racism because it's against the people that are moving in that happened to be wealthy that can afford to buy totally pushing people out so if you say fuck white people it's not racist but the same people that agree with that you know the same people that are like yeah that are like that are like the same white people that agree with the protesting they're rich they're already up there anyway there's only that and there's just it's convenient because they're not that thing it's like I read this one woman was tweeting that here's an unpopular opinion I'm not at all uncomfortable about the idea of men being falsely accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment like that is a crazy thing to say like what if it was your son yeah what if it was your brother yeah what was it what if it was your dad and they were a good person and accused of something here you're not you don't feel bad because you don't like men no men suck is that what it is yeah that is sexist let I do you might not think it's sexist but it's fucking sucks it's hardcore sex if all men sucked if all men were violent monsters girls you'd all be dead right okay you'd all be dead someone along the way would have done something terribly so we're not all bad no some of us are bad you know men are bad and I won't even say us some males of the species are bad some females are bad yes where's that that's not even a part of it it's like people are bad I don't understand this whole thing like all people are good most people I think people are good but a lot of people are not good there's a lot of people so if there's like we were talking about the the number of what was the that weird statistic about that we pulled up one out of 0.6% what was that that we were just discussing yes micropenis people right so if that's how many people how many people are fucking assholes right more than half micropenises way more yeah so if you have a hundred people right and point six have a micropenis - were assholes flamin assholes and imagine being an asshole and having a micropenis you're in trouble you got a real proper you probably never develop like real asshole tendencies because these always be so intimidated that's someone in the middle of a ramp just pull your pants down shut the fuck up and then everyone's like oh my god there's way more assholes but some of those assholes are women so like on National Women's Day the other day like a couple people that I know retweeted this someone was like believe women trust women embrace women support women this is yep some yes yes some are great yeah some women are amazing yeah some men are amazing yeah some humans humans can be amazed this whole like gravitating towards one gender specifically just because they have a vagina or specifically just cuz they have a penis is equally stupid yes it's equally stupid on both sides yes and it also creates divisive 'no skon flicked right because you were aware us on the team penis that you're fully in support of team vagina that's all you're about right you're about team vagina and you know over here is a penis fan I'm like this is bullshit you know I'm willing to tolerate those vagina fans but they're shitting all over the entire to you shitting on penises I'm getting tired of it enough you know it's like can the dolphins and the Raiders have a healthy relationship amongst the fans can they get together and share a stadium together without any gang fights no no not in that example no no but it's the same thing with team penis first team vagina here's an unpopular opinion I'm not at all uncomfortable with Raiders fans getting gang-raped or stomped to death in a parking lot fuck the Raiders hashtag fuck the Raiders yeah that's something a retard would say right yeah that's a really stupid fuck who was like a uh you know a anti Raiders guy would say something like that and you get like a hundred likes yeah fuck fuck oh fuck oh I hate that futurist female quote I think it's such an annoying good luck just eating each other's pussies you crazy bitches that's such an insane thing to say it's so annoying it's a stupid what do you say what are you really saying you don't want to be masculine Yeah right imagine what a piece of shit you'd have to be to walk around a t-shirt this is a future as masculine mood no no the future is human-beings hopefully we're nice to each other getting along yeah doing each other good and being right to one another we're all we're all important all of us males females everyone yeah they're so human ecosystem needs each other it's so funny but women can walk around with those futures female shirts and not feel stupid it's fucking ok that's a bigger that's supported right it's yeah hey would we say that to me I'm fucking love first of all love your shirt amazing it's amazing I'm with you 100% sister they can do that here but I'm tell you

venture gonna be done with all this girl's shirt they're just walking the street right mmm girls come here Steve yeah it's stupid it's stupid like just it is general I I mean it does like taking one gender and deciding that's what you're really into that's just a stupid is taking one skin color totally just as stupid as I am really only into dudes were over 6 feet tall anybody under 6 feet tall should be dead I don't want to talk to them I have a team I teach team 6 feet we could always decide some new thing that we don't like somebody about right before and so we always decide like yeah those fucking assholes from the town across the tracks like well of like a boundary line decide those people with them imaginary lies yeah we put up a fence fuck you some gum will stain some we're gonna meet in the parking lot on Saturday night if they don't say that we're the best we're gonna fucking kill them it's and people don't see it for whatever reason if you have a futures female t-shirt on you don't see it that way because you are just in support of feminism and Night Court of equal right right in support of women doing powerful things and you think this is a step in the right direction but it's not know the futures female is not is not a message that is good the future is happy loving people the future is good honest people not not fucking hurting each other people trying to do well for each other trying to facilitate communication and growth and learning about each other in tolerance like just be nice to each other not the futures masculine fuck off you dork

yeah you do those dicks yeah you have to go to master tattoo artist wow this guy covering his eyes he's got tattoos all over its face holy shit man I am seeing more that than I've ever seen in my life that's the new shit dude how quick that works man that's incredible so this is how old's that article stuff like new it's pretty new this year so find your fun with Jamie and I'm gonna get something

mmm-hmm it's me me and you but yeah you and me together with the right ideas now if I've never I've never no dude I think I don't think I can commit to something like that no I couldn't do it then the fucking getting a tattoo to me was always like I just can't fucking can't do it I thought about it for years and then I was like but every friend I had it got a bad one isn't the futures feminine sort of like if you have a brown power tattoo you're allowed to have brown power brown power yeah if you had a brown power yeah if your brown person traditional laser does this place in Beverly Hills the picosure laser what does it do hey cuz this gon see you fuck out fuck out of here bitch done looks like that looks pretty dope dude I might have to go get that shit done cuz I've been putting off getting this tattoo who's the broad at the bottom yeah she's good she's like hey I had one above my box and they took it out she bunch of she had a bunch of gang stuff on her forehead bunch of dicks pointing to my butt I was a kid it was a gang I was in the gang just disappears that I love that revealing a beautiful future this is the real truth this is how it actually happens you know and I you know what I need in here right now I need like a pee bucket I have to pee so good don't worry about it we'll talk shit about you while you're gone what makes him comfortable that we talk about we'll start with that the future is Mastan this makes me sad i get though i'm a hypocrite though because like one of my favorite fighters Cain Velasquez he's got brown pride tattooed on his chest never bothered me for a second his dad walked here from fucking Mexico and you know like if you're a part of a disenfranchised community if you feel like you are and you have that on it's like you're taking pride in something that's considered maligned right but I guess women would think the same way in a more mild way that they're disenfranchised too we're gonna do with all their that tramp stamp thing that's done right know some girls are still getting them now yeah really there's some dumb people out there bro okay but what is a tramp stamp a tramp stamp is only when it's your lower back yeah right but your whole back like I know a lot of people that are getting their whole bag done right that's that's that's I mean they're getting their butt done everything which i think is probably not the best move because like asses look really good when they're well formed like to put you know what it's like it always seems to me what do you show me well look at that well back tattoo god damn that's gorgeous look go back to that full screen like row below go go below go below there's a tiger low right of that screen look at that one right there BAM look at that back holy shit that's crazy that's really good work who made that one does it say oh it just says a hundred awesome back tattoo ideas yeah I just think ladies leave your ass alone please don't get crazy Wow like or if your ass is so good you could tattoo the shit out of it still looks amazing but you gotta be really careful what artist you go to that is the thing about tattoos you got to really make sure like before I got my sleeve I got my sleeves done by this guy Aaron Dellavedova shout out to Aaron from guru tattoo in San Diego I'd seen his work online a bunch mean he's a real legit artist his works amazing I knew that this guy was like super good at tattoos but there's a lot of people to get some wack-ass tattoos I don't understand how people don't have time they don't have the patience to wait for that good artist they get nutty I needed today and you know do you have tattoos all over him move why to better yeah they want the one that we know don't have you seen they have glow-in-the-dark tattoos now yeah gotta be good for you yeah on the dark definitely not gonna fuck you up for the rest of your life it's all natural as far as we know if you were gonna get a tattoo what do you think you'd get so I don't pride yeah or like we'll wipe our maybe look in the dark tattoos that's amazing that looks fucking cool Wow shit okay look that's amazing holy shit dude that would back up to that last one you just went to know what the girls back right there note to the right of that one to the right of that one no look at that picture up at the top bar and go to the right of it the one that that's it there you go BAM look at that Wow fuck dude that's someone's arm right that someone arms ever arm yeah oh I thought was her back oh I thought it was like leaning forward fuck that's incredible that's amazing yeah then you have black lights over your house like you're in college again though whoa yeah right like your whole house is a college dorm you have to have black lights everywhere you have to have like a MD booze bottles filled with like things that make them glow and shit every room you go into is a college drunk because you are black light black light poster that's what would I get probably something from something representative of Chicago back home fuckin Chicago get down a deep-dish pizza and a broccoli get old-style in a hotdog on my shoulder shit a snow shovel and a fuckin bratwurst he's got a high cholesterol chart reading but everybody's fine don't worry about it everyone's got a fat gut and then fine in a big smile heard you making fun of Joe Rogan's making fun of us

show ever it's the underground comedy show in Toronto they've never done that place do they have a bong shop and in the back room it's all a comedy show but it's all people smoking pot in the room

seconds ago and it's so bad and it's thick like smoke everywhere like the hope there's no ventilation you get to material you just have to go fuck around yeah I mean you could try to do material I think I definitely have tried but like I took tripley there and Tripoli doesn't really get high at least he didn't I don't know I don't think he does time I think he might have been sober but dude he got blitzkrieg just breathing the air in this place got fucking ripped the whole the whole place is bomb it was I don't think it was a I don't think anyone bombed oh yeah I feel like that's such a bomb venue where you're like I'm never gonna do well in here they don't fucking they're not paying attention you're just out of it he's right the whole thing you're off everything's off right you're so hot but that's also where I did a thing on the Iron Sheik came on stage in that place you ever seen that video of the Iron Sheik Joe Rogan's and he's talking to me and doesn't I realize the price that pro wrestlers pay oh my got health like this poor fellas in crutches and shit he could barely walk that's him in me on stage [Applause] that the toughest for the Olympics is freestyle wrestling sir [Applause] [Music] one of the highlights of my life being on stage hi is giraffe pussy talking the Iron Sheik in a room with a pot leaf behind me that's a big wall pot leaf was he ripped - yeah yeah sober eye in the house there was no one sober in that place I don't I don't I literally don't think it would be possible to be sober in that room I just don't think you could be there's no air in that room no yeah they trap you yeah like all the fight there's fire like the little candles and stuff on a table like it's running out of air they don't hang out so we did some in here everybody's like this like the whole these candles burn on weed Joe it's fine but the shows there are always real weird people go there and just it's in Vancouver no it's Toronto Toronto - yeah I forget what it's called comedy underground or something puff-puff mom around comedy club underground comedy club yeah we've done it a couple of times they still doing shows and shit there I don't know yeah I think so

promising I would you fucking promise we're gonna breathe air bro we've got tickets done this choice before Joe get tickets who's your other boys hey just so many people there's just so many people where's your where's your least favorite spot to perform I don't really have one isn't what not like a city but what's your like what's the least ideal situation much on the tag out of City I mean like least ideal is always a Late Show on a Friday night in a place where people are dumb Yeah right and they're dumb and there's rock but I'll tell you what man there's places that you go that don't get a lot of love and then when you go there the fucking shows are awesome like Bakersfield was awesome really just did it just did a couple of weeks ago it's fucking amazing they were incredible they were one of those one of the best audiences ever lively fun by the way same place to hatch be mountains that's right near with a gun by there that's right there what there will be blood I drink your milkshake that was right there there's that whole area those people are fucking great they were cool they were really cool you were shot you selling you're surprised yeah we're good I'm like I gotta give it a check I saw Bern I talked about on a podcast like two years ago we should do just of Torah places where people don't want to go I'm like yeah that'd be kind of fun so he and I talked about doing it we're gonna talk about doing it in Bakersfield and we never get around to doing it and so I said I'm just gonna go by myself right so I decided to go I had a great fucking time it was fun yeah me know those people deserve comedy too like it's so funny it's like big cities that's why when you go somewhere small most of the time they appreciate it more because I like dude no one ever comes through here you know what else is great Fresno yeah if I had never been there Fresno is great yeah fucking fun man did two shows in Fresno had a great time you have no idea how many people right now in Fresno losing their minds Oh Fresno has some serious soul food some legit for real soul food yeah Brazos how far I wish I could remember the place I got the name of the place somewhere on my phone how far is Fresno from here it's a solid four-hour drive yeah it's almost the San Francisco right yeah yeah it's about about four hours drive I forget the name this fucking place there was a soul food place and fries I'm not gonna be able to find it see if you can google soul food in Fresno it's one of the highly ranked rest there's not a lot of choices in Fresno for food chef Paul's or doll's kitchen I think it's chef Paul's can you see if you can find a picture of it 4.6 yeah that's the spot it is chef Paul's gotta be a for balance baby they had dude they have ox tails they have love on sale that is the place cool artwork on the wall that place if you are near Fresno if you're like an hour outside of Fresno Drive there if you're on your way you're passing through and you guys probably not some little shrimp gumbo dude they had chicken and waffles they had ribs I had tried tip they had catfish I believe they had the but the braised oxtail was all of shucks damn it was so good man they had collard greens that was amazing they had braised cabbage that was sensational it's a serious joint it's one of those places where one of the main things that they serve to drink is kool-aid and I went off the reservation so I'm like fuck it I'm eating this stuff I might as well just have a kool-aid what's the difference it was wonderful yeah some some ribs and a kool-aid there's a kool-aid right there baby having some ribs and a cooler we went there two days in a row that's when you go there you can't fucking you can't like health it out you gotta go go for hog you gotta go whole hog if you're going to chef Paul's so shout out to chef Paul's cafe in Fresno good spot but I'm you know what man I'm having a good time doing stand-up so everywhere I'm going I'm having fun I mean even when you go to a weird place it's like yeah it's weirder I mean it's not Anaheim but it's weird you know it's fun it's not the Irvine improv right now see I'm at a level where I'm still hustling through places that are just you know I'm having fun for a lot of places but some places I'm just like the crowds are not that good I don't draw enough people so it's like it's it's hard I think BER talked about it I don't know if he talked about it here or but he said like killing to the abyss music there's a part in your career when you're killing to the abyss right there kind of like you're you know you're a professional you've had accolades in the game you've done well enough but your fan base isn't huge enough to where you have a big following so when you go somewhere you crush and you'll hear afterwards someone go you know I've never even heard of you and we you're one of our favorite comics now and they do that they do this thing where they're like we fucking love you oh I can't believe we're gonna fuck so you make these new fans it's great but it's just like you are you are working so hard crushing to 30 people to you know to earn earn you know to earn you're earning all these audiences those times though man when you look back you will remember those very fondly well I can't forget them because a lot of more painful issue yeah there's gonna be rough ones but those are fucking so critical for the development of your act oh it's worth it's worth every and the other thing is the places that I have built audiences that I love like Denver when I go back to Comedy Works I can sell that place out because I've built an audience right right like if I build audiences in places that really love me that's the best part about going to places where I'm like you know shit you know they just show me so much love they're like that's what it is that's what it feels good yeah and you have to think of like if you're in a place like Denver how many of those people that come to see you are actually going to leave comments or tweet at you and how many are just gonna enjoy it because most the time when I go to see somebody I just enjoy I just enjoy - yeah yeah it's very rare that I say hey you have to go see this guy hey this girl's here and or this band or whatever it's very rare right most the time I just enjoy it so like you think about your doing thousands of people right you're doing 200 was it 300 seats how many I think it's three yeah it's like 300 seats you're doing 1200 in two days you know and then you're going back again do another 12 tell their friends people come back tickets go quicker next time right then a year later I mean that's that's the key to building the road like to this day there's places where I sell out way in advance and there's other places where I really haven't been going that often and it's it's more of a difficulty to sell tickets yeah that's right because you because you built up a yeah they've had I mean how long Stan Houston's a spot where I can just I sell on Houston I've been selling out comedy clubs in Houston since the 90s yeah it's like it's always been a spot that I could cuz I was like for me Houston was one of the there was a few cities where legends came from and Houston was where Tennyson came that's right and for me it's like Kennison and Hicks both came out of Houston right so for me he's like I had to get to Houston like there's just thought in my head like I knew about the laughs stop and River Oaks it's one spot that was a nice I gotta get to that Club like that's the spot right he's a fucking perfect comedy club too you never worked there huh no I was gone before you came around I was gonna say but I've listened to many albums where they're at the laughs stop introducing comics mine from 1999 yeah from I'm gonna be dead someday on Warner Brothers that was from the laptop I did in Houston filmed in like I recorded it rather in 98 or 99 and it was the perfect Club it was perfect they had an open mic night so they had a bar in the front and they had staged in the in the front and they had open mic night they would start at 8:00 and go two o'clock in the fucking morning and no hacks I'm telling you no hacks and they would ostracize hacks boot him out of the community they're all artists there was a lot of really good comics that came out of that's wild and one club went under it's one club went under and the whole scene took a big hit apparently the scenes bouncing back now and there's there's a lot more comics now in Winston but dude when I used to work there in the 90s you would go there and these opening acts these guys were working there would be fucking killers they were killed openers would rip they were great real comics there were real comics and then the open mic night you would see funny comics that were learning how to do comedy like people that really have shot but it was just one club it's always a problem when there's one club in a town Wendy's figured out how to do that in Denver like that's what Wendy who owns the Comedy Works yeah she's figured out she's created a scene like that that scene is almost primarily responsible or she's almost primarily responsible or in as one individual for that entire comedy scene yeah she's amazing well she's called III I give her credit cuz I think that she's cultivated such good talent mm-hmm that that again that's kind of what you were saying about Houston like everyone that I know that I met there that's from there yeah that comes out of there ism is a fucking phenomenal comedian right like they're like they're locals yeah our professionals here to this day when I do comedy like do theaters there yeah like I'll do this the Belko it's like 5,000 seats I go through her I do it through her and she do her Club so I I always hang out with her when I'm in town like yeah that lady's super important yeah like I did my special there in 2014 my Comedy Central special because I think it was important to me to do it at that club like that that Club is one of the reasons why I moved to Colorado for a brief time I was like this I'll be close to this club right it's like I could I can survive here like I need a base station I need a base station to fuck around and work out material I could use this place like everybody else is doing it I got good I could this could be this is a real comedy community it really is yeah there's a few like that that are building so strong right now I think my only fear for the future is a lot of new clubs that pop up and a lot of clubs that have gone so corporatized that they're all the same then I'm still a club guy so for me I don't get to play theaters you know so when you do clubs you're you know at the mercy of the club system of whatever that may be you know and a lot of them are a lot of them are so corporately systemic I mean you feel like you're like sometimes you feel like you know that old joke of a musician's like what's up Omaha and they're like what this is no maha's Missouri and you're like well it all feels the same like some of the Grubbs feel the same that's true with a lot of the Improv but what they've done is they figured out a way to make it a very professional experience everywhere you go all of the country yeah like I accept what they're doing because what they're doing is like a blend of the art and commerce it's a business they've done a smart thing yeah but they don't fuck with your act no as long as they don't fuck with my act I'm cool and totally they're professional and friendly I'm cool but there's a big difference between working for them and like working for Zanies in Nashville right it's like owned by you know guys who've owned it for a long time it's a sweet club you know they're just great guys it's just and it's a perfect old-school car you know it's an old-school comedy club because you walk around and look at the headshots ago as he's dead he killed

we've had he's awesome he's the best we've had some good comics pop up we're gonna keep there they keep getting more count Andy Kindler came on the show fuckin Rick Overton is back on the show there's like a lot of great a lot of great people I became friends with Dom because we hung out in a pool hall once oh yeah yeah we did a gig together but I didn't really know him and then I went to Amsterdam billiards in New York and like 90 somewhere in the 90s and I just played a lot of pool and I was there and Dahmer air was there with his own stick I was like what you play pool he's like yeah he was pretty good I was like shed let's play some pool and we played pool so I got can't believe fuckin love to play some real pool please from Philadelphia from Philadelphia you got to be able take a punch tell a joke and place a pool that's it you have to have to know where the good cheese sticks are right right right do you think that's Philadelphia people like enough with the fucking cheese day no they love it part of a fucking culture but you don't think they annoyed like oh you're saying that that's all we have yeah and partially it is what other food is coming out of there is anybody else being like dude you know what else is good out of Philly very good Italian food that's good it's like Boston good Italian food New York I think Boston has some of the best italico to the North End that's not true oh yeah good Italian food you can't fuck with New York I grew up there trust me but New York Boston to me no you don't think it could fuck with it sorry Boston like I love you I love you but I think there's a smaller amount of good places whereas New York there's an endless of shorties right per capita it's fucking yes endless supply of flour on the floor and fucking people with a friends and make it sauce oh good fucking sauce my own sausage shed it's just I feel like there's a larger concentration of guineas in like the New York New Jersey area and in Boston it was more of concentration of Irish there was more Irish Irish anitha yeah just a few Italian but they were heavily outnumbered yeah like East Boston you're like a few places little italy few place that's why i feel comfortable there because i'm an orange guy when i go to boston people think i'm orange just slip right in yeah they assume i'm theirs well what are you Irish an Italian well they you're one of theirs yeah Santino yeah here Santino they get mad what trader position you know when I first moved to Boston I had an Irish last name the opposite but I'm mostly Italian I'm 3/4 Italian we look Irish so it's like like wha why have you got a fuckin Irish last name and you're almost all Italian fuckin shame fuckin fuck that shame there's some real Irish versus Italian animosity in Boston and like that in most cities late seventies early eighties when I first moved there I was cuz I like the history of Irish and Italian they didn't fuck they didn't really get along too well it did not I think I moved there and it must have been like 79 79 and then I went to high school there and 81 that was my first year in high school where were you born I was born in New Jersey yeah I was gonna say I thought Jersey but we lived in California for a while I lived in California from age 7 to 11 and then we lived in Florida for a little bit and then we lived in Boston Jamaica Plain for a year and a half two years somewhere on there and then we moved to Newton which is a very nice suburb you an up or falls for a nice emergency it's very quiet there's a lot of big lawns everybody's relaxed yeah fences yeah people born out of their fucking mind can't wait to escape you know it's one of those places don't realize how good they have it well that's what happens I went back recently I drove through the streets my jacket live here fucking place is great well you have a new perspective when you get older when you're young you're like fuck I did a shithole well when you're younger you're just so filled with angst yeah you just like you have no idea like think about this when you were 17 you know idea you're gonna be a professional comic no idea things gonna work out you're gonna be on TV series I'm gonna be having a good time get no idea so you're just like what what if it doesn't what if I was wrong you see all these people around you this guy's always drunk and he's doing coke I gotta thought fuck out of here I gotta get the fuck out of this town it's a fuck away from these people and then you go back when you're an adult and you go this is a great place I grew up in a really nice town yeah probably only because when you leave it's nice to company no I didn't have anybody telling me it was awesome finally my smart older brother like dude look Oh anyway here's the Catholic school girls are all morning they're all right there he is wait outside in front of the school I would had strategies dude there was no one that was hornier than the girls who went to Catholic school no one no one yeah they separated those girls from boys and they were a different animal than the girls I went to school with freaks yeah I went to public school I went to Newton South and when we were in high school we would get out and we would meet girls that were coming off of the Catholic girls school yeah these girls would go after guys they weren't like regular girls his hunger games well shit predator yeah like they were starving like they needed water dick they're crazy the horniest girl I ever dated when I was young went the once was in an all-girl Catholic school she was a great gal it was a fuck machine because she was like made a joke about her that like you could you could roll a dick past her like a kitten with a ball of yarn and she would just die she could bet she wasn't a bad person but she was always horny and it took me years to figure out what was going on it was something that I really considered in a very strange way okay I had a really puzzled me because I had these preconceived notions about how women behave but these Catholic schoolgirls threw a giant monkey wrench on this notion like okay that makes sense for the regular girls regular girls they might let you know they think you're cute he seems nice you ask her out you asked her friend to ask her if she likes me and you know there was like this little thing those Catholic girls they would cut to the chase they were like werewolves they would just charge the rabid guy hey how are you they were crazy it was they were are totally they're taking your hand and putting it down their pants and girls didn't like it other girls the regular girls did not like course never liked to gang members they like gang members they all have their own uniform they come over with their fucking plaid skirts on and just fuck everything like the Tasmanian devil they were just tornado fucking the whole school and they preyed on these boys because they didn't have any they don't know boys they were in a whole school with hundreds of girls and when you repress that that's what you get dude that is not good when you take away human emotion like that you're fucked all they're doing is just all day math science Spanish dick dick dick dick dick dick dick just running a ticker tape of dicks and boners squirt squirt squirt just thinking about someone sucking their titties and eating their box that's all they're thinking about that's all they thought about I mean I really like for that for years that girl fucked me up because I had all these ideas about like a spectrum of natural female sexuality right like this girl's hornier than that girl but this girl's hornier than that girl and she really likes this patchouli likes that but most of them they act like girls you got to let him know that not this bitch off the charts rabid who's rabid they suppress the shit out of her they just left her in this fucking thing it was crazy meanwhile her sisters was really weird her sister didn't go to Catholic school her sister went to school with me she was a regular shall tame she was normal yeah she was fucking normal I mean she was a means nice girl and everything nothing wrong with her fun to hang out with right but normal she wasn't a werewolf yeah nothing insane her sister was a werewolf a werewolf or jig dude she was a monster and it was the only one in the family that was like that and I just don't I don't see any other correlation shit for years she's probably a fucking orgy she's a fifth grade night he getting stuck in stood by like five dudes two of them she's jerking tentacle porn she's face fucking them dude she's an animal girls an animal you see I said well that's I got to be a drawer of women that get into porn probably had some kind of a repression like that right I think it's more molestation that's the most it's the most but it's not all of them you know there's a thing that they always want to say that all women who get into porn are fucked up and believe that no yeah and there's a thing that people was like someone was saying the other day that porn addiction is real and porn is fucked up because it ruins the way guys think and like maybe some guys but isn't that the same as with gambling like isn't gambling really bad for some guys yeah you know it is right yeah rules people's lives ruins their life yes and it's certain guys I just can't fucking gamble right who was it that was saying that he his dad lost their house over gambling early podcast goddamnit they growing up I want to say it was one of Callan's friends was it Jimmy Burke it might have been I mean I come from my grandfather there's a microphone that works at the dog track in Chicago I think it was Jimmy Burke whole life dad was a crazy gambler but yeah man there's a I knew a lot of guys like that from the pool hall that just every nickel they earned they lo yeah they always owed money and they were hiding from people is always gambling that lifestyle so wild too but I don't have a problem with gambling so if I go to Vegas and you know I don't bet on anything but if I used to bet on fights so if I maybe if I'm in Vegas and just for a fuckin goof Canelo Alvarez is gonna fight Gennady golovkin I get to the sports book like a day before the fight Mike yeah I'll put a fucking couple hundred bucks on this ya wanna I think triple G's got it you know no throw my hat in the ring but I'm not gonna lose my mind and bet my life was with some people it's their whole existence they have to it doesn't mean that I shouldn't be able to go gamble this is like the same thing is if I'm in a hotel room and I want to jerk off I don't want to hear your bullshit about somebody who's addicted to and it ruins their life that's I'm sad I'm sad that someone addicted to it for them but there's nothing that I can do about that and porns a real thing so what do you what do you want me to do what's the same way I'm supposed to abandoned right all my jerking off and not watch the stuff that I want to watch because somewhere there's someone who can't handle it or do we have to like educate people like hey some people they have weak chins and just they don't think well thank you three just shouldn't get into boxing right okay it's like if you can't take a punch don't get into boxing if you just if you just watch one porn film and next thing you know five hours later you're dehydrated you know you haven't left the room legs don't work and shit you're fucking you got tennis elbow like I saw my fault okay I don't know what to tell you should I not jerk off now not like people but those people that suffer through it's like people were alcoholics like Oh what are you drinking you're drinking yeah yeah I like to have a drink yep you know why cuz I'll go weeks without having one yeah ruin my family doesn't fuck my life I like to have a drink I don't go home and kick my fucking dog around the house and beat my kids I like to have a drink yeah all right let's have a glass of wine with dinner does that mean that I have to respect the guy who lost everything and he's fucking homeless and he's sucking dicks for cheap wine though because he couldn't handle it so I should out of respect for him push that pinot noir aside no no no it's it's not a palate cleanser when you're having a nice steak and some fine garlic mashed potatoes that's a terrible drug that ruins families just like the porn just like fucking everything though it's like working out you could be addicted to working out so many people are they are there's a lot of people that are gonna stop you from lifting come on bitch come on waste people are too fucking goddamn soft that's the problem yeah we're social protect other people so much that we're ruining yeah we're ruining them we really were ruining people god dammit Santino how did we get to this Jamie doesn't know he's looking at porn I get mad he does he looks at porn all the time I see it in his eyes like you see the glint yeah yeah watching porn is one of the weirdest taboos because you think about how many people watch it I mean it is I the last didn't we talk about this once where was something insane like 20% of all Internet traffic there's a funny one I thought it was more than that more we knew a surge more than that 39% I'm gonna say 39 I'm gonna say I'd say I'm gonna do 42 isn't most of it Netflix now 30 cent 30% well what percentage Netflix 70 I want to say 49 I don't know why I'm into 9s today I'm gonna say 36 this is like the price is right you got the old it dam went to five in just North America but 36 of all Wow do you got super specific wait wait 30 2.25 in just 36 overall so but that's October 8th of 2015 so it's got more now probably but how crazy is that the United States has that big of a mark in the rest of the world is just four or five points I'll tell you why that's wrong because Ian Edwards was just somewhere that was saying how the international market now has almost matched Ian's working on a Netflix show and their international markets almost matched North America now that was what three years ago it's gotta be way higher now that's great way higher that is crazy you know what they made in the in the fourth quarter last year Netflix what take a guess don't look it up take a guess eighty kazillion dollars and billions no no in just the fourth quarter last year they made 3.4 billion just the fourth quarter what 10 for the year that's probably Wow well death rolling it around at comics I'll tell you that I wish they were throwing it at me they will be no first of all would I be a little too white in the future is dark no no the futures brown and meek no what am i doing if you had glasses and you're thin and brown you'd have show I'd have two shows if you were a woman and your glasses yeah and you were brown I might show I might transform no I think that what it is right now is that they just have so many specials so that's that's my biggest problem one was trying to say that they were like oh you know they're only going after I forget what term he used like either hipsters or they're going after you know diversity like they're not they're not gonna give it to a white guy I'm like John Mulaney just got a special yeah we talking about like this Craig Ferguson just got a special it's just those that have built it you have to build yourself you have to be built well that's how it always was yeah of course it was the way it always used to be and this is the problem is there's no real valid entry level show so what it used to be is you would get on like young comedians special on HBO mm-hm and then there would be like four of you everybody would do fifteen minutes or so and then that's how you'd make it right and then there was the Rodney Dangerfield specials and that's how we found out about Lenny Clarke and Dom I rare right Bill Hicks Sam Kinison Dice Clay they all came out of the Rodney Dangerfield specials there's not a thing like that anymore so you had to go through those things before you got a special it's a while now it's like you just kind of get specials right you have to find a way into the game yeah you have to find you to find like the niche that gets you to the place to get the SPECIAL will you have a Showtime special I do have put a special up on Showtime last year but the problem is show times market is so you know is so specific it's only people that subscribe meanwhile Netflix is fucking everybody that's true but meanwhile Sebastian become of the biggest comics in the world cuz it's just because a show to ya know Sebastian is the unicorn man yeah like when people go how did he make it so big well first of all he's really funny very funny great guy family-friendly and for whatever reason he whatever show times fucking target market is clay he just flew right through in he's like there's an opening and he just like without touching the wall yeah he just went right through right it's perfect perfect yeah but that's what all that is that's all perfect timing and I you know yeah I mean show times maker I don't know if I would do another one anytime soon at all but if they did if I did do another one I'd do it with them but you know I don't really care where it is I I just care the content that I put on it and then someone see it online can they go and get Showtime that's the biggest that's the problem see that's the thing about Netflix that's so great is everybody has right but Showtime is like my special is always there it's just you have to have Showtime you know people have talked about doing this with podcasts about doing the same kind of thing like coming up with a bunch of cash and having all podcasts under one umbrella right you know like a Netflix type deal because everybody has their own way of doing it now like everybody has their own way of doing it in terms of like some people have ads some people have like GoFundMe or a patreon page you don't want that would fuck you yet would fuck you up right probably yeah I mean now with that seemed like a good message unless it was like a Netflix thing where everybody had it like that would have to be the thing yeah what do you like yeah Netflix is movies and movies take a shitload of money to make Netflix is TV shows like a shitload of money to make this podcast you could have done it on a phone we could have set our iPhone on the table right there press the auto record thing and just gone yeah but instead we got Jamie doing all these fake button-pushing and I'm going oh and BTR bro Apple's market cap that's my man Marcus brown Wow market cap is closing in on one trillion dollars you got a trillion dollars you could literally buy every single NFL NBA and MLS team Ford NASA and a hundred thousand Tesla's and still have money left over but you couldn't buy Apple whoa Netflix seven and a half times Wow but Apple is a that what they're doing with podcast is very interesting because they just they're just an aggregator you know yes like you have to have your own hosts and you just put it up on there and but through their iTunes I mean we're always in this trending section and we're always in like like the rankings when you're looking at like who the top podcasts are we're always in there and that helps people find you totally so they're helping people find you they are kind of a network in a way but they're not a network in a way like they're not like a youtube where they control content and not like they're not that they're not really they're not hosting you well they have Apple music - but podcasts are not a part of that yet a wonderfully this is so weird that they don't merge those like that that my guess is a separate tab which makes no fucking sense to them hmm like it's just to be a subcategory of music it should be right but then there's the thing of if you have something on iTunes right and like Apple music is a totally different jam right like Apple music is them hosting it isn't it yeah they would have they would have your podcast so if you said something really fucked up like maybe they would get in trouble for having you on I don't think so they won't censor someone's song no yeah anyway same thing of music like any like radical punk rock fucking crazy they might they might not host it right going into it but I mean I don't think but like look up like but Apple music can't like what is a Spotify market versus the Apple music market like I don't think Apple music is does well at all I think doing way better now well that's but not as well as Spotify does because I feel like Spotify just dominates the market yeah but see Apple musics on everyone's phone now you just find it and use it it's so easy to use yeah but with kids use the auto-fire see but I think it's the youngest generation loves Spotify like they love SoundCloud you know SoundCloud yeah I mean that's so big they love yeah they SoundCloud a lot of people are using the hosts podcast yeah totally but a lot of people think that it won't be around oh I think that's the opposite yeah not only do I think not only is it for stuff like that that's homemade podcast stuff like DIY it's also set to surpass Spotify a subscriber paid subscribers right right because modified starts off for free right interesting but like that's my thing is like you know like that the future of SoundCloud thing like that is because it's it's all everybody loves DIY shit whether it's musicians are like all those musicians and artists now that are on Spotify it's all people like making music and they're fucking in their house yeah fucking youtube you know I mean how many youtube millionaire has been made from a lot so many weird shit putting up videos talking I know some from this I know some from the beginning like I used to do a YouTube sketch thing a long time ago and like caught fire a little bit on a very small scale and the people that we kind of associated with when it was starting to grow two or three of them now that I know have made so much money from that and they were just from the jump they were kind of like in right as the cusp was like beginning you know what happens with that dude who got in trouble with the suicide is that Jake or Logan Paul which one is he that's Logan Logan Paul whatever he's he's banned they don't they D monetize his entire channel I thought he's still making videos right if he's not making any money they took all his ad money away because he electrocuted a dead rat no but he doesn't know they were saying that his entire channel was D monetized unless he got lawyers involved so then he could be just using his channel and then getting sponsored videos yeah one of the big things to me it's stunning makes more on merch probably than he doesn't from fucking YouTube it probably does it to me it's stunning that there's not a competitor to YouTube not a real competitor yeah there's been Trott they've tried it's crazy Vimeo is just not not happening it's well it's a video hosting site but it's not it's not as user friendly well it's also doesn't suggest things their algorithm that YouTube is towed out to having what's next on the right hand side it's like so attractive yeah cuz there's always something there to click on right Vimeo does not is that they're not sophisticated in that way they want to be the artistic you know Coco Coulter they want to cultivate like this sexy little artist think YouTube's like fuck it here's everything you've ever wanted to see and ads for tampons we had we're putting up every video on Vimeo as well as on YouTube sure but on YouTube it'll have over a million videos and million hits and then you go to Vimeo on the same video I have like what twenty thirty thousand twenty thousand yeah yeah that's a good there's a so sick there viewer traffic is so much lower it's so much lower on my watch Vimeo is when someone sends me a link like and you got to think that video link is being sent to whatever million people I have on Twitter totally I have like two million people and two million Russian BOTS I'm not sure which one they're all BOTS I don't know I don't know how that works I'm using about some of them they say it's if you haven't used it to post but there's a lot of people that use Twitter and they don't post so like how do you know if someone's a bot like there's some suspicion of their their detection Matt for me to decide who's I always can tell when you look at their fucking profile oh yeah the stuff they write is so funny oh there's definitely some of those you know I get a lot of those on Instagram get a lot of those really yeah yeah weird like fake comments you know like I learned how to make a hundred know that those things are everywhere you know it's a it's like who are they getting with that like who are they oh they going after literally nobody yeah nobody they can't make any money that's got to be just like a whole sold people so get really man I watched the saddest show once with this old dude kept getting he kept getting scammed by this Nigerian scammer who was pretended he
