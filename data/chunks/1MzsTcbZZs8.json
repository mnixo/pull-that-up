hello freak bitches do you get blood work done um I haven't I I've got prescription to like measure like all like my nutrient levels and I've just been too lazy to go get it done that's ridiculous though you're a professional at the highest level of the yeah and I'm I'm an idiot I don't know I just I just procrastinator with it because you know one day I'll I'll feel like crap you know I'll be talking on my osteopath no but I go get these bloodwork done see what your deficiencies are so we'll get a prescription and I'll never go do it I'm scared of needles that's a big thing you're scared really I pass out I'm not scared to fight in a cage that passes many times doing like IVs or stuff like that yeah man I hate it so like when you're rehydrating like when they give you an IV you pass out yeah faint call it and I wake up and everyone's looking at I almost attacked Feroz and a couple guys because I've woken up and didn't know where it was and I was just like I used to date this girl who couldn't even watch someone get a needle in a movie she would black out yeah yeah if I think about it too hard and I'll like get like my stomach will like that's so weird yeah but that's so illogical I don't understand what that is and it only happened like it only started happening like four or five years ago really more like blood like because you have to get blood work done for the fights right right past like your HIV and all that stuff and before I would just be like yeah and it's done walk away now then all of a sudden out of nowhere every time and I see a needle coming my way like my foot my face will get white for no reason that's so strange so I have to like get on my phone like this I have to lay down like itself and yes like look away and look oh yeah distract myself Wow even talking about right now I'd like it like that's so strange I mean it was it would make more sense it was something you always had yeah it's so weird like my ex-girlfriend her dad had it and she said that her dad one time her brother got like a severe sunburn and yet blisters all over him selling the dad saw it and dad fainted and what's crazy is it down was a fucking doctor he was it was he was a dentist okay so I mean how the fuck is this guy like me obviously must deal with some fucked up shit and gory things he doesn't in dentistry - yeah weird well he I guess he was okay with needles but he would see certain things like he saw his son with the blisters yes because you know like from from the Sun from the sunburn yeah and he apparently had a really bad sunburn yes it's fucking weird right yeah it's in her family I guess but it's weird that you acquired it that's very nowhere it was just like one it was I was doing the blood work for a fight I was at the hospital and I was just like every day and then I passed out and ever since then it happens so I have to be really careful but this guy goes around and just records people regular people walks up to you records you and puts online and and whatever he edits it together and puts it on YouTube well that's kind of fucked up it's very fucked up what that's it it's very fucked up is he a Korean I wouldn't know we know who the guy is no no idea so he doesn't put himself on ever fuck that guy so he walks up to people and gets various responses some people like he walks up to to all this stuff got pulled off youtube but it's on liveleak now he walks up to two Mormons you know the ones that go door-to-door and they're super polite they're like whoa they're like oh you're recording us whatever like they have a nice conversation and they walk off but then other people they're trying to knock them out but I think it's so it's so interesting how the camera in and of itself almost has this social view of like like a weapon in a way right like you're pointing that thing at me because you're attempting looks like the person's not doing anything wrong by pointing the thing no no I mean the purse when it's getting regarded you're not doing anything wrong why does it make us feel so uncomfortable for a bunch of other people to enter into your life if you take a guy I take a camera on you yeah I don't know you I find you I take camera yeah and I put it on the YouTube channel that has a million subscribers like yours does well no no let's say the person doesn't know that when they're being recorded okay not right like if you're out in the street well I probably doesn't count for you because somebody might know who you are and what in that case but if you're a regular everyday person and someone walks up to you with their smartphone and they're just a few feet away from you recording you that like that's what he's doing he's not announcing that it's going to be on YouTube but people's reactions are intense yeah should be fun it still is fun kick him in the dick fucker but maybe he wins but he wins that way he wins the house he win cuz I stole his phone no because that's important cuz that's a way better clip if you don't get it if you don't get that phone oh I'll get his phone well whatever you met you may be more gifted than others who fail in his clips to get it from him he's like a sprinter well he starts to get oh he moves away at the right time this guy is crazy he interrupts like he there are cases where he walks behind the cash register at McDonald's and starts recording people that are like wow making burgers and they're just like what the fuck or in certain cases like you know he walk like that guy he walks into like a card game that's going on private card game and he's recording it like he takes risks to get that footage but I agree with you fuck that guy but at the same time I think it sort of unveils something about humanity and how we're not completely ready for a fully recorded future
