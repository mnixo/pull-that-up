boom here we go yes buddy how are you great good to be here we were talking before the podcast about people who get mad when I have you on like is if you're some sort of a monster if you're you're a mean person but I don't I say you're a New York Jew your snarky yeah say funny things but this idea that you're a Nazi or something like people of gotten so this is this icebreaker hey by the way why do people think you're not see someone sent me I don't read comments on Twitter but someone sent me something like you having this guy on today and I'm like that is so hilarious I go this guy is yeah there's some shit you say I don't agree with sure you're very reasonable and very intelligent yeah the last chapter of the book is me arguing with the nuts conversation folks it's not bad it's not bad well it's kind of for them a religious thing right if someone is a sinner you can't acknowledge them they have to be outside of the fort that's a good way to look at it that is what it is you know what's interesting it's I know these people don't mean to do this this is not their plan but if you wanted to keep Donald Trump in office the would the way that people that oppose Donald Trump are behaving is the perfect way to keep them in office if you tell high schoolers if you smoke your parents are gonna get upset and the teachers are gonna get upset that's the biggest commercial right right so you tell these kids hey if you go to these websites and read these books then your parents and the establishment and the teachers are all gonna be afraid of you well sign me up I mean it's as simple as that the same exact psychology and they're driving people to the fringe they are and the the deep platforming thing is fascinating because the way this stuff works folks is when people get deep platform the first people that will get deep platformed are people that you agree with getting deep platformed people like you know I'll go real Nazi like someone who's an avowed white supremacy like yeah deep platform that guy and that's a little slippery cuz then it's like this guy's a suspected Nazi or this guy is friends with a Nazi or this guy had a right see on his show this guy had a white supremacist on the show this guy had a guy who thinks it's okay to be white on his show and then it gets it gets more as it gets more and more progressive it gets more and more preposterous but it really is great once you accept one grade then you drop below it a little bit more preposterous and then that's acceptable and then a little bit more and then that becomes accepted and it's a double standard between people who are Orthodox and people who are unorthodox Barbara Walters sat down with Castro she sat down with Qaddafi who's killed how many people yeah that's fine you could sit down with the murderous dictator if you're Qaddafi if you sit down with someone at a podcast with someone who has all point views that is somehow different what's a new thing right it's a platforming and deep platforming and you put putting this guy on your platform like all this this kind of this kind of communication is very new I just didn't exist no one was saying that to Mike Wallace no one no one's saying that as you're saying to Barbara Walters that was my argument to the daily ins data and society lady I said oh Jesus I said Barbara Walters interviewed Fidel Castro does that make her a communist like right and I interviewed Milo am i a gay conservative provocateur now are you I don't think so well I mean what what what they what they're trying to do is thanks to social media they no longer have a monopoly and I don't mean they have just mean like Orthodox thought doesn't mean left-wing a right-wing Orthodox thought no longer has a monopoly on the microphone and that's very dangerous if you want to basically set the boundaries of what acceptable discourse is same thing with forget politics suck up music right if you want to say these are the cunt you shouldn't have lyrics like this people shouldn't dance like this they shouldn't you know dress a certain way this is what they would like I mean back in the 90s you remember they'd have the warning labels on CDs and says this has explicit lyrics yeah and that way Walmart could with clean hands say we're not being involved politics we're following their rules so that's what this data society lady's trying to do it's like okay I'm giving you target whatever company an excuse these are the people you don't need to deal with and then they could say well it's not up to us we're looking at this from an external point of view well and also my perspective on is it there's certain subjects I think that we can all agree we need to cover and we need to deal with in terms of laws and terms of the way the government is run but a lot of these disagreements aren't on that a lot of these disagreements seem to be just on political ideologies and like liberal versus conservative ideologies and people think differently they have different styles of behavior and thinking this is why like if you had a station that played hip-hop and all of a sudden you just got a bunch of Aerosmith songs playing like what the fuck is this this is not what I want get this off the station except for walk this way that's good well the one with run diems yeah that was one exception but that that's sort of how a lot of people seem to be approaching conservative versus progressive thinking is it's like once you have this mindset you don't want to hear other opinions as if they're gonna influence you or if you don't like the way they sound you don't like what they're do and you want to get them off the channel and this is what it seems like is happening with social media platform right is that these social media platforms are like we're a country station we don't play heavy metal get that shit off our network like we are a progressive network we don't play conservative get that stuff off well if they had said that we're progressive network wave like I serve that would be honest and fair but the claim is no we're banning people who are doing X Y & Z yeah and you know for people that are like oh my god they're talking about this again fuckers listen this is really important shit this is gonna decide how we this is this didn't exist before okay and now it does now we have this unbelievable ability to communicate and I'm enjoying it right now talking to you right we're all enjoying it if you're tweeting about this or writing comments about this but it's if this really branches off until one side get to do it and one side doesn't we're gonna have a fucking tremendous problem in this country if you think that this problem that we have right now and it's it's just starting to be an issue over the last couple years if you think that this is what this could escalate like a serious conflict which I mean almost like it's it's absolutely reasonable to think that violence could come out of this well the Trump presidency was escalation before Trump it was okay fake news was this left idea that like this you know these new sites are putting out lies you your if your point of view is different too it's not just wrong it's illegitimate right and a lot of people in that both in booth and said you want a legitimacy ok I'm voting for Donald Trump for president and now he's in the White House so for you to say that people to say that these ideas you know are evil and shouldn't be discussed those are separate concepts because even if you think they're evil if from your point of view it's in the White House are you going to pretend this isn't the most powerful man in the world it's there's a big contradiction there but one of the things progressivism offers many people is this idea of truth and certainty knowing you're one of the good guys and knowing you're in the majority and when you find that that is not always true I think that causes some cognitive stress yeah no I would absolutely agree with that I just think there's a real problem that's happening now with some of the accounts that I'm seeing getting banned without reason without reason for things that are like parody accounts well our pay dogdom so I interrupt you he's the one who made this great meme during the State of the Union where he's had President Trump and all the piece of footage from the State of the Union of the Democrats looking pissed and he put it over the song everybody hurts right this two-minute video it's it's a joke it's fun right you could see on staring live and you don't have to be Republican or Democrat to to laugh at sourpusses they got his copyright strike because it's like you're on the right to use the music Trump had retweeted it he put on another one he just got suspended for a week he did the the video from my book so they know here's the thing if someone is a name you can say hey delete this tweet it violates our guidelines right you given warnings you could call their manager they don't do that you're just vanished overnight and there's something very Soviet about this because when they vanish you your entire archives get vanished too and it's like wait a minute this person is bad and dangerous don't you want to show other people as an example of what to avoid like this will get you banned so you can modify your behavior accordingly but what they want apparently it looks like what they want is for everyone to be self censoring yeah and to be afraid and that way it's like instead of saying we're censorious it's like you made that decision on your own why no Trump has been talking about this now because it affects so many people that are his supporters right now and he's been discussing that the idea that these people need to abide by the First Amendment and then there's your argument either they're a private company they could whatever they want and they can decide whatever they want or they're protected by the 1st measure you know I had Tulsi Gabbard on the other day she was running a lot of her I love her too and she's running he won't I asked her doing my show she wouldn't reply really yeah why I don't know she didn't reply I don't know how men compound media I guess digital oh yes digital that's even more disgusting than compound media that's the problem you don't like good ways in all the good ways I love Lois I love all those guys savages they she's probably a girl fuck I got savage adjacent like I'll have those guys I mean I have officially gotten permission that the room we all recording is called the gas chamber oh Jesus yeah you could say that I could say yeah put that privilege yeah that's pretty much it yeah yeah maybe she will um I'll tell her about it but she was on her and I are besties yeah I really do respect the shit out of her I really do you know I'd love to call her Madame president I think that would be dope she's smart man she's she's she's so measured which doesn't have all the answers and some of the things that she says are things that you say you know I'm not sure gonna we're gonna have to work to create more jobs like those kind of that kind of talk is like politician talk and I go okay well what would that mean and we'll have to figure that out and I think she's sincere but these answers you know don't really exist like how to fix inner cities like how to like these are there like someone that some of the big issues that she discussed we talked about like horrible neighborhoods that have always been harmed right like how is this like we're going to fucking Afghanistan trying to fix the yeah yeah and we're not trying to fix Chicago the Southside Chicago what's happening now all right why are so many people getting shot I can we can fix you know it's funny back in the day they had something called slum clearance and the idea was if you tear down these old buildings and build new buildings somehow the crime is gonna go away and this is a big moment it's just like yeah it's the building small fucking haunted houses they have decades of decades of crack and bullets Florence room that's so crazy but she's great because she my biggest issue is anti-war yes and anyone for me whose first priority isn't let's stop killing people yes that I'm a fan of yeah and she's also a veteran yeah sixteen years yeah I'm a big fan but you know I think this country needs more you know we need we need real plans we need like someone we just the way we engineer software systems you know search engines operating systems or cell phones they should engineer society I mean we should really be looking at in terms of the potential for prosperity opportunity all these different things that we don't cover we just sort of leave so much up to chance because we buy the the bullshit that like I mean I think we all know at this point then not everyone's on an even playing field we're just not but we don't I think the other thing a lot of people know that well they're fucking crazy and that's the problem yeah yes they're fucking crazy if you don't think that being born in a crime-ridden neighborhood with violence all around you and being exposed to at an early age fucks your head up not even mean that I think the fact that I admit that a lot of people aren't hard-working oh yeah this is that today and I'd like to say that out there it's shocking to many people I guess some people are bad some people think that just because they show up at work and they don't want to that they're working hard right right it's hard for them yeah you fucking you just go lucky or you do that you know when I read that was one of the more hilarious things that I've ever heard of crazy progressive person right if you are successful it is because someone else got fucked over that's so disturbing but it's such a crazy way to look at it it's like okay somewhere down the chain or if you have an iPhone someone got fucked over that someone lost their iPhone logic right no no no the logic is someone had to work as a slave in Foxconn to make these fucking iPhones for like 15 cents a week or whatever they make over there but if that slave wasn't making 15 cents a week that slave would be dead that's what there has been saying it's squirrely right cuz but yeah but is that okay like when they go to third world countries and set up these sweatshops and like I knew someone who had one and they were like doing fucking mental gymnastics to try to justify and I was like wait a minute how much he pay these people and they're like they were gonna starve to death if it wasn't for us Mike are you sure they were there right they were there they probably been there for thousands of years like where'd you go like Guatemala where was it Argentina Laguerre yousa give you two examples that are maybe I can't speak to specific and world example look at North Korea which is obviously my beat yeah that's your B so there is a zone between North and South Korea where they work together DMZ mother no but it's like this enrichment zone it can work together right so the North Koreans work there the South Koreans kind of put it together and the government takes like 95% of your money and also North Koreans who work in Russian logging camps where the government takes like 95 percent your money they're slaves they're 100 percent slaves Wow but they're beating down their doors to work in these locations because they're providing for their family and they're still wealthier than the alternative now this is a very extreme situation this isn't like I don't know third world what country your friend is a sweatshop in but there are circumstances where a lot of people on the left and on the right don't understand often that politics and economics is about often you have two bad choices like what is the alternative it's like what do you like for example you're gonna put forth the law what are you gonna do about people who are going to look at this law not in good faith like there was that guy was named zoomy zoomy who said I'm trans and he just made a video boobie zubi yeah he just broke the woman's deadlift referee yeah woman he look out yeah by the way they took those records away from that Australian woman there's a guy that was Australia right wasn't the world the powerlifting woman's world record she broke like three of them so it's not even about trans stuff it's like what do you do with any law when someone is going to act in bad faith and if you can't account for that you're not being responsible with your proposal yeah this isn't even a law though but we're talking about with the trans a fleets it's just it's loopholes so some weird people don't want to be seen as transphobic in today's climate so they're allowing preposterous things what was that like for you and you were talking I remember when you're talking to Adam on this show that got pretty heated oh yeah I'm ruins everything yeah yeah it didn't get heated we just I mean I never got upset we've absolutely disagreed but he had some crazy notions about competition that didn't make any sense either like that somehow or another this ports are designed to favor men what yeah it didn't make any sense it was a lot of it was progressive rehashing up in my opinion yeah I think it sounded good to him but I don't know how much actual thought he's put into it what's actually interesting is like in his show he's well researched and no one's opposing these this data that he's putting out so he gets to say these things it's one of the problems with like writing a blog or making a video about something where no one goes actually that's not really true this is why that's not true let me explain and this is why you're wrong and now continue see when you can just go on these long unchecked rants that's where you get like Flat Earth believers that's what that shit's from they watch those videos yeah and they go oh this makes sense but this is why it's so important that unorthodox voices don't get deep platformed because even if that person is proposed putting forth things that are completely full of shit their criticism and their perspective they might have some truth in it and at the very least like when I was a child so when I talk to these people by talking to them it makes me think through why do I believe what I believe why is my truth the actual truth and I'm gonna be challenged on my views and I'm going to have a better grounding for them as opposed to like you're saying if I'm sitting here just giving a monologue and no one ever calls me out of my bullshit yeah I think I see what you're saying I think what they think is you have to silence these bad voices like the anti-vaccine you got a silence and deeper sort of taking anti-vaccine they're taking anti-vaxxers down you know I don't know how much they actually know about the science you know I don't I mean vaccines are incredible for health in terms of what they've done to protect us from disease they've stopped smallpox they've stopped polio and when you see these outbreaks of measles that is a direct result of people not getting vaccinated you know does that mean that no one's ever been hurt by vaccines no no it doesn't man there's a vaccine court people been injured people have died that's a fact but that's I think just a part of medical procedures and human beings men a lot of kids die every from circumcision yeah they get infections they lose their penises yeah yeah it's like very common like way more common in terms of like the numbers per year than you would ever want to hear Oh God okay people die from things they get infections people get have allergic reactions to certain chemical but then this problem is now those vac stores can say we're being covered up yeah now they're honest it's the truth not being covered and are being covered up yeah so it's very it's a I think a problem is who's right and who's wrong like if if you're a person and you have a child and you're terrified can you go to these websites like oh my god I don't want my kid to get autism like but they're saying that vaccines cause autism I'm not vaccinating my kid I'm not gonna take the chance and that's where a lot of it comes in yeah if you watch those videos and you watch a video that's not done by a scientist that's not up to date on what we know about what cause like I had Peter Hotez on who's very knowledgeable about vaccines and very knowledgeable about diseases in general and he was describing the the what they think the causes of autism are that how it takes place in the womb and how what's most likely happening is it's just expressing itself at the same time that the kids getting vaccinated and you're correlating the two things together well there's also the movement of not regarding autism as a problem or your coda you know children of deaf adults you know you have these parents whose kids are deaf and they refuse to get them cochlear implants to give them the ability here because they think that's losing Deaf culture now to me you never heard this no this is the thing yeah yeah there's me everything is a thing because what you can see when you think about if it's a few seconds you can understand where they're coming from cuz you want to be like while you're saying I'm bad because I'm deaf and it was like but then you hear people that are like trans disabled do you know what that is whether that was they cut their hand off because they feel like they're supposed to have no hand no oh yes oh yeah see these things this is what I'm saying like they're all I'm lumping them all together because what they are is all of them are these weird variables when it comes to human behavior and thinking and patterns and biology all these weird variables where you get so many numbers if you have all these people three whatever million we have in this country you're gonna have a few thousand of almost every far variable every weird variable good lord Lord yeah all I know is the politics that the health stuff I don't even want to wait into that dude that was why I was there was an old website that I was going to what was that body modification extreme that guy from DME he died when they loved the lizard guy no the cat guy his name was Shannon Shannon Shannon laureate is how you say his name but BM e X body modification extreme was the website and he and I became like pen pals going back like he sent me some stuff fun I wrote something wants about body modification like what kind of weird shit people do and he's like he may have you ever have any questions feel free to ask me there's my website he sent me a password to his wet because it was like one of those things you had to pay for a membership I was like holy shit you go to this website and it's just it was just this was in the 90s okay and it's the most freakish weirdest fucking body modifications and there's a whole culture behind people putting horns on their heads and doing weird shit through their skin maybe just pulled you out and tattooing their whole face my friend Melissa she had magnets implanted on her fingers I don't know why well you never know alright I would I think the magnets well you have to pick things up you don't to close your hand frogs well people think that magnet Laguerre magnets is a wristband supposed to be good for you here's autism but the other maxi magnet you know it sounds stupid but they use magnetic therapy for veterans that have PTSD and CTE because there's areas of the brain that can actually stimulate with these very powerful magnets cat Zingano UFC fighter she went down there when she was having some serious repercussions from her fight with Amanda Nunez she got really battered badly in the first round and her hormones were out of whack for months afterwards she was all fucked up her cortisol levels were all fucked up and finally she went and got some of her sparring was off her timings off she was like I just have to rush people I didn't have any sense of timing oh yeah she was having real problems with her brain and they fixed it they fixed it with magnets these these electrode no pulse I'm just saying words that I don't understand so if you're a scientist sure this is focus I just tweeting at you feverishly right yeah it's very lies listen angry scientist I'm with you I'm retarded listen they throw these these these waves at the brain and somehow know these electromagnetic waves stimulate areas of the mind and it actually forces brain cells to grow and forces neural connections it's really interesting stuff cat Zingano explained it pretty pretty pretty in-depth but it really helped her so it's weird that a magnet would work for that but those are like really strong ones okay little ones around your wrist but it might yeah I don't know yeah I'm not spending the $24.99 in that fucking bracelet yeah but it's got an English guy that's that's how you know it's legit but it comes with a mop comes with a free chamois remember the ShamWow guy he's dead isn't he guys really you get bit by a hooker no it's the other one who got the oxy clean guys dead Billy whatever oh yeah I was alive yeah Billy was it was Tooting up yeah it's how it was yeah he had a lot of coconut system apparently right oh you got that oxy money clean your sizes out you want a fucking party he's probably had a yellow Lamborghini dick implant just made that part up I'm sure he's a great guy well what's in the middle I do want a television show they were doing a television show about him yeah he was well he had the pitchman it was like a sitcom or something it was a like a reality show reality time sure they're following them around doing pitches and stuff there's an art to that shit those guys the he he got me to analyze shark tank before them I think they were helping people do stuff sorta mm-hmm I like Kitchen Nightmares yeah I'm friends with the son oh the shark tanks under them well Billy Mays there's a Billy Mays son yeah what's his Joker terrific Bill Gates Jr disease the third oh the program mad we're talking about that he's I'm sure Billy Mays was a good guy but did he well yeah he's your friend yeah that's why he couldn't spawn anyway dude was partying the ShamWow guy was the guy who got bit attractive I actually think he bit someone that's yeah good someone like Marv Albert did Marv Albert bite someone yeah then he invite the lady I thought she bit him too huh I get my stories all confused because to do dudes too many too many vaccines that's your problem yes it is man they saved me from the measles they made me dumber what happened oh there it is Oh God oh he bit her it's happened a few times I think a ShamWow pitchman brutal beatdown yeah so they just went to war oh my god that's where eyes is that real I don't mean don't that mine every room that looks like makeup though always crazy that's like smoke yeah no it didn't look like makeup to me is symmetric looks like black guys that's what happen the no that's the look you know she she had his tongue and so he started punching her until she realized oh my god mouth tongue or in the conch now in the face oh my that's meth right daddy guess what's involved there no it's something crazy the meth not really what a PCP or like a bath salts Oh remember that if you're grabbing someone's tongue it's bath salts I think bath salts were meth though no yeah I think it was I think what it was was meth with the the I think they altered a molecule so that it doesn't fall into the protected Schedule one drug see that you can do things like that like that's why DMT was illegal but five methoxy DMT wasn't which is actually stronger mm-hmm um they missed that one here it goes what's that drug the last ten minutes Oh what is this bath salts well first of all here's another thing I think there's a bunch of different kinds of bath salts for Shore yeah for sure you got the lavender I mean but I mean nobody I don't think anybody has a patent you can't call that bath salts wait it's bath salts because of the name bath II oh no no no no the bath salts is because they were selling it in stores as bath oh not for human consumption wink well no but you just played that ever look like the chemical is back they owned no Kath okay no okay I misread it okay what what I'm saying is the yeah I'm labeled it bass also they could sell it but everybody knew it was Matt thought okay man that's bath salts over there you should try smoking that but it's in that house salvia was around for a long time salvia was around for the same reason five methoxy DMT was around yeah missed it in the sweeping Schedule one drug act of 1970 okay they missed that one was two of the most potent ones they missed salvia divinorum and five methoxy DMT that's why they're always changing it because they fit slightly different than you could say it's nothing exactly so see if you find that like bath salts is meth because someone there was a guy there was a guy who got a who's a homeless guy that I think they shot him he was biting someone's face off in Florida yeah you remember that yeah and they said that he was on bath salts that's the first time I heard of it yeah and I think someone said that it was meth that he was like he's like that cat stuff just but it's like you're saying it's just a bunch of did with Oh mephedrone so it is a potpourri you can basically sell whatever you want if you're selling it as not for human consumption and also I probably they probably put smell into it so they can say no this boat oh yeah you know they probably threw some fucking so they had like a little cat-and-mouse game going on for a while where they would have it's the same thing with one with that k2 spice stuff we'd stay as synthetic yeah actually they're spraying all over us I supposed to be terrible for awful yeah way worse for you than actual but they would outlaw one little chemical and then those guys would figure out okay tweak it and make th 379 okay and now next week is 380 and they just would keep doing it every single week literally and by the way that's the same shit that they did with steroids with like the clear when Barry Bonds and all those guys that ball co scandal that's what all that stuff was about no they just changed the like that points out the drug stuff around a little and it doesn't show up in this in the test because it's not the thing you're looking for the way it's been explained to me is a lot of tests for things are very specific so testing for something and it's just a little bit off so I can test negative for it but it has a similar result or approximate result in a different way huh yeah I will say that with the bath salts people were breaking into any place that had him hmm gas stations any store that had bath salts if they think they had them what your windows are being broken your doors are being broken yeah you're not gonna have that it's a mess tomorrow yes that yeah those are methods that's meth-head activity Jesus Christ do you know what did you ever know anybody there's a method No yeah I haven't known a few people it's weird to see because it's so visual the results well not always that's what's interesting what you're seeing when you see people that are completely fucked up and picking the skin off their face and they weigh 5 pounds and they're falling apart that is worst case scenario there's some people that I would call functional methods and what these people are people that are on amphetamines every day or almost every day they're constantly on a meta means that some of them get prescribed by doctors they get really irrational they start thinking and everyone's out to get them they get real mean and nasty towards other people very defensive there was there always attacking and thinking they're persecuted thinking that someone's attacking them this is very strange and these people could function like this for years years and years and you get the same with adderall addicts yeah yeah well that's just speed isn't it same thing yeah it's very similar to meth it's him feta means right it's just a different release like what adderall is Duncan Trussell has a great joke he's like as if it's a scientist took cocaine and went I can fix this this makes people talkative and aggressive and insulting and mean and any kids it like it highlights some of the worst aspects of people the bitchy pettiness I love that stuff that's my butter but it's not that's not you do it you do with a smile oh thank you that's true snarky people need to be having more fun yeah but you are your positions are always even if I don't agree with them they're rational I see your thought process I see where you're going well thank you that's a huge compliment on a method that way yeah are you saying the Jews are doing what what's happening with the Nazis that was a big one I get I interviewed a Nazi for the book and I said to my go look what what do I supposed to do when they you're people come at me and say the only reason you care about North Korea and its concentration camps is because they're anti-israel and he goes what do you want me to tell you there's idiots in every group right there because they're anti-israel the idea that Israel is do with North Korea is just like absolutely amazing but I get that online people connect to everything rival that are really into the nutty conspiracies there's a network of connections with it and then if you're not talking about it what they think is the most important issue you're clearly being dishonest because it's the most important issue must be a shoe yes Mossad that time over there in Korea are interested what South American to be over there North Korea hey I wanted to talk to you about this I don't know if you know anything about it but essentially Google has pulled the plug on Huawei today meaning they're no longer allowing Android updates on Huawei phones and they're not allowing the Google app to work on on Huawei phones or excuse me the Gmail app to work on Huawei phones if you had an old Huawei phone with the Gmail app you're fine but going forward no Huawei phones will be allowed to have Gmail anymore what what's the reasoning it's a very good question marques Brownlee who's Marcus has been on the show before and he's probably one of my favorite if not my favorite tech reviewer on YouTube he had a point about it he you know he put it up on his Twitter and then I followed the feed he's like this is very important I follow the feet and there's tech people there saying there is no reason for this there's no evidence they're not pointing to anything but then when I talk to people that are experts in foreign policy and they explain the way China works in China's relationship between the government and industry how they're inexorably connected and yes every business works for the government they were saying no there's a reason why they're doing this like this these guys are playing this real long game and to aid them in any way is extraordinarily bad for our country yeah I had a Marion Smith from this game of communism on my show and since my focus in North Korea I wasn't that much folks in China and Hugh and we all think in the West that you know China's gotten so much better than it was which is true but he goes it's still really really really bad and one of the big I think fair criticisms of the corporate press is how much they're focused on Putin and Russia and it's like you calling him a dictator the shit they're pulling in China is an order of magnitude worse and something that they're doing now they stole from North Korea North Korea has a southern called song bun and everyone on bun somg be when sung won everyone in North Korea got interviewed and there's several iterations of this and you got a score based on your family so if you our family was born in South Korea or a priest or landowner that's a low score if you your grandfather fought with the great leader Kim il-sung that's a high score it's divided into favored class wavering and hostile and there's like 51 subcategories and this determines everything about your life where you live where you go to college and China is now starting to do this they're trying to implement a social credit system based on your loyalty to the government which will allow things like leaving the country and all sorts of other opportunities and that's scary scary stuff and that's what needs to be I think covered much more in the West the problem with that is it becomes like a game and people are gonna want to have a really high school of course that's if people are so weird when it comes to scores and games but we get so that you have to have a high score or else you're not getting food that's our job right right right yeah but it's also like people coveted oh but they don't tell your score oh geez you have to intimate it oh yeah scary oh yeah yeah so you got to fly right and so you're always nervous Europe that's what they want you're always nervous it's not a transparency self-censoring as well yes right it forces a system of self censoring like Twitter yes are you saying that Twitter is like China did you say that Twitter's like communist in those words yes no we got a ways to go for communism but some of the techniques they use are very disturbingly totalitarian yes disturbingly so and the other thing is yes they are private company it's funny how the left is like as soon as you criticize Twitter their private company do they want but any other private company whatever a private company can be criticized and if you know you're perfectly appropriate in a free market to say what you're doing is screwed up and give us answers or we're gonna use another company I think when I talked to Jack about this one of the things that he was saying is that they're considering an open Twitter like they're gonna have Twitter where it's like a safe neighborhood and Twitter where it's like the Wild West okay and I said please do that yeah I said please do that you know I mean but if he does is to block people this ways to avoid people I block people liberally you know it's weird though block lists when you never even had an interaction since I want it's like a blacklist yeah and you go to their page and they're blocked you just blocked just down why no reasons people have blocked lists for anyone who follows President Trump yeah and it's like if I'm a journalist yeah I sure as hell better be following the fucking president right know what he says first of all he says hilarious shit yes on the Reg look he does what's your favorite Trump tweet Rocket Man when he was calling my favorite one Jim John owned rocker man what's the the one about the haters and the losers yes that's a great one but he did that before he was president yeah thousand thirteen it's still of my favorite trophy by far oh yeah every time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection they cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up I would like if he said that now as president now that's one thing he's really doing done a great job as president not swearing yeah it's amazing well did you see what CNN did to him during the campaign he said boy that's really up so he didn't say it they played the clip and they believed him yes we talked about this yeah yeah it's very dishonest yeah they bleeped it to make it look like he said something he didn't but he's cursing ass blue streak in the White House anyway we all know this but it's funny I like it I think that part is funny like I'm not I'm not happy with a lot of what's going on but I'm very happy that he's this ridiculous person I think it's funny and I think it's very healthy for us to have less reverence for the president because when a president's on a pedestal he's in a position to send our sons and daughters to die whereas if you look at him as a clown you're gonna be much less more skeptical of is this man going to war for the right reasons is he doing these things for the right reasons and I think that's very and that's what the founding fathers wanted to they didn't want the president to be looked at as a god yeah that's an interesting point though I think you're correct and I think this idea that its behavior unfitting for a president that's what we're thinking that a president is a special person right that's real job and they'll act accordingly like a gentleman and they're human beings it's a stupid job it's a ridiculous job anyway and you sub Biden went after Trump and says Oh being presidential as always yeah by definition he's always being presidential cuz he's the fucking president and you're not well Biden's a weird guy do you see all this videos him sniffing those kids no what is that about and it could just be a sweet old grandpa I know some sweet Oh grandpa's don't want to fuck kids they do do that I the thing is it would in a sense be make more sense to people if he was just like handsy right it's like okay this is like I don't even know where to put this where do you put sniffing yeah it's a fucking weird thing he's just a weird guy did you know about the the plagiarism from back when he's running from say he ran three times I think he's fucked in the primary because his track record is pathetic so the first time he ran was an 88 cycle right he announces in July he has to fold by September because this plagiarism scandal right he runs again in a way it comes in like what sixth in Iowa has to pull so he in terms of his history of running for presidency it's been very very poor he's a good backup man he's right right cuz a steady reliable result yes you stay the fuck out who's look it's they're gonna eat him alive it's ugly it's gonna be ugly you're gonna hate it bro and you're not gonna win they're gonna die don't think he's gonna but he's the front-runner you look at the Democratic polls in terms of the Democrats you know who is the front-runner at this point in 2003 who Joe Lieberman because he was the vice presidential candidate from Gore yeah everyone knew his name what happened with that guy he lost that he would where'd he go he what he went right didn't he he what they he lost the primary in his state of Connecticut then he ran as an independent Democrat won again by reelected he killed universal health care because they needed 60 votes and he's like fuck you we're not doing it so they had to have this Obamacare mark systems because of him and now everyone hates him didn't he turn into a Republican though no no but he endorsed that heard it you became a Nazi [Laughter] Joe Lieberman invention urethane you're not cz the new right yeah the fact that he gets called one that's the funniest shit ever while he's wearing a yarmulke people call them or not so that you you'd never suspect it yeah sneaky its we're sneaky hmm I just think if we had a design a system from scratch there's no way we'd have one person at the top of the pyramid right doesn't make any sense and doesn't need to be a pyramid yeah doesn't it could be a series of silos yeah no reason I mean I guess the good thing would be that person can veto stuff and get things done sure so if there is some sort of if he's a reasonable person and he really works well with those and doesn't abuse that power one thing he has done those what I mean I'm it's gonna sound ridiculous but when he has Kim Kardashian bringing cases of people that were unjustly prosecuted or unjustly imprisoned and he releases them a guy like that I like that she does it and I like that he does it takes a lot for me to get angry but when people were clowning them and I'm like Kim Kardashian you can say a lot of shit about her she saved people's lives she's helping people in a tremendous way you're gonna tell those families that Kim Kardashian is fuck you she's helped seventeen people be released from prison in the last three months and I think it's also very disturbing how glib a lot of people are about prison you know and it's a really I don't know what it's like and I don't want to know what it's like don't worry it's no joke yeah so but it is a punchline and it's like you're laughing about people being traumatized for life and possibly having no possibility of returning into society if this is people used to be able to laugh about stuff like that cuz it would be like laughing at it at work you know you go to work and you're like eh OJ's in the can he's gonna take it in the cab you would go to work and you'd say something stupid like that and you wouldn't go anywhere but when you say something like that on Twitter or Facebook like oh boy remember um I mean people find out you say the inappropriate thing remember that what justine sacco of course something i was flying here for this show and someone tweeted me hashtag his malice landed yet because that was the hashtag for her oh yeah cuz she tweeted out a joke she gets on a flight yeah and it blew up while she's of the flight right and when she lands her life is ruined yes inside for a dumb joke yeah that jump joke could have been something that you would just say and then the next day Bueller what the fuck is wrong with me I was on ambien and alcohol and I'm gonna be funny and that is something that the evangelical left is very scary about about being about if you're too if you take a joke and that's inappropriate in some sense and they're the ones judging it's inappropriate your life should be ruined that is crazy and totalitarian yeah it's um it's also it smacks of deep insecurity and fear that you experience personally and you want to turn it on other people the same feeling that people have when they're bullies the reason why someone's a bully is almost always because they're not confident of their own ability so they want to somehow or another by being cruel to someone else they exercise this power on someone else and it's somehow another relieves them of a certain portion of this inadequacy that they feel the stress they feel it's why one of the reasons why a lot of people are saying that bullies it's contrary to like what would think would be a logical thing you should teach them how to fight and they wouldn't want to do this the reason why they're doing this to people is because they're insecure that's the same thing I think when you're when you see these Twitter mobs and people attacking people the thing they fear most is that they're gonna be attacked themselves the thing they feel oh yeah I think what they feel social they fear social authorization and the fear they fear that they fear being standing up on their own two feet and being an individual and I have a whole chapter on dark humor in this book and I'm shocked that they let me publish it because body MacFarland great comedian she has she was roasting Jim Norton and she says to him your show is so unlistenable I'd rather hear my daughter drowning and it's like are you gonna do it but you know let's say let's break this down are you gonna tell her as a comedian or as a mom that that's not appropriate oh she's so they only made me cut one joke I have everything else in there and the point I make is something might not be funny for you if you're an assault victim right you don't want to kind of fight that's fine right but it's not that's me and if something's not for you doesn't mean it's not for anyone what is uh the new write this is the title of your book yeah a journey to the fringe of American politics well what inspired you so the circles I was swimming in started going into developing into the scene as it was happening that culminated in like the Trump presidency in charlottesville so I was there as this was happening what circles we discussing this kind of the anarchist circles the the what they call race realism the racists you know and then all right and seeing a lot of it happening just being discussed in the press and people not knowing what they're talking about I'm like all right someone's got to write this book who's been there and understands it and it might as well be how do you understand that like what what what about it you know like the race realist because I the one of the points I make is this is not one scene where everyone's in agreement these people often completely hate each other and disagree the only thing that unites them is their opposition to progressivism and this is you looking at this as a journalist when you say sure yeah but the way you're saying it's like you're a part of these groups well I was the I'm like all right I went to all the meetings you know I go to Charlottesville and interviewed all the types I had yeah you know and it's what their points of view are and if you're gonna engage with this kind of thinking which is somewhat prevalent on the fringes you have to at least understand where they're coming from and being dismissed and there's a power for sure but what I want to say is because I don't want people to misconstrue you so someone could listen to this and inadvertently Mis consortium is construe and think that you're a part of these groups oh no no it's very clear in this book who I absolutely yeah in the book but the way we're it's discussing it in this conversation you're saying the circles that you running yeah cuz a lot of the people who I was friends with fell down this rabbit hole they fell down the rabbit hole of not easiest and racism yes and that one who that you were friends well don't i'm not name one saying yeah because and it was very disturbing real-life correct Wow and it was very disturbing to watch as they start throwing our terms like HPD and Iraq was a human by diversity that's their code word for different races right human biodiversity is the code word for different races yes and what's the other one hbf and nrx and Iraq near reaction so this is basically America is this decadent Weimar Republic and we need to return to like hardcore Rio react knio knio knio knio reactions that was the hashtag before was the alt-right but it's not the same buddy they're similar enough so and a lot of these guys are really cerebral you know they could tell you what the history of England they could tell you about you know all the science and so what went along with it with whom with them I don't know what what went wrong I think one of the things that goes wrong is when no one's talking to you and you're just talking to each other yeah you're gonna start doubling down because there's no one hitting the brakes you know what else happens what you say controversial things people attack you and then some people don't attack you they support you yes and then you gravitate towards yes support you right and then you get that endorphin rush you get the light yes you start seeing that with people and they start embracing really weird fringe ideas they become a part of these fringe groups they get praised by these fringe groups and then they elevate to divert you signal for that fringe group and so it you could be either an average person in the mass or you could be a leader in the fringe so it's big fish in a small pond and you could be one of those who knows one of those who knows right people know what the fuck is going on right so not gonna get me with this scam so my line is you take one red pill but not the whole bottle you take the adderall bro fucking adderall no one's gonna I know what's happening start stashing weapons in your backyard yeah so that it's it's an interesting and there's also a long history of this stuff so how did you know those guys in real life did you know them from work did you know I knew them from like like anarchist circles so yeah this anarchy thing like how serious are you about that a hundred percent 100 percent sir yes so anarchists think there should be no cops know that anarchists don't think this should be government cops there's no private security private security whoops before what well same thing you know one wants to have a scenario like if you go to a bar you're not paying for the doorman or if you're going to a hotel you're not paying for security the point is whoever has an environment wants it to be as safe as possible okay stop right there okay because if you go into a bar if you're buying a drink the bar is taking some of the money from that drink to pay for that security correct it's the same thing as you paying taxes it's not to save the a see pink text so let's just look at it this way it's just money into a pool it's not just like oh please if you throw the money into a pool but let me explain okay if you throw the money into the pool okay and obviously taxes get taken from you it's different in that regard but if you have a certain amount of money certain amount of money is gonna go to protecting the people and this is the idea of police force and this is the idea of a bouncer at least a bouncer is more likely acting in the interest of the club and trying to keep out bad people they're gonna keep people from getting sued but the money for the drinks goes to that some of it a percentage goes that sure much like you tax money some of it goes to the cops sure right correct but the big difference is one is voluntary and one is forceful and one is a monopoly and one isn't so if you had a free system you would have more security because the streets would have someone doing security and the bar and the store and there would be complimentary to each other as opposed to you only have two down on one one wouldn't it look how many dating sites there all right wouldn't it be great if instead of one number you had dozens of places that are going to offer you security so like private businesses that work like uber you give them a call when you getting raped like you press a button a short one with the dude on you press a button and then someone shows up we have that now and right we have no I mean we if you go to a apartment building or a business building there's gonna be security there already you're gonna yeah you're not gonna call the cops are gonna call the downstairs we're just book readers shirts in there playing with their phone they used to be book readers to other phone players well I'd rather they be reading books than shooting dogs so that's where we are right you see we said in terms that's the grossest shit ever when you see SWAT teams show up and yes these people's dogs and people get and that's the problem with having a monopoly is there's no constant yes so let's say there's all these cases where you know dogs get shot the flash grenade in the baby's crib these people aren't fight like a Eric Gardner the only person who got in trouble for Eric garner dying is the guy who filmed it mm-hmm I mean if you are a cook and you are serving food and you undercooked chicken it's a mistake honest mistake and someone gets sick that shouldn't be your job mmm but if you're a police officer often and I'm going to get a lot of heat for this and that's fine if you something bad happens as a consequence of your actions there have to be consequences that maybe this isn't the right job for you well oftentimes there is if there's an inappropriate shooting or subclone those lines but I think you're right and I mean I've experienced abusive cops I think we all have and I also think that it's very very very difficult to be that guy absolutely and not become abusive and not become worn out by it not become extremely stressed out I'm a big supporter of police I just don't think that it's a job for everybody I think being a cop is like a lot of other jobs that are especially that one that's super fucking difficult the idea that you just hire people off the street and run them through some tests and they're gonna make great cops I agree it's crazy I agree and what happens is when you're a monopoly you don't have to be efficient or effective I think they should hire former military that's what I think at least a hire people no hire people that have discipline hire people that that have gone through some experience in actual combat who know how to handle pressure better and then make it a very very valuable job and make it a very like very strict codes of conduct and and behavior and in action I think another problem that police have in their defense is when you have public streets people have certain rights and they can act have where they're like here in LA you have only seen these tents and I thought my understanding is the government said you can't clear out those tents that is hilarious isn't it and now the cops can't do anything so they are hamstrung from being able to do their jobs whereas if this was private this would not be happening well if you go under under passes in their life folks I don't know where you live but there's a fucking campground then literally they have tents yeah everywhere I went two sided no Skid Row was an actual place I didn't know I went there last time I was here and they were the the whole block is covered in tents I was unbelievable people who don't know I love to take them to skid row it's just amazing Downtown LA's insane like you go there like what is this well what this is is failure this is fail you know I mean cultural failure failure to address these members of our community fare failure to provide health care failure to raise children correctly failure to keep people from drugs failure to provide good systems to get them off of drugs it started in New York - de Blasio who's a real charmer that one like now every ball you go into every subway train there's a homeless person with all their bags yeah and this there's got to be better alternatives than that even for them well there's some what Oh Donald Trump jr. posted videos all over the news the other day when he was talking about the de Blasio he's like this is I'm driving here I'm Lissa's out my window and filming look good look at all these tents he was homeless shit he started following me on Twitter and now I live in fear of like say the wrong thing again I don't know it's just like holy Sh because North Korea is my biggest issue by far right by far but what do you in fear of getting unfollowed by Donald Trump do ya follow you well he better not no I have friends that are friends with him okay like good friends like my good friends and they're good friends with him okay I'll slide it tastes like him they say he's a good guy let's see what I slide into his DMS do it he's just in a weird position man if he wasn't the the the president's son he wouldn't be under so much scrutiny be like he's a great guy okay so everybody's just like oh you're the president's son but it's weird for me given that that was my beat that I'm like one step away from being able to influence policy on that issue was the most important thing to me boy I get it yeah what would you tell him about North Korea I mean I wouldn't even know where to start I would just I would think I'd have a lot of information about helping with the psychology how to kind of influence them how to basically manipulate them mm-hmm also how evil they truly really and truly are and always to keep that in mind so it's a dance it's a very delicate dance with them hmm do you think he's gonna get in trouble with Russia who which ones all Trump doing you know you think he will I don't know I don't think so I don't think so yeah you don't think anybody's you think it's over I don't think it's over it's not I don't think it's over because people if after three years of reporting now you can say with a straight face what there were three years of reporting over nothing if there's smoke this fire you know blah blah blah so I haven't been following it that that closely I saw Justin Amash you know just tweeted out that you hear this whole tweet storm that he thinks Trump should be impeached based on who's Justin Amash is a congressman from Michigan he's a one of like three libertarians and he turned he said he's like I actually read the report which most people have not in Washington eight hundred is it yeah and he's like I think this is their stuff in here that's impeachable this was a big deal and then all the left were like republic even Republicans like Justin Amash is like no no it's just him it's not there's no like it's him it's literally just hit him yeah there's only to like him it's the time is it like him it's Thomas Massie and Mike Lee that's the three of them and Rand Paul for Rand Paul's an interesting cat I like him well I was uh I want to talk to his neighbor that fucked him up that's such a bitch move does such a bitch that is such a bitch tackle them when he wasn't even look I know yeah I think he had earphones on too it's it's a I'm not sitting here like some bad ass but come on what the fuck you're doing yeah how about that guy that kicked our on Schwarzenegger yes he kicked this kid dressed Arnold Schwarzenegger I think he was crazy South African he was saying he was screaming out help me I need a Lamborghini while they were arresting him it was the bad sauce WorldStarHipHop he's on look I mean if that's what you want what really happened it to Arnold nothing what's really gonna happen to that kid probably I don't know you don't know South average it's look at look at a Auto WOM beer in North Korea he steals a sign and so it we don't know if the laws like in South Africa could he think it's not as bad as North Korea it's not as bad as North Korea fucked him up pretty well did they look like it yeah second listen if you're if you're dropped kicking people out of nowhere that's the problem when I was talking to Eddie Izzard yeah Eddie ran a bunch of marathons in South Africa 20 it was it was - it was a designation it was the same number as the amount of years that Nelson Dell was in prison so it's 27 so he ran 27 marathons but there was areas where they're like listen man you ain't running through here like this is this area you won't go to we're gonna take you I'm gonna put you in a car we're gonna drive you way the fuck past here and then you keep running you're not running through here so you can killed right yeah yeah you'll get you be carjacked this is we're all gonna get shot you're not going through here and that's you know there's parts of the world that are like that and I'm Swartz and Egger when he visited South Africa what's the worst it got dropped kicked in with poor technique okay I want to say the kid had no follow-through right right barely knocked a 71 you first of all even though Arnold Schwarzenegger 71 years old he's still a 71 year old Arnold yeah of course he's still a tank but I mean even even fall over kid drop yeah he didn't even know it was coming right he gets hit in the middle actually just and it is fine it's kind of impressive I got your present you do what do you got ready okay what do you like best about me this I got this this is the most Joe Rogan thing that's like a thing a girl says to you right she's about to trap you what that's the end of like your personality I like everything this is the most Joe oregan thing I've ever found what is it here you go well we got here take it it's a mini museum so it's got 29 different things from all over the universe encased in lucite Wow that is fucking dope yeah Wow it's got a piece of the White House a piece of the Hollywood sign at some amazon water giant sloth claw I think thank you you are welcome to that will go right fuck in here yeah here's the book to tell separately much oh thank you very cool that's it where'd you find this I went on one of my rabbit holes in the internet I don't like all these shit this is you've heard of it gel the internet rabbit holes oh that's dope dude thank you very much um so get the doublet back oh yeah oh there's a bag yeah feel like I need to have it out though it's nice a bag right here I got mine on display desk is so cluttered this is a ridiculous to ever keep saying I'm gonna clean it up yeah so tell me more about your book uh why are you why are you breaking um there's these buildings said that's a dog whistle that's a dog was a cover so there's a guy named Ben garrison and he was a regular conservative artist right and he would have drawings about like Ben Bernanke or Hillary or whatever the Nazis took his art replaced all of his drawings with Jews so instead of the great wizard of debt being the Fed it was a Jewish caricature and they did it perfectly and they also invented this whole backstory about him that he was this closet Nazi and this poor guy in Montana if you google him it's like knots and he's like why is this happening to me and the photoshop work was perfect so eventually they calmed down and you know you now he's kind of like a regular cartoonist and this story got out but that's his artwork so the people this poor guy who was talking about a victim of Nazis it's very rare nowadays to have a new victim of Nazis and he's actually one of them well meme culture is very strong right yes and those little humorous images that get chucked around oh yeah there's a lot of dirtbag sort of really profited off of other people's me more - I like my friend Don he's terrible he works for a meme site yeah dirtbag those sites are bad man some of them just flat-out steal and some of them steal and then they'll attribute oh yeah yeah yeah I'm where like they'll just say your name and sometimes they don't even say your name they say a name of like a fake account that doesn't even distribute it to someone all week I thought we got it from that person because they know that it's at a hundred different account yes but because bunch of people have this guy's like you you'll find something you like this is funny and you pick it up but then there's people that they make these giant sites with all other people's work and they curate them yeah and they make millions yep like a fat Jewish yeah oh yeah everyone hates him they say oh this is one of you this is like one of your big issues with like people who will like take content and basically agree to be appropriate for themselves but first for sure would stand-up comedy yeah but the thing that's happening with memes is like you're you if someone sends you something like there's a bunch of things that might like Eddie Bravo sends me for hilarious ones all the time he'll send me a funny meme and then I'll send it to Brendan Schaub and I'm not asking who made that me right so but a joke Brendan doesn't think that I made it myself so it's not like I'm stealing my joke but I'm definitely not crediting the original creator because I don't know who the fuck it is right and those things fly around they fly out so but that's all with in good faith the person with in bad faith right curates a website and then starts profiting off of it they find a loophole and then they make deals with Comedy Central and then they also have people who actually steal stand-ups bits and turn those bits in the memes and they put those bits on their their meme pages and they do the same shit they'll do it they just their content need ears they need content they're whores parasites yes so they just they'll hire people to do it they in the people that they hire they'll they'll steal people's jokes and tournament - memes it's real it's a real problem yeah that's that's I mean that nesic become a joke because then people are like oh this is a rare pepe right just like please say it's just like you know even though you can replicate you know that we have a lawsuit yeah I talked about that in there no the new one that's happening right now Alex Jones refused to he refused to settle out of court so they're gonna go to court they're gonna figure out whether or not Pepe you can use Pepe the Frog but I mean I talked about this in the context of it's like if King Andy Warhol uses Campbell's soup can it's the same thing it's like if yes someone creates it but if someone is using it in a kind of a broader satirical context well it doesn't though because Andy probably couldn't do that today yes he could I think they'd soon if we tried to make a lot of money off of Campbell's hands corporations had more power back then unless accountability because now the social media everyone lose their minds on Campbell's right that's true that's a good point I think that you know what they did with Campbell's did when he did this so he paints all 40 flavors of soup cans right puts him up in a gallery Campbell is just like what the fuck is this like they didn't know what to do right and they didn't know who to call this is unprecedented so they had a storefront and they had the cans at the window they go why pay a hundred grand you could get it here for a dollar so they tried to own it in their own way that's smart that's smart great advertising for them yeah I mean Tighe antic advertising but that's the other thing is like with this meme culture people like Oh Pepe means white supremacy it's like you can't Campbell's doesn't say what a Campbell Soup cam means different things mean this is not news different things mean different things to different people and if you're using it in one context doesn't mean other contexts aren't legitimate that's how art and images work yeah I mean that's almost like what happened with the guy in Montana right so yes his work and then turns it into Nazi stuff and all sudden he becomes a mob right nothing to do with it with Pepe the Frog does that guy who met Harry yeah he's so upset I know because he's you know they did do you think they did to him he had a cartoon where he killed Pepe so all the trolls are like oh that's interesting so they took all his other characters and made them full-blown Nazis so Heinrich who's the wolf instead of having reflections and a sunglasses had the SS they're like oh you want you want to throw it out we'll throw it out asshole and that's what happened here wolf has a Nazi name already no now they gave the last name it's like Heinrich something else but that name I'll tell you oh my god I know no no this is something not see what do they call it that's a Nazi wolf yeah I cannot see what maybe they what was that that's hilarious it he thought he could just kill it off that's like deep platforming he thought I was gonna deep platformer Pepe what's also like let's suppose I decide to kill off Paul Bunyan what the fuck how it yeah I can't what I mean doesn't mean anything like the idea that he's gonna kill it off and they're gonna stop were killed his name was originally land wolf so they said his first name is Heinrich land wolf the Sun you could pull it up and the glasses well maybe we should have a symmetry here but an Wolfe as opposed to what sky was that mean the funny thing is about Pepe was it was always so bland and lame well that before it was adopted as a meme like when you said like feels bad man right like it was like this is so low blood sugar it bothers me but it's also the idea of you're saying that because Nazis are using it you can't use it as feels bad man like right if you're giving it okay symbol yeah they're using this way you can't say oh that's okay doesn't make any sense yeah you can't say something may I go okay yeah I'm Alice if I do that that's white supremacy yeah that's know everybody for years I had all series on my Instagram page of people doing the okay sorry course including me back when I had earrings yeah Bill Cosby doing the okay symbol it's fucking come on man you guys know this is not that's not what this is just because people are using it and saying it is they're investigating people are investigating people there was a guy who is on television and the other thing is we're at a point now where it's more easy to give the finger just someone than to say okay yeah geez you blur the finger out and nobody cares yeah but if you do that what is he doing listen these touching his fingers you can't even do like you're holding a joint cuz that's like a white power joint like if you like doing that like a roach that's bad that's bad how do you do you have to use a roach clip it's a ploy by the roach clip industry but there's I have a list in there all the things that are called racist milk show dinosaurs milk come racers Oh cuz then what the trolls do is they make it let's see we get him freaking out about milk and they got it picnic my favorite one the trolls did was the free bleeding move Mountain I god that's the greatest thing the people have ever accomplished that they actually got women no no that's not no no your there's two thing you're confusing two things the free bleeding was a woman who made it but there was the pee on yourself no small free bleeding was a 4chan troll no it was the girl running a race because she was she was actually smart about she said this is to create awareness toward women in third-world countries who don't have access to sanitary pads I yeah I was reading a whole article on the 4chan the creating the free bleeding movement okay I could be wrong so see if you get pulled out I know there was a legitimate example of the free bleeding yeah I think that was post that Uncle Sam putting it up they've done a few things like that they also had P on yourself to fight rape all I heard because that's one of the big arguments that to fight a rapist if you're actually in that situation P and yourself that'll turn her away and it's like you shouldn't give people advice it's like listen if she's actually getting assaulted what should she do in that horrible circumstance and then it's like pee on yourself to show your support for victims sexual assault wasn't there a senator someone that actually said that if it's a legitimate rule that's in there and Todd akin Todd akin was running this is amazing Todd akin was running for Senate in Missouri and he's pro-life and they asked him a very common question for all life people what about if it's rape and he goes well that's very rare and he goes but my understanding is if a woman is assaulted the body has a way of shutting it down now there's a book called sperm ORS and apparently again I'm crazy scientists don't get mad at me it didn't work that's the books true it's not true no no it's been disputed it's been debunked okay thank you there's no evidence that sperm acts as anything other than sperm that attacks the egg and tries to get it pregnant the claim in that book yeah yeah is that rape is more likely to result in pregnancy than regular intercourse the point is he got read out of town and rail and then reza aslan who said on twitter you know what I hope he gets raped and if you take his comment out of context it's very disturbing mm-hmm and it's kind of disturbing in context but Reza's response being like this is a response to you being like yes you get raped you're not gonna get pregnant and he got the new right went after him Reza and got him fired from CNN years later za what he got fired from he also caught us in a shit head yeah so they're like they use that and they use the other tweet and they cover to him what's really free bleeding stuff has been online there's an article I found from 2004 oh wow crap so it's been online for a long time but as we started it fortune picked it up as a troll in 2014 okay so I started as a real thing it's been a thing online for a time on this blog 2011 there's another thing when you fuck but when you find it in 2004 was it a troll no it was all about my vagina yeah my vag net yeah yeah I told you I knew I'm glad I got this right okay you got it right to my vag fortune has too much power long my revenge on net some ladies experience with her free bleeding so she just lets her fifteen years ago her twat bleed sorry the article was so fucking convincing that's a problem man that's a problem you know and that's what people in that are arguing for D platforming or saying when they're like 4d platforming anti-vaxxers or D platforming flat-earthers or anybody who's got information that's just not accurate in terms of the other things climate change I held on to my big answer is you guys reported WMDs for a long time and hundreds of thousand people got killed because of this misinformation so if that's going to be your standard you're gonna have to deploy from the New York Times as well so it's a very double-edged sword when you start talking about if people give misinformation they have to be banned from these social media sites you need someone to be able to check the Orthodox point of view no matter what it is that's true there's no denying that what you say Jim this is the poster that's the I didn't know this was about a poster it's a fair use issue with the Pepe and Alex Jones like they're arguing is fair use these are humans not blah blah blah so interesting it's not just because it's a meme or something yeah there's the poster person behind Alex to the left of Alex it's good question most of these people are I know who all of them I don't know that's like a cigarette in their hand or a test tube or a tampon what was that what is that is that a bunt what is that so the Sharpie you're writing some on the Alex's back is that a dude or a guy who fuck is that yeah who is that I know everybody else yeah whatever we could be here for days is that diamond and silk okay I think it was so okay oh no it must be diamond and silk the two of them whose diamond and so there are these two black ladies who are Trump's biggest fans and they got social media they start ranting and raving scene one and that one of them always drinks blue line blue wine yeah and it's like when you're so sick of his blue bullshit they drinking literal kool-aid it's blue she's got a blue drew liquid it's crazy green and she's a tryst Bob wait a minute maybe she's drinking kool-aid like you can get you can't get green kool-aid no I think it's wine wine glass I think they have blue wine now what look at the looks at her face she's always seems sad I don't know which one's diving for one silk ones Vera always act really upset the other ones just like why am I here that's a good move if you just want attention if you don't really support Trump they sit there with your green line yeah just get super outrageous may see and they testified in front of Congress that's why I love this timeline it's like this is where we are they testified in front of Congress about Facebook censoring people oh yeah because Facebook is censoring them they said will you see what's going on with Alex Jones if you write Alex Jones name on Facebook it says only you can see this post I do license name I do live streams a lot right and if the live stream was my thoughts on Alex Jones live stream the second it's uploaded it's demonetized and then later has to get ramana ties once they see it's okay so the default setting is and that's the other thing of all of these people Alex Jones is the worst one like you have actual full-blown we need another holocaust types and he's the villain yeah well he's got a big platform that's the idea the idea is that he's got a big platform so they have to show you here's the other lie they're like Oh blah blah blah Sandy Hook you're like you're an upset when the Sandy Hook should happen you're getting upset about him now years later because you're being whipped up into a froth by the corporate press about it you weren't saying he should be a beauty platform seven years ago when was whenever it was sandy yes when it was something around them right so five years ago well it becomes something that is a talking point right right like that he needs to be deep platform to either agree with it or you don't agree with it and I think that's the case with almost what is happening with our something happen up there no I read the perch no this you're messing with the guys are you're messing with electronic okay um no there's no approach here yeah okay good no we have security I would not do well in a perch you'll be fine dude stay in this room this room's bulletproof is it yeah all right good good to know yeah you all right man okay good are you worried about the perch no are you worried about the apocalypse no natural disasters not at all nothing solar flares taking out the grid no no nothing I mean there's eggs at lights going one of the best books no more serious at all and this is my response to people on the far right and I'm using that term accurately there's a great book by Arthur Herman called the idea of decline in Western history and he talks about you know every 20 years it's a different group on the left on the right and they're like the world's gonna end and he brings the receipts and it never ends up happening because people are smart some and we have a huge asymmetry in wanting to stay alive so I had the idea that the last of what apocalypse what pride the Black Plague I would say would be the last apocalypse we've been doing so good so far do you know about the people that got the black pit excuse me the people that got the black play because they were eating a marmot liver so was it a liver I thought they thought it was the fleece from the rats no no no no no there's some recently recently recently got the black play but it's the fluid of the rats the last time that happened in the United States I think was in the 1920s and that was in Los Angeles actually the last evidence of the yeah but you don't die from it anymore oh you could definitely die from it but they died in 20s I think they died in their 20s I thought it's still okay maybe the people died this year from the Black Plague Oh che but it ate the liver okay kidney I think right cooling couple you know you're all marmot kidney yeah Marmot it's like a vole yeah yeah that's what used to be 65 million years ago yeah yeah yeah these people hate it ate it and wound up dying from the play what was the point I had a point about end the world are we worried about the polyps yeah you know that idea that people have always worried about the end of the world and it never happens sure that's like saying I've always worried about dying but I never have I'm not gonna die I'm not gonna die I'm gonna be I'm not gonna be there you're gonna die but I'm not gonna be there how do you know what do you mean how do you know you're not gonna be there um I mean that's what dying means oh you you're not gonna be there yeah die so you're not gonna die right cause I'm not gonna cure you not so don't even worry about it there's one over you won't be here so who cares I wouldn't say so who cares but I mean if your entire life is focusing on you know avoiding death that's a very bad mindset yeah that's for sure that's what I'm saying is that I think people are operating with a very small historical time launch and the more I talk to people like Graham Hancock would describe the overwhelming evidence is something pretty severe happened to the human race around twelve thousand eight hundred years ago most likely comet impact or something along those lines other other people think that it was actually a solar mass coronal ejections made lightning storms like rain storm that lightning was coming down like rain all over the world and just killed everything and this thing could happen easily at any time not easily oh yeah easily okay yeah common impact or asteroid impact easily ethic easily or not easily in terms of likelihood because it would happen easily turn a likelihood it what happened by now no no it has happened there's a lot of evidence that it's happened it's just we're dealing with a small timeline the ideas could you get lucky and it won't happen in the next 60 years or so while you're alive yeah yeah I could have an orchid hit tomorrow that could happen too okay I'll take that bet it's good bet I mean it's good look your perspective is good that's like it's good to not worry so to not look at it because when you have power yeah if you don't have power to affect the combat as I personally don't most room knowing it's coming who can theoretically what can I do not it just live and I one of my heroes Albert Camus great French philosopher you know his point about living to the point of Tears right and I think what really I find sad in this culture is cynicism and hopelessness and it's like we're blessed you know we have this I mean there's beyond beyond the internet you can find people who are making amazing things more opportunities than you can count and if you're just gonna sit there and mope I mean you're blowing this great gift that God's given you yeah well I think a lot of those people that are moping that are concentrating entirely on the negative aspects of life they're doing themselves a giant yes and they can't it's almost like they can't help it I think there's a lot of people that are affecting the way culture shifts today that are probably clinically depressed and one of the things I resent enormous ly about culture is this idea if something is joyous or fun it's less it's less legitimate artistically and that is such a disgusting horrible mindset and we need more joy and more happiness and I for me because I want to see Joe Josie well last night okay yeah do you know what that is you know she's a youtube star my nine-year-old loves her so how do Joe Josie was birthday concert last night okay at the Microsoft Center whatever the fuck that is I know cuz Burt ran into her at the airport loves her too of it I bet cuz Burt has young daughters too yeah she's all about positivity yeah believin achieve fun times I'll upload a video later but is it also like is it all like Zachary and like Disney stuff course it's too serious the Sakura is a girl I don't like that yeah yeah yeah yeah like yeah she was taking old Queen songs and reworking the words cleaning him up she's like those mean people oh she was she's cleaning she's toning down Queen songs on downs from Queen songs oh this woman's the devil how dare you take someone's art and and appropriate it and make it like take out all the energy yeah she this is corporate culture at its worst but she's doing it for three-year olds bro so to sleep five-year-olds they don't need to be listening in Queen over there it is oh Jesus Christ loves Freddie Mercury bro what's problem no she doesn't if she loved him she'd respect him she's fucking 12 she know oh she's 16 excuse me yeah shouldn't know any better she does know better how smart were you and you were 16 smart enough not to try to rewrite Queen I bet she doesn't have a say in it I bet whoever's pulling the strings gets her to read that makes it even more nefarious of course the Disney people or those sensors but their ever it is the producers what you eat am I wrong here's the light where's the light what song was it - I remember they did we are the champions she sang that but champions I mean someone's a loser yeah no time for losers so once I changed her no time no no no I don't think to change that no time for recess oh my god this is horrifying yes videos this is like those videos they made for like Mormons where they took like Hollywood blockbusters and cut out all the sex and all the cursing yeah and it's like you are evil vampires horrible monsters she did Crocodile Rock Elton John okay and she changed Rainbow Chevy to rainbow Beemer so Crocodile Rock you know my theory is with that song I tweeted this out years ago what I just imagined Elton with a bunch of friends they're all getting highs fuck right and they're like alright let's try to think of the most fucked up lyric and Eric Elton you're gonna make a song about it they're like I have a like a like Crocodile Rock it's like alright I'll fucking do it be fuck it's it's it nails it what the fuck does that even mean what does that mean but I'll tell you what man the word crocodile means something different to me I have to watch that black mirror episode titled crocodile I haven't seen it holy shit if you're listening to this ladies and gentlemen and you have a sensitive heart and you can't handle really fucked up premises and a really fucked up episode like her fans don't want you don't watch it cuz it's rough it's really good though it's but it's like holy shit it's one of those ones where they I'm not giving away anything but at the end when you're when you're done with that show you feel like you need a fucking shower like whoa oh geez it's dark okay has nothing to do with the reptiles I do like dark it's just dark it's dark I just read this book by this woman Cynthia car called fire in the belly it's it's the life story of this artist David when he wrote it - I don't know anything about and he was in New York and there early to late 80s when AIDS was coming up and as she tells his life story you hear the story of aids permeating through this culture and that book is as dark as fuck because she'll have a scene where he's like oh he had dinner in da da da and the next sentence Keith Haring died on this day at age 34 and you realize this was like for them like they're hanging out phone rings Keith's dead and these are men who are the symbols of virility early late 20s early 30s just dropping like flies and the thing is they're watching each other die knowing I'm next that's gonna be mean a year from now and they're getting dementia before they die so they're talking all crazy at age 30 so this book really fucked my head really bad they were giving him a zt2 yeah yeah didn't help nobody loves later at first they're like we don't know what the fuck to do good luck and it's like we're dying like I'm sorry shoulda suck dick it's like what the fuck was to do you know they were calling it the gay cancer yeah they didn't know what it was they did and and then when they were trying to fight for education people like well we're not going to teach kids you know about sucking dick they're like dude we're dying and they're like oh sorry about it and it's this book really got with fuck with my head especially cuz you know it's real yeah did you ever hear of bug catchers of course about chasers bug chase web chasers yeah that's again we're talking about things are just fucked up about human beings when you look at the spectrum of behavior bug chasers are people who tried yes maybe right because they thought is one of the ultimate symbol of being gay well I'm sure there's a bunch of reasons that was the big reason well sure there was probably that but probably they felt bad that other people had it and they wanted it and there was other people that just wanted it because they're crazy sure and other people hated themselves so they wanted there was also that guy in Germany who's like I want to cut off someone's dick and eat it and they got someone signed up for it no he said I wanna I want someone to cut off my dick and eat it and I want them to eat me right someone said sure let's meet up yeah that's right I got a rock and so this guy cut his dick off and they both shared his dick and then killed the dude and started eating them and then they arrest them and they didn't know whether to charge up cuz it's voluntary yeah it's a good point yeah well yeah I don't but I mean why are you still like you can't that's murders like it either is murder or it's not murder like if you're in a gay relationship with a guy the guy says okay this one I want you to do I want you to beat me up and rape me you know like oh okay can I get that in writing can you write down what you beat me and then you know if the cops come he's like he beat me up any rape you know brought listen here he wrote it right here he wanted made a videotape you didn't use the video you can use your safe word he said he wanted me to beat him up with them and the cops probably let you go but you can't murder right you know I'm saying because consensual sex is obviously legal so if you have consensual sex with someone it's legal but if you pretend to be fighting them off right and it relaxes you it's fun it's roleplay but murders never roleplay you know I found when I was doing research for the book the National Review who's my favorite paleontology journal in the late 90s as the gay rights movement was coming up into the mainstream consciousness they wrote an article comparing the struggle for gay rights to a struggle for necrophilia they're like well be the difference like the fight and they talked about how right now in the European Union perverts are fighting for the right to be violent toward each other in bed and in various ways it's like yeah it's like rough sex it's adjacent to vanilla sex yeah they liked it and now the art the articles are the conservative case for gay marriage it's like you guys have no fucking shame then and you have no fucking shame now at least be consistent one of the things that disturbed me greatly today is there is a movement and I don't know how big it is but it's a movement for people to try to recognize pedophiles as a sexual distinction a sexual designation rather than a sick disease that similar to being trans or being right or that some people are just born pedophiles well I think what's important there is it's not just a crime because a crime can be fixed and treated so I think it is important to understand these people will always psychologically be pedophiles and you're not going to get them to be like straight you know homo no therapy that's ever been shown that I think it's like trying to make someone who's gay it's straight is it really that so that's my understanding if that's the case and is there an argument that we should be more compassionate with them as long as they don't act on that but that's the danger because the other thing what they don't understand is from their point of view those kids are giving consent which they are right the kids saying yes so they're like look maybe that's what's scary and even know if they do right nobody they they don't think a statutory rape being a thing and I knew okay this this is why in turn to the place long ago and there was a librarian who worked there like a Guido type you know and girl or guy guy and years later he was arrested he was a school teacher he was arrested in an undercover sting trying to meet a kid who he knew was 13 or 12 in a park to try to sleep with him right this was a Jeanine Pirro who later became a fox commentator he got out of jail and I see him on Facebook he's married with kids and it's just like I you think it's fine that that's just scary shit and it's another thing to be switched gender to if you're going for young boys you're gonna go to like regular aged women I don't see how that would work right right and this is something that's such a taboo topic that I don't think once you for a lot of people correctly once you start talking about kids and sexuality their hackles raised it is a PC subject cuz it's like while you've been introducing this into the conversation where you're going with this it's a very very very slippery slope well if you're trying to say if they're trying to say that this is something that people are born with I don't think there's evidence that people just are born that way I think there's evidence that people become that way from sexual abuse yes that's true too absolutely and they think it's a probably never heard of anybody they grew up in a normal household wasn't abused is that the case I'm not in a position to talk about this at all I think we have probably have very few cases of pedophiles on the record explaining how they came to this point of view right of an eat-in either situation born or abused I can't see how this is something that's going to be an emotion level you're going to be able to turn them well it's also a super the idea of that being in your neighborhood yes this is in your neighborhood you've got this guy who likes to fuck kids and he promises not to do it anymore they did a few times they locked him up in a cage now you live down the street and he locked up in a cage where he was traumatized also further traumatized oh yeah so and also if he promises not to do it but knowing when he's looking at she's checking out my son or my daughter yeah mmm I did not expect to be talking about this today I'm not course fuckin that the human mind can be that it be imprinted and you're abused when you're younger that you go on to do that same thing that was horrific lead unto you that that is a common thing that happens with children that makes it abuse it doesn't make sense to you it does make sense it just to me it's like that way I wasn't abused I was enjoying it could be right you know that that way it takes away the trauma because it's like oh this is how I've always been so it was okay nothing happened to me and you don't have to deal with the trauma that way well that's what Milo and when he was talking about right being sexually abused as a child right I think that's what he was kind of doing oh yes saying that I was the predator and I was going on I talked about that in the book because him it was anyone other than Milo people because he was older he wasn't like 12 he was like whatever 18 14 no no he's like I think he was like I remember how old no no he's a team it was fun there wasn't a team but it wasn't 12 Inc he was a teenager but he sure if it was somebody else people be talking my head or normativity right and it's historically not that weird for an older gay dude to give the younger gay guy especially when everyone was closeted to kind of initiate them into the lifestyle this was a thing but it's Milo now it's all my god you want pedophilia blah blah it's like their different standards for gay people they're for straight people and that's appropriate and acceptable and people understand that in other contexts well the problem is society as the way we understand human beings and the way a person's brain works when you're young you shouldn't be allowed to make those decisions because sexually in particular you could get coerced you can guess you can get you can wind up doing something that you don't want to do that can be straight guys that are 14 years old cher talked into having gay sex by a very charismatic four your old man who gives him things the idea is that this is a bad thing for the boy it's bad thing because you wouldn't want to happen to a girl why would you want to happen to avoid but I think it's a very different phenomenon for a 30 year old man to sleep with a 30 year old gay man to sleep with a 16 year old gay man as for a 30 year old boy sure as opposed to a 30 year old game straight man to sleep with a 16 year old straight girl I think you can make that argument there is a little bit different I still don't think it's okay I'm not saying it's okay I'm just saying yes there's clearly it's different it's different yeah especially if the boys like very gay very seriously yeah which you know everyone for high school remembers or as he's not a virgin right true to that first score that first guy for that girl will fuck with her head for her life for many women for him it could be was first yeah that's a very big difference too yeah yeah you don't want to be that first guy that's a lot of work I don't even mean with gay I mean what straight to I don't think I ever had a virgin in my life I've never had a virgin thank God so much work I connected you'd be like forever I thought you mystically be too much work no no no no no I mean yeah I should probably clarify yeah I mean being connected that / it's too significant you want to be like the third guy you don't want to be the first guy girl has sex with you were always my first Michael I'll never forget I always thought that we were supposed to be together forever and ever because I believe in movies and fairy tale is that you were and I listened to the Queen songs with the nice lyrics to work to jizz he was concert she explained everything was like a movie yeah you were yeah that's a thing right like people do get emotionally attached to romantic stories that they see in movies and they want their life to play out like this fictional narrative and and the left uses this a lot because they'll have all these leftist ideas in culture and movies and that's where a lot of people get their programming and then it's like you know for example here's an idea you don't see in culture that people very often knowingly and consciously do the wrong thing that happens every day people know they're doing something fucked up you don't really see that that much in like TV and movies and that's a right-wing message that like you know people sometimes are basically Eve and yeah run into someone at that point in their life they are evil that's a fact yeah sure that exists all over the world or like yeah and it's also evil in a small scale like if you're in an office and someone's getting chewed out and they're getting bullied for whatever reason and you're sitting there and you're keeping your mouth shut you're not Hitler but you know you're doing the wrong thing what you're trying to protect your job right sure the balls to come down on you but a lot of times you have that space and you still won't do it and that's knowingly doing the wrong thing and I'm not saying you should be thrown in the garbage but I'm saying people do that all the time these little sacrifices they make with their conscience mmm that's true you know and you don't see that really represented and that's an important idea for people to understand that people are often weak yeah and always especially if you're going check to check always worried you're losing your job losing your gig yeah that's a real big thing with people though I was on vacation once Moses guy who was a boss and he was there with his employee and his employees family and he was mean to his employees daughter that's horrifying a watch that the guy had to take it he's just talking shitty to her it was just it was really gross because you can see the dynamic play out he was just this mean old guy just really shitty it was just it was disturbing to see this weak man like just having to accept the fact that this guy is right shitty to his daughter and he was giving her a lecture and berating her and doing it publicly like oh my god that's an is this who you wanted to grow up to be is this job worth it it was so gross on what I wanted to step in I was like I just want to tell this guy shut the fuck up driving me nuts I remember when I was back before I said I started you know being an author I was working at Goldman and it was a very stressful job and I had my review and they said oh you know if you have downtime sometimes we see you like going online we want you to help the laptop lab and I just go no and she goes what I said I wasn't hired to do laptops I'm not interested in learning laptops and there are the job is very intense in high-stress so if I have downtime I'm going to you know use the downtime and and the look on her face was just like as if I I just been added myself as a pedophile what did it mean I used the I was doing laptop the lab lab right I was doing tech support so like okay Microsoft Word Excel people had problems they would call on-the-fly you got to have an answer for them it's very it's like a quiz show you're living put show and then there's a laptop lab people are checking out laptops they're setting up laptops which is a very different skill set something I didn't really know setting up in terms before downloading sure yeah I got you know what were I didn't know then I still don't know I think I don't fucking know not my job no I'm not and I'm not interested in working as hard as possible well also like when you have

author media personality I thinks the word said troll though immediately like that went right to about myself but you wanted to be a troll I don't like that yeah the first thing you think on it it's like if someone says like what do you do you like troll I'm an author no well actually you know what I say when people ask me what I do I say you know those obnoxious people who have a job giving their uninformed opinion that's me that's what I usually say interesting yeah it's not funny that that's a job all you have to do is be kind of entertaining and have an interesting way of looking at things it's great that's this is what I'm talking about being blessed and I don't take it for granted and the fact that like people pay my rent because of my sick burns on Twitter on patreon says burn either I love my sick first and you used to be a Microsoft help representative for Goldman Sachs wanted yeah was it Microsoft just Microsoft where yeah yeah Walden Microsoft products yeah yeah do you use Windows I do do you yeah you don't use the Apple I don't you seem like a guy you seem like a guy using Android phone - I have an Android phone uh-huh yeah a little bit of a contrarian I have a little bit yeah do you like Windows because the people that use Mac's are just like following the sheep herd I use Windows because that's what I was professional on so I haven't changed it all this time the only thing that bugs me about Windows I have to constantly be updating yeah you turn that shit off you have to turn that shit off why because like I'm up to sometimes just crashed my computer Oh when it updates yeah so I'm not rolling that fear of the computer restart how often do you update your software never but what if they fix like vulnerability they're gonna invent new words it's fine it's fine if they get the squiggly line when I write the word mean why what I worry about is like vulnerabilities to the system I have everything backed up in three places I'm a crazy person like that okay so you're ready to rock and do you run some run a VPN no no and I'm hiding that shit too why would you why would you say that I'm there oh shit they're gonna think I'm gonna get swatted now I get you gotta get slaughtered or pirates they're gonna fucking die are you sure me and Madonna with the I gotcha let's get Madonna has an eyepatch yeah I didn't see that thing see I think it's a fashion thing but it could be a glaucoma thing she's got an eye patch mmm maybe she's just a fan of Slick Rick do you know whose did you know my favorite comedian Neil hamburger yeah sure I love Neil eye he's my absolute favorite comedian so Larry and one of his jokes is what do you call a senior citizen who can't help but expose their genitalia in public Madonna and he says it'll sad it's a weird act he's so funny oh he's the best no it's just a strange strange act well he's just basically Tony Clifton yeah as it as a stand-up but better not better material much better material yeah yeah and better presentation I talked about Kaufman in the book because he's the first troll hmm and it happened was the first sure yeah and there's this great he had this character Tony Clifton people don't know who's this like angry lounge singer and Tony did this bit he would perform I think was in Atlantic City and he said hey my wife died whenever I look at my daughter's you know Stephanie's eyes I see her so let's Stefan to come out into a song sits on his lap are they sing her voice cracks he smacks her across the face he goes are you fucking it up the audience is booing goes don't boo he was gonna make her cry more and it wasn't even a kid it's an actress you know what I mean what is that it's just beautiful drawling yeah well he used to Coffman's to go onstage and sing the Mighty Mouse theme song but just inviting us all right yeah here I come to save the day he did this special and I think was ABC refused to air for two years and one of the parts it was like pee-wee's Playhouse previous Playhouse he had a girl from Sound of Music and she's like oh she starred in his you know restart her career he called it has been corner and she comes out he goes so at what point did you realize you weren't gonna make it in show business I it's just she's it on it right you know but it's you're sitting there like oh my god even if you know it's gonna sting and she's like real I'm trying to restart my career he goes well I don't think it's gonna happen for you but good luck and it you're just like oh my god well how about when he was wrestling women that was the thing a sexual thing but yeah I'm sure yeah but it was also trolling is it yeah yeah screaming oh that's yeah that part but yeah yeah but III didn't that I'm not a fan of dude the fucking people at the wrestling arena they wanted to kill him yeah they wanted to fucking kill him I they thought it was real I got Dolph Ziggler coming up on my show tomorrow and he's like he come came out once dressed as the Undertaker and the audience what he pulls off that head for like brewing goes oh you thought it was really gonna be him you only see once a year so he fucking comes dressed as other wrestlers just to troll the audience I love that shit well when you got to think also when Kauffman was doing this there was real discussion as to whether or not wrestling was real yeah this is a different time yeah it's amazing you could look back at these arguments that people like oh yeah yeah it's it's holy fucking real no he was taken do you know it's really though what's fascinating though cuz with the rise of the MMA yeah I just saw like the the WV address square garden we know what the dynamics of fighting looks like right but the wrestlers it's still the same motions it's like we know that if you hit someone here how they actually react because we've seen it thousands of times for real yeah but you guys are still like if someone punches you in the neck you're not gonna be passed out in the floor what's also like some wrestlers got upset because I was explaining that a figure four leglock doesn't work not only does it not work but you're setting yourself up for heel hook okay I'm like let me explain yeah yeah and they were mad like how dare you disrespect wrestling well it's also like if you clothesline someone that's gonna hurt you no no no that's not if someone 200 pounds hits me here it's not gonna hurt my shoulder no no okay okay they're not know what the fuck I'm talking about this I'll fuck you up with a clothesline how that's like you just hitting someone that they had your forearm you can fuck somebody up with a clothesline really 100% in the neck 100 but it's not gonna hurt you know mean mine okay okay yeah every time you punch somebody could break you're sure I'm sure but no are you closing on someone that shit's totally legitimately that people get Kayode from that all the time it's like a like a like like if you kick someone in the neck right like if someone gets neck kicked they go out sure at times you could do that with your arm same thing same motion your shin is stronger or than your forearm but especially this way see there's two bones right there's the the ulnar and what's the tibia fibia no that's your leg okay I don't tibia is I broke the fibula the smaller one or the tibia which one I broke the little one which one's the big one which one's your shin your tip your femurs the top and then I Beulah I think it's the fibula I broke I broke the one what's that tibia is the bigger one yeah I broke the smaller one okay it was fucking gross it was really painful they couldn't do anything about it it just it was just a hairline fracture Oh see that guy just oh she said clothesline by this dude boom okay all right Wow the cop doesn't know how to land it look you went down with it too he probably broke his fucking arm fuck that cop broke his arm see that guy was barely using his arm oh it definitely works out okay yeah like in in the UFC well the thing is like my point was I think the big where's the big bone where's the little bone I think in the front this happens all the time guys get kicked in this bone breaks actually sometimes pull to the bones break but it with a spinning backfist when they're landing it a lot of times they're landing it with their with their forearm what not landing it with the actual fist what about the Randy Savage if you're jumping out the top rope on your elbow won't you break your elbow or kill the person if you're landing on his neck you will hurt them for sure and you'll slamming down the elbow it's definitely got more force but when you're getting on top of someone and you're smashing with elbows which you can do in MMA you can generate incredible amounts of force if you ever watch a guy workout on the heavy bag with the heavy bags on the ground they work the ground and pound just boom well I mean you think about that being a fucking head it's a creek but and if you're 200 pounds 250 jumping off a rope on a small point I would think that would I mean break something in there it could could just really hit yeah right sure but if that were for real but just that first of all the reality is just that alone I mean even though he only like bounces off of them a little bit yeah he's he's just got it down where he lands first with the feet if you watch the impact if you slow you right yeah the feet land first and then he's absorbing all of it and just he lands the the the side of his body on the guy's chest okay but it's a secondary impact boom see he collapses yeah - it's like e1 - and he doesn't hit him that hard but he had some hard enough that it sucks like it ain't fun to be yes yes it's a tough gig but that shit would work clotheslining someone would work it's just not ideal the ideal thing to do if someone's just palm them in the face if you get close line one you could also just palm them in the face well that's that the good thing about the palm in the face is that first of all it's extremely difficult to break your palm like this think about what you can do okay this is an oak table and I'm slamming my hand into I have no pain at all you can't do that with any other part of your body you can't kick it like that if with your shin you know you can't punch it like that with your knuckles even your elbow kind of hurts more than your palm the palm you can really fuck you got the funny bone - yes yeah but you could fuck somebody up with an elbow though sure like in Muay Thai it's one of the eight points of contact but a palm strike someone's charging I could just smack them that you could have a tremendous impact on your hand and still get away with it and knock someone out Jon hack woman who is Chuck Liddell's former trainer trainer of actually current trainer if he still works out training Clover to share just one of the best guys in MMA he has these little videos on his Instagram I think it's the pit or pit master pit master on Instagram talking about Street self-defence things and he's always advocating hitting people with your palm some people break their hands all Tommy isn't that the whole thing hit him in the nose to kind of that's not real that's not real the idea of Drive the bone up you'll break their nose not that you're gonna kill them but like that's the easiest self-defense anywhere even the side of the head but the ideas hitting him with the palm I thought you're gonna say when I said that's not real there was when we were kids it was like a karate movie yes a guy would hit the palm up to the nose the nose bone would go into the brain it would kill someone skin it that happened in like a Seagal movie just smash him in the nose I thought you're gonna say that but the idea is you could just without worry of consequences you could palm strike someone in the face like really hard and never break your hand a regular person throwing a punch you have a real good chance of breaking your hand okay real good chance like if you crack someone in the forehead most likely you gonna break your hand like that rest or something else but with your palms you could just fucking way lay somebody you could smack the shit out of somebody but then you look kind of silly there was a an organization that MMA more organization back in the early days called Pancrase I think they might be still around but they have modified rules but Pancrase back in the day they were wrestling shoes with shin pads and they wore like little tiny little speedos and they would smack each other with their hands so they'd kick and punch and do submission techniques was fairly crude in comparison to today's mm matter but we got to see a lot of leg locks back then and there was there was some fishy fights too but my point is like bas Rutten was the first guy figured out how to really fuck people up with palm strikes and what he did is he has really flexible wrists he's a badass striker so he learned how to pull his hands way back and he would just throw them like punches he would just do the same motions that he would do with a punch but just smash guys with his with his palms and he was lighting people up like Christmas tree grace with that it's horrific to what he fucked he Kayode a bunch of people with his palms huh CB watch bas Rutten KO put bas Rutten kalos foo naki he kod Funaki who is like an elite MMA fighter who was a Hicks and Gracie's last opponent when Hickson was fighting MMA but Funaki I think started out in Pancrase and bas Rutten ke Odom and the way ke Odom was like like like a punch but he was doing it with his palms huh just smashing people it's just like your hand like there's a lot of things you think wouldn't work clotheslines one of them that shit would work okay that's my point but mine not the honky tonk man's moved though what's the home to talk to shake rattle and roll I just flips him on his back it's like why is this even hurt mm you don't remember this you don't watch wrestling ladies no well how about the DDT here so here's boss I'll give that knee oh yeah back up before that back up before that here watch watch I hit him he's so he's usually boss was a fucking gorilla back there gonna sighs OH see smacking the shit out of them he's using his hand see how he's hitting with yeah yes he's throwing him like punches but this knees what did it boom yeah boss was a beast man he was a fucking beast he was probably the first really elite striker that we saw an MMA were you like whoa like this is what can happen like when he was kicking people and Pancrase everybody was like whoa like this is this guy can fucking kick like you're seeing a lot of guys who were kicking that were kind of like karate be yeah yeah maybe they didn't have as much power but bas was he was a Dutch kick box he was smashing people boom he looks scary as shit he was a bad motherfucker bad motherfucker he won the UFC heavyweight title he was the first guy ever I think in my recollection to win a title off of his back by from strikes he fought Kevin Randleman Kevin random is a badass wrestler kept taking him down and boss was beating the shit out of him from the bottom throwing elbows and they gave him a decision which a lot of people disagreed with but I was like man you look at the volume of strikes landed but damage and way more you just just being on tops not good enough you have to actually do something with the position huh okay this is not a subject expert mode yeah yeah yeah hey yeah this is this is the old-school buck you got to realize a body kick fuck fuck people up man bas Rutten was no joke man dude he was fucking people up they nobody had seen anything like that this those guys just couldn't strike like that they didn't have that kind of power you'd see the impact but then you know like all things it caught up yeah yeah good lord the USC then they got um there was some elite fighters to start showing up in the so yes they mando vite smashing machine marker marker yeah well he was different man he was a wrestler he was a wrestler slash science project he was juiced up real good oh my god that's to put it mildly it's a great documentary yeah the special machine you saw it yeah yeah it's amazing it caught him they would they were that documentary the purpose of it was initially to catch him as the scariest fighter on the planet this guy who's just this Goliath who's just dominating people in Japan but in the process of documenting it he was falling apart that's him when he was his biggest he was his neck would start at his ears and he was very skillful as well I mean just really gives all-american wrestler was one that right the elite wrestler and just just gigantic look at that upper left hand picture upper left look at that one yeah but click on that that's the one I started no why is it look no that's different it's very different the same photo no it's not it's just different photos yeah but look at them that one looks like shit go to the other one again that's a different version of it look at the fuckin Jesus Christ that is insane the fact that a person could get to look like that sounds insane there's guys that look like that at my gym fuck you all at Harbor Fitness who are listening to this show in the locker room while my scrawny ass is right there you don't even notice me well you wonder like what it's like walking around looking like that well you can find out if you took all those same steroids yeah but they're also like six you know yeah yeah you'd be a mini version of that yeah I do yeah likely praise yeah do you lift weights yeah what kind of shit do you do I have a split six days a week do you have a trainer yeah oh Michael Wolfe you trying to shout out to Michael Wolfe yeah yeah always a deadlift but it's also important for me psychologically and for people who are depressed or anxious I've sometimes have a lot of downtime so if I go to the gym I can tell my brain I'm objectively a better person than yesterday and I did something today so it really helps with keeping you mentally grounded I'm never gonna get jacked but I could I learned this from Matt Hughes Matt he was the first one take me to gym really yeah Matthew yeah all the first want to take you to it yeah Thurs book when I realized I don't have to look like marker I could still look like a better version of me yes and when you have that realization it's it's very liberating the mental health benefits yes and and people need to realize that and the thing is other people were like really I'd like the first day I went I was all nervous and I know what I'm doing and there was a guy I wish I could thank him he's like we don't this machine and I'm like yeah he goes thanks brother I like alright no one here is judging you everyone's doing their own shit yeah and if you're if you're happy you're working out and if you're fat everyone's cheering you on yeah yeah yeah they they're like fuck yeah you're getting it's good for you no the opposite of what people would think yeah so no one cares it's I really recommend it yeah there's a lot of gyms have a good culture of support a good culture of encouragement you know like there's a reason why a lot of people that are on Instagram are fitness people that are also motivational yeah this is the culture of these communities like when you see people doing raps like come on come on you got it you got it you got it like that sort of support is there's something - there's endorphins you get released when you're all pushing each other together I mean that's one of the big rushes of martial arts training is that you push each other you workout together and then afterwards over you just everything seems to be more normal and I seems more rational and I have people follow me on Twitter instead like Jack people and they give me advice and they're very supportive yes and that's that's the real big misconception I guess from those movies this is retro rom-coms will tell you that the guy who is like a big guy's a bully and sometimes he is but most the people who are like serious about fitness they want other people to be like come on this is this will be great for you yeah I think most people's experience with bullies is really high school stuff right it's like jocks in high school and a lot of them are just as we're saying insecure and a lot of them are also probably it's probably their experience it's experimental at home from their dad and I think that's changed a lot because thanks to the internet now I think the jocks respect the Nerds a lot more when I was working with Hughes and I met all those fighters they could not be friendlier or more like hey you're you're doing your thing I do my thing I can relate to that that's awesome so there was no I'll look at this pussy or whatever like that yeah well fighters are a lot nicer than people think but they're because they're so disciplined is it's that for sure and they know what it's like to get their ass kicked and it's humbling mas oyama who's a famous karate guy he he said it's not that fighters are any nicer is karthika he was calling it you know karate practitioners or any nicer it's just they're tired from training he might be right but they they do behave nicer because of that it's it's both but I think it's also one of the things I love about the Internet is that if you're doing your thing now people respect someone else's doing their own weird thing yeah as opposed to when we were kids there'd be that one weirdo like I had this tweet there's two types of people right if you learn someone is a guinea pig breeder there's two approaches you're weird what the fuck's wrong with you or sit down and tell me everything yeah and I'm very much and people who follow me or the second one it's like you're doing your thing it gives you joy and passion I've never heard of it let me know I want to know dude i watched an episode of Anthony Bourdain's old show was called No Reservations and he was in I forget what country was but these people bred guinea pigs for food oh yeah South America candies yeah they had guinea pigs running around the house oh they were all over the place yeah and then when they wanted to cook something they reached down grabbed a guinea pig just picked it up and killed oh yeah cooked it all the other kid because if you fucking yeah they said to me they're nearly dumb but they don't it's it's it's a good argument for eating guinea pigs it's like they don't seem to miss their friend I just got someone just paid held me a contribution 300 bucks Adam and he says go out to dinner buy something stupid hold on no better if someone says this is for stupid things I'm like all right it's an order it's your money so I bought some stupid things give you some money I got this and I'm like elephant is unethical mmm there's they recognize themselves in the mirror they have a social structure this is giraffe it's stupid I got a giraffe leather wallet let me see you go wow but it's nice and it's get your raps are so nice they're they're dumb they're like cows are they dumb they're doubt they're just dumb that they're dumb they're done are you sure I'm positive to run tests on my friend Owens my friend's parents each one is zoo and I've gone I've gone with him two differences giraffes are very dumb but they're so peaceful that they let little kids feed them at the zoo that's one of the only animals where they let people feed him that's true and they just reach out with their tongue oh yeah never forget that my daughter was like to take him to the zoo and her giggling and laughing they're amazing the big crazy tongue comes out and grabs the lettuce they can clean their ears with their tongue ooh yeah I would that was a joke that I used to have about how they're the only animal that I could point to that's a wild animal that doesn't seem to have any problem with domestication yeah when they're at the zoo they're like another day with no lions and just strolling around did you ever see that blue planet where the lines are trying to kill the giraffe in the desert and she's he's just kicking him in the face dude they kick him and break their mouth and jaws there's no child really dangerous for lions when they fuck with zebras or injure a strap zebras as well yeah yeah but whenever they fuck with any animal with hooves that's probably one of the reasons why they have hooves you know it's like a weapon same like they have antlers I mean it certainly helps them traverse difficult terrain it helps them run protects their feet where do you draw the line when it comes to like leather or different animals it's good question yeah I I've gotten very very interested in elephants you know in terms of like their social structure and what they're like and in learning about how intelligence they are and how long the memory is and I don't want to have anything to do with elephant leather like or ivory unless it's pre bad a cue a long time ago that had elephant ear as a rap okay and I didn't think anything of it but now I think yeah that's my line I like they have elephant wallets and I was like no I'm not comfortable this here's your thing man pigs are super fucking smart pigs are real sweet and when you domesticate them like people have domesticated pigs that lungs are well fed they behave a lot dogs the only difference being of course if you fall on the Pigpen they will fucking eat you yeah and they got a do ya often that have thats a very common way for farmers to die they fall in the Pigpen and the finally scraps of clothes and like oh my god and just a puddle blood my buddy but fuck is left there yes so I know now thankfully they're coming out with this kind of synthetic food you know this isn't that even meat people know that mimics pork or chicken I'm mimicking its actual chicken cells or pork cells yes yes and that's gonna be a great day yeah that brings me the the beyond burger that people keep it go --gel discs because I want to make sure this is true someone sent me this I didn't have the time to check beyond meat test positive for glyphosate lets glyphosate glyphosate is roundup Masson this is very fucking dangerous they're trying to pretend it's not but meanwhile they're dishing out fucking lawsuits when yeah yeah one couple got was it 2 billion dollars I got a two billion dollar ruling against Monsanto another guy got 5 million it's just it's a 2 billion because they got cancer being pesticides I'm like maybe the I'll drink that 6 you got a good lawyers were big yeah they're probably gonna lose and I mean that seems like a lot of money of course but I was reading that that you know if it's a it's a meat-based a non meat based burger that's supposed to taste pretty similar to me I haven't had one no but what the one's saying is now they figured out how to take ya cells and replicate right it actually is meat no bright but it says no animals being killed right which is the ideal she wonder if it's an it's dangerous for you but this glyphosate thing I need to find out if this is correct that's the only reason why I brought it up I just remembered and I think it's important for people to have this is one of the best things about that whole kind of paleo Whole Foods situation no way if you're gonna act in a certain way towards your food know what you're doing yeah I'd be happy to draw that line about ok what are you comfortable with and defend your decision yeah yeah what what are you willing to kill you know my friend Chris Pratt oh yes hey he's got a farm like his own thing that he does and he takes lamb and you know he he puts the rod on their head and yeah and puts him to sleep and they have no idea what's gonna happen and then they just die instantly and he made this like really detailed post on Instagram about it and people got super upset with them you know that he talked about this as a peaceful thing and that he has these animals that he loves and cares for and you can see pictures of him like touching them and holding them and then later they're packaged up as meat and like but but you saw just a steak you wouldn't have a problem with it like if someone said look I cook the steak you'd get a lot of people like oh that looks good but it's like I killed this animal and now I'm gonna cook it people like you're a monster everyone has to other than getting hit by cars and if people have to put down their dogs and their cats yeah so maybe this is not and that lamb is being bred for that purpose and it's being done painlessly that's the important thing and I'm sure that lamb had a good life and it wasn't a factory crowded shoulder-to-shoulder existence this torture situation yeah I'm sure but it's a very quick life you know lamb is a baby sure lambs a baby nature is about us eating babies yeah I've no I haven't had mutton I haven't had like a sheep sheep you know that's such a British thing and it's always like in these old story books you read but like now I don't think sheep get become adult unless they're for their fur or their hair well I've had wild sheep my friend Remy Remy Warren he gave me some some wild sheep backstrap it was very good some wild sheep that he killed well I'm gonna while I'm here I'm gonna try hagfish have you had fish that's that weird fucking slimy thing yeah at the bottom of the ocean how do they cook that I it's Korean barbecue there's one place here that has it I like it super legit Korean BBQ yeah yeah yeah they're cooking hagfish yeah well I'm cooking it I guess technically what does it taste like like I haven't tried it yet I can't wait what's the reports uh not that good I'm not surprised I like sign me up well I like since I have a zoology background I learned I'm like Noah but I want to eat at two of every animal you know have you had jellyfish yet I have it's tasteless it's weird it's like plastic yeah it's the saucer has a chest yeah strange I ate at a restaurant that's in the wind yeah it's in the wind and it's the only five-star Chinese restaurant in the country or in North America it's insanely good like you you realize like wow it's true like you don't see a whole lot of gourmet right like super high-end Chinese restaurants what did you have anything weird there yeah I had that I had jellyfish sea cucumber head no I didn't have that I had abalone that was really that was not that a lot of times just like credit cards a balloon it wasn't that yeah I've had abalone before and I liked it I liked it I don't I don't love it it's expensive - what do you got Jamie so from couple articles I just found the the issue seems to be in pea protein which is what is used to make these burgers and article what I found about what you were saying is the impossible burger actually tested 11 times higher when tested for glyphosate then they be on meat burger which is there's two different versions I eat P protein protein chips every day is that a problem so there's an article I'm getting some glyphosate what does that mean as P protein could have its own concerns the detox project a research organization looking into pesticides of glyphosate that's been looking into it for over a year it says that there's there is an issue there's a heart we can hardly decision clean protein anywhere the results like those for other products tested for the popular pesticides aren't pretty it's a very we can hardly find a clean P protein source anywhere Jesus Christ it's all got glyphosate there's but I still don't know what glyphosate does today glyphosate this is the idea okay and please Google this because the argument was glyphosate is great because it just kills the weeds and bacteria and it doesn't kill people okay actually drink it well the problem they're saying is no no you have bacteria in your body so if you're taking in glyphosate you're killing the bacteria in your body it might not kill you sure but it's not good for you and it fuck's up your system okay this is the argument I guess that they use to present in court they must have used this to get the jury to award them two billion dollars in damage cancer yeah yeah that's not a monsanto parent company bare feet faces thousands of roundup cancer cases after two billion dollar verdict thirteen thousand cases right now yeah listen man this thing I don't know there's this is what the problem first of all I'm a moron I don't know anything about any of the science behind this when I read this I see two different cancer just like so many other things yeah I see people saying there's no evidence this is just they're all hysteria but is that the people that work for Bayer is that like their PR firm that's putting this out there to try to like alleviate people's concerns and stop some lawsuits in their tracks they try and do influence public opinion on this or is there real science it shows that this stuff is really bad for you but there's definitely a bunch of people online that are telling you that it's horrible for you here exposure to glyphosate base herbicides in a risk for non-hodgkins lymphoma a meta-analysis and supporting evidence I don't want to switch off my pea protein it ain't good bro hemp protein but that should get tested too I'm what am I saying just

Solaris there's no taking anything no need no need to try to make it smoother it's hard to put the calories down though is my point no it's not it's open your mouth chew swallow oh yeah baby your grandfather would have died for a steak like this Jesus Christ listen to yourself you saying all the shit you would get mad at people if they're saying about any other subject it's hard it's hard to eat all that food it's hard it's hard to get by in this world it's hard it's hard it's hard to get up every morning it's hard I work hard I work hard how fucking hard is it to eat steak look at me bro just eat it cook it eat it put some salt on it delicious maybe like some steak sauce do whatever you got to do to get that steak down your stomach sir get some grass fade grass fed grass fed grass raised it's got a darker richer taste it seems like a lot of work grass fed no just cooking steaks all the time you learn how to do it it's easy is it get yourself a nice grill all right I'm in Brooklyn though you're in Brooklyn you got a yard no no Oh Brooklyn come okay get a cast-iron skillet I can get one that's all you need it's not gonna stink up my house yeah I'll stick up your house okay mistake yeah commands house okay smell good people would be like taste that Michaels living good he's got the steak life he'll be knocking on doors how about your box bros are grass-fed let me just cut it for me let me see what you got you got a medium rare oh yeah kosher salt yeah well I got a kosher chef it's the thicker sauce if I use I like the pyramid salt what's that it's shaped like a pyramid the crystals really yeah they do it a certain way no it's crunch here if you're gonna cook a steak like a man correctly you need kosher salt okay how many count how much grams of protein or is steak a lot it's all you need to know shove it down your fucking mouth I follow my macros every well - oh are you really getting serious about that I've always been because I've been eating disorders so this is a way direction okay yeah um you'd have to look I mean it's it's certainly more for wild game which is mostly what I eat than it is for store-bought meat okay but store-bought meat I would I would guarantee you that there's more nutrients in grass-fed meat I don't know if there's more protein that doesn't seem to make sense but if you look at like it could be more protein because they might be less fat or whatever but more fat yes that's - of course it would be more protein if it was leaner yeah for the same amount of ounces yeah but there's also a bunch of other shit em toward and essential fatty acids that exist in grass-fed meat so it's all good stuff okay let's get some steak and stop with the P protein bro okay sorry protes I'm not eating your people it might be fucking you up man I wonder I wonder how many people are getting fun what are the dangers of consuming glyphosate other than non-hodgkins lymphoma maybe this is what you're seeing over and over in people yeah better not kill my gains there was my game I don't think P protein is helping your gains there's something about knowing that you're getting all your protein from Peas that's all of it some of it makes you 60 grams mmm day what do you got - an endocrine disruptor oh that's just no joke that's what glyphosate liver disease birth defects reproductive problems in animals oh Christ what is this from I just typed in dangers of glyphosate I don't want to get them do you I don't want to get a birth defect I don't know what that is pull up whatever us are TK it's fine it might be horseshit we should otherwise that org you asked o us right - no right - no mmm that sounds anything like what is it what is that based on this that's not legitimate look at that top news on the right trial from monsanto hometown it's all Monsanto everything's Monsanto this is just news story from today they're all over the news right but you got to be care this is not real story though look at all the top news is almost like on their contact I bet you it's just some it should have a some dude GMOs are look litigation oh they're litigating this is from the lawyers mmm could be yes I spend the lawyer pushing for truth and transparent yeah this is the lawyers yeah the food system this is looks and if there are two billion dollar rulings you can just bet your sweet ass McFly see shit people that are swarming on this subject all right would be a better source of information now nomads good question what do we got here Alex let's call Alex Alex Jill no he I don't know he's up on food stuff he know about the the plastic wrap that gives you raises your kind estrogen you know the ones who make southernxposure Day Scientific American yeah okay that's good that's good 2009 weed-whacking herbicide Wow deadly to human cells used in gardens farms and parks around the world the weed killer roundup contains an ingredient that can suffocate human cells in a laboratory researchers say yeah so will kill my gains yeah it's suffocating myself fuck that whatever that is whatever whatever has that on it fuck that stuff okay I'm gonna go to more weight than just carnivore die that's your move okay I'd like Jordan Peterson joins on carnivore yes yes okay over a year huh it's helped him tremendously how so well first of all intellectually he says it's really alleviated a lot of his autoimmune issues that he thinks we're slowing him down and wearing him out and making him tired and he has more energy okay the things he says he's at his peak intellectually and he credits that a lot of that through this diet he's lost 50 pounds all the eats is me when I'm saying all these does mean I mean that's it what a drink sigh water enough there's none okay he doesn't have any of that he drinks water and he eats meat and for the veal oh you what I heard this I heard that okay you know what else I heard I heard that the food pyramid was all green at the bottom and that's not the case anymore right there's a lot of shit and I'm not saying this is for everybody cuz it's not for everybody it's not even good for everybody there's a lot of people if they ate meat every day all day probably terrible for them but for some people it seems that particularly people with autoimmune disorders they achieve some at least anecdotally some really positive results Jordan Peterson has gone as far as to take I think he took three blood tests when he had a one-year in for insurance purposes and much things showed because you know obviously you're gonna insure a guy who's 55 years old just eat steak all the time like oh my god this guy's gonna die right no everything's fine everything's healthy no coronary artery disease no plaque no cholesterol levels are all fine everything's fine this sounds like it would be exorbitant though too financially yeah maybe not the cheapest way to Harold I mean you can get Costco steaks you get some supermarkets have cheaper cuts it really depends on what you know you could also eat just ground beef that's not as bad you don't eat as much and that's one of the reasons why when you're on what they call an elimination diet one of the one of the cool thing that might be fuckin with you except the one thing that you can write zoom easily and this is one of the things they're calling the carnivore diet elimination and an elimination diet when you do that you wind up eating less food which is one of the reasons why these people just eat steak and wind up losing weight they don't you don't take in any car unless they're all but that's us basically also kind of Atkins if they're not taking a car sort of but there's a thing called Google Genesis and like not necessarily sort of Atkins but sort of Kido but it's more Atkins than keto and that Atkins diet works oh yeah you stick to it it does work and when your pay stubs way and when your piece starts to smell it's great that's when you know the party started yeah you're in ketogenesis great or kosis and when you're in ketosis man you really do have energy throughout the day because your body's not craving carbohydrates so you don't have this up-and-down blood sugar crash the thing about the carnivore diet is it's not even ketogenic really I mean you're in ketosis sometimes but you're not eating that much fat you're just eating a lot of meat and a lot of it with fat some of it without fat I thought ketosis is loke wasn't wouldn't you have no carbs it's not a function no oh here's why okay because when your body eats a lot of steak and you don't have any carbohydrates you your body does something called glucose Ennis's where I'll convert steak into glucose so it actually convert protein into glucose okay and it'll actually knock you out of ketosis if you take in too much protein and not enough fat okay it's got a proportion ketosis is I think somewhere in the 80% range if you you would be consuming like 80 percent of your calories from fats you'd be kind of amazed and actually can fuck with some people's gains they don't think they're getting enough protein because they're getting a lot of fat and a smaller amount of protein like less grams approach you might not be ideal in terms of like physical performance for athletes they think but when you when you do do that and you just eat steak your bodies is alright this asshole doesn't want to eat apples you know we have to figure out how to get our carbs yeah and we have to get it figure out how to get our sugar so we're just gonna get it through the steak huh okay it's a weird thing that's like people some people are unaware of that but your body literally produces it turns protein into like a glucose substitute glucose actually leuco Genesis yeah you can do it I've done it for several days I've never done it for long periods of time but I was I wanted to try it when they were doing national carnivore month well this knuckleheads is people are so into it carnivore diet is a lot like the vegan diets they can't shut the fuck up about being a carnivore my buddy Michael Goldstein who is the first person I know who's about Bitcoin is that Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin same thing with carnival a carnival carnival carnival it's like alright so I tried it for a couple of weeks I think I went from like close to two weeks and after a while I was like Jesus Christ or twenty regular foods I know I'm not being I'm not joking I would think you'll be a problem with getting it stuck in your teeth all the time no you just brush your teeth what are you dusting what's wrong with you have a toothpick at home excuse me I have every flavor of Marvis on my shelf right now Marvis Oh interesting now who doesn't know about tooth care what's Marvis is the like italian toothpaste brand it looks really cool although the flavors are subpar the point is brushing your teeths not gonna get it not stuck in between your teeth that's not gonna help flossing yeah flot you're gonna be out flossing all the time no I just bite off bigger chunks like a man just swallow it Oh always chewing can I tell you a story about this this just happened to me yes and this is when I realized that most people there's no mind there I am at a buffet I'm eating steak I was eating steak congratulations I get stuck in my throat I'm like alright it's just too big peace I'll just wash it down mmm it's not going anywhere and I realize I'm choking and it was a very scary situation in the sense that mentally I knew there is a percent chance that I'm gonna die did you try to throw up hold on hold on I'll let me tell the story Joe Rogan so I'm sitting there I'm like holy shit I'm choking and I'm like all right I was calm but I'm like your life is currently in danger and there's a three people at the next table two got two in there two women their 50s it got in their 60s I go up to them and I'm like I know what to do because I was at school and I go them and I go I'm choking and I did the hand motion and I make eye contact with each of them no look no effect on their face and I'm like at the very least you have a crazy person coming up to your table doing a neck motion were you in New York yeah that's a problem I people do sense dice did this to myself and it shot out and then I go - how'd you do to yourself show me how I just did this that's oh yeah I saw Heimlich like I don't know if it was the cloth or whatever it popped out and all the liquid - after it and I go to them I go I was just choking and they're like oh well you should shoot your food better I'm like someone was just Chuck said that's you that one lady should get that lady's name she doesn't have an answer because there's not a human being there there's no mind and I'm like holy shit if I saw this happen and I didn't help I would be like oh my god you just oh my holy shit are you okay it was like I should shoot your food you're not a soul holds this there 50s somebody probably just treat her bad man not bad enough bad relationships it was scary the reaction was scarier than the choking yeah I would imagine well I think that's a really common thing with big cities that that sort of there's a diffusion of responsibility when there's so many people there's so many you don't feel responsible for this guy with his hands on his neck saying I'm coughing like somebody else go Ted somebody handle this I work I would be fine if they had shrugged and then like yeah whatever in a sense but there was no reaction she's probably so jaded so whoever you are lady I hope that exactly you fuck you I I hope you go back in time and you have a better daddy and a better mom me and better friends yeah and you grow up to be a nice person and I and yeah in her 50s maybe she could be a yoga teacher gonna save someone's life in her mind and be like I save someone's life today I go into heaven yeah maybe she thought you were nuts and you're just trolling her but if I was nuts you would think they'd pull back and be like holy shit there's a crazy person in our table maybe it's because of your troll like wait the universe is sent your way you're the boy who cried wolf the lesson is you're invincible and nothing bad will ever happen oh because you survived I survived oh do you know how to do that to someone else now if someone was choking do you know to give Hana look I think I do it we all think we do right that's the thing but it's like you have to get it right here like right where the ribcage the sternum and you push up I think people get the ribs broken all the time yeah they're supposed to yeah you're supposed to be as hard as you can but the alternative yeah agent Matthews doing that to you as far as you can that would be very painful you just black an old chicken yeah no pea protein there and you get in trouble for helping and hurting of course you can 100% of course yes you can get in trouble for shooting a burglar especially if you're a strong person like if you're like that Robert Frank are they approve you yet no checks I was looking on his Twitter account I couldn't tell what the video was he might have it on Twitter yeah maybe it's uh yeah I bet he does right well but isn't he like um he's uh I don't know the topic was he had a couple videos up but it could have been this is what it looks like for some reason now Instagram wants to send me Twitter wants to send me to the Instagram from the web and Knox France it happens that you're an Apple what do they do that should have been an away message should have been an Android why does it do that but does Android work better for that what's in it for the purpose of it for the purpose of the joke yeah it doesn't I have Android to have an Android phone as well but don't doesn't Google I collect way more data than Apple does I think they yeah it's my understanding there's this gathering data and selling it whereas apples kind of trying to avoid that amount of support Apple did a great great thing where they had that set up where they can't even break into their phone and defying law-enforcement that was really wonderful not just that but your information right terms of relocation information and where you're going and what you're doing with Google every time you're getting online they're just trying to do it where yeah what do you want what do you need there's a great documentary called the creepy line and they talk about like let's suppose face on Facebook and I want to influence elections right what if if I have an ad that says get on vote it's gonna crush people vote what if I just ran that ad on Donald Trump fans people who like Donald Trump don't run on Hillary fans that would sway the election and no one would know mmm so what they do with this information is very quiet and there's not that much transparency and it can really lead to especially with the sheer with foreign countries how with China how they're like you know being perfectly happy to kind of sensor stuff this is these are things that need to be asked yeah I was talking to a woman who's an executive and her position was that if they didn't do it Google's gonna copy it anyway so might as well just let Google censor and this way Google won't invent their own Google sure and just copy all the code and steal the code and that's a fair response but these are things that people I think should think more about yeah well especially with something like China where the government and the industry are all tied in right this is why I was really weirded out by this Huawei thing today when it came to Google and Google because you want to say well if Google's doing this clearly there must be a real reason for it but then you know about the Google memo and James d'amour oh yeah oh yeah cuz when you've done that I gotta go okay the guy just provided scientific information didn't say anything sexist he's just talking about the facts of studies right and you fired him for what you called like what was it reinforcing sexist stereotypes and it wasn't the case at all it's not what he did but so many people are complaining about his report on the data that they were asking about while also saying that he doesn't know math and statistics when that wasn't have an MIT degree yeah well he's a coder yeah so it's it's what happens is is when they have this fundamentalist faith mm-hmm you start with the conclusion and your recent array backward and if you're contradicting my conclusion you're not only wrong you're a liar and a sinner and have to be driven from the face of the earth well that's why I would ordinarily defer to them I'm like wow this must be pretty serious if Google is looking to take Gmail off of the new Huawei phones and not update the operating system but then I go well no that's not right what's going on at all yeah I don't know we don't know what's going on we might never know that is a problem when you do one thing like that like there's giant consequences for what they probably thought was a PR disaster probably have to get rid of this James to more guy let's just do it well justify and I think the culture of the company probably supported it's probably very less demanding it didn't support it it's a man that it was my understanding a company yeah even though it does logically and the rest that was really interesting too you see outside of the bubble where the rest of the world the people who actually read his memo and looked at it we're like okay what is wrong with what he's saying he's not saying anything bad about women right he's in fact he had a page and a half talking about strategies to get women more interested in tech he was just relaying the information as a stands in terms of the studies that have been done that show what women tend to gravitate towards what men tend to grab right words these aren't sexist studies these are studies where they're just trying to figure out why do more women go into health care why do is it opportunity is it desire like is it is it just natural cultural sure there's a lot of things and so data is not sexist this guy was just talking about data and then when you looked at his own ideas there was rent sexist either he was just talking about strategies that this is where I disagree with you they will say data is sexist because it has conclusions that contradict what they air quotes know to be true so therefore if the data contradicts this the data is sexist that's so crazy that that's the left the left used to be science driven and now they logical ones their left has this is one of the big myths and I talked about this in the book they have from Woodrow Wilson on have this evangelical fundamentalist face a segment of the left there's many people on the Left who are very science driven who are like look these are the facts let's work about but there's a big segment of them which are very prevalent where they're basically like jihadis and you have this on the right as well where it's just like these are my conclusions and we're gonna force everyone to fit said conclusions hmm so you think that even like when you go back to was that fuckin there was the terrorist organization that Obama's professor was involved the weatherman the weatherman yeah like that you go back to that similar to almost like an educated version of NP f-- I'm going back to what Joe Wilson yeah but I mean if you went back yeah it's real similar to what we're absolutely yeah and they were that's there's a book called days of Rage and it talks about how in the early 70s there were bombs going off I think every week in America and they weren't trying to kill people it was political they they called him the bomb threat and be like look we're gonna set up a bomb but the point is they there are other cities living at Liberation Army with had Patty Hearst a few of them you're the Weather Underground they they really this was their thing and they blew up a townhouse in New York City you know killed a bunch of people and now they're walking around and they're fine it's it's a fast and it's all been swept under the rug like people always think that no matter what's happening now is like regard select these like neo-nazi types and like all they all right oh this is the worst time ever it's like the client used to be like a major part of both political parties like what are you talking about things used to be Woodrow Wilson is playing Birth of a Nation at the White House things were really really dark before and but people don't have the historical context no it's easy to not know what happened before but just to think about what's going on now and where you want things to go yeah so therefore it's really really bad and therefore it must be the worst right yeah there's a better there's a better way to live for sure but I think we went we went into real problems when you start telling people what they can and can't do yeah no matter what it is no matter what it is and you tell people that what they can and can't do you sort of reinforce I think one of the things that's going on now in terms of like these abortion rulings oh gosh yeah yeah which was very sketchy yes Carrie and the Alabama one which essentially just outlaws abortion right there making it where your punishment for abortion is far greater punishment than the punishment for raping someone and causing them to get an abortion so well they don't punish the woman I think they punish the doctor the law punishes the doctor yeah yeah the doctor gets ninety nine years something like that that's right it's the doctor who's being charged not the woman that's and the question is in Georgia and Alabama maybe a baby right but the question is why do you want this but if you regard this mother as a potential murderer do you really want her raising that kid right for - yeah ninety nine years in jail oh yeah another thing is that I am very torn in this issue abortion on Twitter it's such a cesspool of people who don't understand each other one group saying oh it's all about a you wanna control woman's body and the other being like all you want to murder babies no no they don't want to murder babies and they don't care about the woman they care about what they perceive to be the infant so I try to talk to both and it's it's just noise yeah these are rigid ideologies and they're not persuasive if you tell someone who is pro-choice who would otherwise be amenable to your point of view well you just want to murder kids it's like well I don't so there's nothing to talk anymore did you see that state representative that was walking around in front of a abortion clinic and was trying to get the names of these kids that were there oh yeah yeah he's still on Twitter yeah no consequences that's crazy he was trying to Doc's kids he was asking for he was gonna keep offering money bribing them yeah hundred dollars a hundred dollars to get the names of whoever these people are it's it's insane gets to this one boy and he puts his boys face on Twitter just some meek shy Christian right this is a big guy he's big and aggressive and he's getting in people's face with the camera right and then he's putting them online and he's getting a lot of attention and fame for it and it's crazy and meanwhile my buddy Mike he has a parody account of aoc he gets kicked off that's crazy yeah and it says parody yeah why can't you do that I mean I don't think what he did was even rough it wasn't it wasn't anything I don't really awful like I've read some of the tweets I was like they're just kind of funny they're a parody yeah what about sine alive I think exactly exactly what we're out baldwin does to the president every fucking day on Saturday Night Live every week he's doing a fucking Trump impression right as well he should that's your job exactly so it's a complete double standard it's it's and the other thing I'll defend Jack in this regard what we talked about earlier I'm sure the pressure he gets internally oh my god he's off the charts and he even said this explicitly goes they were all my whole company was yelling at me to kick off Alex you know for a long time he refused to do it for a while yeah it's it's weird that they don't see the consequences they don't understand that this is gonna go to a bad place but this is they do see the positive consequences where they're preaching to their own tribe and basically the people who aren't like us get to go out in the gutter in the gutter in the wilderness well I think human beings are way better at expressing themselves today than they ever have been in the past and I think one of the reasons why is the free expression that we so enjoy and that we have enjoyed you know like if you if you look at the history of what you could the message you could get out just 40 or 50 years ago as opposed to what you can't get out today and then you looked at how culture has radically evolved over the last 40 years versus where if everything was stagnant like it was in 1950 we would we would think if you watch like 1950s films or read books about the 1950s the behavior that people got away with was it was way different oh yes it is today of course things are getting better but one of the reasons why these things are getting better is because people can see everything you can talk through all the details yes if you think you can just cut off the ugly stuff cut off the Nazi stuff and cut off this stuff and you're gonna keep people from getting recruited so you're gonna kill this and you're gonna deep platform this you're also gonna you're gonna enforce assholes to say like there's a reason why they're silencing us there's a reason why instead of having people go and hey no you guys are shitheads and this is a stupid idea right and you guys are all ignorant fools and your perception of the things is so off and we're gonna explain to you while it's off and we're gonna all like work this out together and when they say there's a secret elite who's running this country and wants to control your life they mean the Jews what don't they check is up they know shut it down this but this is their proof they can point to Twitter and Facebook and they could also say hey they're picking off the same exact people and every platform it's not a coincidence whereas David Duke is still on Twitter yes yeah of course that's hilarious is it no but it's telling no song hilarious like ha I know but yeah they got rid of Farrakhan they didn't get rid of David Duke right right because David Duke serves a purpose what purpose because he's a good foil for the left because when David Duke endorses a Republican look oh the Republicans are racist when David Duke endorses Ilhan Omar or Keith Ellison crickets there he'll be a good bad guy on payroll like if I was the Democratic Party I'd say look David you think jig is up okay everybody knows I'm never gonna be President right now we're gonna really run for office anywhere legitimate but she's not that good valuable how about this David will give you $400,000 a year all you have to do is every now and then I'm gonna call you up but I'm say Dave you know be interesting it would be interesting if David Duke endorsed this asshole and then David Duke just starts talking about this person being a fine American and a white nationalist and all these different just make up a bunch of quotes and have David Duke put it up there a lot of people when don't have a shake that off a lot of people think he's controlled like not him specifically control opposition is control F is this oh that's my favorite alright when someone's not bad they must be controlled opposition that is one of my favorite I love that she dork it is a control opposition is someone who you don't like who hasn't been banned yet yeah controlled opposition is a useful idiot yeah controlled opposition is it it's like when people get into these I've been accused of being a CIA plant you probably are probably one of these base for Anarchy you know that the term cognoscenti like oh yeah I was in the know yeah yeah that's a great term and that's like that's perfect for this it's like all useful idiot all controlled opposition I'm in the know I'm one of the cognoscenti I'm gonna sneak this by me I understand but meanwhile sometimes they're right which is why it's really fucked up it's like sometimes there is controlled opposition sometimes there is sometimes just fake websites good times just because somebody wants yeah probably yeah somebody wants to win a lawsuit you know look at this I'm deer deer with this case you're working on come and look at this website I found but that's my babies that's why it's so important for there to be venues for those people if someone is crazy or brilliant well often looks the same right but how does a person know whether or not that website's right or well once we get to Scientific American we all get like okay this legit is legit claim they're basically talking about sells they were talking about human cells I don't know any better drawing human cells but here's here's a problem with that what I was gonna say is at what scale because by the way they've shown that certain elements and plants in laboratory environment will destroy cells you even like phytonutrients and there was some something one of the head guys for the carnivore diet Shaun Baker posted on his Twitter a while back showing that you can make a lot of weird arguments based on cells like how things respond to cells doesn't necessarily mean once it gets through the organism safe yeah yeah the only way in my view and I'm not an expert on this is discourse mm-hmm and having a platform where people can argue at each other and you could stand by and watch and see things otherwise if you're silencing it's it's it's as various as we talked before and I think any right minded person would agree is very very slippery slope I agree did you see the Ben Shapiro meltdown on the BBC I did yeah yeah that's a good example it's a good example which I don't look he didn't handle it well he knows he didn't handle it well and I'd like that but I would like him a lot I think he's a really nice guy I like talking to him I don't agree with him on many things but I really like him he's a really good guy I think he's a very smart guy I think he's smart enough to admit that he fucked up he did he did he went on Twitter and Zoe here's think I didn't mean making fun of him it's on my and people are white knighting for him and I'm like he owned that he played it wrong yeah yeah and he's like yeah I got god that's to his credit yeah and it highlights to me more so than anything the problem with two things one doing a remote show sure where you from you're in Los Angeles they're in the UK sure where you know he was talking to him like he wasn't there the British guy was because he wasn't really there right and then the other part is that short time format you don't know enough time you have had time to have a conversation and just talk but Ben knows this fan is a pro I mean he knows what the BBC is too but he's also a pro at doing those things yes to shout talking points at each other and taco which and Ben talk super fast cuz are super fast it's really hard to keep up with him and he's sound smarter than you he's very smart yeah and articulate any talks fast I was like woo he rose to prominence when he was on Piers Morgan yeah I talked about guns and if you thought that BBC interview was rude piers at one point just goes you're real stupid men aren't you like that's your line and Ben didn't storm off he was just like no I just think when a government becomes usurpation that it's very important for the cities that had you know and he handled a good impression we go to the same shul he handled it amazingly so for him as he admitted for him to lose his shit and also to be like I'm popular and I've never heard of you that's just because you never heard of someone and I'm sure he would admit this is of no relevance to their the validity of what they're doing yeah that's why I was shocked when I went to Joe Joe see well last night it was sold out I literally didn't know she was until a week ago a lot of people know her I'm the same more so than Ben Shapiro I'm the second most famous Joe here what the fuck happened and she's 16 there's like ben shapiro did a speech at the microsoft center i don't know how many tickets he sells if he does speeches but sell 7,000 people's are hard you don't think ben shapiro could still 7,000 tickets that's a lot yeah but that's basically you're getting a two hour speech in one hour so that's you know I already have to double the value no but it's getting people out of their house to pay money to come hear people talk like most of these like when these guys are doing these talks and is Jordan Jordan kind of a football stadium yeah but a lot of these guys are doing like 2,000 Cedars okay this is 7,000 this is a big jump okay seven people I bet you he could fill it maybe maybe it's possible I don't know I'm gonna know if he's doing live ones like there's a lot of people doing live shows now it's very interesting because they're old timey - very old timey yeah but it's also it's cool to see people that are interested in intellectual exam Harris's some fantastic one and I like some what if some of Sam's live ones too because he's funny in them yeah which he's he gets a chance to actually work to the crowd yeah you know I was talking to him about him like you have good timing yeah you're not like a comic like some of the stuff you say actually makes me laugh when he does live ones as opposed to he's very like rational and somber when he's doing straight you know just just conversation ones you know this is a performer and stay with me like if you're in front of that audience and the Laugh is out of proportion because there's so many of them and just have that one-liner it makes you want to be more on and it's like it's this median stale and it's really really exciting it's also like a nod to the crowd that you know that they're there and you're trying to entertain them you appreciate them like you say something fun like yeah you're doing it they know you're doing it because they're there and it's funny you know and what it's improv that's much more intimate you know when you've got that one-liner that you knew wasn't part of this speech it's great so they're doing theirs their way whether it's just conversations and it's interesting because they're getting these giant crowds and you know they're also like do produced ones too like Radiolab does it produce live one and it's really interesting they'll bring someone out and they'll play sound clips and I don't know if they have a video element of it let's see I think they do I think they have like visuals too but they're doing it all in these big ass theaters and people love it and they come out to see it so for someone who listens to like Radiolab every week and they get a chance to go and see it live it's like wow I can't believe it's here it's a part of my life and this is the danger of the summer Twitter Facebook stuff people are desperate and excited to hear new ideas stop provoking people even if you disagree right - my favorite people like a lot of times if you hear them talk even if you don't care what there's or disagree with them the energy and it's like this is fascinating it's not provoking for me it's just it's nothing's better I think there's something really cool about people coming out to see these really interesting discussions too like Jordan had a debate with this laughs let's get Jack yeah thank you for saying his name yeah I think I pronounced it right maybe you better you than me about Marxism yeah and it sold out yeah and then they had pay-per-view people were buying Oh watch this just like the dub w/e of our time it's like how are these two people our room together I want to see this and they actually want to agreeing on quite a few things and just it was really an interesting discussion but it's also interesting that that that Marxism is such a attractive subject that they're willing to host this giant event and pay to see people debate this topic it's like this is this idea that you could fill up a whole arena for an intellectual discourse yeah or a theater I mean I'm sorry take the place was and then you could also sell pay-per-view tickets for like what the fuck are you talking about who the hell's gonna pay to hear that at school get out of here with that shit it's not I wish school was like that I wish right there's no better way to get kids to hate learning than school every kid is so excited about the world you know go on us to go the museum not every kid a lot read books then you go to school and that all goes away and you're a factory worker so this anything that reinvigorate your show does this do reinvigorates your love of learning and how much there's so much interesting crazy shit out there who doesn't love that and that's the only native the the jocks back in the day didn't have that space and now thanks to you and people like you it's like you know what I don't like reading books readings not for me I could sit here and listen for three hours and I'm gonna be a smarter person than it was three-hour go and learn stuff who doesn't love history yeah even if you're the biggest meathead it's like this shit's interest or like these crazy animals either biggest meat had a be like oh shit that's cold you hear about this you know this is the giraffe weevil which has a hinge in its neck but only the males and it's from Madagascar yeah yeah the other thing it is a real thing and I was gonna say this like it's fuel for your curiosity yeah and for your create it's gonna give you ideas it's gonna like there's so much fuel for creativity right now like more so than any other time there's so much information and interesting shit you could learn and do it easily like you just find a pot like I need to learn about economics and you just find an economics podcast and start playing it and if the person is good you know they're they're interesting to talk to and they can do it in a fun way like you were listening to Peter Schiff yeah yeah he knows his shit I've had him on a few times and the way he describes thing it's like he's entertaining as well as factual as well as a compelling charismatic person while he's talking about these things he's getting fired up and you're like oh okay so that's how it works yeah it's so much better than absorbing in a dry stale manner and if you and then you go from that like oh let me know you he mentioned this thing let me learn about this oh there's a YouTube video about this and you go down this rabbit hole and it's just like hours of entertainment and you're and you can have better conversation with other people hey I learned about this this and that yeah I feel so far behind kids these days like I mean an 18 year old today I feel like a 30 year old when I was a kid all right in what way they're smarter they have more info yeah more data they know it's horseshit and what's not when we were in our twenties we didn't know what the fuck was real what was fake there was no YouTube right there's no Google there was books and he didn't read them all I read him yeah you might I know Joe yeah I'm older than you yeah you had books about like to find out whether or not something's true right like we do today you know I'm saying yeah yeah like when I was in my 20s like I wasn't like researching subjects that I've read a few books here and there but I wasn't researching things on every single aspect of the world the way the the access to this information just so radically different so you just have a thing in your pocket that answers your question what else is fast-setting is google and other organizations have digitized entire libraries so many of these books that are old are public domain and for free you can read this book from 1910 where these ideas got started and instead of hearing someone's interpretation of it now you can see where this idea developed in how they looked at the world back then now here's the real question is that action absolutely we both agree incredibly valuable resource is that worth giving up the data like maybe we should just accept the fact that they gave us something to change the world so of course they got super rich hey Mark Zuckerberg I know what you did it's ok it's ok you take that data yeah take it bitch yeah you like that shit richest person well you deserve it you shouldn't you shouldn't just give it away for free well I change the world in a better way no I should take advantage of the fact that you changed the world in a better way to profit in some insane spectacular way when I generate billions and billions of towers the thing we don't know is how they are generating that profit that's the issue you know so if they're doing it in a certain way that we know about all right if they don't this is where it gets tricky because there's an element of fraud in it I think they must be terrified and both Twitter and Facebook they must be terrified of their influence of culture the action oh yeah of course there's no way they can't the responsibility must be insane do you know how you know this because a lot of people who were Republicans during the Gulf the Iraq war and now look back on it who were beating the drum beats and I'm not gonna name names you watch interviews and they're like that shit was fucked up and when you look back and you realize you had a part to play in this unnecessary war and if you're someone who cares about human beings as a Christian or whatever that will fuck you up for life because it's like I had a little part in this like when I do my work with North Korea right if I helped ten people that's a huge fucking deal and I don't take that shit lightly I've had and here's the power social media I've had people three or four tell me I'm going through chemo and I read your Twitter and it makes me laugh throughout the day that's fucking huge conversely if you're on the side of Hillary Clinton and you realize that your website might be contributing to hurt demise oh yeah and all ya realize that other countries might be posting fake accounts that are there you know they have these groups these discussion groups and they're based in Russia and they want to talk about black lives matter yeah what they want to talk about abortion or they want to talk about southern separatism or all kinds of you know that IRA research group in Russia and you find out this is all happening on your platform and that your platform yes likely being used yeah to manipulate how the world is run how financial markets are run international politics and you just wanted help college kids get laid yeah yeah right right right right kind of Jack the I what about what about the kids when they were torturing that retarded kid and it was a Chicago and they were streaming in our Facebook that's your site that's gotta fuck with your head it's got it well there's been murdered I've got live streaming New Zealand he was live streaming I mean there's many many cases of horrible things that have been put on their Isis beheadings and you know I mean there's no way they can catch it all there's no way and we when you talk to Twitter or you talk to Facebook or YouTube and you'll they'll tell you the just just I want everyone to just think about the idea that 7 billion people yeah let's be real conservative potentially three billion sure just three billion just three billion people can all send something at once at the speed of light Williams of bits of information headed towards YouTube or Twitter or Facebook I was trying to catch it all some of its Nazis and some of its frogs and Alex Jones bad his name and they just everything's flying it I don't know and then Congress is like mr. Zuckerberg you know what you're doing is like hold on let me drink our water yeah yeah yeah uh mr. senator yes we know what we're doing I think I think mr. no there's no he's doing also he's he's not he's not a monk right he's not some scholar he's not a genius he's not enlightened he's a guy he's not a stupid guy he's a smart guy but he's just a person just a human and has an insane connection and insane he's the CEO of one of the biggest groups on the planet where people exchange conversation which still hasn't verified me an Instagram by the way let it remind not because they're not saying follow up only 7000 instagrams god that's my weakest one bro yeah edge the fuck up haha but but it's also like Lucy Lucille Ball when she's working at Chocolate Factory right she the chocolates are coming out and then they go faster and faster oh yeah yeah you there's a certain point where you you're not going to be able to process this much information and scan it and any filter and any filter by its nature any color will tell you is going to be imperfect and it's gonna weed out people it doesn't want to weed out and and and leave people in that you don't want to leave it like any filters only as good as its creator that's what I wanted people to kind of understand from Jack and he did a pretty good job of explaining that and then saying that it just shows you the problems with trying to monitor these things at scale but the thing I would say to Jack is one workaround if someone is a high enough platform where they're contributing like the laws against obscenity the ruling was if there's some cultural benefit here it's not regardless of scene right that's a blue pool if someone is big enough in terms of their part of the public conversation you should have a manual person double check or triple check before they're blocked you could give them a warning explain why because it's important but here's the question bloggers for what well if there's got to be rules when you are getting blocked if you're threatening violence against someone like you if you're sending like dick pics to a reporter you should be blocked I mean if you're if you have you're putting up people's information right daxing putting people's address right you go to your home right telling people you want to pay someone a hundred dollars take the photo that you've got a photo and video of someone who's not giving me permission you're uploading in and offering this is what that card yes verified out that's crazy so what sometimes does that work you ask him I'm not jack how could that work I don't know jack get it but he very easily that people like that you should tell them you could that will you be banning if you're daxing people yes but someone is doing a parody you could be like take this down for XYZ reasons do the thing is I think they tried to make a differentiation between Daxing someone and threatening to dock someone this is how they kept Kathy Griffin on write remember when she was saying I want names kids yeah who are these kids you know imagine if they did and the kids eventually all their information did get wind up getting online but when you watch the full video and you saw what actually happened like god damn you people have really I think I posted a picture of myself holding up a bloody Clinton Hillary Clinton head that I wouldn't be banned mm-hmm I'm not gonna find out but that's a big deal and I don't even I don't that she was obviously doing as a joke I didn't find an offense if I think would be funny if she was wearing a hijab while she did the photo but the point is she have no consequences on Twitter none um yeah I think you would be banned yeah almost positive you'd be banned it's it for whatever reason it's more disturbing to see a guy hold a woman's head sure that's true um didn't see but even if it was Obama the idea is that like Kathy Griffin probably wouldn't be able to cut Trump's head off like he'd kick her ass he's a big dude if she you know if she came at him with a knife I mean she'd have to shoot him and then cut his head off which I guess she could do no she's got to use the palms all the palm through the nose Thompson no this nose bone in the brain would you do that I'm just trying to like run the numbers in my head there's a 126 million daily users on Twitter how many people should they hire remember when we're asking you I know that's like I'm just remembering I'm like that's going back over my head like how that cue if someone could get through a hundred a day if they could get through a hundred a day spending five minutes sure on each of them that's 500 minutes that's more than theirs that's you can see manually there's no way you can and I think it's smart use the reporting system is smart yes like some you're relying on the users to report things that are at issue right that's smart but it falls victim to trolling because then someone can just decide to attack Jamie Vernon don't do it got trolls are the worst do you have those fuck oh that's you oh my goodness that's the bad kind of trolling that's just being an asshole dude we already did three hours oh how how is that possible I'm just adorable and charm I guess that's something something happened I'll go with that that's good answer is any your book is called the new right we barely talked about it um more stuff people to read yeah a journey to the house the first 12 pages inside joke a journey to the fringe of American politics michael malice and thank you brother thank you that was a pleasure thank you bye everybody
