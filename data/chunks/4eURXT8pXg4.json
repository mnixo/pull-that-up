goes to show you I'm gonna find that we're back up sorry Ustream only tweet everybody we're back up yeah so the you know the the way that the shamans continued explaining 5th dimension is the dream state that's you access that sleeping and you also access that and a general level in psychedelic experiences 6th dimension is the realm is the spirit realm and the kind of the master of that realm is the earth-mother is nature itself so the snakes that came the eels that came that's the fifth dimension the six six that's the sixth and we're like what are we in we're in the third third and fourth you know time yeah conscious time linear time and what's in the fifth is the dream state the dream stick dream state the collective unconsciousness of all humankind is the fifth and that's why when you dream you can access things outside of yourself you know think of things that you wouldn't have thought of because if somebody else had ever thought of it you know you can access that in the fifth dimension the dream state outside of time so then the sixth is you know that's the spirit realm that's where if you're going to communicate with any of these totem animals or guides or anything and they actually say when you smoked DMT you get kind of dropped directly right in the sixth dimension and there's beings in there that you see and it's very common report from people smoking DMT that you see beings and it's because you get Rockets shipped directly into the sixth dimension where you're going to encounter these different beings that exist in that dimension but the overlord of that kind of dimension is is Mother Earth so a lot of the things you see or a kind of animalistic base especially for the people in the jungle maybe there's different paradigms to that but then the seventh dimension beyond that is the realm of energy energetic vibration and large and large entities and that's where they say the ships came from for me was the seventh dimension and the purpose of the ships was to prepare me for travel to the eighth dimension which is the realm of pure potentiality they call it what you can really affect change on all the dimensions before including the third and the fourth of that change in the physical body basically access see things in your life have a completely different perspective outside of time and that's the eighth dimension kind of the final dimension that you can arrive so you know they explain this all after after I'd went through and then said okay this was where you were here this is where you were here and you know what based on my experience of mine I'll sound crazy but it's a paradigm that seems to work for me because I lived it and I was there and I did it and I saw you know I've seen the physical benefits of what happened when I got to the eighth dimension it wasn't like I just got there and no good stuff happened I mean my business the decisions I made I've been huge you know things are going really well my health is great my buddy's good but who knows that wasn't very scientific I'm not gonna put that one up in the win column I'm not can you know I'm not convinced that what we experience in a hallucination in in that form isn't absolutely real but it's just we can't put it in a box yeah you can't you can't weigh it you can't hit it with a hammer yeah make a noise you know yeah but it's the idea that is just your imagination people like poopoo that like it's just your imagination what is your imagination man your imagination is a crazy fucking thing all these neurons and cells are firing and somehow another through these ideas manifest themselves or they can manifest themselves as solid objects like the person who figured out the wheel or the guy who warp makes a fucking computer these are all real things that have somehow another emerged into this dimension from this ether old dimension of thoughts and ideas and done it through a human being and we look at it as like no big deal like ah he's thought of it and then he made it it's just his imagination oh you were in the 8th dimension sure you were that's just your imagination what the fuck is your imagination we are very light with our appreciation of that and very light with our very relaxed with our aw as far as what what the the dimension of the imaginations brings us i mean it's that's a crazy fucking thing the idea that the the world of thoughts and ideas is actually some sort of an intangible experience that's like right there and from that you can pull things out and create them in and put them and then you stack them up on top of each other and you know and then they're physical they become a different thing but it's from the imagination everything it's from the imagination so the idea you saying you know anybody that would you know critique it oh you saw her Lawrence sure you did oh you saw snakes that's just your imagination I don't know what that exactly means you know when when you see something even if it's a hallucination and it's changing your fucking life because it's whatever it's teaching you or whatever it's showing you or whatever leverage that it uses to pry your egos grasp free of your life for whatever amount of time that allows you to sort of reset your rpms and fucking start anew with fresh purpose that's real yeah that's fucking real that UFO you saw was real it was real you know what I'm saying what the fuck is the imagination to someone have to pour alloy into a mould and carve those things on it for it to be real do you have to be able to walk up and hit it and make a climb for it to be real no it's just how it interacts with you electricity any kind of invention was made from your imagination so sure so it's like who cares if they teach you how to make the next fucking computer then don't say your imagination if I teach you something just like these are tools from from you know the Egyptian times they were you know yeah yeah and if you believe in things if you believe in things they have incredible power of you yeah both good and bad you know and who's to say that's not real you know there's like the idea of the placebo effect like I give you a sugar pill and also and you feel better because you thought I gave you medicine well still you feel better you know people have actually been cured of ailments because of the perceive effect so what the fuck is happening well people people have this misconception that it works only one way that you know that the body can affect the mind but the mind can't affect the body oh no you can't go backwards on that road but it's bullshit I mean your mind can make changes in your body how do you think these you know these people are able to do things like slow their heart rate or walk on coals and not get burned I mean it's they're able to focus some kind of something walking on coals lose the trick maybe it is I don't think I've never walked on coals but whatever you just gotta keep moving well but they can do things with pain - yeah I mean you sure these people go to trance and really kind of stop the pain from from affecting human and certain people whose beliefs have certainly healed things that the doctors thought were impossible but the idea that the mind can't affect the body I think is one of the biggest problems and misconceptions in Western medicine it certainly can we all know people who are super super negative one of getting really sick so I mean that's that's real there's I've had moments in my life or my my I was too stressed out and I wasn't balanced those are almost always the moments where you wind up getting sick and there's a direct correlation between that you know there's a direct correlation between positive energy and positive results in the physical form you know they're all connected one of the DMT trips that I had never forget this because it was a real life-changing experience you know the DMT trip is like being shot through a cannon to the center of the universe and all of a sudden you have all the information around you all the time but it's like they're slippery dolphins he can't grab them it's like all the information is there but it's like you can't harness it you don't you can't figure it out and it's very very overwhelming and it can be terrifying and in one trip that I had I got real scared in the middle of it and I started thinking all this negative shit it just got away from me and as I was thinking all this negative shit the DMT trip became black and green and dark and it became like jagged and then it just like it just looked harsh and it looked like it started to be almost like kin tourists Hitler think it was growing and it was it was moving in an asymmetrical way it was just fucked up it was and then I realized okay this is you're thinking negative stop thinking negative think positive relax let go and as I'm saying all these things the colors are slowly changing and then when I completely relaxed it went boom and it blossomed into these beautiful geometric patterns it's like once I started thinking positive and going okay this is your silly you can control your mind think Pollak love love boom boom it like showed me in a physical form like something that I could actually look at and watch I could see negative energy and positive energy and that the lesson was that these can be controlled to a certain extent they can be managed and they can certainly be managed by your intent in your attitude and your ideas yeah no doubt about it I mean that's a it's a powerful lesson to learn you know as to be able to manage that not only when you're on I mean it's psychedelic that's like that's like when you're in the that's the real game time you know that's the playoffs that's when you need to bring all your training and practice to bear because it's everything is magnified you're under the microcosm you know in a real intense moment you don't know yourself yeah until you have a psychedelic experience you might think you know yourself but I guarantee you you're gonna find out who you really fucking are when you go deep when you go deep and you come back and you have to kind of assess everything and you look at yourself through fresh eyes the ego while you're sleeping while you're working when it's gaining ground it's like the fucking Fed it's stealing money and if pocketing things and taking control over certain areas it really is like the government and then you don't realize how fucking embedded it's becoming your system until you have a blowout you tell have a psychedelic boom blowout experience and that ego get just shucked aside like you know like a fucking explosion in a comic book movie and the egos sitting in a tree with half its clothes off hanging from branches because it just got blown out and then then you get to see yourself again then you get to see who you really are yeah but the time off of that man you got to be real careful cuz that ego he fucking gets out of that tree fucking brushes himself off and clings ahold to you and starts running shit again listen it'd be a lot easier to just let me handle this I got this I got this dude you're the shit okay you're gonna do this cuz you're the fucking man trust me have a seat I'm gonna drive and then the next thing you know the fucking knee goes in control again your life is fucking confusing I think that's why it happens even to the shamans you know the Masters this is not something that they're you know void of you know because they get a lot of power in their little communities and things and so the medicine has to bring them back well you're you're spiritual person but you're also I mean the idea of spiritual so the word is a weird tainted word unfortunately the word spiritual so tainted you know automatically hippie nonsense comes into play when you start using that but the bottom line is your thoughts and ideas but you are also a physical biological being a vehicle and just like your fucking car we have to change the oil and you have to make sure that spark plugs are in and set incorrectly and make sure that the computers tuned up but you have to do that with your body as well your body is a vehicle and if you ignore it much like your fucking car starts spewing out black smoke and and shits out and dies on the road your body does the same goddamn thing as your car can do if you don't maintain it correctly it will fuck with you it will fuck with you and you know and the ego is a part of the physical body you know it doesn't seem like it is because again you can't fucking measure it you can't beat on it with a hammer but it is a part of who every fucking living organism that wants to stay alive that has a conscious consciousness and has the the ability to recognize that it's here that has self-awareness the ego comes into play because that's how you stay alive that's how you succeed that's how you get girls that's how you fucking get money you get money you work for the ego the ego is it's a part of the machine but it can get away from you you know what you're saying there it touches on the very core of my entire philosophy in life which is balance you know and that's what the warrior poet is it's the you know it's the samurai that appreciates the cherry blossom tree you know it's the it's gladiator when he's you know walking through the fields of wheat and in you know appreciating that it's the ability to maintain that kind of balance of both the physical side and the spiritual side and and really that's I think the message if I had one message to bring it's like you got to have both you can't just be the spiritual being only and go on these trips and stuff you got to hone your body you got to keep it healthy you got to be able to operate in this world because in this in this dimension you're in you know people aren't gonna you know lay down for you just because you have a higher spiritual truth like you have to bring both aspects to bear and I think that's what we were supposed to do and I think everybody almost everybody is to whack on either side you know there's the big muscle heads that are like oh yeah fuck that hippy bullshit crystals eighth dimension that fucking faggot and then there's this you know the other side of things that's like deep no sense of humor yeah like almost like a Democrat you Mike protect your shit you know like both sides are applicable and I think that's where people are flawed and they're so vigilant about protecting their little niche like my shit is right I'll pound you if you if you're wrong and if you believe something else the other people like you're just an ignorant ape you know on the other side of things and no one wants to kind of bridge that gap but our birthright is to have all of it and that's what we should strive for is complete balance in both of those aspects and I think I'm hoping that's why you know some people will listen to kind of what I'm saying is because I tried it I try to be able to do that like I want to kick ass in business and still talk to people about yeah dude like I went to another dimension and it was fucking crazy but I'm over here I'm gonna be killing it you know in your world too so don't think I'm slipping you know alone that's what I'm trying to do that's my goal a lot of people want to push aside or deny the importance of the physical world the the whether it's capitalistic gains or whether it's keeping your body fit and sexually attractive they want to deny the significance and importance of these things and the you know the meaning of these things almost as like a form of socialism because they don't want to compete and they don't want to have to be sexually attractive and so women will say oh is that what you care about oh you're shallow you care about what someone looks like you know I'm a human being I'm a human being and if you're fat that's gross okay that's just the way it is and you can pretend all you want and you know maybe you'll take fat with the greatest personality over skinny that's a cunt yeah maybe you make some compromises and you know no one's perfect physically but let's be honest about what we're looking at and what you like and why you like it and that goes with capitalism as well that goes with being a successful person you know there's a lot of people that think that some there's something shallow about being monetarily successful and I think that's a form of socialistic thinking as well as like yeah you want this to be a level playing field because you can't compete and that's really what it is you know and you got to find your fucking place in the Sun jackass and you know some people I will never be playing professional basketball I'm five foot eight and I don't run that good and it's just fucking just the way of the world man it ain't a fair world okay you got your own hand this is your journey you deal with the hand that you're given and and and just find your fucking place but don't try to hold other people back don't try to say there's something wrong with that girl being sexy as fuck don't think there's something wrong but because that guy's got a six-pack that makes girls wet you know when they see him you can't hate cuz you're fat you can't hate y'all would easily shallow just going to gym all day I'm sure he's really interesting to talk to maybe he is maybe he's more interesting than you stupid cuz guess what it only takes like an hour a day to work out you tell me that all those other hours of the day he has to be doing meaningless meathead shit to make your paradigm work no you're just you're just you'd want to pull the playing field down you're not trying to level things out you know I'm trying to rise you're trying to everybody's above you your crabs in a bucket man your social crabs in a bucket yeah lot of bitches out there folks and most of them are men how about that remember that when you hear just whiny kunti negative stupid shit from dudes you bitch saddle the fuck up yeah it's uh you know I think back a long time ago and I think we've touched on this maybe in the last podcast but you know you had to go to war and in some countries you still do and I think that's why that Israeli dude was so cool like everybody in Israel goes to war and he was like listen the kids are a little unruly or whatever but when you you know but the parents don't care cuz they know you know what 19 you're going to war like Israeli army is active it's very active doesn't rest you know so that's one kind of last people that's holding but still they're fighting with lasers and a lot of things I mean not this guy he was running a tank fighting this shit that we give them yeah that's a trippy situation no they're about the size of Rhode Island and they're surrounded by no hate them so countries all over the place that hate them and some of them have nuclear weapons yeah but the fact that each one has to be a warrior at some point you know I think it it impacts there's a more character yeah impact and that's the way it used to be back in the Roman days you know I mean every philosopher like I said Socrates was a badass you know every philosopher had to be they ran campaigns with swords and stabbed barbarians in the throat and then talk philosophy over some wine later and that's that aspect is largely ignored I think and one of the one of the large sicknesses I think of our world is they are like you said we definitely talked about this before the coming of age ceremony that this the ritualistic aspect of you know making a big deal of coming-of-age because I think that's something that's missing from this world because I think that kids today like they don't know when they're a man you know one of your man you manually 2223 yeah man we dad still calls you a fuckhead you need to borrow money he's still a man you know when do you become a man officially you know and in a lot of you know cultures there's a ceremony and you know like those the guys in the Amazon that do that bullet ant glove yeah we saw that tree by the way shake out of here it's an ant that bites you it stings you and it feels like your arm is being slammed in a car door for 24 hours apparently is blinding unbearable pain and for the coming of age ceremony these crazy motherfuckers take these ants and they these oven mitts and they they make them themselves and as they're all porous and they've stuffed the ants in there so the ants can't go anywhere and you have to shove your hands into these gloves filled with bullet ants and motherfucker that looks scary the tears that were just streaming down these men's faces as they were going through the ceremony well you get through that man you have the right to say you're a man now yeah you know I'm saying like you feel like this is a very clear boundary I've broken through no I wouldn't suggest bullet ants yeah what happened to re you know in the realm of politics you know like I feel like politicians should have to fucking earn their place like whether it's bullet ants or like a five-step psychedelic you know trip where it's like all right you want to you want to lead us here's what you got to do first you're gonna go take a bow go 24 hours gonna cure you of your addictions of fucking blowing coke off gay and turn cock whatever you're into it'll you know at least the coke part maybe not the game turn I don't think it'll cure that but uh you know whatever it's gonna whatever your you know addictions are cigarettes heroin coke whatever a BOGO blast that out of you 24 hours all right so you go from there and then I think they should have to do it fast for a week where they get smoked out every day and have to control their hunger and not eat and think and then after that like maybe go and do the ayahuasca you know and then from there bring a bipartisan group to a campfire where they all do mushrooms and just talk about ideas and shit and then hit fuckin session I'll drop a cap of pure pharmaceutical grade MDMA yeah that's it boom now you just make the people party but listen good drugs imagine how different yes it would be if there had to do some kind of imagine how different they would be if they had to go through boot camp just that anything go through some something that shows your character other than the photographs of your cock that you send to your entire you know busting another guy they busted another fuckin politician to send in pictures of his cock today some fuckin new guys resigning I don't even know who he was just some dumbass who thinks it's okay to send pictures of his dick through his fucking cellphone what what some chick who turns out to be working for the enemy yeah yeah yeah he was set up he's a fucking fool he looked like a fat 50 year old probably couldn't blue he's gonna get some pussy so I see a cock okay here's my cock shit and next he know these pictures around the net and he looks like a fucking idiot and now he's got to resign and god damn and these are the plans they have their job because they pretended there's someone else because they pretend to be family men with great Christian values and loyal to their wife and their vows but meanwhile they're sending cock pictures all over the fucking internet and so you know that this is a person who's full of shit and this is a person who can't be trusted his character can't be trusted because he's pretending to be something he's not it's not like Tommy Lee sending pictures of his dick and you're like Oh Tommy you know it's fucking Tommy Lee he's crazy he's married to Pamela Anderson we've all seen his dick you know I'm saying yeah it's like if Tommy Lee was sending pictures of his dick to girls you'd be like well my dick look like that I pictures of it dude why not you know it's not like that when someone pretends to be something they're not and we know they're not we know that they're there's no way most politicians can really be the way they are you know around John Edwards used to pretend he was until we found out he was banging some other chick while his wife was dying to cancer and apparently fucking physically threatened her and you know yeah he's a fucking we used campaign funds to hide the fact that he was banging this broad so now he's probably gonna go to jail there's fucking going after John Edwards but at one point in time John Edwards was this lawyer with good old-fashioned American values and pull them up by your bootstraps you know work ethic and you know you come to find out that it is impossible to be a pure person to be the guy that you're pretending to be to be a politician they they push it back so far that eventually it pops out somewhere it blows out they're dressing up like a tiger and taking pictures or they're Al Gore fucking tries to get his dick sucked while he's getting a massage and the chick wants a sex you know charge him with sexual assault you know there's some truth there's something something happened there you know something happened there I don't know what it was she might have overblown it he might have you know just rubbed his cock on her just as like a little tester who knows what the fuck happened but whatever happened it's not what we thought Al Gore was we didn't think Al Gore was whipping his dick out in fucking hotels was getting massaged we didn't think that was he was pulling girls on top of him we didn't think that was Al Gore I don't know if he did that but he did enough or got into a situation it was enough for him to get in trouble yeah you know I mean no one talks about what Winston Churchill did with his women you know like that that was like it didn't fucking matter fighting the Nazis he was kicking ass and I think all our politicians now they're so fraudulent and what they're kind of projecting that it does matter at this point it's like your hypocritical lying little bastard you know but if they were real like really doing shit and very honest with what they were attacking and the issues they were attacking were honest and they were coming from a real place it's like oh yeah our fucking fearless leader after a big you know a tough night he had some you know sexual indiscretion whatever you forgive that stuff but when they build this foundation full of you know puritanical nonsense then they do that they feel like that's only to get elected though you know there's so much power in bullshit today with the idea of the Christian ideology and you know the Christian Right and the fucking you know so uber judgmental and that that there's a that's a big political push because those people were organized those those the really right-wing Christian fundamentalist that that movement that's a very organized movement and if they're on your side you can do a lot of damage and if they're against you it can really hurt you know if they organize the churches and they all sudden pull out and they say well this fucking Al Gore doesn't believe in Jesus or fuck him you know they'll go crazy you have to fake that you believe in Jesus whether you do nah you better say you do because you're if you say you don't you're gonna piss off 50 fuckin percent of the country and you're never gonna get anything done yeah yeah it's it's a fuck situation and I think that's why you know there's the shamans down there when they talk about 2012 they talk about it just as a tipping point but that it's like that's they talked about it would they say yeah well they said that 2012 is the tipping point that's when the world has to start changing and it will upheavals will happen they don't know if it's gonna be economic they don't know if it's gonna be you know physical it's not the end of time or anything like that and that was it was kind of cool to hear them talk about it like that's all nonsense that's all hype what it is it's it's the point at which things must start changing for us why is there a date why is it dude I think December 21st 2012 was the 2012 correlates to a astrological astronomical kind of event right isn't there some kind of obviously I'm not an astronomer but I've heard Neil Tyson talk about how that's bullshit and that that event happens all the time that everyone's talking about how it aligns at the center of the galaxy and it's like it always does it happens all the time yeah well I don't know I don't exactly know how they got the date I mean whether I think it was tied to some kind of just so much going on in this in the idea of astrology and astronomy there's so much going on where you know they can figure out that the moon is off a little bit with its gravity and then they have to figure out what is responsible for this error and the moon's gravity well it could be a brown dwarf star that lays you know 100 million miles outside of Pluto and that's like the current theory is in it but they can figure that out they can figure out they could measure gravity and know that there's errors in places and try to like figure out well why where is this error coming from so we know that that for sure that the moon's effect and its particular gravity has an effect on tides we believe it has an effect on human behavior although that's all subjective but we we know that these little bodies or these these motions and these these things that we can't quite grab a hold of have a very physical effect on the earth like an ax tide who knows how many different things are doing that all the with the precession of the equinoxes the fact that the earth wobbles on except it's access 26,000 years cycle and in between that times you know you never know what is aligned with what when you were brought into this world and that the idea behind astrology is fucking flaky and new-agey and bullshitty as it sounds is that these events these alignments of stars and positions of the moon and all these different things they actually affect how a human being is charged as they're set loose from the vagina into the world you know that it that it actually has on any look a fucking I know a lot of Leo's that seem like Leo's you know I know a lot of cancers that act like cancers me it sounds like other horseshit but god damn it's fucking close it seems it seems damn close yeah so yeah I mean I don't know exactly what the what the event is that they name the date for they didn't go into that but what they said is that a new type of person has to emerge at that point and then the old ways have to change and they will and that things will get fucked up enough where they have to it's like it's not like we all got a rally and you know but we didn't mean we do to a certain degree we have to prepare for it but it'll it'll force itself to happen so we just need to be ready for it as what they're saying like the new era is gonna come and it's gonna happen either complete economic upheaval physical upheaval of the earth whatever is gonna happen is going to force our hand and then the new people are gonna have to emerge they call it the legend of Quetzalcoatl the pheasant the feathered serpent but really that represents the new type of human that comes and starts taking a leadership role so all of these talk picturing politicians and everything whatever they believe is gonna happen is gonna change that paradigm where all of a sudden that becomes de-emphasized either faith in them gets lost a new system asked to emerge new leaders new you know political structures this is the shamans have actually explaining this to you yeah do they talk about the internet you can tell you can tell the mountain the mountain shamans were dim it different than a jungle shamans but you can tell a good mountain shaman by how much he smells like burnt llama shit because that's how they stay warm up in the high part so they'd be really shitty really look really smells like burnt llama shit you know he's probably up then it cuz then he's up but about 15,000 feet for most of it love Jesus Christ but no cell phone no internet and he's missed there's not the cool YouTube video they're starting some one of them one of the guys I had I was talking with had a full URL at the bottom of its little cone I'm starting to adapt to it nice they need that this you know people poopoo the cultural experience you know because it's filled with morons and Lady Gaga fans but there's nothing wrong with Lady Gaga okay that's the part of the trip and I think she's fascinating I like some of her music how about that and there's nothing wrong with the rest of the cultural experiments even the most ridiculous aspects of it it's all part of us you know and you don't want to be locked out I don't buy that being locked out when I talk to someone to go I don't have an email well you're a fucking moron how about that you don't want an email you don't want people to be able to send you cool shit that you can read you don't want photos that'll blow your mind you know want someone turning you on to some fucking article that might change your life you don't want that you don't want that okay you're too cool for that what are you gonna do sniff flowers you fucking weirdo and for them it's like I mean really do they want to just affect only the few people in the village if you're a real strong man yeah fuck yeah I want to get my word out there I want to make change I want to make things happen and I think it goes back to kind of what Pressfield says about professionals like the professionals the shamans down there were professionals they're not trying to be shamans they just fucking are that's their job that's what they do and they're professionals at it so yeah the internet comes along they analyze that tool they're like oh yeah that's cool you know if something funny happens in the middle of their ceremony they're not like I better not laugh or people might think that I'm not a shaman you know they're like they'll fucking crack up and be like and then they'll just get back to their work when they're done they don't take themselves so seriously that it's like anything could shake the experience it's not for other people they're gonna do their work and whatever happens when they do their work that's fine they go with it and that was something I really appreciated because even when you get out here in this kind of slightly pseudo spiritual thing it's like they're putting on an act you know like the music has to be perfect and right yeah the candles have to go over the right and the crystal has to be without impurities you know and they're like okay you know if they use rocks they're like this is a good rock you know and it just looks like yeah the fucking rocks you're in should bullshit spiritual talk is the grossest shit ah yeah I got married by a hack we got some lady off the internet that married us and I was brutal your love is two streams that will be come together a growing river it will wash over the rocks of the world like oh you crazy bitch there was no feeling to it at all like as she was saying it there was no connection to the words it was just utter spiritual nonsense because it was a non-denominational wedding obviously because I'm not religious nor as mrs. Rogan yeah so I had a listen to this nonsense crystal sucking fucking shit had you ideas marry a world of gnarnia yeah this bitch lived it totally in Narnia she had a hut in Narnia it was brutal this I found the article about the Colombian shaman he was arrested in Texas and charged with ayahuasca possession he flew into the Houston Airport and the crazy thing about being charged with ayahuasca possession is the plants that you use to create ayahuasca and not even illegal that's the weirdest aspect of it you know they I met the guy from bouncing bear botanicals he came to Vegas yeah if you don't know the story there was a guy who ran a website called bouncing bear botanicals and it's a website all dedicated to selling legal plants that have psychedelic properties to them like the San Pedro cactus that you could buy at fucking Home Depot yeah well you can make mescaline out of that shit you can you can open that bitch up make some peyote if you know what you're doing and trip your balls off this is off some shit you just buy at Home Depot and it's totally legal it's a beautiful cactus and a lot of people don't even know about the psychedelic properties of it they have it just to decorate their garden because it's pretty but it's not illegal so they they he has this there he's selling this he's selling the different socotra at veritas and the different plants that you mix to make ayahuasca selling those salvia saying all these different plants that are absolutely legal Morning Glory seeds you know a lot of people don't know that Morning Glory seeds just those regular fucking seeds that you buy when you go to plant to make flowers well the ones that you buy most of them they've been treated so that they are not psychoactive because regular Morning Glory seeds you can grind those bitches up and eat them and you'll trip your fucking balls off hell yeah so untreated they're still your they're legal though you can buy the untreated ones it's hard to get it's hard to get the untreated ones you're supposed to treat them because the government is aware of the psychedelic properties of them meanwhile you know of course it's not nearly as dangerous as cigarettes or alcohol or anything as a sanction but it's too mind-bending for the government allowed the unwashed masses to participate in so you're wise daddy government has figured out how to neuter this incredibly brilliant psychedelic plant to the point where most people aren't even aware of its properties but regular morning glory seeds was terence mckenna's first psychedelic trip that's what sent him on his fucking wacky journey of you know being the psychedelic shaman of the the new world and that was you know a common thing that people did in the 70s in the 60s before the government got hip to it they were just tripping balls on Morning Glory seeds you know so this guy this John Orr he sees as anything from bouncing bear botanicals anyway there's two dudes that I met that came they were high as fuck there was so hot I barely talked to them after the show they came to my last vegas show and I talked to them outside and that swarm of people remember results two of those are those crazy guys they were trying to have like a serious conversation with me was like 500 people trying to take pictures and they want to hold on my hand and talk to me like there's a lot of people here I can't talk to you about your arrest that you're doing the right thing glad you got out but apparently they let him out of jail they had to let him out eventually because there's you know nothing you can fuckin charge him for there's nothing that said he was making drug trash this place crashes I don't know if you got his money back they froze all that as well for nothing for nothing because the government is scared of psychedelics it's amazing how scared they are of it and I guarantee you they're scared of it because they're not experiencing it it's that simple like when you get in knowing that Alex Jones believes crazy shit like he believes in the elites are all smoking DMT like they're all you know who talk to you about their own fuck they were Guantanamo Bay they're all down in Guantanamo Bay and they're smoking DMT connecting to the spirit world they believe in eternal life what they're gonna do and he'll tell you all this nonsense that he absolutely positively believes in but I believe 100% you cannot smoke DMT and not be empathetic towards other people that are doing it you cannot take ayahuasca or mushrooms without being empathetic and wanting other people to do it these people that are trying to keep everybody from it those are the people sending their dicks to their fuckin secretaries and their emails those are the fucking hypocrite hypocritical shitheads with huge flaws in their character that we have running this country and running this world and unfortunately that's that's one of our biggest issues are we considered leaders we know for sure that it's a bullshit scam and we allow it we have we have resigned ourselves we know that the president has speechwriters we know that everyone has a bunch of people that will review every word that he's gonna say and it's gonna be calculated and they're gonna sit down and come up with the the right words and enact the most emotional impact to the point where they even fucking they used to plagiarize other people's speeches before they got busted for it Joe Biden their own fucking vice president used to plagiarize he plagiarized Kennedy shit well they caught him doing that in 1988 that's why you had to quit running for president you know and that's why he had to like sit in the background and wait for everybody to kind of forget about it before he could be vice president you know we know for a fact that it's it's a it's a bullshit hustle we're all aware of lobbyists we're all aware of special interest groups and corporations donating millions of dollars we're all aware that the Supreme Court changed the ruling so that a corporation can now act as an individual so they can donate as much fuckin money as they want which is absurd the idea that a corporation that would rely on politicians in their their decisions to make money in a way that may or may not be ethical but they'll rely on and then they just donated X amount of fucking millions of dollars towards this person it's insane it's amazing and we accept it for now because things are relatively placid you know yeah we have some little few financial difficulties but whatever people's lives they go on and we go and you know what they're saying about 2012 is alright at certain point things aren't gonna be fuckin Placid anymore and at that point we're not gonna accept that bullshit we're not gonna expect accept these weak-ass politicians who don't really stand for anything to lead us any more so what's gonna happen who the fuck knows they don't know they don't have the answer but they're gonna say some type of new person is gonna have to emerge and be like yo this is bullshit like we need to make some changes now like things are getting fucked up even worse and worse have you seen the the the numbers that they did when they were they did an audit of the the Fed to find out where the fucking money went for the bailout they found trillions of dollars that went is weird fucking overseas banks and it's totally beyond description how much corruption and ridiculous bullshit is involved and how little accountability there is for the distribution of the taxpayers wealth I mean it's a fucking free-for-all man it's craziness so it's just say there's a few financial difficulties the whole thing is built on this foundation of unfixable bullshit and there's no solution in sight yeah that's worse I mean it is getting more credit rating about to be downgraded and China already did they downgraded our credit rating even though we didn't default even though we raised our debt ceiling they're like these bitches like on the edge you know it's like when you try to get too many loans even as you pay your loans back the the banks are going what are you asking for all this money dude what do you know what's going on with you but you got a gambling problem but yeah it's it's it's not it's not fucking getting fixed and the system in this the way it's set up right now and the model that we're operating under it's not getting fixed and everyone's frustrated no one knows what to do and me like you like I'm fucking completely foolish yet all I do is just complain about it and then I go about my day and as long as I have food in the refrigerator and I have the use my credit card to buy gas I'm only gonna Yap too much you know it almost like it has to fall apart on all of us before we step back and we go alright alright well now we have to admit that this doesn't work right well what you do but you're doing something more important than that I think as well is that you're creating a movement of consciousness I mean every time new people turn it tune in you know you have their ear and these people yeah but I don't know there's no crisis yet necessarily right now so sir what is though no kind of probably if we had the foresight to really look ahead and start doing things now but it's not prescient enough like it's not beating down our door so it's just really not gonna happen realistically probably not that we shouldn't try and do it or whatever I'm not saying that but so much work though at some point when things get fucked you know you may have this is a Joe Rogan fucking emergency podcast listen like this is what needs to happen like seriously and you'll have you'll have that power like fucking John Connor for your own small people of conscious fucking humans who are gonna be able to then go out and like alright everything we're being fed is nonsense don't you think if the shit goes down the Internet's gonna be the first thing they shut off they tried to do that in other countries we have they've done it but yeah they were did in Libya they do it in Egypt yeah Egypt but there was still ways around it people were still getting mad I don't think he's gonna intentionally fuck us I think they're gonna be incapable of helping us at that point you know my personal shop the internet yeah it's just gonna be like ah what do we do we're a bunch you know we've never fucking stuck our hand in a glove full of ants we're not ready for this no it could be either/or though right guv it could double either/or I mean there's a reason why they do these fucking FEMA tests and they have you know Giants stockpiles of plastic coffins you know that's all been documented they've prepared they have a lot of drills they've prepared for mass extinction events and you know big huge environmental catastrophes natural disasters I mean the government has camps they have FEMA camps these are real you know this is Alex Jones you know and he'll he'll start talking about FEMA camps but this is there's a real they really do have places where they have cots up and they have they have fucking almost like a prisoner of war camp because if the shit really does hit the fan you know we get wiped out in nuclear war you know or a fucking asteroid hits or something nutty that fuck's up the world we really are gonna have to detain a lot of people we're really gonna have to calm everybody the fuck down if we're gonna evacuate areas we're gonna have to have put these places to shelter these people we're gonna have to have buses where women and children are crying and they're being separated from the father and the father sitting there with a son and we'll meet you at the camp and then that's real shit they're gonna get on buses and we're not gonna know where everybody is and when I some people are not gonna be that's possible this is a fucking fragile world we live in yeah it's possible you know I little and then little colonies will get set up individuals will have different you know who knows how that but the structure could break and at that point some new system can emerge it's almost like that's when we have to bring in the Colombians bring in that fucking ayahuasca donkeys bring in big clay pots riding on the back of donkeys yet I'm gonna start singing the whole way you got it yeah I can get in there I can get down I can get down with the ayahuasca arrows so what do they say about smoking DMT would they say well they said that that's just kind of a it's kind of a rocket ship that plants you right in that that right in that cement but only the city dimension never the seven days they say mostly mostly not because it's too short of an experience you can't really you have to kind of gather steam through the through the dimensions there's something that unless and and I the smoking the DMT kind of skips over v where you usually kind of start getting in these dreams it's like wham-bam into the sixth and that's why they say that there's some disorientation there a lot of lessons to be learned in wisdom any time you sneak outside of time which is how they describe it is sneaking outside of time you have lessons to learn but they're you know once you're there you have a short window of time and you're trying to absorb as much as possible but the forces aren't there to align you to help you know kind of push you farther because that's that's a process you have to gain knowledge like what happened to me I had to download something or whatever they said in the seventh to get you know to get that farther like just have more steam and energy to get there and they talk about it as fuel you know the problem with the smoking DMT is the fuel runs out they have enough fuel to like get you into orbit you know but it's not that extra afterburner that's gonna come in and shoot you to Mars after you're outside of the atmosphere you know eventually it's just gonna suck you right back in and so that's what they say that the difference is but we know the interesting because the intravenous doses of DMT that like Strassman did in those studies those people had 30-minute trips that's one of that's enough I wonder if that's a different takes you to a dead place supposed to be a more intense experience when it's experienced when it's done intravenously it's supposed to be more more in-depth and a lot more entities yeah a lot more people being you know more of what they would describe that sounds remarkably similar to UFO abduction experience right you know that kind of thing that you're dealing with these physical things in this other place yeah it's a real fuckin symptom of our culture that that shit's all illegal that people can like you can come back and you get so fucked up that you have to change your name and it's illegal it's illegal you know that's it's a it's really annoying it's really annoying that we're in this fucking nanny state this shitbag stupid nanny state country yeah do you find you any side effects at all like is does your mind wander in places over and over again do you have any differently what what was it was some of the challenges were just reintegrating you know and a lot of that's just you get to this different world and experience different things but do you leave your life on the treadmill running full-speed you know and I tried to hop right back the fuck on and I got you know tripped up and slammed against the back wall you know to use that analogy like it's hard to get back you know and hard to find kind of the balance of integrating what what you found out there or not but do you feel like the world doesn't seem the same when you when you came back do you feel anything's changed in the world no you know I I feel like you know I've I've changed the way I look at things has changed you know the fact that I can I view myself now more like a needle piercing a nine layered onion you know and I'm you're consciously aware of the first four four layers you know that part of needle but you're still connected to another five layers above you and you just you just don't see it you know just that very thought alone has changed has changed my life you know it's hard to incorporate in every day and everyday things I mean I've been focused pretty much solely on launching alpha brain and making sure that all goes well and it's been very you know very focused on that but in my quiet moments we know when I can meditate I can think back and and think you know what I want to do next time I go down there and what lessons I could learn and how I don't need an isolation tank son that's your next step we saw some of these alpha brains you have to get you one so this is this is the shit that we've been talking about on Twitter and we talked about it on the podcast before and this is a formula that chris has put together and that we're selling and it's called alpha brain and it fucking does something man it first of all it gives you incredibly vivid dreams and it seems to fire up your brain at a higher rpm level or give you some clarity I feel like it helps me form sentences better you know you know I'm saying I mean I don't know if that's what's doing it but I feel like man I'm fucking talking pretty smooth sometimes when I'm on this stuff technically what they say is that it enhances synaptic plasticity which is the way that your neurons can kind of fit together and transfer information does this all peer-reviewed stuff or is my ritual no yeah this is purely on the scientific tip here from what's it what's in here so what it is it's GPC calling which is a great form of rock calling the best form of Rock Calling really glycerophospholipid brain barrier whereas some of the other Coleen's are not so it's most expensive and best calling for you and then we have hooper xia sirata which has a proven compound called huperzine a which is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor and that prevents the breakdown of the acetylcholine in your brain and what acetylcholine is in charge of is in charge of you know focus memory memory clarity all the Alzheimer's treatments currently almost all of them focus on rehabilitating your acetylcholine levels and boosting your acetylcholine though so even huperzine a which is part of the Sarada has been tested in that capacity so this is all very you know very scientifically proven this is not anything hokey-pokey is just a fact hire a suit Seto : levels lead to this now the problem with higher acetylcholine levels otherwise everybody would just be jacked jacking their acetylcholine up is it can lead to you know anxiety anxiousness short temper if that's too out of balance you can get other you can get kind of hyper aware and so what I did with this formula is I said alright we want to have strong acetylcholine it's good helps your memory helps your mental drives help you focus but we don't want to have all the other things so I created a balanced formula and I included things like gaba which controls kind of relaxation and kind of calm and mental clarity in that kind of calm state and then dopamine which handles a lot of your movement activities and some of your mental energy activities you added dopamine well it's meu Kuna Puri ins contains a standardized dose of 50% l-dopa and you kina purans is a herb I think believe it grows in India and so the 50% standardized l-dopa is the building block for dopamine so yeah I didn't add dopamine I actually you're able to add gaba directly because they're able to extract it from a plan but the dopamine you have to get through you know pushing l-dopa in your body your body will destroy dopamine if you try to put it in directly so you build it yourself with l-dopa the catalyst and that is again the pyridoxine HCL vitamin b6 which we have in there which helps convert it so and then then I just put a ton of antioxidants that are gonna give you energy help your focus the AC 11 in there that was shown to actually repair DNA and scientific peer-reviewed studies so really fucking strong antioxidants gonna kind of eliminate some of that mental fog clear out some of your free radicals and then allow the acetylcholine boost to be manageable by the other by the other components now have you ever thought about adding 5htp to it now that's another formula that I have and serotonin is a crucial component 5htp is the direct building block of serotonin it goes l-tryptophan to 5-htp 5-ht HCP then converts to 5-ht which is serotonin that's the fourth component I have another separate formula the rollover formula which is specifically focused on building serotonin so being the fact that I have that there there's just not that much room in the capsules and it is important to have but I recommend that you know that doesn't tend that doesn't need to be so much in balance for this formula to work but it is a crucial part of things so I recommend either taking my formula or another form of 5-htp but it was just a little bit much to fit and efficacious dose of 5-htp in this alpha brain to bring that fourth component I mean that's too bad because I know a lot of people at about a lot of positive effects with that I have HTP is great that's why I have the whole product you know roll it roll it roll over yeah my product roll over is dedicated specifically to that so yeah but you're selling those a much smaller package you're selling like four of those you get bottles a 30-year bottle thirty just like this yeah and so do you recommend people taking that if they're not coming off of a you know the roll-on roll-off is supposed to be like you do MDMA and then your anytime if you're not sleeping if you're stressed and you're not sleeping that's when serotonin is produced is when you're sleeping so if you're not sleeping doesn't matter if you're partying if you're doing doing whatever you're doing you're not going to be producing enough serotonin so that's when you need to take it so yeah I certainly recommend taking it as part of the regimen I mean that formula will probably change a little bit in the next iteration I have some ideas for it but I'm going to always have a serotonin specific formula you know if enough people want to have this alpha brain be that complete brain thing we can look at it but just as far as dose and capsule size it's difficult to do everything I mean I have a capsule that's specifically designed for serotonin the whole capsule capsule be way too much it's tough it's tough so you so that one was something that I do recommend I do sell on on it calm but it's not in the Alpha brain but I highly recommend it's a great it's a great thing to have I use it all the time I love it I don't take it every day but I definitely take it on like days I'm sure feel jacked up in it I think I I've been taking for like I don't know like six eight months here and there and I it's one of my favorite things that I've got the roll on and roll overs or not yeah those so those formulas though will change a little bit but I'm still gonna always keep that kind of concept and you know the alpha brain is getting great feedback I know you know all of us here we all take it and we dig it so there's something going on with it yeah most certainly does have an effect like I said it gives me the most incredible dreams and so the reason why that's happening is the seed of choline regulates REM sleep that's what determines you know you get a wash of acetylcholine during your REM sleep so the fact that you have excess surpluses of acetylcholine created by the GPC choline in the Perseus errata allows a deeper and broader wash of acetylcholine to go through your sleep cycles and so your REM sleep becomes way more intense longer and more vivid than when you do have low levels of acetylcholine all right so if you guys want to grab this it's available now and on it calm onn IT calm and it's called alpha brain and tell me how you like it I know some people who've already started taking it and I haven't yet to talk to one person that hasn't had positive experiences with it and it's no what is it thirty bucks for thirty of these things and people say it's it's expensive but like this the stuff's not cheap stuff it's it's what's needed to actually have an effect I went to Benson I got the best I got the best ingredients I could you know I cut no corners everything's full spectrum standardized so this is the best product I can make and you know I hope people dig it because I'm fucking I played my cards as well as I can and try to make the best and in every aspect of doing it thanks for coming on and talking about your psychedelic experience it made you change your name I mean we thinking get you drunk on Jack Daniels and you go to being duke turn you into some sort of fuck yeah after listening to that story though I would definitely change my name to it and you could actually got to sit in that that thing we talked with the ancient aliens guy the the big square that was kinda yeah you got to do it yeah okay he's got a photo of him sitting in that when we were talking to Giorgio tsoukalos from ancient aliens he was talking to us about this area in Peru where this stone is cut out and you can see it if you go to the Ustream page he put a picture of Chris excuse me Aubrey sitting inside this this rock where it was cut out where they have no idea how they cut it out because it was it's it's really you have to see it what is the name of the place again part of its in the ruins in the Sacred Valley I forget the name of this actual ruin site not coming to me but it's it was right there near you know it's outside of Cusco by about an hour and a half and you get to these ruin sites either way it's dope go get some alpha brain stupid yeah yeah it does seem like one of the place too bad you can't do ayahuasca there that would be the shit yeah I think that sounds fucking badass do ayahuasca at Chichen itzá or you know Machu Picchu or something like that yeah at the ruins of some ancient civilization that's what they do that's what they develop mantra peaches for as a spiritual center actually really it wasn't like a original itical Center this was their spiritual home where rituals I'm the people there Oh cuz I thought cuz modern Western folks have no fucking idea why it was created they don't have an idea no yeah the shaman saw say this was there this was created as their spiritual home and that's and that's why they created it in such an odd spot the way that the mountains are around there's speaking of lost civilizations I'll be in Milwaukee August 13th at the Pabst Theater with Joey cocoa Diaz tickets are on sale right now and it's like half
