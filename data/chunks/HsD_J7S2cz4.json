tallow ooh what is that what is that and you know what else I use minced garlic and rosemary I put rosemary in the in the what cast-iron skillet with the beef tallow extra I learned that an Italian restaurant I said are you guys doing he's a rosemary rosemary it's a wonderful rebuy if I go to an Italian restaurant the dude talks like that I am excited yeah of stoked I'm more pumped yeah it's just a regular person even if they're nice I'm disappointed yeah it's like the nicest waiter ever I'm like dude you seem like a great guy but damn I wish you were from Italy I'm just whipping you guys up some fettuccine alfredo nobody from Italy back there man it's a weird one right it's like Italian restaurants particularly like I go to a Greek restaurant I would hope the guy would not have an accent oh yeah we don't need I wouldn't care as long as I can understand and that's great right but I'll require it and but I required an Italian restaurant yeah cuz there's something about it that's different and then everywhere else max you know I mean everything else is Mexican chained by maxixe Chinese maybe like in Mexican or Mexican people making Chinese food it's always one of those weird things you like huh okay though like it those um you know those those chain places yeah those Chandon PF Changs now PF Changs is not as much that's like a restaurant like you order it PF Changs pretty fucking good but that's all Mexicans cook in a Chinese go time for say have you been to a Buca di Beppo like in college that was my job as valeting at Buca di Beppo if you want like straight-up filling old-school Italian food so much bro they will hook you up there to fucking kill you wait a minute look at a boat is the Chinese food of Italian places you don't I mean like how Chinese places give you way too much food pounds of fucking pasta when you book at a Beppo they bring that aluminum tan out with the rigatoni anyway who the fuck are you for a full fucking Kingdom your servants listen this is silly yeah it's absurd it turning me into an asshole and that's also rigatoni like that kind of food you keep going you don't even wanna hurt you don't stop like that carb when that when you're eating like a good linguine with clams like Oh mmm why are you eating it's so gluttonous the chewy goo that has no nutritional value is going in your stomach I go it's so good you can't wait for mixed in with some sauce and to give the illusion of healthiness oh there's green a little bit of green on it when your body's trying to process it afterwards oh I feel fucked up sometimes when you eat too much pasta you feel like drunk I feel like stoned or drunk because I'm broken my body's just like oh your resources slamming all that shit down yeah it's so fucking gross good everybody remembers from like time we were kids apparently someone told me that you don't get a significant enough amount of tryptophan from Turkey for it to put you to sleep I've heard it's bullshit I want to know if that's true though you know that's true so I've been told that there is there's always tryptophan that's been in Turkey but the the running joke is that after Thanksgiving dinner you pass out but that's actually because of all the other shit you're eating fucking mashed potatoes tons of carbs a fucking Brit Hawaiian bread rolls carbs yeah contrary to popular belief eating turkey isn't the main reason you feel sleepy after Thanksgiving feast the oft-repeated turkey myth stems from the fact that turkey contains an amino acid tryptophan which forms the basis of brain chemicals to make people tired but it's not true yes but it's not I mean it does but it's not the thing that knocked you out beautiful that fucking sitting on your couch and drinking 40 beers is what makes you sleepy yeah so it says tryptophan is component of the brain chemical serotonin which gets converted into the well known sleep inducing hormone melatonin and poultry and many other foods also contain tryptophan chickens got similar amounts yep gram for gram cheddar cheese actually contains more tryptophan than turkey does suck on that cheese heads no cheese folks it's just being a glutton man yeah you just become a fat piece of shit in the holla you just feel like you're supposed to keep eating and eating and eating there's an interview with Katt Williams you sitting in the back of the limo I talked about this in this Pat where he talked about not eating before shows and I was like he's right like why would I eat before shows it made me realize I even before it shows is a terrible idea yes anybody's got a process all that you come out like half-assed we don't know we never eat before shows when we do shows we never eat before shell after shows is actually when I taste the fucking best I'll have some fruit I'll have a little bit of fruit before a show I have a little something like a little baby thing I don't mind some fruit because you have some fruit it's like you're getting some carbohydrates you're getting some sugar you're getting some fiber it's super easy to digest like melon you know melon your body's just you could lift you could to eat melon and then do a Sikh kettlebell workout like it's not gonna fuck you know like melons easy it's a little baby sugar rush to the probably helps your energy a little bit your body just you mash it into mush so quick it just goes sliding down there your body's like oh we got this we should do that we should do the tired tour where we just eat a huge meal before we get on stage and see what see what comes out of that fucking shit compare melon to like a Stromboli like one of those with fucking sausage and cheese with the layers yeah but the bread on the other cheeses top you know they burn it up now and you you take a couple of bites of that you just like oh just keep going but if you looked at like the size of what you would eat on one of those mother for all design you'll get shit but you wanna layers and layers we fucking got that we'll take you down son you ain't do no fucking crosswords after that she's pasta cheese pasta pasta cheese sit the fuck down there's more cheese coming you know play no puzzles bitch I would wonder the brain activity slows down so much more like I wonder what the act of the active level of brain activity is when your stomach oh yeah you're useless I feel like eighty points of IQ like someone should come to you and try to get you to do things yeah like you'll fucking sign off on stuff you'll change your marriage license fellas you want your wife to sign a prenup go ahead and fat her out on Phuket a pepper lasagna and then she'll sign whatever the fuck you want you up I don't think I could like when I Drive home after having a full meal I feel more fucked up and like out of it than if I have a couple of drinks well you're definitely slower oh yeah your reaction time would be slow if you were full and you were driving just like it's just like you're tired when you're full and you don't talk as well you know articulate things as quickly yeah it's got to be related that's like part I worked there for four years that's why I know so much about it but part of the thing you're supposed to sell at the end of the meal is like lemoncello or espresso cuz it's supposed to be like a digestive I don't know if that's a theoretical miss but maybe it is some to that where it helps you just a little better well are they all in Italy they all they all do it as a end of the meal to clear you out a little bit it's gonna help you break down some shit I use ingresso and the chairs in Italy turn into toilets you know that right in Brazil when you go to those two Hass Correa's they they have this delicious dessert that has papaya in it and it's like a papaya smoothie it's like a blended papaya drink and look at the dessert rather and they they have that specifically because the enzymes and papaya help break down the meat Oh does yeah wild that's fuckin delicious dude what is it it's a speak you know what's that what's that chain that Brazilian changed forward a shot for the job I'll get a child that's it right there dude son that will fucking rock you at the end of a good meal is there booze in there you can get before they have a guy who comes by unlovely say no cuz I'm not a drunk but you I would say pour it yeah that's the first question I ask is there booze yeah it's good with booze it's good without booze - it's just good I love those I went there with that a UFO guy Bob Lazar oh you did Lazar one there was yeah yeah in Schultz and result with me - yeah and Jeremy Corbyn the guy who made the documentary we all sat around talking to him that Lazar did freak me - fuck oh he's a freak out made me want to move I you know I had no indication he's full of shit I mean I was zero bullshit meter here's the thing that when you've told a story for is many years as many times as he did hmm it's uh it's super hard to be consistent if you're just making everything up it's super hard to to have things that you are saying back then that everybody says don't even exist right eventually turn out to be true it's very difficult to deny that like these are parts of his initial story his initial story had something to do with this thing called element 115 which most people mean they didn't even recognize that it actually existed until much later right that's a big feature of it when did he start talking about it once they're talking about the ad yeah that's how 70s 80s right a long time ago but it's about look I don't know enough about elements and the table to understand it you're talking to a state school kid here well shit both stupid you're probably more educated than me though but at the end of the day this guy is obviously smart as fuck and he's a scientist that definitely worked at Los Alamos labs there's a record of them there right and they tried to deny that they tried to erase it that alone tells me just the fact that they tried to say that he didn't exist he never went never worked at Los Alamos that's a huge freaky yes in the 1980s you don't think they could just erase your past right right you don't think they could just erase your birth certificate or erase your your your medical records or raise your dental records they could do whatever they want easy act then well what's that tell me you saw that documentary about the three identical strangers did you walk heard about it didn't see it bro oh my god I mean essentially in so many words I get without divulging too much three brothers are born a triplets are born and they are separated at birth unbeknownst to them they grew up completely independently run into each other later in life this is the 70s I think it was 70s and they meet publicly on maybe not Donahue but one of those fucking big shows you know like they bring them all together you know and they end up finding out later in the documentary spoiler alert that the company who is doing this that's doing trial tests on babies that are separated and putting them with different families to find out if they end up growing up with similar characteristics nature versus nurture yeah nature nurture scientific experiment but imagine how sick you have to be fuck to decide to separate kids yep and dude and show up and test their family to find out how they're breeding these are how they're growing these children gross as do you wash it right Jim they'd come test them every week or two and they're like doing checkups in the they didn't the parents almost didn't even know I don't I'm not sure well one of the parents seem to be more keen about it and the other ones just felt like well they were getting money for it so they were like this is just a part of a program that we're in bro how is that much different than aliens abducting people and that's I'm saying that's not us it's not that's my point is like if they got away with voluntary life and and and genetics test bro involuntary those do they have the data from that to like the nurse or the assistant from they get the doctor that was doing it says there is data she has read it but it has never been released and it should be because they fucked up oh wait you're leaving on an important part problem it's in it it's in a library in a in like Harvard library legally what can't be released to the public it's something that's it's someone's holding onto it and it cannot be released they've tried hundreds of times and it's got a 2050 release date or whatever they're hope they're waiting for these people to die yeah so then they'll just go away and no one think about anymore it's fucking dude watch it it'll fuck you up I'm scared and then you find out in the documentary they're not the only ones there's they've done this over and over and over and over it's fucked dude I'm sitting on a plane watching it he's a reptilian yes you know you know you're on a plane watches I'm so good and you look around like to other people you're like it was true so trippy man it's so trippy so yes do I think that Lazar had people trying to excite his his pet for sure for sure and there's a look there's a lot of other stuff that you gotta go hmm I don't know how do you how do you prove that how do you explain that well I don't know he's not like anything in our world what do you believe that the big questions are is it education background that was a big one what do you mean credibility wise know whether or not he actually was educated at a certain place I'm not I can't this is a fucked-up one but I can't say what he told me hey um but essentially without saying it it had to do with projects he was working on currently no at the time oh right he's working at Los Alamos labs I can't say anything more than that fuck and now the Internet I don't love it I don't know if it's true right I mean who know them I wouldn't say anything so I said I wouldn't say anything and I'm not going to say anything but whatever he said about all these different things only he knows if it's true sorry when you're talking to a guy it doesn't seem like a liar seems like he's very intelligent I mean he's talking about all kinds of different things very intelligent so either he's running the greatest 30-year con of all time or maybe this really did happen when you talked to him so you just guessing you don't know I don't know his life I don't know it's real life right just gasps ow but he seems like a guy who's seen some shit and and just didn't know what to do and told some friends about it and then then went to the new and that's what that george knapp guy who was the investigative journalist that studied this case over all the years like this guy's never wavered like he stuck with the story over and it'll things have shown to be true that they said were science fiction like the there was this equipment they had at Los Alamos labs that he talked about where it was this thing that measured the distance are the size rather of the digits and your finger apparently it's like a great like your fingers the the inches are specific and so if you put your hand down that thing and then Jamie's hand it would give a different measurement like there's different each bone is a different length and the exact length is of like 1.7 whatever the fuck it is you know 1.7 inches like whatever measurement teal tool they use it was he was calculating the length of your fingers through some kind of buggy system that he said didn't really work that often but people said that science fiction it doesn't exist and then they finally got photos of these things and people that worked at Los Alamos labs concluded or they conceded that these were real things but for a long time they were fighting at being some people that didn't know we're saying he made that stuff up it doesn't exist but insurance showed it does exist and it did exist right there where he worked he even took them on a tour through the labs like he knew where everything was he used to work there so he when they went there with the documentary crew with Jeremy Korbel they just walked him through he showed where he worked he walked right in there look many of the guys run the craziest con game of all time yeah he's just a super genius way smarter than me me trick me and he thinks it's hilarious or maybe he saw some shit what he was explaining that made it more and more interesting was how compartmentalized it was and about how the problem with being so compartmentalized is that science is it's based on free exchange of information right yeah you have to have guys who are testing all these different things and working on them together that's the only way you can do so right so he's limited to a couple of guys that work on the propulsion system and then there's a couple of other guys that are working on the metallurgy and a couple other guys that are working on the navigation system and they chose him because he was kind of a maniac and he put a fucking jet engine in the back of a Honda and it was on the cover of the Los Alamos news page and it said in the article about Bob Lazar with his fucking jet-powered Honda that he was a scientist at Los Alamos lab a physicist so this was in the newspaper they printed this when this guy was doing this thing where he said he was living at the time in in the area where Los Alamos was and it's said in the newspaper that he worked at the lab there's a fucking logbook of employees it's got his name in it from that time a guy had it he showed it they took photos of it they showed it to everybody look we have an employee logbook yeah like this or the employee directory rather Robert Lazar right there so he worked there he really did work how could he how could all that I mean how could you fabricate that she everybody scared to talk all the people you've worked with they're scared to talk why do you think this wicked was happening to him and he looks like a fool that FBI raids his house everybody calls him crazy he'd he won't have anything to do with this the only reason why he wanted to do my podcast he was what he liked he wanted one more chance to just get it out in a forum where it's just him talking and he felt like he and I and we both talked about I feel me and you talk I'll just let you talk you tell me what happened and I'll let everybody figure out if it's true I don't know what do you think honestly there was parts of me that said maybe I'm just done with in Scott he's like really manipulative and maybe he just knows how to tell a story and it's 30 fucking keen dude I know but it's a tricky thing man you get cocky you can get cocky I feel like you don't get cocky and think that you know that someone's not full of shit yeah but I feel like you talked to enough fucking people who are an aren't full of shit that your meter is higher than most I'm also nice so when I'm trying to talk to someone I want I want things to work out well you're giving it out often I want them to have a good time yeah and when we're talking and don't want to confront people yeah I just even if I angrily disagree with every fiber in my being as I've gotten older and better at it better at talking to people I avoid that kind of conflict right I just I don't think it's necessary I just don't I just think your bullshit meter is keen enough we're gonna be like I think it's super cocky to say that I would like to think it is yeah my ego would like to say broke like a photo okay just try to lie I've had people lie to me dude I know NASA bro that ain't master stuff fear not I mean think there's times when you know someone's bullshit and there's times we think you know someone's bullshit and you're wrong then you know it's like this whole thing of looking in someone's eye and talking to them sometimes some will tell you something like Oh bro I didn't even know you called me like you motherfucker if I could see it right in their eyes like you piece of shit you'd I didn't see your tax demand I didn't even see it you didn't it's a fucking Salman bitch yeah fuck that shit you know who knows I don't know it freaked me out and not gonna like it was like fucking sometimes you have to do that to people what hey man I didn't get your call is it better off to say hey I find you a little annoying and very needy and so when I get a phone call from you off and I cringe I do like you and I do our time but sometimes I just can't sometimes I can't that's probably the most healthy version but you can't say that no you can't you have to go like this he'll go I didn't you did today oh fuck I didn't see ya sorry Manny I didn't see it did you not get my text that's when people that bothered you not get my text I always say sorry I didn't respond your text I try to say that first but let me tell you something as if as a man if I text you and I'll get a text back I don't get it with that I don't get a fucking butt hurt right no I just go that's let's it he saw it it is what it is we move I don't send a text in needing or if I needed a real response from you I would call you and go hey I need to talk to you about something you ever have someone send you a text it's like a little on the needy side and then they send you one like three minutes later it says hello every day question every fucking day Jaime every day to me when you coming over when are you coming over I'm common Jay leave me alone from our afternoon pump session you know some people just get real weird with like them sending them messages in a bottle and then there's a little message did you get it and in the other side of it is Bobby Lee who literally never answered a text ever ever ever ever I've sent him a thousand texts for him yeah he doesn't answer good for him you his green you know his notification is like 800 fucking little red you know he never answers he doesn't give a shit but I kind of but everyone who's friends with him knows that's just Bobby yeah Joey just calls you yeah Joey I jump a lot more I've been calling people a lot more it's more personal what's also like you can call as many people as you can text and I think there's an overload of communication that occurs when you're texting with like 10 different friends at the same time I got dude sending me videos of them kicking pads and people shun me I mean look at this fish I caught like a fucking get these texts all day from all these crazy interesting people imagine if I got that many phone calls in a day it would be insane turn your finger like hey what's up man hold on someone's calling me hey what's up Tom you never write you know I'm saying like you would never if you think about even if you have like three friends and you're texting to the back and forth throughout today making jokes maybe you know like a group chat like right a lot of us from group chats yes toggle a shed and show ridiculous pictures see what it would get me kicked out of the country oh yeah sure right god I mean that you would never do that if it was phone calls you'd be like you needy bitch I gotta call you all day yeah I'm calling you in the morning that are calling in the afternoon are we fucking and what's happened even if we were if you needed me to call you that many times in a day Blake hey hey hey like we got a we got to be happy to being alone - yeah baby happy be together but also you got to be able to be alone yeah if you need phone calls all day long hey hey hey hey hey chill out chill blank out a text it's good because you could be in the middle of some shit right if you're one of them dudes is inclined to change a transmission you want to rebuild an old Chrysler or something like that you could be under there that a little text message I'll get back to you I'm gonna figure that out that's my cat she may be real quick yeah we're gonna meet at 8:00 you know like it's minimal yeah right there's nothing to it but isn't that bad to be talking to people that way isn't it is it bad you talk to people so much - shit diet yeah a shitty diet Duncan and I were talking about the other day about like finding information online just constantly be inundated with stories of horrific things and bad things terrible things and ugly things that it's a bad diet it's a bad like mine died and I was like you're so right that that is you think you're like immune to that that you are who you are and it's just some stuff you're experiencing but much like if you eat healthy foods your body feels better I think if you concentrate on healthy things and interesting things and fascinating things and not horseshit I think you're giving yourself a better mental diet totally I think if you consume too much of anything it's bad right so consuming too much of even tooku too much positive information can be fucking detrimental because you can get delusional yes so you have to have some semblance of a balance of how you ingest that the people that only ingest negative they're like people only eat candy if you grown adults and for like ten years you only ate candy yeah your body would be a mess a fucker just barely alive if you just had to live off Snickers bars how much nutrition isn't a Snickers bar like I want to do something with that dude who did the 30 days with the big supersize me guy happiest guy hey bro do this just eat nothing but still are you still satisfies to a point that's why your hunger I guess they're delicious yeah they're on domina I love us in my favor they're great to take on hikes too by the way what really yeah a lot of nutrition and they burn in sugar man yes fuck it hiking up mountains and shit people love Snickers bars but hey I think even the Snickers people would tell you don't live off that shit stupid you can't live off us isn't that interesting like there's a food you eat that you cannot live off of yes because all food at one point you had to eat to live off of how many days do you think you could go with only eating Snickers bars and should this be the sober October challenge yes first of all yes and second if I what if we know birds would die Bert will die but I mean that is what it is if you only could eat Snickers bars and water two weeks two weeks two weeks with all your body malfunctioning I think something's gonna happen yeah there's a post I just found from like two years ago where people asked this question it was a discussion if someone did the math you get the eight about twelve to get the caloric intake to get that 2,000 a day 12 a day just for 2,000 calories how many days could you survive ion I mean that's up to you well bro let's think about that 12 hours a day holy shit how long do you think okay the problem with that is like everyone is not coming from the same starting point that's the biggest issue you have to have those three twin guys meghamala Snickers - white and dyes you guys need to cut you guys need to control you guys need some sort of hero they would be the test just feed them give them a million dollars each give them nothing but Snickers till someone's on the verge of death - so many taps tap out bitch honey daisy thing you go on only Snickers I time I say two weeks is probably the human body will start to shut down I wonder maybe you could go a long time well let me say this you could you could fucking find this there's a dude that's been eating just pizza for like 25 years breakfast lunch and dinner well fine dude that he's just pepperoni pizza I respect that I think it's like fuck it my parents told me what to do my whole life and I'm a grown now bitch I paid sevareid a just crying and eating pizza never saw this journalist try to get him to have like a piece of green a leafy greens puked on camera fuck unless it's basil and a nice sauce get that fucking green shit of a pizza for 20 years something like that's the same boy was it Jamie was it 25 years he says he has one boy Raisin Bran a week blue cheese chili down all that dough that delicious dough holy shit 25 years he does have diabetes of course he does duh calling me surprised how the fuck sorry buddy for laughing at your diabetes but how the fat all not sorry how the fuck does someone eat nothing but that glue for 25 years that's the cat exam he's 48 I should be doing YouTube videos so what do they call they call him skinny fat on there was an article to call him like he's you know skeino skinny fat right yeah he looks remarkably good for someone who's only in pizza for 25 years it might be something to it but they say skinny fat fucking people look skinny fat skinny fat we're like the body doesn't show any signs but the insides fucking murdered it's torn apart yeah well these are muscles nothing's there yeah that's why you can look small but you don't have anything there right skinny fat people your limbs are barely hanging on threads it's like a certain you know certain people like you hug them and you're like oh my god god there's nothing there you're so frail so funny when you when you hold that's like when I take pictures after shows is ahead of people yeah you know and you grabs and you feel and some people you feeling like wow that's fucking weird it's weird it's weird you're like I'm fuckin just lumpy with jello it's terrible boney lump bag well it's really terrible as one mm-hmm I mean I'm not saying you have to be a bodybuilder no but you have to fuck it's just it's you should keep your body and moving away it's just a laziness thing it's a discipline thing and like this idea there's some sort of nobility and humility and not caring about your body it's silly I won't get one you get one it doesn't make you dumber if you workout stop I know that jocks were assholes and people bullied you I get it yeah but goddammit take care of your fucking meat vehicle just go take care of it yeah the meat skeleton people oh you're vain that's why you work out yes sure hat - I like looking good I like it it's better to me than not looking good I'm sorry I'm willing to put in the time but you know what the irony is so because of the type of because of the growth growth of MMA chanting cheers Cheers my brother because the growth of MMA CrossFit all of these all these new worlds that have kind of emerged socially now that are so much bigger than they were years ago nerds from that I grew up with a high school an hour into working out yeah that's the irony that's a big thing with jiu-jitsu so I'm saying it's like the biggest like insecure people now they found a home there's something that's disciplined it's good it feels good to move your body it feels good it feels good to do things whether it's taking a dance class I'm not into that but taking karate I know that shit did I like yoga I like running like doing jujitsu obviously I like all kinds of martial arts and but I just like moving my body man runnin up hills you move your body so I ain't goin you'll feel better afterwards I know you don't want to do it I never I fucking hardly ever want to do it if maybe wanted want to actually do it five out of ten times but I see me less yeah but I do it I just do it I know what it's like to not want to do it I get it shut up I just start talking to myself I go come on pussy what are you talking about do it if I was you outside of you knowing what I know if I could read my mind I Billy come on bitch you just being lazy put your fucking shoes on get a sweat going then you're gonna feel pumped come on man you've done this a million times and then invariably I'll be in the middle of the workout I'm sweating like fuck yeah yeah and then I get into it it's like just you got to push past that creepy resistance that Steven Pressfield wrote about in the war of art it applies not just to art not just to writing replies it applies to cleaning your room it applies to sand your sorry to a friend it applies to taking care of a debt all those things you just keep putting off it's this weird thing that you have when you see a problem you gotta fix it see you thing you have to do go do it when you know something's like clean your fucking room right that's what Jordan Peterson always says clean your clean your room right in your room and that's that really is what he's means get your shit in order yeah we'll do it I think I think it's also a personality trait though to to be fair like I fucking I'm someone that has to get it done you know someone goes you know if you do it all at once I'm the opposite I'm like yeah you do yeah you fucking do like my she wants new blinds at the house what if we just did the living room for now I was like none of us get the whole fucking thing done what's the difference that's a manly thing to say to get it done what can we just have this window no this window just this will be my shade spot the truck up all around would be simple fucking blinds I want trees around this house I wanna walk around my trees you could buy an old tree you know that you could buy like I want to tree my yards 500 years old I'll find you one that's dope though no that's cool to be like place it here I got a fucker I have a 150 plus old oak tree in my backyard here's what's weird okay if you have piece of land right in that piece of land is a hundred acres a beautiful piece of land you know you don't own the animals on that land like if there's wildlife on that land are a bunch of deer on that and you can't just shoot them you have to have tags you have to have state allocated tags to give out a certain amount based on the deer population using wildlife biologists and they view it from helicopters and shit everybody's different way they've trail cameras all these different ways they determine the numbers then they figure out how many people can hunt but you own the trees and then weird yes all the trees yeah you only everything that they're around have like some gigantic population of pine trees in the forest like you own some giant swath of land that you're logging like those logging companies do yeah they own those trees somehow how they don't own the deer they're in elk they don't own that the Eagles but they own the fucking trees yeah we're maybes because the trees don't move yeah that's exactly easy to just dock you just take that ya saw that thing they like completely over fish you know what I mean the forest and then they they leave these big cut like these huge cut areas like have you ever been to the woods and seen a pair a place that's been logged yep it's interesting yeah it's wild to see well it's kind of beautiful in a weird way I hate to say it but it's like you're like wow that's it's mesmerizing you know it's it's a key area for hunting too right because well you're right he's a clearing and the animals come out to eat the sprout right right the new new new new grass grows up yeah and it's a big open place so it gets plenty of rain and sunlight like sometimes the canopy keeps like smaller things from growing right I don't get enough sunlight and a lot of times in the canopy to like everything's beaten down with pine needles everything's covered you know with leaves and shit inside well you have a real thick forest right those big open areas metal these animals come out you could find it in there that's fucking wild easy hunting season well it's never easy they could smell you a fucking an impossible distance way you put stuff on yourself to not smell like no you can't do it if you can't cover up the smell no chance the other thing you could do is there's a thing called oz onyx that does work but it only works if you're in one place so like if you're in a tree stand you have a thing that you put above your head and it sheds ozone down on your body and what the ozone does and this is how it's been explained to me again remember I'm moron so you're talking to went to Boston University are you mass Boston rather for three years in their continuing education program and everyone took my SATs I'm a legitimate moron but apparently this ozone shit that comes down over you it it confuses the deer like the deer gets the scent it's like what the fuck is that he doesn't know what it is as opposed to smelling you and going fuck they smell you they just run they smell people they just run yeah they take off like hundreds of yards away you'll see them just go like this and then just take off and you're like what happened and you blow some this like white talc in the air like a puff of talc and as it drifts you see which way the winds blowing it's a wind checker right so when you're up there in the wind you have this little it's like like almost like a little just like a baby powder right right you just press it and the stuff goes in the air and you can see exactly where they went they even have vaporizers now that do it now I have one that's like a vaporizer you press a button just mist goes in the air to show you where the windows it's just mist yeah that's Wow and um it's just for that just to make smoke so you can see which way the smoke goes but it's just mist so that's the ozone shit o3 ozone bonds your scent molecules yeah so this is what they're saying so they I don't think they're allowed alive on this shit I think essentially it creates like a shield for your natural you're older you're older your natural odor so my friend John Dudley is a big believer in this and anything he's a big believer and I'm a big believer in that is fucking wild apparently it does work but it's still if they see you move if something funky comes their way I mean maybe it works so like 80% of the time there are some sneaky fucks they're smart how good is their vision their vision is good but they they you view things like from an edge detection thing like that they see things that move right if you just freeze if you have camouflage on and you freeze they'll often walk right by you yeah especially if you had there's a thing this another thing called a heck suit HECS and a heck suit I wear one I don't know if they really work but they appear to work with birds like they've proven that birds follow an electrical magnetic signal that's how they get home right they they use them the natural magnetism of the earth to figure out where the fuck they're going I fade it's crazy what isn't it funny that we can't do that so too we can't get home I'm lost yeah we could just use two wrong turns I'm fucked though but these birds it's like it works with birds like all these guys say that you put these suits on birds have no idea you're there and they don't see you like it blocks the electrical magnetic signal that your body's what could that be made out of what's happened to mesh there's some sort of a mesh that that you want yeah that blocks it they have actually like meters they can show they put it on weave it over this thing there's no reaction take it off and it's reaction where it's detecting the signal that your your body puts out the real question is there's a prove that it does that the real question is can animals really see it and how many of them can see it the big thing is smell it doesn't matter if they can't see you if they fucking smell you they're gone yeah they're gone you could look just like a tree but if a deer smell you he's gonna just start running they just run what you what's the only fix for the smell thing other than that that's that thing that's it that's it there's so their sense of smell is impossible to understand it's so much better than ours that what we have shouldn't even be called a sense of smell if we like the difference you can go holy face holes yeah like how well the ants do stand-up comedy like a couple of guys got ants man I got a type three but that's what the difference is in comparison to like how bad our noses work right versus a deer who's the bet what animals the best I think a bear bears are the best sense of smell to think bears have a preposterous sense of smell dogs are really good but it's not good I think a bear is like a hundred times stronger than a bloodhound it can smell 18 miles away eight fucking miles row I search with average sight distances how far can people what's the what's a typical like site distal can only see about a mile it depends on the animal like some animals don't see good at all pigs don't see good at all yeah you just freeze on a pig they don't know what the fuck's going on for sure you go he's a lot like little mice and the fucking yeah Eagles have the best probably sight yeah they can see from for miles and miles my my friend from Alaska heals halibut fishing all the time he said if you help you to fish up an eagle can see it miles away that's it that that's some dinosaur shit that's how you know dinosaur shit does that play is miles is what grizzly can find an elk carcass when it's underwater and polar bears can smell a seal through three feet of ice oh fuck three fucking ice oh my god that's insane three feet of ice that is our fucking monster imagine if you were in a big concrete building that's three feet thick and there's a bear on the outside oh that was a monster movie Blake this is this monster no I'm here I could be two kids right there parents have already been killed and they're just breathing like don't worry we're safe it's concrete's three feet thick there's no way I could smell us in this outside I smell who he talks to mm-hmm just just wanted three fucking you either sister 18 miles and smell three feet of smell through eyes did you ever see the video where the BBC reporter gets inside a box like a plexiglass box and then I put him around polar bears and the polar bear tries to eat them and the polar bear is trying to eat him through this box trying to figure out how to get to him because it knows he's in this box it is fucking terror I would you ever bro and this guy's got cameras on him the whole time shit in his pants dukey and left and bright fill in those drawers son how strong is that that thing has to be indestructible they're so big they're so big and we've been we've been really fucked over just let that let that run Jenna we've been really fucked over with goddamn Klondike bars and coca-cola make it look sweet we have a super distorted perception of this fucking predatory killing machine that eats its babies bro bro these things are fucking ruthless cleanup crew they're there to make sure there's so few resources up there in the wild that this giant behemoth of a bear exist so he could just jack everything just jack everything and keep the populations nice and low look at that he's in here right in there I'm not a biologist so that he knows it's in there he's just trying to get it he's biting it goddamn dude look at that up look at this man it's pressing on it that's glass man if you praise your dead fucking teeth through it when its opening its mouth that's a monster's mouth this is what I look like drunk at a McDonald's it's fucking 4:00 in the morning trying to get food to the drive-thru this poor guy no gifts he's behind him he's like but the camera is this well shake it's shaking the shit out of it of course it is why would he be so convinced that that can't that thing would survive it'd be so dope if it just kind of how do they rescue this cat this dude yeah how do they get him out of there like who's who's like how long does it take to get him out of there they gotta find a way to distract this bear walked away come on yeah it's got to get frustrated at some point like fuck does look at he goes fuck there's how did they test that box what if that guy hated them the guy made the box oh this guy's gonna climb out I'm out I am free we've got a prize oh the bear yeah like pretend the bear is right next to him that thing can run 35 miles an hour fuck out of here fast a bear run yeah they're insane dude they run like that on ice I think he's just digging with their claws they could run I like how they kind of pretended like that was a totally safe normal experiment for him to do like he got out like no big deal man you know big fucking polar bears ironically are black underneath all that white fur you know that right it's clear those clear or is that was a clear black it's black skin you have the skins black yeah that wire yeah it is why well you gotta imagine that people get snow tan right you get snow blind a stop line is the Sun beating off the snow like people get burnt like really bad yeah you go skiing without chilling you know that's a black bear bro there's polar bear without here yeah but it's not look at the hair around its face see oh it's all black I guarantee that's a black bear also it just doesn't look big enough what does a parent maybe it's just another one yeah it's got mange you see how it has the hair on the top of its heads black a sink I think just wrote that it doesn't mean it's correct no but they are they're dark but underneath all that they are really dark it's why me hey maybe when they get mange their fucking hair on their head gets black come the fuck knows go to that will ranges I mean just weird shit what the fuck is a little bear I mean I've looked I've seen this before I guess it typed in polar bears oh yeah what would imagine pull up there no fur they're the most terrifying because they're the biggest well they're right there Jamie top the top fourth picture is them spreading the hair apart right they see the skin there there how so there you go Oh perfect yeah and see how that the hair looks white but it's actually they say it's like more of like a clear color wow that's fucking crazy to me yeah like not technically white right no it's yeah it does it does kind of looks translucent translucent almost right what but what an amazing animal man unbelievable imagine that thing lives in this place where there's no vegetables at all nope but it got so big it evolved to get that big meat dude just eat tons and tons and tons of me and they can eat a fucking like a hole through ice to get to you to they'll just chew through the ice it'll do whatever it can get to you they're right there it's so nice that they're so far away they swim you know they jump in the water in ten it comes from six miles an hour bro and for how long can they swim I wonder how long they can stay in the water for because they have to get out this is that knots and why do we need knots like boat boat people love that show but boat people hey it's six fathoms hey fuckface how many feet is a mile six miles now is 5.2 knots my boat goes five notes cause we want to make it slower that's so confusing why would they do that when they could just do miles an hour what is knots I think knots are around before miles an hour no kilometres were also before miles an hour was it yeah yeah kilometres it was thought kilometers with the metric system in our that was later no no knots kilometres down really smart people are like why the fuck are they talking some more than talking about kilometres some engineer is a god dammit when I was in high school they tried to put the metric system on us they tried to bring back the metric system yeah and we're like bitch this is America they fuckin with that bitch and fuck your systems of 10 we leave out unnecessary letters what didn't work just like soccer they tried to push soccer on us too you know why soccer didn't work we're talking about this today because this is America too slow too slow too slow baseball works what people say people have goals people are goals dude people goals oh ok so people have scoring scoring people have scores listen the NHL the NHL people are the reason they change the blue line rule is because they wanted more goals so they got more goals more viewership what's more American than a Grand Slam right literally nothing bases loaded crack it's all Sports Center used to be home runs and dunks yes fucking should be wheel we love seeing that moment yeah so in soccer when you have 90 minutes and sometimes no goals I get it I can't do it if you understand how difficult it is if you're a fan of the game if you love your game play the game like ian loves it yeah he does you know the only black I know that loves soccer in America is that real in America how many black fucking friends you have that loves soccer he's my only one that's true I don't have any black friends that watch soccer that's true he's literally my only water maker right though yes in England England England Jamaica right born in Jamaica then moved to England in New York have you seen those games he goes to they look awesome they do we're supposed to go fun I'm not taking they're fucking fun it's just it's not I don't it's not my ship we were organizing a comedian thing that I had a family thing that I couldn't make it but they look like a good time especially if you want to get blasted on some of this Mike Tyson weed that we smoked today it's the fucking delicious by the way thank you Mike thank you Mike thank you my shout out to the champ motherfucking champ um what were we just talking about Halle Berry Oh polar bears yeah man there was Sun not some article about polar bears you know when whenever we say that polar bear populations are threatened they definitely are in certain spots but the places where polar bears occupy is enormous yeah it's huge and in some areas there's a lot of and we have this non nuanced way of looking at polar bears so people would get really mad if like they found these Inuits for killing polar bears but sometimes these folks are living in places where polar bears start entering their villages right and they they're super dangerous killing their babies they'll kill people they will straight-up kill people you know I think the atomic who's a he's a also a veterinarian Kevin he's a vet yeah he's um he's a guy who performed in Denver I met him in Denver I was working with him whoa oh do you know yeah he's famous yes he has a TV show up every Fitzgerald yes I was gonna say Fitzgerald but I thought I was wrong because my friend Dave Fitzgerald that was just get long white hair yeah like yeah yeah he told me that polar bear is out of the womb I like predator you know like the movie predator like out of the womb they're just trying to bite and kill out of the womb dope I have the womb they just come out and I was like well it makes sense right if you stop and think about what their life is everything is just white and frozen and occasionally you catch something slipping occasionally you catch someone who's sunning themselves and you get to him before they can get away and you could dive in the water and grab a foot and drag them back up survival man the darkest story that I ever heard I don't know if this is true but let's pretend it is yeah fine was there was some sort of an expedition and their boat hit some ice and so their boat starts sinking and they had a real problem because the next boat was hours away so they call in a mayday for the next boat and they climb out of the boat in time before it sinks and they get to an ice shelter like an ice raft oh yeah lies island in the distance I see a polar bear and it's many many ice land bridges or whatever the ice distance that ice ice island away high steps but it keeps jumping in the water and getting closer it's trying to figure out what the fuck they are and then finally it gets to them finds out what they are it's in the ice island next to them jumps in the water pops up grabs one guys there's nothing anybody can do about it fuck takes him kills him drags him in the water again goes back on the other ice island it just starts eating them and they're just chilling watching it there one ice island away hoping that he doesn't stay hungry after he eats their friend elbow was your least favorite friend and the boat comes and rescues Amanda watched her friend get eaten alive the friend got eaten alive he died probably caught he probably it probably ate him and from them probably took her so they could see it he didn't care yeah this I mean like you worry when you eat a clam that you're eating in front of the clamp ends I want me in front of mmm no I'm sure he fuck I'm sure the bear ate it too no they wanted he I'm saying he kept an eye on them yes it's like you're next dude well I'm hungry but he knows that they're there if this isn't enough you mean maybe the guys like a small guy what do you do you what do you do just sit there and watch it you jump in the water what are you fucking do you can't swim away you'll freeze to death if you get in that water you just accept the fact that if it chooses to kill you that's your time there's nothing else you can do you can't fight it off I would punch my buddy and knock him out so it's easier than you know I mean knock him out slender huh you have to think about how much you love your friends oh my god there's so many people I'd knock out and leave for bears to eat doesn't yes a lot of people know most but what it is is just it's it's inescapable yeah the power that it has have you had a moment of near-death experience never like that never one never never run an animal like that if you're ready near-death experience well you're like fuck I could die car accident car accents yeah that's the only time I thought I might just it's kind of a near-death experience it is you ever know have you not been in a bad one I've been in some bad ones I've been lucky that's near-death shit yeah you you ever ride bikes motorcycles no it's gonna that's new people I knew crashed and one person I knew saw someone get hit all in like a month it was like bang bang so two people I know crash and fuck themselves up one was a dude that I was working with mm-hmm and another was Frank Mir was fighting in the UFC he was you know one of the best heavyweights on the planet and some guy ran a red light and t-boned him snapped his leg in half sent him flying through the air had a real problem I mean he almost lost his leg man lucky live but the femurs like the big upper leg that's a really bad bone to break that's what he's not usually yeah it takes a long time to heal it's very dangerous a lot of a lot of blood flows through that area out of main arteries that can fuck bleed out real takes a long time for that leg comes back and for Frank it was years before he was like a hundred percent again I say every arguably he never was the same it's arguable that something like that you're you're always gonna be like playing catch-up because it's such a devastating injury that's fuck I mean sounds like fuck motorcycles man it's too much there's nothing protecting you oh nothing fucking on the outside man but if you lived and well I was gonna say if you lived in a rural area but did you hear about that guy that plowed into these bikers he was in a pickup truck yeah I was in a pickup truck in New Hampshire and there was this I think they called themselves the jarhead bike club or something like that a bunch of Marines got together and rode their bikes around and this guy plowed into him and killed like seven on purpose no I don't know what happened I don't know no I don't I don't know if he was being careless if he was speeding I don't know he was fucked up do you work here with us here where was New Hampshire New Hampshire but I was gonna say yeah I Drive a motorcycle on some rural road yeah but some rural road you gotta worry about people not paying attention right you move out to the middle of nowhere you still don't fucking know Stephen King remember what happened to him Stephen King got hit by a guy who was I think you like he dropped something in his car and so he was leaning over to pick up whatever the fuck he left in his van Stephen King was walking by the side of the road maybe was his dog I feel like maybe it was his dog was doing something anyway the guy wasn't looking and hit him and it just broke everything I mean his whole body was broken he had several broken bones he was fucked up for a long time it took him forever before he could just sit at his desk again it right and he details it and great in great detail and he talks about it in his book on writing as well that's him with pins in his leg I mean there's that dog and dude he was older at the time he was a young guy but he's always looked old for some reason Stephen King has always looked like every time I see a photo I'm like what is he fucking he's always 50 he's been 50 since he was born well bro if you carrying around kind of go inside your bag it does I'm saying right that fucked up shit as made him look old always the fuck is that what is this Stephen King called sure maybe it's not his train let's not go down a little Google Stephen King me think about how many amazing books that guy is written think about the diversity of them by the way yeah they're not all the same kind of like people always go like Stephen King or he's done with drama he's done a lot of different kinds of different things but you know what I like he almost always made it a writer for main it was a guy from Maine yeah and then this crazy shit would happen to him that's like many of his stories not all of them but many stories were a guy from Maine yeah didn't he write Shawshank Redemption yeah yeah think about the water based off that story but think about that the he wrote that that beautiful and it's the rest of his shit is very dark so much of a sense blackest now he's got so much good stuff man I mean he's got so much goods did you read the Tommyknockers uh-uh it's fun man it's about like an alien craft that the crash-landed in the woods and I don't want to give any sport don't yeah it starts changing people what is Tommyknocker mean what I don't know but I think it was based on some like old fairy tale that people tell us like learning old words like that Tom I'm not sure find out what it is let's find out like this word hey I have a word like like Candyman you know that kind of thing here's a word I have a word for you there was a word that I heard that I thought was very funny that I wrote down that house I go Joe will think that's fucking wild but I like when I learn a new word I go oh that's fucking I always admire you again when I see you really with no case okay no case Jamie rocks no case to he's recently along this whole phone since I've got the gold one the new iPhone how many months has it been since you've been rocking them sober mmm do you feel free sure you feel better I've only had the case for one phone I guess you feel better than other people no I would feel riskier I would feel like more living everyday you make it as a sect like a success I so admire how Neil deGrasse Tyson explained it he's twirling around his fingers I've made some catches that maybe is yeah gained ability because of doing that right just let it drop if it was one of them like otter cases or some OtterBox yeah and thick ones this does never I'll I've said that I've said the same thing not to cop and Neil deGrasse Tyson ship but I love love the design of this yes I it if I don't know why hello it's beautiful it I see people with these huge case does go to OtterBox who cares so fuckin throw it off a cliff what am i throwing my phone if a fucking client are you but also what's very good Tommyknockers but all but but also by the way but also I think about it in the sense of I know this sounds privileged fine but I have Apple care which isn't that expensive are you if I fucking break and I just get water it's like twenty bucks what the fuck I don't give a fuck Joe Rogan you don't give a fuck was Tommy what is a it's based off of knockers who would have been miners chapped in the cave and would have been pounding on rocks to get rescued in his book it's the aliens underground who are trapping on knocking on Oh try it I don't remember the exact premise I knew they were doing something that was changing the people they made a really kind of funky movie it wasn't like the best movie wasn't it wasn't fucking was it for TV series for TV uh how many episodes think four five it's one of those ones where you almost gotta imagine in your head and that's an asshole thing to say because like like I used to have a joke about Game of Thrones people's books better and like how is that possible you're watching real dragons and people fucking and then sword fight it's impossible and you're gonna tell me those shows two episodes two parts so two hours that movie if you wanted to really figure out what the book is it would have to be hours and hours and hours that book was nuanced the book got into psychology what was the other one where the dudes were in the woods and some alien crawled inside that guy's asshole and killed him which one was that one King book yeah family reunion no that was like some alien thing I crawled in his and killed yeah I would take over these people would take over these people it was in the in the guys toilet you know who it was it was the guy who was in that HBO series homeland Oh Oh Mandy Patinkin knows the guy who was captured remember he was captured and he was turned over the redheaded dude oh yeah yeah uh what the fuck is that guy's name what the fuck are you talking about but this is a Newark movie we can figure this out well that first of all that guy find out the the TV show homeland first season yeah and then you'll find the guy's name he's on billions billions that's right that guy was an awesome actor why can't I think it's funny oh that guy's at English accent yeah does ya crazy I know that as good as he is and I could he in an American that's creepy well it's kinda like what's his name uh the walking dead guy yeah yeah same guy I mean same thing they're on you how dare you Jamie wait wait also Jamie Lewis okay go to Damian Lewis's IMDB and there was a movie that he did a few years back there was a good fucking movie it was a steal I was on the right one I just never heard of it's called dream catcher a dream catcher yeah I was thinking white trash that's why I was thinking white trash I was like white trash white trash same kind of thing now you know that is my trash dreamcatchers that is the barbed wire around the bicep tattoo of the house of couch Ehrman's yeah yeah why do people love people love whenever you see someone had one you're like fuck man bummer bummer my kids were for sure puka shells it yeah when you have you and your Chuck when your child just learns about the world it's just not a good piece of art I'm sorry adult I think it's the frame cutter sucks yeah you notice everyone that catches a that has a dream catcher hasn't caught one dream yet they're fucking it's true dream thief the dreams dreams yeah catches them but you don't fucking get him dummy from no girl's house imagine if you were single and after all this conversation the girl he dreams she's a goddamn dream catch her over the bed you know like fuck she's perfect in every single way but she she believes in astrology [Music] it's my it was so right it was exactly who I am she said I was smart and creative and gifted and that I'm beyond generous to my friends just totally true she wants you to rub jib what is it crystals or gems in your hand before you fuck she's like can you roll these in your wrists but no they will they'll match your intentions they'll change colors if you're really your true self be me I'll be you bro how often when you when somebody goes what's your astrological sign I'm always like Oh get the fuck over get the fuck away from me yeah but I am a Leo and Leos are supposed to be kind of douchey a little bit boy oh wow they're very aggressive what does it mean to be confident it's bullshit I'm a Libra does that mean like every fucking guy born in October that's a boys and then you would get banned from Facebook for being racist Libra boys it'd be all white guys would be like the new proud boys Libra boys by the way I can't wait for sober October for me to keep drinking I want to come on the show and have a drink just to watch you guys battle nonsense I don't know what we're gonna do whatever you do I'm still not gonna be sober it's my birthday month I can't fuck with that well the real problem is the time commitment like I have too many goddamn pie podcasts that are booked all the way up to them and I know there's gonna be a lot shit I have to do yeah I can't dedicate too much time I can't do what I did last year let's do the Snickers challenge I think that's the best way to do it mmm let's do it let's do it what have you

with deep fake of Joe eating Snickers just fucking make a phony you doing it that was the other thing like we had an idea of like who can read the most books the most pages yeah but the problem with that is Burt legal wrote it just pound through all the pages no reward he can't read but he'll lie look I asked him if he could do the split you up can you split I go I can do the split he'll do it so I did this basically I was like an inch off the ground he's like oh you really do it so he what to do it he's like it couldn't do it at all he's in there I'm motely flexible I saw like there was a time in his life we could do the split but here he is 44 years old fake and he could do the splits doing Bert why would you lie about that he might seem like a guy that could do this but for a guy that's been sitting on dick for that many heroes I figured he could do the splits you know I mean for bouncing on so much cock I'm surprised Bert doesn't do the splits he's just a funny dude you could say I can't I can't let that happen now fuck that okay well I'm gonna I want to be invited so I can sit with Jamie and have a drink and gets get high and while you guys do sober shit it has to be very

this dude throws a fucking I see it out of the corner of my eye oh my god but when the sandal hit the curtain are actually in La Jolla they have the old comedy store sign do you know that they bought they brought that down the old neon oh yeah the old neon now it hit the neon and I was like dude what the fuck was that shit and it kind of you know when something doesn't register because I was like no way that if he broke the knee do it bro murder so I turned and then as I'm turning another sandal gets tossed on stage not thrown but like tossed and I immediately I was like what the fuck and he's going like this ah bro and the fucking staff is coming up and grabbing this fucking moron and two dudes are standing up in the audience ready to like swing like people were like it was a commotion and I was like what the fuck and he goes I'm just kidding around we kuna run and they were like get the fuck out get that he goes come on man I'm a big fan I go dude get the fuck out you can't throw shit

shit at people no and the poor girl man I've never seen someone so embarrassed she was getting her purse and shit and she's like you like wavering through the crowd and the son is like can I get back his sandals and I was like if I got it it doesn't usually happen someone's rare rare you gotta you gotta do some dumb shit it does happen hey man this guy got kicked out the improv yeah he was heckling everybody and then why God stage I mean he was just so loud and they just grabbed him and I go dude you kind of shut the fuck up man what do you like what are you doing doing this is ridiculous you know you're interrupting and they just grabbed him and the lady who was in front of him was his girlfriend go they're kicking him out are you going to leave she looks at me and she goes

room building your fucking room bitch that's your problem it was so crazy I was like you saw you were here with me yeah but the crowd was going Apes but they think it's your fault here though she knows to people she thought it was my fault everybody else thought was hilarious but the rest of the crowd is so angry at them because it's so indicative of what we know to be true about certain people there are certain people that blame everyone else except themselves so does always Watson when you watch the guy who said she's like he loves you I was like well he's ruining the fucking ciao like you just don't come to a show if you can't keep your fucking your your Tourette's in check you just want to scream shit out and just be acknowledged that's crazy you're just winning the whole show this sounds fake the same show the sunday show I was Joe we were joking around how crazy it was in the middle of a setup I'm about to tell a fucking setup and a guy goes said Tina what's your favorite thing about San Diego and I was like what what any goes I'll just and everybody boo I mean everyone's lighting him up because they were like is this the some people get so excited sometimes and I don't I love I do was a nice dude it was just like bro you know you gotta know the rules of the thing but he's been out by the beach too much there's those guys yeah there's those guys that it's too much salt air and too much Sun and they're cooked you're like a slow it's like a you know how like if you're gonna smoke a piece of fish look if you put your hand in there it doesn't even seem like you would do anything right you know I can seem like you'd be fine yeah like you live there forever but you can't after like four or five hours you become a smoke piece of fish all right that's it after those dudes brains smoke fishes certain amount of those guys brains that are always by the beach they don't drink enough water yeah they just get old and leathery right and though the rain for their brains leathery yeah you see them in the outside you look leathery their brain looks like that too man right I'm not a doctor there's their smoked their smoke and they come to the show they're slowly smoked too by the way about so many I had a bunch of Mexican fans I love my Mexican fans showed up in San Diego and all these dudes after the show we're like you almost have fucked that dude up dawg the fucking sandal dude I was like hey man am I gonna you do whatever you want to do not right now don't ask my kids to beat up white people right now it's a bad time I'm important to all nations to beat up Mexicans this wall talk they'll throw in a few extra shots against you beat up everybody beat up everybody Mexicans that's Andrew Santino saying they might have my favorite food a period about this my I think not my favorite food here's the thing honestly it really varies like sometimes my favorite food is steak sometimes my favorite food is Italian but my favorite food when I know I probably shouldn't be eating it but I want to eat it anyway is like lengua quesadilla from a real Mexican joint like that place I've taken you guys to the one that there's a joint in the valley you go there they have Mexican soap operas on TV this girl's the big tits in the red dresses always right yeah and everyone in there is like locals they look a bunch of dudes who are getting off work and know abouts like a real small hole in the wall type place everyone speaks Spanish 100% everything's written in Spanish my food is off the fucking charts dude it's off the charts it you get Leng lengua quesadilla bro with the spicy sauce don't what kind of meat is in there lengua tongue language ah beef tongue it's beef tongue yeah sensational dude it's so good go on yeah I'm one of those there's all kinds of tacos oh my god what's your death-row meal then is Mexican and your death row man be eaten before I go really shit yeah come on kill me you want me to have a good time eating lobster first fuck you I'm eating death row me shit I mean all of that shit I'm just thinking of trying to taking one guy out when he tries to get me from the jail that's all my concentration is on come get me bitch I mean you gotta kill me come on man not even the lobster well I'm not gonna need a fucking Lobster I'm trying to figure out a way to kill you if you if they're trying to kill you trying to figure out why they kill them I'm thinking somebody just one guard gets murdered yeah yeah that's a good way out I'll fuck up one don't you think you would be thinking that way no they're gonna drag you to you unless you did something horrific and you want to die and you know you're terrible what if you were wrongfully accused if you're wrong if you I'm wrongfully accused and I'm on death row I'm trying to kill somebody or you kill yourself when they get to you yeah yeah but how do you so hard in jail they make it real hard they keep things from you that you could kill yourself with which is horrific hey they put you into the problem is you could kill somebody else with it right they left some wire with fucking handles on it you're not going to turn that in right that's gonna get that's gonna get passed around some some dudes gonna die yeah but but I do think though if death with Death Row's coming up on you you're thinking a lot differently yeah you're not thinking about killing the guard you thinking about fucking please God people people find God when they're about to die you do but the way to avoid those horrific thoughts is to plan a murder just think like how fast can I get to one of these guys before they can they can pile up on me I think about what I would think about what it would take though to get to that place when you're like that's it I'm gonna have to fucking just kill everyone I see cuz I'm done that's always like the appeal of a show like The Punisher like the comic book they ever did it was a shit job with that fucking comic book I mean I heard the Punisher on Netflix was good I didn't see that but I didn't love these like they had a Dolph Lundgren movie and he didn't even have real stubble it's the dumbest shit of all time because by the way this is before HD this is where they faked his stubble and obviously fake VSB those in coffee grounds it looks so bad it looks like a bad stipple like little rascal sponge and dipped in some dirt rubbed it on his face and they pretended that it was a five o'clock shadow I mean whoever the fucking makeup artist was they should have got the fucking Academy Award for parish shit ever but it's like almost like they made it a comedy it sounds right like they know this movie's piece of shit and they are gonna make them make the makeups so bad and so dumb looking hey that's honest that's odd dude they're gonna make the makeup looking so dumb that nobody believes it's real closing up on young-hee is there Dolf it's not clear is not HD yeah but it's goddamn dude it looks so fake it's hard to tell no but that is that but you can see it's the actual movie did you google Dolph Lundgren fake double a Punisher I just did Punisher just so we could see pictures from I don't want to have anything doctor okay just right Dolph Lundgren Punisher fake stubble just try that fake stubble can we have that maybe nobody noticed this but may we have that mic special anymore where is that where is it there's oh the mike tyson's fuck yeah yeah yeah let's have some it was a close-up I remember there was a close-up he was like lying down I was like this is so fake well I mean right there you can tell it looks like shit this is it's hard to tell like I remember watching on TV going what what is this that looks bad stringy sideburns burned down dusted his face with some very looks like it's like when I when I was that you know that's like one like a kid in junior high is trying to get facial hair for the first time he's got a stiver accentuates yeah I've been thinking of rocking a police most - fuck you no way yeah really you got to get a bushy one though it's got to be bullshit you gotta get real voice that one yeah how about one like Mike Beltran roll up the fucking the hairs grow long you got to get like Wolford Brimley you know you got you know Mike Beltran as you know I'm talking about now he's the top MMA referees oh oh oh oh oh oh I've seen that dude his mustache comes down yeah it's like Cinderella's hair yeah he's got like yeah yeah handlebars no handlebars big ol jack dude - it's crazy ass mustache you would you you wouldn't fucking do a mustache maybe I'll do one like that there's Mike Beltran look at that shit yeah it's not to grow that mustache for decades I know but how long does it take to grow a mustache like that forever but braiding it kind of I mean dude come on get an extension added to it so you could Scott Anton shit I wouldn't lie like that [Music] your weave your fucking mustache weave yeah maybe someone's done that I would imagine maybe or something like that oh yeah the mustache weave this it's a look right but at a certain point in time would imagine you become like prisoner to that look yeah the - you are then forever yeah I got like like I've had a beard for as long as I can remember and so now if I shave it I'm fucked you can't I can't shave this it's kind of strange that I could never get away from it now this is it I didn't think about he brought it up you've never seen me without a beard Rhys cat this is the I remember planting a band with this guy and I'm pretty sure part of this you played the band with this case this is the bus Damon not in his band but my band played with them we all know that for this as a singer for Mudvayne part of it is not real but part of it is really you guys have a really long one but I remember seeing it up close to like it was like a rope or something like god damn it's crazy how long you can grow a fucking beard yeah that's absurd that exists like why does hair on the head grow so long well his hair and the face grow to those lengths it doesn't seem like it'd be useful well why would nature do that yeah why would we need it because like arm hair doesn't grow that long it doesn't need to anymore right but why does beard hair grow long and arm hair stops well I think I think it's probably cuz uh-oh and that weird though well that's like you know you know you know the crown of the head hair you know this head hair here like yes this will never ever fall out it's it's but genetically biologically mmm the hairs will never fall out on this crime that's right when you see someone anybody says complete balls still here we'll have harem right here you have to have hair right here though forever is weird like what I understand it's like why can the hair on your head grow so long and the hair of your beard grow so long but your arm hair and leg hair is always the same way but your pubes can get rather unruly just but Jamie starts to trim your fucking filthy cunt your boobs can get your not up your um your pubes get out of control Jamie I will should I say atrocious the atrocious like it's fucking repulsive different kind of hair yeah it's like you bears yes yes it's court it's angry yeah angry it's like protective it's like you know what it is you from filthy pussy it's imagine there's a reason for is there a reason why pube hairs were so thick Google that what could that fucking be why is it so weird I was thinking it's like the the thick shield around a wild boars face before it comes up as why is it curly it wasn't straight damn he went down and she had her pussy hair was like a wig what is this crazy has it parted you like what is happening here I left I left hair parted pussy it's braided Beltran's beard this is dumb pick they used to describe this it says that it helps prevent friction both bringing the coarser and thicker and all this and not the way I fuck what does that even mean friction have you trying to start a fucking skin very like so you don't get like this yeah but how much hair is on your cock or both people both hairs it's like bribe bribe and villains each other I suppose that's funny it just sticks we're on everyone meth and viagra and you were in the desert do you think you'd start a fire fuck so hard you start a fire oh no no water in the air yeah you're fucked yeah you're starting a fire if you're rubbing hard it out you're on mass fucking whoa I think I think that's I think that's better than a stick rolling yeah yeah the bow the bow way have you ever started a fire like that I've had to try at a camp at a summer camp we had to do this one we had to do a bow one and then we had to do the wiggle one with your fingers what's this what the flow of Flint oh yeah Flint snap that is the much more likely one yeah that happens yeah but this shit this bullshit is so fucking hard it's hard so hard I got to the morale down it was burnt like it was black like it looked like it wasn't I smelled it I was pretty close but I think I did it I don't know when I did it but I'm pretty sure I was like preteens yeah when you first start those things I think I was boy scouts when I was doing that you do Boy Scouts I did boys for how long one year how long do you do do Boy Scouts yeah how long you seem like a long tour yeah I didn't make it to we blow whatever those fellows like that we're strong enough huh dude I got fucking kidnapped almost by these criminals these little kids I went to I went to Boy Scouts in Jamaica Plain Boston Jamaica Plain is like a suburb of boss and not really suburb it's part of the city isn't there one in New York a plane Jamaica Queens Jamaica Queens that's right Jamaica Plain in Boston is uh it's more gentrified now like them white people are spreading out and there was white people there everywhere when I lived there too but they were like angry Irish people who will punch in the face I wasn't used to being around people like that I lived in San Francisco and then I lived in Florida and then all sudden I lived with these uh like really wild people man what was my point would who are we just talking about that led me this about your makeup what about what for that about why you're talking about the angry Boston beer what was it a lot the we've made many questions and I can remember what it was I got a point I have a significant point completely lost we were good so we were talking about angry people fire filling a fire pit Boy Scouts oh so I went to camp with these fucking kids that lived in this really tough neighborhood and there was a lot of Puerto Rican kids and a lot of town kids and there was Irish kids there's all ethnicities but it was basically like low income people it was the first time I was ever around kids that were like legitimately dangerous like when I lived in Florida we were around like alligators and shit and we used to go into the swamps who'd find snapping turtles I lived there for a couple of years yeah but it didn't seem dangerous in terms like the kids that I was interacting with right then all of a sudden I was in Jamaica Plain and they were dangerous kids tough ass kid there were tough ass kids and I didn't know I'd never had sex and I didn't know like what way a penis goes in I didn't know it goes up I mean we consider kid name was pauly Hudson he lived right next to me shamed me he goes you probably don't even know that our dick goes up in a pussy oh he's right I was like he does happen I was like really I was trying to like figure out how that would work I was like oh I guess I wasn't 11 I was thirteen thirteen was one a little bit Boston but I was like what okay I goes up Wow you could have said that nicer I was like hey did you know did you know you will get all kid that I had ever encountered probably would have said hey did you know then when you have sex it doesn't go straight in because when you think about having sex you would think your penis would go straight forward yeah you think your dick goes like this like that you never think you would go up you're like oh of course how it why else would boners be like that right wouldn't make sense to do it you'd have to hold them down to get them into the proper position now anyway I went to fucking Boy Scout camp with these criminals and dude the first night the first night they tied this kid up and they he was sleeping he was soundly asleep and he was a little annoying but they either way they tied this is on his Betty a little cot and they dragged him into the woods and it was dark as fuck it was New Hampshire woods see anything no lights there was no moon out so I mean you couldn't see your fucking hand in front of your face it was never experienced that before and that was thirteen yeah well all my life as a person I had never been in a place where I couldn't see my hand I was outside going this is insane cuz we were like this Boy Scout camp was by a lake way the fuck up in New Hampshire and once I seen their shitty criminal kids and they bring them out to the forest and they leave him there and then they came for me man but I woke up and I was like fuck you fuck you fuck you they took this other guy like they left me alone I just did I gave up on all the activities I was awake when I heard that kids like mumble and shit and I saw them carry the whales like these guys just rapping this guy down to a cop with fuck Jim what were they have no remember they did something I do not remember remember the other kid they put toothpaste all over his clothes apparently when you put toothpaste like toothpaste does not wash out good especially in 19 whatever the fuck it was it was like 13 SATs 99 246 79 I think yes a 80 79 80 81 I was 14 yeah so it's that age 80 ish and they're like these little fucking crumbs I was at the woods with these kids and we had bows and arrows of 22 rifles you would hear ricochets man we would be we would be over by the lake because me and this other kid who was also this kid we called him onion is a story we called an onion man but this is other kid who decided to skip out or no one cared if you were engaging in all their activity no one cared right and literally I'm telling you no one was watching us I was 30 we just grabbed fishing rods and we went where the lake was we knew where the lake was like all these kids would get get in there I'll do an archery and rifle practice and you're hanging out there with a bobber and the water in here they let these fucking kids have twenty-twos UND and it was the it's a weird noise like when you think of a gun you think of a boom yeah 22 is like it's a crack crack that's it it doesn't feel like it would hurt it sounds like a whip yes it's not it's not as threatening as the actual action of getting hit by a bullet yeah you sound like what it is people kill people with 22s 22 a fucking kill you but it just seemed you know like you can't be around these kids I am were you happy that you did Boy Scouts or not was a fun for you one year nobody did anything to me nobody molested me I feel like I got off flight you got molested Jana no no I was 4 years Catholic school bro that's what that was years later yeah you you know what though I was thinking about that you know I went to Catholic school when I was a kid kid and then never again I never got molested I was think that maybe I wasn't cute enough for something like that was that why don't worry I just line something up online where I'm from in Columbus some lists just got released of a bunch of priests that either that have been either accused and found out that whatever was happened some are still alive some art oh I looked through the list and found someone that was a priest at my school you know yeah I don't know that any no nobody I know said they've been touching me like that but like bloom I blew all of our minds like holy shit gross that shit is fucking grody is it's one of the weirdest things you could just connect a thing that's a horrific act to a church look that's one thing you just can do yeah the Catholic Church Catholic priests pedophile you could just say that I mean those that's peanut butter and jelly bro Yeah right how crazy is it that the peanut butter to your jelly is fucking kids do you imagine yeah and kids love peanut butter and jelly if you see a jar jelly you think oh if I had some peanut butter and some bread and make a peanut butter jelly sandwich you see a priest you like oh that guy fucks kids he fucks kids it's not weird that's a crazy just trying to teach the word of the Lord man sure you are dude how crazy is that it'll it'll go away at some point no it will not no well not as long as you let those people keep doing what they're doing it will not yeah it's just fucking Pope himself at one point that guy that uh Brad singer in what at one point in his life he was involved in moving people around dude they said he was wanted for crimes against humanity that's so fucked this one there's a documentary that shows that he let these people go let this one guy go rather and moved him to another parish where we molested a hundred deaf kids Wow dude Jesus Christ oh shit it's pure evil it's pure evil and what's most fucked up about it it's evil that's common to people that are looking for God yeah gross right like the people that's why people get mad when you talk shit about the Catholic Church because there's a lot of great people that are ya know not everyone is a shit I know the people that are actually going to the to the good people right right right those people that are good priests they do exist yeah not everyone's bad but the number that are bad a hundred deaths I mean the numbers insane just say did you ever see the documentary hear no evil no or did I speak no evil is it speaking to know which ones that some of my iTunes pull that shit up baby poo - shit up but it's a horrific documentary let's be speak know if it's a horrific deliver us from evil deliver us from evil we have three different titles which one do you like better deliver us from I think they know I think I got it right it's a terrible documentary in terms of the way it makes you feel it makes you feel it's a very good documentary wait takes you feel terrible that reminds me of did you watch the devil we know which ones do we talk about that we talked about that before the devil we know is about 3m and Teflon ooh oh no oh bro watch Teflon is in 99.99% of the world's blood they had to go all the way back to the Korean War to find out Teflon not in someone's blood what effect Teflon Teflon where the devil we know bro watch this fucking guy cover up did you ever Google the devil we know debunked no me neither this but no that's what I always do Oh debunked no well watch this shit it'll give us to believe you some insights heavy - what's really going on I'm better even though I'm not doubting them every time I look at anything like this now mm-hmm i right debunked yeah I put it into just a line down and I find out is there any credible sources sure and I don't necessarily automatically agree with them but are there any credible sources that have any indication to see if there's a balance to it I've just said too many things that are not true well because nothing comes up when I type that in there's a story in the LA Times that comes up variety the devil we know review LA Times says she would be scared of Teflon and this documentary bla bla in this documentary there's a farmer who lives down this down the road from where and this is 40 years ago 50 years ago where 3m was making Teflon right and he was complaining to them well the water source wasn't supposed to be they lied that they put they put their their runoff in his water cows had fucking like blue teeth and shit their eyes would turn different colors dude he was like he kept complaining but they push this they pushed him down like shut the fuck up southern Marco until he went away and then this documentary explores how other people have tried to tell his story but no one gave a shit that Teflon was killing at such a rapid before you before I forget this hold that thought real quick can you please go cuz I keep forgetting this can you please google that water bottles in Target and other stores were found with arsenic no yeah holy shit levels of arsenic on unhealthy levels of arsenic Jaime you're so good at one-hand typing it's fucking absurd wizard bottle water what is the same I can't type with two hands tighter than I do I'm like this I'm like searching pound shit I didn't pop up windows hey fuck off the fuck out of here NBC News don't fuck out of here envy bottled water is this a gym bottled water brand found to have high levels of arsenic cold from stores find bran particularly oh okay here it is penafiel battered bottled water sold at Target and Walmart it's one name Keurig oh oh right Dr Pepper yeah because they're burnished huh the band said pen afine penafiel unflavored mineral spring waters are involved in the market withdrawal they wrote in a statement they're voluntarily pulling the product which is sold at Target moment so maybe like the manufacturer had some fucking weird shit in their water yes high levels of arctan long-term exposure to high level and crease risk for diabetes sure high blood pressure rapid you don't say what's the level of arsenic in it right what does high level mean what would that is it how much is it okay for us to have they're already they're allowed to have ten parts per billion in there and it must have exceeded how much is too much how much would you start off someone's dick hundred pounds per billion every free zero parts per billion just show me a dick bro I mean how much are you willing to snort if you tell me this if you tell me arsenic is not bad for you how much should we snort I'm talking about I'll cut it up with b12 that's fucking insane by the way that there was there was selling she that has high arsenic well they didn't know I mean it just looks like water that's the problem with water it looks like water alright you can get weird shit in water and leave it in a hot car do you know that like your bottles yeah you buy a bottle water you know the fuck happened that Bob for you it's like a adopted dog somebody could have been kicking that thing yeah by the time you get it man it's managed who the fuck knows what's in there in terms of like diseases like you can legitimately have water bottles that leak PCBs they they leak some sort of estrogen mimicking chemical really yeah did you see this shit with Justin Trudeau in the water bottle did you see that tonight it wasn't today I saw it today did you see it earlier Justin Trudeau's asked about how he and his family are doing a better job at not using plastics and his responses so she fucking awful she can't get it out he said well we're using listen this fucking this is made me laugh so hard plastics we were wide it won't abuse at least what you and your family do to cut back on plastics we we have recently switched to drinking water bottles out of water out of when we have water bottles out of a plastic sorry away from plastic towards paper how tired you are now water out of a load you imagine if Apple somebody asked me a question like that about my job imagine if somebody said hey Joe what do you think could be done to stop head trauma and MMA and I'd be like well we could conceivably there's not much but we could pad the elbows we could pad the knees we can I would have a thought I want to fucking thought that shit through didn't think that shit through dope and there's also thinking about getting caught in a lie did it I have everywhere I get home I saw his wife on the blue mow on the way home they're coming for us don't applaud the house there's not a fucking bottle in the house it's all plastic everything's play everything no glass

listen if you find I still Trudeau I'm fine a legit male feminist let me let me talk to him because I've never met one dudes running a scam right say yeah yeah I love women sweeties these non-male sweeties I'm like okay you're trying too hard man something's wrong it's so obvious man there's someone wrote online this guy that was like I was like I'll stand by every woman forever and know that and I was so crazy what are you saying he's gonna stalk you he's gonna stalk you yeah his words sound like a normal person's words but you you just have to have a deep vocabulary of crazy that is only that word those combination of words in that circumstance only exist from the mind of a crazy man yes normal people don't fucking say that you know nope no no no sir no it's super important to tell those guys no no that's why this whole insel thing you know what insult yes what to do what to do what to do what did you no one wants to fuck him what do you do what do you do get your shit together okay I went through a six-month dry spell when I was 19 and the first time I had sex with a girl after that I came immediately it was depressing I stuck in LA likes it was sad I smelled like desperation okay I had very little interaction with regular people all I was doing was doing martial arts and training I was meeting girls I was meeting zero girl and when I got together with the girls I panicked used jerk as a feverish lazy night um I don't remember jerking off feverishly and I was NH I went through a really fucked up time I was when I was a young teenager where I thought that my desire for sex was a weakness and that I should I should avoid it who put that in your head what Pinole would no one put that in my head I put it in my head because I was trying to figure out how to get better at martial arts yeah but something had to help that no nothing negativity nothing help that knows my is pleasure this is a desire for pleasure was a weakness Wow what the fuck yeah lack no it wasn't because it was recognizing that like real pleasure the only pleasure that I had gotten up to that point was satisfaction in being good at competition yeah I started being good at competition I realize okay what is this is better than anything so how do I get successful again well one thing you can't do is get wrapped up in anything stupid and you have to stay mentally strong it's like why do you want pleasure I feel good I felt weak I felt like that was a weak thing to want that's a lot of good foresight because most kids at that age that our testosterone levels through the fucking roof are like I want to get good at this thing but also oh my god I want to fuck everything that walks it was also pride it had to be flavored by the puritanical shit that I was gonna say there has to be some dark to that but not I don't think so man because before that I was really into it once I started fighting it was like I it was two days also so dangerous but I was always worried about doing something wrong and getting hit and then maybe if I'd lived my life correctly I wouldn't have gotten hit so I saw a lot of guys get kicked in the face man how many times you been kicked in the head oh I have no idea zero idea a lot a bunch of times for sure Conchita yeah I don't know never unconscious from that never unconscious from anything dropped from a punch in a fight I got I got a tko'ed I got dropped him I was like he hit me in the jaw in my lip it didn't hurt per se it wasn't like like sometimes you get hit in the body like a liver shot it fucking hurts so bad it doesn't matter if you're in the middle of a fight it hurts so bad but the jaw didn't hurt but my legs just stopped working like the wind we they just stopped they just shut off and they went out from under me it was crazy I don't think I never had it happen that way before I definitely been dinged where I like wobbled yeah I like covered up and recovered and had that happened before but I never had it where I just my shit just shut off let's just shut off dude but I was still conscious and that I was trying to get up and I was fucking point the point they just didn't work and then he hit me a couple more times and I fell again the referee stopped the fight so that was the worst I've never been hit in the head nah but you never enjoyed it out from a girl I was always scared of it you've been knocked out though no never been never once no shit no how many can how many concussions do you have you think on record I don't know I have three I have three I know I think two to one when I was a kid I think I I know I cracked my head cuz I have a giant scar back there above my hair transplant scar where I cracked my head on this cement sewer thing there was like some crane we were kids we were running past this thing and something happened I don't remember exactly happened but it involve falling and something slipping and something hitting me in the head and it hit me in the head pretty fucking hard or I didn't go unconscious but the whole world went like yeah I remember I remember saying to the doctor that I grayed out like a grade out but then I came back like son it was a big impact on my head so was that time then the time that I got tko'ed but then the other times in between it was mostly just getting dinged we just popped and your legs give out a little bit then you cover up and then you know usually like it's inspiring you'll stop and it's if it's in a fight you get a you know you either you fall down or you get a standing eight count you know depending on if you're boxing or kickboxing right doing but in the gym you just fight gym guys get dinged and they go down and nobody does anything to stop it and you get back up and you're getting hit again like you really probably probably should stop the sparring but people are you know guys are fucking and animals and all the moles and in in a boxing gym when you're allowed to indulge in that sort of animal behave here it gets encouraged especially amongst really good guys right I had my fucking knees taken out from under me that's why I had my first concussion and when he told me about that basketball right yeah my neck well on my fucking hardwood basketball floor and I remember vividly to play two moments one people telling me to sit down because your natural reaction sometimes when you get knocked out like that the bounce off your head is to get back up you know and I could so but I was unconsciously doing it and then I remember that and then I remember the paramedics asked asking me to lie down and I remember saying I'm gonna throw up and I did I threw up everywhere and passed out and woke up in the hospital I fell on my fucking hair back and then in fucking junior high I got popped so hard in football I got hit so hard my dad was like you got your bell rung I was listening to yeah work those listened to Bo Jackson he's on the meat eater podcast this week he was saying he wouldn't have his kids play football yeah not crazy that guy lived through hell he has a hilarious crazy story first of his life but about getting the one time he got Kayode in a game waking up and going to the wrong side and they say hey motherfucker you're on the wrong side like and then he goes over there and then he hears a gunshot and people sees people ridings like who got shot he goes it's halftime he thought he was playing the wrong team he has a hilarious story but it's also kind of dark man like he's talked about how crazy wasn't his childhood too but um did you see that documentary about him where he could shoot bow and arrow with his foot can he really do you not see that bring luck you could show that shown that he was saying he got a shoulder replaced this motherfucker is from an athlete to a degree that's creepy I keep module sports door sport ass dual sport athletes pee everyone thinks they could almost no one really can't play both sports no he was incredible he was unbelievably talented but yeah there was documentary he's living in the woods he was fucking he could shoes he talked to him what was I talking about he could shoot a bull's eye from a hundred yards away with his feet thank you that's what I'm talking about I don't know that there's a video of it they must have a photo or some shit up there that's a fucking this not well but on the documentary up to the 69 minute mark of his 34 30 yeah it was a 34 that's what was all talking about him though I had one heater telling a great story a meteor what was it about knocked down knocking wrong side yeah yeah about how he wouldn't have his kids play foot place ports right that's why football just football Wow Wow I mean football is so dangerous dude I've lost it yeah it's it's insanely danger it's beautiful but fuck me it's dangerous I mean it's so bad well that's that same thing they found in hockey the hits are harder than the fights people scared about the fights the hits caused more concussions oh for sure far well soccer players have problems because they get smoked and they call it a non concussive brain trauma the the goalie that just won like Player of the Year Robin Lerner is his name I guess he gave a really good speech about his mental health issues he's been dealing with and while he accepted his award for validity I can't find that oh wow keep happened this is a bunch yeah it just happened last week you saw my mother's openness to it to the whole crowd well pretty good moment listen Matt helps right it just is it is not a good thing to be involved with you know head trauma if you can avoid it in life it could possibly happen to you no matter what you do I mean anybody can have a head trauma it could be an accident but if you can find a way to avoid it you probably should but in these sports you can't no you cannot so you got to decide whether or not you want to take that risk I'm not ashamed to say I'm mentally ill but that doesn't mean mentally weak that's a fucking dope line vitalist that is a dope lon cuz I have mental illness you do you bitch get it together give it to a mental doctor I can't to illness you have a vitamin for you what is it cocaine that's what's fucked me up by GAD as a co Ganic thanks man so we're going off now full circle imagine if you were like a slightly overweight person who might might be burped more on the feminine side bert and get really mad at me like their birth no Hubbard we're not talking about birth you said fat guy that's a post Eve doesn't exist love Ebert I got someone that doesn't exist if I was an overweight person who was a sensitive super sensitive would you just choose that moment to be a victim yeah would you how would you say that would you say you cruel Joe why because you don't respect people like me struggle what did you do what did I say you know what you said you Pig well that's a fucking alpha male you can't honey can you say that you just I just said something gonna tell me Jaime what did I say you hear what I said Pig you don't even tell them what I said called him a bitch or having my own bitch mother aren't there some bitches though right okay a lot of people have enough mental illness and it's legit this is a few bitches that are faking it they're just bitches Wow you can't say that how come you can't say that because you know it's true it's not everyone yeah but why look there's some people that are just full of shit you tell amazed anything like right every bullshit all the grifters the world some aren't gonna claim depressed come on they pretend to be heirs they pretend to be dukes and they're not gonna pretend to be depressed as ridiculous that guy is called a bitch it means he's to make what's called a bitch it means she's too aggressive do any of us have any idea what this word even means I that was so good that tweet was so good I wish I wrote it cuz that that point is so good yeah I'm glad she put it on Twitter so no one could steal it it's almost like that idea like that idea is like very poignant like that yeah what is that fucking work you know like pussy can be great but it can also be weak but a pussy can give birth I mean it goddamn bowling ball comes out of that thing pussies are always strong 10-pound babies come out of a pussy imagine a 10-pound baby coming out of your dick and then respect that thing I'm saying I mean dicks will have more privacy be weak it's more like compliant but it's not weak like it's also desirable pussy's not desirable it's a man when I gotta sit of desirable if a guy tells you a pussy what's the first thought if something Lucy oh really yeah oh really really yeah yeah right so what do when a when a when a guy calls another guy a pussy is a cheap insult meaning what well sometimes you ready to fight you just want to provoke this guy so pussies the word counter-puncher so what you're calling a guy a great sexual object fuckin nice thing I want to foxy just letting them know we're getting about to get down nice thing I want to fuck all the time get over here if you watch guys fight half of half of it is talking shit to each other before you get down you just yeah instigate the fight there's a well it's also it's not just instigating you're getting someone scared you make it southerner you're trying to sell your confidence level versus there yeah who's got the most you know you can get someone nervous though if you can legitimately knows you can decrease their performance by a significant margin for sure it gets in there scare him yeah you could scare someone I could be really ready to go but you have to be really ready to go yeah but everybody here could try to scare someone they took a swing at you Tyson talks about it every so many competitors talk to only when they would see him they get nervous horse so that we get scared and they'd fight worse because they get scared 100% everybody um you see that guy you're like he didn't have to talk much he let all his performances talk you know and he the most scary thing he ever said the scariest thing you ever said was we talk how dare they threatened me how dare these mere mortals yeah well I know their primitive skills is it crazy that he has such a feminine voice he's the masculine dude my favorite boxer of all time to watch he fucks everybody up cuz the moments when he would fight would not just be I I don't want to say he's like the best boxer of all time who is it see the Floyd Mayweather or roar Jones jr. in his prime it's how you your time war Sugar Ray Leonard or Sugar Ray Robinson or Roberto Duran that's means there's arguments or Muhammad Ali who is a lot of boxing guys say Sugar Ray Robinson because he had so many fights and he was so successful and he fought all the time and he fought the hardest of men and a hard hard time right there were different people but I say if you had to make Sugar Ray Robinson fight Floyd Mayweather foot man with a box I'm in their prime he would box a mom I think I think Flo would box this is the argument of every sport ever right every so whatever who's the best I know there is none I don't think impossible I don't think he would be technically at the level he was ferocious he was a vicious knockout puncher he threw a double left hook like it was nobody's business but Floyd Mayweather had a way of making guys look like they didn't belong with them oh yeah the way did it to Cannella all the way did to pack yeah the way he did it to McGregor Gregor was well a skillful master I went to that fight in Vegas yeah I went to that fight for chauffeur cuz the show time and I've gotta tell you Floyd Mayweather look like he was fighting a guy who's never fought even though you know he's fought a ton it's just he was the balance was way different he's a master yeah he's a magician too master he makes it look simple that's what is disgusting anybody that good it looks when people used to watch the Jordan you'd be like that looks fake he's a true he was just so brilliant and smooth and easy and simple and you know yeah it's a beautiful magic trick to make you think it's easy it's fucking impossible what he does Sugar Ray Robinson was a motherfucker don't get me wrong I just don't think he ever faced anybody like Floyd because no one liked Floyd existed back then because no one liked Floyd could exist unless a guy like Sugar Ray Robinson existed first right so Sugar Ray Robinson had to exist Roberto Duran had to exist Sugar Ray Leonard how to exist Milton McCrory had to exist Donald curry had exist all these killers had to exist and that way a guy like Floyd Mayweather who was at the tip he figured it all out he saw it through see Robinson was a bad motherfucker dude he killed a lot of guys but he they stood in front of each other back then like look how these guys are fighting they're standing in front of him and he's and he's marking a man I think he was ahead of his time in a lot of ways but he lost to Jake LaMotta and here's my position although it may be a controversial one I cannot envision a world with Jake LaMotta out boxes Floyd Mayweather I just don't see that happening but right now you can't control I mean you can't compare eras like you can't you rise too hard you can't it's too hard you can't so it's like the same way we can't do with comedians like if anybody ever asked me I always say that Lenny Bruce is probably the greatest of all time because he was the first he was the guy whooping the door he was the guy who did the weird shit that we would that we do well we say ridiculous like we've done on his podcast right we say ridiculous shit and and and make it funny and at some times at least sometimes it has a point to it and it makes you reconsider but like we here you're watching Ray Robinson and and Jake LaMotta if Jake LaMotta stood like that in front of Floyd Mayweather Floyd maybe they would still be hitting them his 1946 he would still be punching him I just I think Ray Robinson was the best of his era for sure and here's an amazing amazing boxer but fuck but I mean a lot of boxing guys like you don't know shit about boxing you're right I don't in comparison to what I know about MMA I know he was amazing oh no he's a like the Jean foamer knockout the the the Jake LaMotta rematch me and tied up against the ropes and you just beat his fucking brains out the way wait he he lost to Billy Conn he was beating Billy calm but he got from heat exhaustion I think he and Billy Conn was a light heavyweight here's a bad motherfucker dude he was a bad motherfucker yeah I just wouldn't you I just don't think you can compare hoist Gracie to Robert Whittaker I think they're different animals you know I'm saying Whitaker is the current middleweight champion to hoist grace who won the you have seen UFC 1 he won in UFC 1 because Robert Whittaker of 2019 wasn't there yeah but how many how many years ago is UFC 1 was a long time so did not even then nothing compared to that that was the 40s man right that's what I mean exponentially even more different wait way different I mean the technology alone has improved so much in the way we've trained how to fight or train how to play sports it's did you watch Roy Jones jr. in his prime I mean I saw him fight dude yeah dude Roy Jones jr. when he was in his prime did things that even Robinson didn't do he would put his hands behind his back right and kale with one punch right and you like what set a bait he would hit guys and it would look like it was an impossible match up like Vinny Pazienza fought Sugar Ray or excuse me fart Roy Jones jr. and Roy Jones jr. went a full round without getting hit by a punch Jeff crazy that is almost impossible in a world championship level against a guy who in Vinny Pazienza was a multiple time world champion does that happen today no no way he was on and he couldn't he couldn't maintain it he didn't maintain it you know but you can only maintain that for so long that's a shooting star right that's a bad company song son right look at this this is Roy Jones chair I don't know look at that look at that look at that that's James Toney by the way that he did that too dude Roy Jones jr. was on another planet son but you know called for the stoppage when he started fucking up Vinny Pazienza our mouth dude I'm telling you this was like one of the beatings of all beating you see a guy who's at this time probably the best ever look at that combination son look at that combination with the rest of the referee rescues him when Roy Jones June was at his prime everybody's like yeah but the guys he fought they weren't that good bullshit he was better than anybody he was so good he was on such another level that he made world-class fighters look like they weren't that good bro he outbox Bernard Hopkins back then you know I mean he was on a fucking Bernard Hopkins as hard as luck by the way Bernard Hopkins who didn't have a the same sort of dynamic explosive style Bernard Hopkins was a much more solid fundamental guy you know was a different kind of style and Bernard Hopkins wound up beating Roy as Roy was on the way downhill look at him he tells you Scott yeah shit outstanding right in front of him pink play basketball games like full games little fight later that day naked dude I'm telling you you had a seat he was almost bored for a couple years because there was a couple years where Roy Jones jr. was it was just a show nas put him as in a song yeah he said the the new Mike Tyson is Roy Jones but hold on you just missed the greatest one of all time go back to that one back it up watch this watch this punk ko pans mine is bad he's not even there him behind his back John Ruiz now this is the fight that fucked him up this is why he went all the way up to heavyweight to fight John Ruiz and he got to like 200 pounds if you look at him he's pretty stout then he's next fire then his next fight look at that come on son but his next fight he had to fight Antonio Tarver and Tarver is a legit world-class light heavyweight and and boy just didn't look the same it didn't look the same dropping all that weight coming back from heavy weight to fight Tarver and Harvard knocked him out what's the weight difference that he went down to 25 pounds that's a lot of fucking fucking a lot of fucking sway a lot of especially when you're that high up not only that let's let's be just real here let's be real here there's not a lot of ways where a man is 30s gains 25 pounds supplements yeah in my head in my arm yeah dude Tarvin you know what's a Tarver said you got these juices tonight Roy that's he said to him yeah when they were facing each other but if you look at Roy in his fight he just does not look as good it just did not look as good he was more smooth he didn't look as muscular and Tarver was a real problem man Harvard's a dangerous guy see Roy when you're losing that much weight to get down for 200 pounds you're fuckin depleted man I don't care what anybody says yeah for him to take that fight if he's gonna do it smart he should have been fuckin marathon running for like a year or something to try just try to lose that weight but to try to lose 25 pounds of muscle in just a few months time bunk that's it right there that was the left hand that knocked him out and Tarver was a world-class motherfucker back then Tarver mighty knocked him out even if they did fight without any problem but Roy for sure had a problem we had a real hard time making that weight and Tarver was Harper's legit as they come where's-where's now right John Harvard still fighting and Roy Jones jr. just retired Harve is a heavyweight now yeah yeah yeah he took some time off cuz he got caught with ed ped he got caught with some shit something happen even Roy Jones just retired huh yes thankfully but he was willing to come out of retirement for Michael B Jordan what who was saying that he could box with them because of the movie Creed Oh movie the fuck out air and Roy was like legitimately trying to set it up why why for publicity show he was like I'm gonna fuck this dude up make a lot of money and beat the shit out of him what the fuck Michael B Jordan but he was apparently he was really genuinely trying to set it up we made a video where I was telling Michael B Jordan please I don't care who's talking to you listen to me do not do this yet who would not do this I'm not - and your career you have no idea how bad that guy's gonna light you on fire he's gonna light you on fire in his worst days and he's gonna did you see when it was a joke but Justin Bieber said he wanted to fight Tigers Dana White said one set it up know why it was joke um but like the internet ran with it yeah and you know what I would love to see that that's why he did it cuz he knows people API people would pay money that's hilarious I'd watch the fuck out of that but you wouldn't watch that fight Tom Cruise was like a high school wrestling state champion yes so like yeah yes pictures of that person so why would you want to watch that he's 85 years old his ankle doing a movie dope and he believes in warlocks I want to see him fight a fucking weirdo he had super small - yeah how that would like it wouldn't be a super interesting mmm I meant Justin Bieber when he's a young fella came to the UFC I've worked with him young we did fucking Punk for that kid it was so II when he was 16 out of 17 no no listen man that ain't a way to do it but if you're gonna do it he's handled as good as any yeah it's not that's not a way to grow up it's a terrible way to grow up but anybody says there they would handle that differently they don't they don't know what the fuck you're talking about pretty fuckin good job I think what would help him for like legitimately help him is a real struggle like jiu-jitsu I get in the real martial arts I don't know if he's into it well that's what I'm saying I think he's fighting cuz he's training now is it I think he offered up a fight because he's learning how to train hard - people talking shit look at look at look at a Wiz Khalifa when we do Jesus Jack was a super jacked super nice guy but I'm saying he used to be thin and now he's I fucked out I'm gonna Jack out did you see the box I did with him we talked about it yeah he just really got into it you got you yes you guys got big dis fuck not as baked as I did would be real that's the highest I've ever been in any real slated for so we were barbecued we were barbecued already and then we're like when we get in the car then we'll get a really small come on No dude he doesn't show so he does a show about putting like weed and food on Vice yeah and those motherfuckers eat endless a mouse get weed on camera that's all they do all day they smoke joints waiting to eat the weed food I was like this dude is legit be real he said yet he didn't even flinch I tapped two minutes into the car ride and we're not in a car

the other bullshit that's actually that's fun and new well it's fun for sure look at me think about if you can have some dude showing up at garage sales trying to get the best deal you can't have Action Bronson scream with his homies getting blasted come on bro yeah hilarious big body best right dude look at his headset got that Tommy Tommy Chong joints right here folks look at look at look at

fat one but not like that motherfucker this is ridiculous unless is the Tommy Tong joint dropped down to that size you're never gonna smile no I'm gonna keep it forever he's a legend Tommy Chong is a legend I used to listen to his albums when I was a kid man for me to just even be on a podcast with him was surreal I just didn't want to waste his time I just wanted to like be nice to him he's not weird that for another big for him though do you his neck while doesn't that make you feel type of way where you're like be I'm here older student he's like dude I love your shit I'm happy and I'm happy that Tommy Chong likes me because I love him and Cheech was a kid man yeah those guys were heroes you know like they were ridiculous they made everything fun they were silly yeah everything was off they were getting high and it was silly and I don't even get high when I loved them when I loved when I was watching their movies and I was a kid like up and smoke what year was that cuz up 78 77 say ok and find that out and then find out what year big bamboo came out cuz big bamboo was the album that looked like rolling papers right and they had a paper in there didn't that yeah I think so I think there was a giant piece but they did write 78 was right 78 and then wait in it and then and then in that album they they would later put an actual piece of rolling paper in there well the record sleeve was a rolling usable rolling papers right giganta's way bigger than that promoting illegal drugs marijuana was a full-on Schedule one drug schedule one scheduled 172 was big bamboo oh wow a big bamboo was before ok so I was yeah yeah yeah there it is and there's the fucking rolling paper I was 5 years old look I was born in 67 this was 72 so that's the rolling paper wow they have a real one look at the fucking inside cover the picture the two of them that is crazy positing is that picture yeah picture that's crazy before they were together and that improv group he was in when they were really young like oh right before that right that's crazy is that what that's from it's right before that now if I could find the engine these guys are still doing shows still selling out here's the thing Santino and Rogan in 2000 84 overdog gonna be taking our vitamins man can you believe that that's that that is powerful to have that kind of that long-term of effect of being talented and producing good shit funny cool for years and years they still have fans me think about if you have fans from 72 to 2009 Kapow name somebody else s like that who's killing it like that right who would be from that era that's still doing what they do in the comedy well would have been Bill Cosby if he didn't have a few what he tips what did you have wrong but I mean someone was tweeting from Bill Cosby's account about father who's his wife apparently right isn't that what it was somebody said on the internet his wife goes real men right care of their families and they imagine generally they rape bags looking at your computer going yeah this is a good one it's a good idea to put yeah definitely definitely a good idea to stay relevant yeah not a good idea it's one bad rep in prison I mean how many rapes do you have to have people forget how many rapes does it take to get the center of a jail cell what do you got it's so strange that when I was a kid he was the cleanest friendliest like family guy he was Fat Albert he was jell-o pudding he was like this super sweet nice guy clean-cut clean-cut and that's the same thing with like to talk about like the male feminists that there's guys that want women to do great because it's just kind they want everybody to do great you know I'm talking about yeah then these guys are just weasels right yes it must be similar those clean-cut guys there's really pushing you to not use such language I would say that those guys are almost always fucked up of course something's up something's up well you what do you give a fuck about people using certain words yeah well not know what a word is a word is a vehicle for conveying intent some of them disturb you what just what's going on behind your fucking screens bro all right what's happening in there one point when you when you deprive people of things good God do they want it more and when they show signs of depravity that means they that's something deep inside of them do you think that everyone who's like squeaky cleans a pervert well of some semblance yeah yeah yes of course when you preach when you preach the perfection what does that really mean someone's wrong dude are you telling me how to be perfect why you telling me how to fucking stop doing heroin are you are you Duncan told me this about the Dali Lama hilarious story that he's going on Lama says it his mother wants him to quit doing sugar and he says come back in one month so it comes back in one month and he goes stop doing sugar and the mother's like well why did you wait a month he goes I want to see if I could do it it's so poignant like oh yeah he should right yeah there's a lot of people telling you that's why I'll respect women just respect I mean like I just got done scream as an African fridge and can't a fuck is trying huge my Twitter here fucking bitch fucking bitch and then it's like women are goddesses do they must be respected dude those who throw stones always live in a glass house they always do it that's the first person to throw something is the first person that's like what's really going on with you hey by the way by the way by the way by the way you see Louie at skank fest yeah what a response interesting our boy Tim Dylan tweeted about it and people went after him he tweeted best moment of my year or something like that you know what someone said to me people lost it he said fucking loved him Dylan someone said that you know hey fuck you Joe Rogan's he sexually assaulted women like man that's I understand that people are upset about what he did but he did not sexually assault women and to say that the one the one err the one group of people that it really fucks his people have been actually sexually assaulted yes well sure it's not what he does not good but when a guy says can I jerk off in front of you and you say yes and he does it it is a big big demonstrating that and sexual assault and contrary to popular opinion and how many people really know the story and again not saying what he did was good we did was definitely not good when people said no he didn't do it it's not like he made people do it at the right and say yes he asked questions and a lot of people don't know this I'm not does not and I saw an article in one of these papers it was saying that he's changing his story like he's not changing his story but he said was their stories are true but in their stories he I don't think he wanted to defend every single aspect of it but as far as I know he didn't no one said no when they did it anyway that's what I've that's all I've ever heard and Sarah Silverman talked about how he would ask her and she would say yes and he would do and sometimes she would say no right sometimes I want to see a jerk-off stop right but he's a freak okay he's a weirdo this is genius comic and I don't think he's as bad as people want to believe he is I think he made mistakes like a human and I don't you know I don't think it was good and again I don't think he's happy about it at all and by everything that's a giant understatement but when does it end like that's why is he allowed to perform when is he allowed to perform for people who forgive him when when is he allowed to perform and I don't know the conversation comes to a point where it's not like you're endorsing terrible behavior but you are saying at a certain point in time you got to give someone a way out because if you don't then they start to recognize what you are right okay and you're kind of a tyrant and you're kind of saying you don't believe in forgiveness you don't believe in improvement you don't believe in anybody ever getting past a bad deed that they did and I think I guess a human who's a kind try to be a kind person try to be a fair person you know you got a you got to let people grow and move past mistakes I don't know when it is I don't know what someone has to say in order to get you to forgive it but the fact that people do well on it and unless it's someone unless you and him have a personal thing and you want to talk to him about it he should sir and I don't know if he has I don't know if he's done any of that stuff but I think as a culture we are way too quick not just to condemn but to attack and to continue to attack relentlessly and to never want someone to get up and that's not the sign of a compassionate person and maybe it's partly to blame for people who don't express themselves and don't give you a full version of who they are and you let people contemplate who you are I think anyone in the public eye has been guilty that to some extent but this is a significant issue and I think that people immediately start taking sides and they start going girl versus boy right male versus female and I think there's real danger and not splitting up like that - I think that we can't get to this place where women feel like they can't trust men and men feel like they can't trust women just universally and then you find rare exceptions I got a red shit like that before like I've read some lady wrote it was so it's kind of sad she wrote like any straight white male is trash unless proven otherwise I know same thing to cast such a big net not just - even all Filipinos have a bad leg but your broad you're broadcasting into your system a thousand followers you know right putting that on your Twitter page it's silly the crazy way you can't encompass an entire group of humans ever ever ever ever it doesn't make sense doesn't make sense so what the fuck are we like look I get where they're coming from you feel like they're gaining ground sure so a guy like louis c.k comes back and they're thinking they connected him with Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby no I don't think it's the same thing and I don't again I don't think what he did was good look I have all dog we have a classic turnoff in front of him when they really don't want it sure sure it's it's not good I'm sorry about that last summer I didn't mean to do no but fucking come on man I I just I just think that like we have classes of crimes you don't know you're not gonna do it in this in this world you know you say they're all the same and then I heard someone OC and someone saying what he did was definitely a crime and I was like come on you might be upset that he did it but it's not a crime it's wrong though it's unfortunate the real problem the real issue is that he was in a position where these girls were admiring him right that's the real tiger I think he should recognize that I don't think he's explained it to some people's what they desire you know some people's requirements and I appreciate that and I understand that I really just think what a lot of us are missing is just a lack of communication and compassion and understanding yeah I think we're missing a lot of that totally and we're real you know we got to really think of people like anytime someone I mean I don't talk about people that are serial killers I'm just talking about people who make mistakes you got to treat there we're all human beings yeah people make mistakes we fuck up doesn't mean you're a cancelled person you got to stop with that I really I really think that right cause I just think that it's not helping anybody and it's getting people's jollies off because they're watched someone crashed down yeah people love to watch someone fucking burn I was also thinking that also when the kind of this kind of stuff happens people don't want to ever reconsider their opinion on a person like there's this thing about Kevin Spacey and the they made the text the available of this guy who Kevin Spacey was touching his dick going back and forth with his girlfriend bro they were laughing about it okay and they're trying to make it seem like this is evidence that they were that he was scared all right and the Kevin Spacey was sexually abusing him they're like oh my God he's gay he's gay he's touching my dick he's gay he's unzipping my pants he's gay this guy was texting his girlfriend while Kevin his asshole he's so gay he's so gay I think he must be gay because I'm fucking in his mouth now bro they should be released Oh text messages but they didn't release some of them and the mother said that she deleted a lot of them that related to his frat boy like behavior what is that probably jokes about getting his dicks that's hilarious yeah no there's some deception going on I think I mean I'm not a obviously I'm not a lawyer but I think I think they're trying to make some money that's what I think that's horseshit yeah I think this 18 year old kids worried about this 800 year old man touching his dick and you flatlined that guy he's pop in the face when you're 18 yeah who punch the fuck out of some 65 year old pervert come in little boy unless he's a small fellow I don't know if he's no idea about his physical stature but if I was 18 some guy was kept grabbing my dick I put him asleep yeah good night the first thing you do at 18 you're like I'm gonna fight you did I'm like you're not gonna fuck me man what is this messages start with the accuser texting like he's hanging around me in the bar he's got my number and asked me to come out with him the girlfriend replies are you kidding and then sends two other messages saying what and then he's it says sounds like he's hitting on you the man types I think he is and then he's grabbing my leg and expletive oh my god you can't say cock and goes away to say I'm not gay adding but I think Spacey is the accuser continued texting saying that he was being touched inappropriately like eight times later adding and then he invited me to his house hey hit pro tip your dick you gotta tell him to stop look at this not once does he say the guy's what the expletive fuck yeah I saw this I saw this have fun too much fun is gonna get to that Jesus Christ you reached out my pants what the fuck is happening have fun but not too much fun if you know what I mean Jesus Christ he reached down my pants help no this is Kevin ducking Spacey the bitch Camus felt she fucked the order up he's gay he's buying me another drink oh my god babe he's gay I think I want to hang this kid is gay yeah what are you talking about why are you the rights that he got autographs and a hell of a story come on man opportunistic hopper maybe it maybe maybes not gay maybe he's just a kid have a good time now a lot of people who get sexually assaulted have time to text okay understand he's he's having fun playing or enjoying the fact that it was Kevin Spacey doing to it to him for sure but it doesn't sound to me in any way like he was threatened his salary let the guy touch him and maybe he should be accused of boob on mr. Spacey did Spacey get a nut does it say that at the end do you think that he was flirting with him a little bit later on keep Kevin Spacey around he thinks it's funny it's fucked up the whole story's fucked up if Kevin Spacey really did do it then it's fucked up that were joking about it yeah and if Kevin Spacey didn't do it then it's fucked up this guy's trying to set him up because he just wants to make money in his room and Kevin Spacey's life yeah but Kevin Spacey's life is already them it's spiral there's a lot of shit dick Robin this was an isolated incident that was one one of many but it's a different thing if you look at that story after you read those texts yo this is a different thing yeah this isn't like he's like trying to force some guy into a bathroom bludgeoned him and falls unconscious they're party to have their partied out having a good time he said they're buying us another drink the guy is hanging around yes like he's not being forced against his will there's no one that's holding him there if you got your dick grabbed once he didn't want it you don't want to happen seven more times look the victim is crying for help yeah and he texts someone he just grabbed my dick did it again it's a it is this is what men have to really truly understand it is so much different when a guy like Kevin Spacey and again I don't know what this guy looked like but I'm gonna see him it was me at 18 right a normal dude who doesn't you know athletic stuff from strong at 18 and I'm not worried about him raping me it's what my point is where as a woman if a guy's doing that and the guys cornered you fear yeah there's fear here there's literally worried this guy could rape you I hope he's not that guy that would rape me the kind of guy right cuz women don't know if you're the kind of guy that would rape them cuz look at Ted Bundy man he was a handsome guy yeah and girls would just go with him because they thought oh he looks good yeah he seems he know he's killing them Yeah right so girls legitimately you have to worry about that work guys don't so even this guy with Kevin Spacey if he didn't like what Kevin Spacey was doing there's no indication that he said it to him right so not in those days he's probably thinking we're gonna party I'm touching this guy's dick he ain't saying shit he's just texted his friends yeah tell your friends when I fuck your mouth tell your friends I want to fuck your friends to bring those mother those guys to bring the whole team fuck all of them he's probably thinking he's gonna have a good time because this guy's not saying anything right he wants to guys texting this never does he say hey I told him to stop touching my dick and he won't leave me alone no doesn't say they said he invited me to his house we're ready to party I had to push him away from me I was gonna fuck him up but I guess he's drunk I'm coming to you baby because I love you know that lol he's jerking me his mouth she says be careful have fun witcha you're out for the night I guess she even told him that being gay is okay she said are you trying to tell me something being gay is okay that's a response I'm not gay lol the first part well that kids not scared okay this idea that he should get money because he was getting sexually assaulted know you're getting hit on and you're all at an establishment that serves drugs the drug that reduces inhibition better than any drug alcohol alcohol and you're accepting this drug from this guy who's already touched dick seven times acknowledging it by the way not this isn't like I didn't know what's happening because I didn't dictating lol his dick is in my ass how dare whoa what was happening do you think the Kevin Spacey should be able to sue him back countersuit for that for defamation of character just for being a bitch yeah yeah like if there was a record of your honor I'm Superman bitch like well you could judge Santino please welcome this case mr. spacey touch this boy's dick over and over again and continue to buy him drinks and the man never said no but detect his girlfriend over and over again and then later on sued mr. Spacey for sexual assault your thoughts young man you're guilty of being a bitch you must serve time as a biatch okay then the question is is there a real issue with him being a teen we're like hey he's legal maybe he's legal but maybe he's like bewildered like he doesn't know what to do is but maybe he's never been around a famous guy like Kevin Spacey before okay doesn't know how to tell a guy to get off of him and doesn't have experience being around gay guys or maybe he's never had a guy try to fuck him yeah but playing into the game the texts all say that he's playing oh he's taught you mean I'm we're gonna but maybe we're gonna hang out with a piece doing this game he's playing again a material you're harassing the witness he could work at the bar someone was he doing at the bar sucking dicks it was a gay bar I was 18 is that a bar I think he worked there there but there's what he lied to Minter's age 93 that was under part of the problem mmm the kid lied and told Sally space years older than he was the plot thickens also there's bars you can go into under-21 I know you can be in there I just saying like what was he doing just hanging out having fun or was he working like well though he did say he's gonna buy us drink I started Mellissa busboy and like he just kept walking by him and he kept grabbing his dick every time people say he worked there I'm looking at I don't see it we don't know keep talking about this this poor fella they didn't want to run into Kevin Spacey and but it was a financial opportunity and he had a capitalized yeah she's gonna happen he's gonna go to jail no fuck no no any money yeah the kid hush money yeah he'll get it how much does he want he'll get it all said that he got him drunk and then sexually assaulted him at that bars what happened he worked there so we said worked there as a busboy okay people written people with wealth always get off yeah like what's her name the USC people Lori Loughlin and it's fucked up man they get off the last season of house of cards nobody gave a fuck about it there right away billboards and everyone was like okay it was a four year consideration what's her name again Robyn right yeah Robyn right she's amazing she's amazing actresses that we've ever had a lot he needed him to play off he was ultimate evil that look was was turning her Maury well they bet there she killed her boyfriend spoiler alert yeah roh-roh and in the move by the way and the show he's doing a lot of gang shit like Hanahan okay well show he does get Library's guys love shit it's a crazy fucking which is why I love to and it was amazing and you needed a dirty crazy fuck like Kevin Spacey to pull that character off for sure look part of you knew he knew what it was to be a crazy fuck it's like part of how he pulled that roll off you bought it okay that's not Ron Howard pretending to be banging dudes and getting his dick sucked and all that stuff best rules he's playing a crazy guy yeah he's crazy yeah always it's also why he's such an amazing artist but that doesn't give him a license to victimize all those people that no went after that workhorse worth it's not not justifying but what I'm saying is it's amazing how someone who is fucked up like that can produce you know like this kind of art where like as an you you like he makes a show right the show a big part of what it was because you bought this guy as this crazy tormented twisted absolutely I mean it was so it was so eloquent at it yes it was unbelievable it would just look it looked so natural oh so real probably cuz it was real right 100% I mean you know how many people in America you say for years if you like Kevin Spacey's gay and the business has known about it and they go you're fucking out of your head you don't know he's gay what how many people in America America we go he's not he's that gay nuts fucking California everything so everybody's good but that's the problem is because there's a perception perception and in the show him playing this character who's also art imitating life balancing on this world of hiding a big secret it was just so close to home it was crazy good show dude so good when she fell in love with that artist and oh so good with them in New York and there's pictures of them together wow this is crazy crazy watch them naked in bed and some great crazy often so you needed them together after they kicked him out like what the damage is too strong when they were together it was amazing and the episode one that I watched you know I'm gonna watch everybody looks super nervous everybody looked it looks like super it just looked what do you mean what do you mean just looked off the show looked off yeah think they knew Jesus Christ I just fired Kevin Spacey now we're gonna watch it not even on camera they're like so we'll just continue this game it was just weird yeah I mean maybe got better as time went on I didn't see it know who I really like too was the his assistant that guy that helped him out that would do anything for him yeah that killed Rachel Brosnahan yeah when you push her in front of a trench no you kidding no no that was him that was Kevin Spacey kills me she pushes my girl from the Train right and that was a guy who went back killed a hooker right now that hooker went on to be the marvelous mrs. Mazal that's right Rachel Rachel Brosnahan that's right yeah yeah that's right she's married oh it's great in that Mazal show yes that is a good fucking show you know Amazon's doing comedy specials now are they did Jim Jim Gaffigan Russell Peters and they're doing some other ones well I'll do one with them I'll do one over there Amazon I'll do one I like it yeah it's cool breaking the mold in the Netflix mold everybody has Amazon Prime dude everybody does well now there's some old foods when you go to hold once you get a good discount on shit that's why I was like but she was like do you

person nice yeah um Amazon yeah maybe I don't and they're the fucking world man content they're doing you buy things like what a weird company you buy stuff with one click you can watch TV shows to make a TV show so you could go buy your groceries when are they gonna open up their town in town where is it where does it go Buffalo they need it they feel in Buffalo please mmm would you go to Amazon town would you live there no you'd be a mess Jamie would you live I had a lot of brown boxes everywhere uses we recycle into everything there changed every dawei like grocery stores have to work now because they have that two-hour delivery like you have to deliver your grocery stores fucking awesome Pete I know but they do that with Whole Foods to write this Whole Foods deliver yes yes we would most grocers we will reach a point now when we don't go into grocery stores that's crazy they'll deliver dude was a kid no grocery stores delivered do you render never I've never heard of that delivery no that didn't exist when did that start they do have the store to worry you walk in and just like feels like you're stealing I usually just leave in a charge your account oh my god you don't get in New York they tested it out people just walk in and you have the app in your phone so when you walk out it registers what you have with you whoa okay it's fucking insane living in the future bro Dawg you will know there will be a point when we don't ever go to those things someone just will give it you get an order every how long will it be before they can replicate food and all you have to do is like put the bare ingredients and amino acids and shit into some VAT and then you print up anything you want rent up 3d print a stake 3d print Apple 3d print I'm hungry for baked tato pizza 3d printed comes out yeah but you know what what it's not gonna taste good you know because food has love and that shit people say that oh you these new cars Moon's no soul okay no the food is different nutrition is different you you can never take you can't take you can you know it's just elements just little things that they figure out how to fuckin move around wiggle I don't know something about there being some management perfect comes out one nice like toasts the crossed your fucking computer imagine just a English muffin dude I don't think so there's no fucking way what if they nail it look they have like the perfect trucker Hall salt Oh char I think yeah there's a touch to that there is a touch the human touch needed a like you I don't I feel like a robot might not be able to give a great massage like you know they say that the oils in your hands are good when you eat with your hands it's right a lot of the world you still eat with their fucking hands right utensils take away 30 people no there weren't people when you're doing your hands have natural enzymes that kill a lot of bacteria or as bro well I'm not wiping my ass with my hands anymore that's why in some countries it's a real insult to try to shake someone's hand with your left hand rights your booty is your booty is your booty hand player yeah bro yeah but you know what I still think there's something about the touch of food when you feel someone touches food it does something to enzymes of food I don't know must be some fucking voodoo bullshit you learn from your straw listen bro you believe in the tides Joe you know there's something about the love of food that fucking I'm gonna go to him you know it's insensitive he's got a good heart yeah he understands enzymes they come from your fingers they doing they're produced in your gut enzymes are progestin things give it a couple weeks in your hands yeah you do and your fingertips yes what kind of enzymes if it makes it that your food is uh what you read this look it up look at how's that real look it up feels like you're talking about like a cast-iron skillet like there's something in your hands that changes the chemical composition of food that changes the flavor profiles in your mouth and and it makes it so you don't get sick yeah that's amazing hands are nice until you don't get sick dirty hands people have this is what you say before you know before we fucking lift up your booty when you eat ass and then how much before we had to know what do you think how do you think their dirty hands they died no they don't die that long there were 30 years old kid here that's coming up I typed in oils and hands you know what's coming up Mike Tyson weed you look at a get Jamie search on Bing bro don't just google it oh you pick a search what was like mister okay search this search this he's I got a peek all right Joseph it's not white P okay search this is a great search search cultures that eat with their hands don't get sick how about that this is great mind your manners eat with your hands no I'm from the same Bowl as it safe like dining etiquette from around the world look dude there's gotta be there's some shit in people's hands that makes them not get sick when they eat what four years we ate without utensils yeah what people got sick no they but not all the time Jamie Greg he helps that like cooking with heat not everyone could cook with fire people ate a lot of raw shit for a long time you've got to find something on there I mean I'm looking you're killing me dude this is killing me I'm too high to look it up right now myself that's the bummer I don't even know how to go to Bing see what the fuck Bing does yeah it's gotta be some eight secrets of people who never get sick let's see it's just about sleeping sneezing vitamin C sleep it off get a handle on stress gym rat this is nothing you got nothing man had nothing coming up got nothing totally nothing yeah I don't know where you're getting this from hey just make it up for Joe just lie when he when it comes back oh yeah we found so much stuff it's crazy where have I heard this I've heard it somewhere someone in the Internet is gonna agree with me so some dude will find it the thing I had with Bill Cosby he just filed today for an appeal apparently what oh he did yeah 458 pages a hard fucking case to fight huh are you gonna fight that dude would you kill yourself tell him hey Jay Joe Jaime found a ton of fucking stuff proving my ships tons you see 10 happens somebody told you have a dream and in that dream you're convinced I've heard somewhere and then I thought wow that's amazing people cultures that heat with their hands they just they just don't want to change the forks and they'd say make up some story above yeah god I was in Central America yes nobody told me they were rocked with the flesh hey would you spend if you were bill cot we were saying if your ability would you just kill yourself yes you would right um I would just end it I don't know what you can do when you're that far down the hole so yeah I found the appeal that's how you met so it's liking it like here's a perfect example we're talking about it all with Lois think about Lois and nothing about think about Bill Cosby totally different right but people don't want you to say that because they're both air quotes abusers one of them's a monster one of them was a guy who did some stupid shit kinky shit weird shit who's into it the ass people they said yes he shouldn't have done it he feels bad that he did it but you can't how do you forgive Bill Cosby like to take that the idea that you're supposed to forgive Lois which I think yes and then I don't see a path for Bill Cosby to be forgiven they don't see that path when you've ruined the lives of how many people 50 plus when something's that heinous I just don't think I think they're going to have you ruin their life you certainly certainly fucked them up like if you wake up and you're with Bill cause when he thought he's gonna take care of you and your pants are done my ear ankles do you realize he fucked you while you're unconscious and he drugged you yeah that is gonna fuck your head up it's gonna change what you think about people that someone could just drug you and treat you like meat your unconscious they're doing things to you when you're out cause you're saying what's our laws of forgiveness well how do you forgive that first of all you can't because he'd ever he doesn't admit it he never admits it so whoever even gets to the door right of like of acceptance of forgiveness of doing this penance or if there is a penance if there's anything you never do ever he doesn't even get to did everybody sit down with every room for forgiveness that's a good question I think you would probably open up the door to more lawsuits sure I think you would there would come storm and in like hail you know right yeah but I think I know what you're saying is very smart it's saying like we're saying we're supposed to give someone like for someone like Louie well what is the line of when you don't forgive right what's the line what is how what's the number what's the line what's the atrocity like what is it that we go you can't forgive this person anymore yeah what's the what's the line of compassion like where do you worry eat a line of compassion that's a good word that's what it is what is that ultimate where you go now you can no longer from this moment forward forgive this human being and the problem is now here's where it gets slippery if you decide you you're gonna be the guy who says I'm gonna kill this guy someone that executed him yeah yeah if you decide if you live in a company look with that's what we're essentially doing we're just doing it slow but putting him in a cage right right but if you were gonna really decide hey we're gonna we're gonna remove this guy from the population I can't trust her with my kids we live in a primitive society okay we live in some some village type Society thousands of years ago right that's what we all did what would we do when someone was like that well we probably try to figure out a way to get rid of them yeah you kill them you'd have to kill yeah you'd have to but you would have to figure out what are the laws that allow someone to kill somebody because you can't just let people kill people because you let people kill people then you just come up with excuses to kill people right and this is what people have done throughout history whether it's the Mongols the Romans let me just go throughout history people with people fucking killed people because they could kill people so when do you like what is the moral distinction that you have to make where someone is they have done irreparable harm but that changes over time right right that and that continually changes that's that's my son is like that will never stop changing from from from decade to decade from era to era what we find deplorable now will not be deplorable later and that see with so many aspects of our culture yes literature movies yes yeah the way we restrict what so so what we're saying is is there ever a line is there ever a line does it ever exist does that idea of like this is the cutoff does that really exist because it's constantly moving it's constantly changing you know I've said it a million times I've never said what Lois did was okay I think he has his issues I don't think anybody has but I also think everybody needs to investigate what happened and find out it's all about what yes I'm sure let him talk about it find out what the social psychology of what he was going through yeah but disturbed but what I think is happening too is that a lot of women feel like when these guys that are abusers got taken out that it made it so that it was better for women and so that if they come back things go back the way they were this is a real that's a real thought you know is what we must have conversation yeah we don't have conversation then we're fucked I mean that's a real thought with imagine being guy like Harvey Weinstein who was doing this for so long get away with all his fucked up shit for so long support supported by support support it support I mean he had a clause in its contract detailing what would happen for the first case of sexual harassment second case four days in the contract so why don't why are there fuck why are they help why aren't the viewlet support him up a Cheeto um I'd loved you to join my podcast network I'm thinking about promoting him in I just think you're a great guy you're a funny guy you're a talented guy dot I think you might be a raper so what I want to put is a first rape I'm gonna charge you this much okay second what the flicka fuck imagine the first sexual harass as I got a figure and the second one lawsuit has another figure us a double the figure they're like three strikes you're out but it's not something he can't afford now it's like two fifty five hundred grand he's like a billionaire yeah he's Harvey wines he goes fine he made Pulp Fiction he's like yeah yeah he's eating food while they're talking he's fuckin crumbs all down his face he's drunken off while they're talking he's gotten he's just the glutton a filthy fat fuckin glutton you can't make a better case for a glutton than that guy he's a metaphor for the business by the way all consuming taking right and look yeah he he would he would ruin what's beautiful right take was beautiful he broke pretty soon mouth Oh who's fat gut resting on their forehead he fuck he ruined pretty things you know he's fucked up pretty things horrible fuck that guy but it's interesting because like that is a villain in a movie he's like oh he's a villain in a movie yes it's like a like a bad Dick Tracy Garrett or well you know I'm not no more modern he's a feeling that he's a villain more in a fucking Harvey Weinstein movie is what he is oh yeah someone will make that film he's a villain in no but he's a villain in a Quentin Tarantino movie right if there was a guy who was doing dark shit and then one of the girls winds up playing like some kickass female character ones I've shooting and we kill him like said Hannah what the fuck's her name who the woman who's in Kill Bill not luma Thurman but the Daryl here Daryl Hannah yeah Daryl Hannah Daryl Hannah winds up kill him tight like hit hit kills him with a brick Oh plus his fucking head over yeah like Patricia Arquette when she killed Tony Soprano yes remember yes right yeah yeah yeah she was dumb fuck yeah that was perfect he was the perfect character that Tony Soprano character that she killed when James Gandolfini and true romance when it was a Patricia Arquette to Arquette's well know what's the other Arquette it's to our cats oh no no no pressure okay it was Patricia but there's no no as a girl there's another girl there yes no no there is I'm crap don't you shake your head bitch thank you very much she's dead oh shit which one well bro you better not be wrong so that's even worse it's bad if you miss it Jamie Jamie Rosen's a narc yes oh shit she's been in gang movies - she was in pulp fiction well yes well Rosanna Arquette was in Pulp Fiction she was uh wasn't she one of the chick she was a part of like when a girl over Marino had over the girl overdose that was her they had a helper yeah that was her that she would choose help in uma thurman she was the girl that had shit all over her face as he said did she goes your wife has shit all over

goes he goes who's that he goes how's the chick was shit all over he goes that's my fucking wife what a movie now what a fucking movie anyway easily one of the best films forever amazed always amazing
