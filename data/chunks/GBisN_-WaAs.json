what's up Brian reichal do you believe in ghosts Joey Diaz fuck yeah do you really fuck you yes yes I don't believe it I seen I seen something at The Comedy Store one thing not I didn't see the door ringing I didn't see nobody walking with not a head on I mean I've heard a lot of stories Mikami's book and then I've been around people who pass spirits as a young child in fact I went to see the lady when I went home last week yeah that was a kid I seemed to do some wild shit what'd you do when I was about uh when I was about eight you know my mother had a bar and all these people coming to shake it down you know cops are coming nice guys just white guys come in that's part of the business when you have a bar you know somebody gets stabbed you want the cops there first you got to give an envelope you know and then uh after about three months this guy started coming he was a Cuban guy look like Serpico but he would come in and break the Cubans balls he went after Cubans he went after Cubans in 76 and 75 he went after him heavy and even coming to my mother's bar and salt them and fuck you motherfuckers I want a bigger envelope next time I come that type of shit so when that one in there after school and he was yelling and screaming in there not in like this fucking guy he was younger and he had a beard he was a weight lifter type dude so a couple weeks later I go to the bar that's all these Cuban guys bar on 38th Street had the brindis these were all human bookmakers that my dad knew my stepdad know my mom nice fucking people and it was this lady I played basketball with the kids the kid was a boxer his name was Jose Torres bad his their uncle's the fucking dude that's their uncle the killer Jose Torres he's a boxing ref or something big boxing official that's their uncle this is their nephew Lakota Ricans so I was the guy that was he was a light heavyweight champion right you know he's something big with boxing this is his nephew I grew up with that nephew live a basketball players I think that's what I'm talking about he's anyone who wrote the book about Mike Tyson he kind of grew up with Mike Tyson and kind of like wrote a tell-all book about him was kind of like kind of shitty no no this is the Joe Torres yeah that's this is Jose Torres the referee from the 17 I'm taking the wrong guy I think this guy even reffed like he was he was the one that did our fight when they were trying to stop at the ran against when they were trying to stop it he's the we gotta look it up Duran against Hill Duran against that fight when he killed the guy in the ring like I died two weeks later but he took the spirit away what's the fight we always talk about what Duran is baby more Davey more yeah that's it I think he had I use it and died years later we got Anna Carla car wrecks yeah the fucking jack fell on Tommy yeah yes Carnaby got crushed but he ached Bertrand took asparagus burger yeah that happens to guys man did Julio Cesar Chavez when he fought Meldrick Taylor there's no question about that fight Meldrick Taylor got his spirit taken Chavez took his spirit he hurt him bad to physically like he was never seen physically but he was also number the same psychologically to go through that crazy-ass war and to be boxing the fucking ears off the guy at first then eventually the guy to slowly wears you down slowly wears you down and then BOOM stops you in the 12th with like seconds to go they stop the fight like that's a crushing blow a devastating blow you know that's added to have the referee look at you when there's like was it like two seconds left in a clock and the referee shakes him off and Chavez wins like what what that's like a spirit crusher we're talking about the spirit with Sarah Torres well so we were kids and once a month this lady would pass a fucking spirit in the house you go she was a mom this lady was a mom I used to watch her she was a mom she used to drive her kids around to different basketball games and shit her husband and her was separated she wasn't a boozer she never really cursed I would go to the daytime and she would make sandwiches fee and stuff like that she would take the kids to church on Sunday so I used to watching but my mother once told me that said that lady passes a fucking weird spirit once a month or some shit people go over there you bring in money or gifts or whatever the fuck you bring it and she talks to you so one night we wasn't oxygen yeah through the spirit so one night we went over there how long you know me a long time look at me I don't fuck around okay I'm chilly shut the fuck up Brian hello fuck around you know fuck when I talk to you for like a man I talk to you like a man this is fucked up but I'm gonna tell you I'm about 8 and 9 so this one last time I went to the bar and he had them all up at the bar like Popeye Doyle had those people in fucking the French Connection then when he goes in he said everybody against the wall he's like last time I went in there and now he's fucking Cuban to piss and my mom's pissed so like we got to figure something on I knew eventually my dad was gonna shoot this guy that's the I just had a funny feeling of my stepdad Oh somebody's gonna shoot this fucking guy cuz he was going over his bounds they felt that he was abusing Cubans which is even worse than your Cuban if he was a white dude or a black dude hey it's part of the turf you fucking cube we're gonna get your ass so I knew about this and I just turned the other way one night we go to this fucking lady's house and she's talking to these people and she's got the spirit now I'm watching this lady this lady would drink fucking raw alcohol what's that what's that fucking Amish I know the shit that people drink that's 140 proof oh Claire ffs Everclear drink it talk to you and smoke the fucking cigar oh my eyes she was supposed to be a black African fucking slave but she was really a Puerto Rican woman and she talked to you I can't drink

a white dish and then she took a fucking candle she took the dish and she put the candle under the dish she took the candle she drew it down she showed the dish to my mother she said this is what's bothering you lately and there was just some fucking thing it just looked like some candle the thing right she took the dish she smashed it she goes done seven days I went home dog I never thought about this shit again I was eight and nine I had GI Joes I was trying to look at my dad's pornos I'm saying right I don't believe this hocus-pocus right well one day I got out of school and I take the bike and I go to my mother's bar when I got up there they're all fuckin drinking and having a good time at 3:30 and I go what happened to go they know that fucking cop they shot him to pieces last night and they shot him up by this place rapido taxi was the first Cuban taxicab company in the 70s that would deliver blown the taxis all these geniuses that genius is not yeah all right the Cubans are doing that 217 Union City they will go over the bridge you call from the city they live in the studio 54 taxis would deliver the car come on dog this is 70 before 75 with my dog and the name of the company was rapido taxi noir wrap it all means in Spanish flat quit bitch quit floppy little quick quick quick yeah quick so I'm drew took my bike Joe Rosen Joe Rogan I went up to this fuck this is this is brilliant sure was the taxi a real taxi company especially company but they'd love a fucking blow that was that was the purpose of II think they made money on a three dollar toll they make money delivering the fucking goody-good the studio that's oh did they run a real taxi too real taxi you thought you get grandmother's can take it from supermarkets and you can go on the way home can

Joe Rogan's tobacco call I'm sorry go right ahead we thought you were doing something else meanwhile I was fuckin a bag of fucking blow in the trunk and the cops must have been an honor to write how much how many the cops were in on it back then I don't fuck it had to be some right seven New York was have different animals seven New York was a difference right New York was a different fucking animal then but you gotta remember that it was just a taxi nobody thought about that well New York back then I was 20 years ahead of that fucking time when when New York sneeze bro everybody else caught a fucking cold let's get down that ten years behind over here these fucking savages this is it you know this is a totally different place socially than New York that's for sure right no you think people are more on the ball there there's more like there's more con artists and shit there's more clever people do you think there's more fucking douchebags everyone's more stone people out here yeah there's a lot of that but I think that I always say that there's something about the weather man you don't have to deal with the weather you get soft you know your your brain doesn't have to think think quickly because you have to survive you know when you're in Boston and it's fucking zero degrees out you get in your car and goes like fuck fuck and you don't have a cellphone stupid there was no cell phones back then so what are you doing oh my god I got a knock on someone's door so I don't freeze to death you gotta wake some people up because you might freeze to death hey I'm sorry my car broke down can I use your dude you got to think quicker when you're in that kind of an environment in California you know your car breaks down you just sleep in the car until you know the cops come and then the cops tell you hey what's going on oh my car broke down and they get you a tow truck you find you'll have to worry about dying outside living in Boston you got to worry about dying it's like some real shit and that's why they're there a little quicker a little quicker on a take that sound that sound that sound that you made for doing the car I was just imagining I was imagining that's what it sounded like when Joey Diaz had sex do you think so Joey what's it sound like when you have sex it's not this yeah your dog told you I was good dick did I tell you I'm giving you good dick I'm giving you good dick ah where's what don't get me started red bad bad I have you-know-who here in 20 minutes bitch slapping motherfuckers you know I'm saying who you have here what the fuck come on what's plan B you know really I don't know do you know he knows who so my dog Twix sea vixen got raped again by a girl by a girl dog in her snow whore the person was like I got a py each other store the person I was with Joey yeah everyone's leaving man it was my Twix see vixen sorry art so the person I was with I owned the dog they're like my dog has never a humped anything and be my dog is a girl dog so I don't even know why it's like trying to hump your dog's ass because it doesn't have a dick so Joey what what do you think about RSS feeds I don't know idea what they even fuck it up here pimping like will you bother before that shuttle love about computers you don't know anything about computers optin yeah what will you do well they're designed to pump out a like if you have a website it's designed only for wear mostly for sending out your website so other applications and other websites can add it to their website in their applications but if you don't want to do that you don't have an RSS feed so I could see you wouldn't want an RSS feed talking about something my fuckin eat like oh is that real that's real bitch see now that's what you wanted to take you don't play with you boys walking right into the foyer fuck I had to pee I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen I apologize I was working on that video game all day today Oh smells like gyros I couldn't oh I was working on that UFC video game today and I drink tea when I work on that show no the the video game is like it's very it's like a script and there's like I have to pretend that like fights are going on right so it's like for hours and hours and hours you're talking at that like really intense fast and you know and when your voice gets really tired I had to drink a lot of tea so I could not hold in my urine so what you were saying before I left so rudely is that your dog's a whore yeah that's a whore that lesbians are raping your dog nope yeah exactly in like why dude all dogs have just the intuition to get on top of another dog and hump it even if they don't have a dick because it doesn't make sense no it does my dog used to do that she was a female pit bull and I had a male pit bull that was a puppy it changed to get on top of him and hump him she's like rubbing pussy's ins no no it's a dominant thing it's like what she's doing is saying that if I wanted to fuck you in the ass I could I can get to the position where I'm on top of you I'm stronger than you I date jockey for position you have to almost like like that it's it's it's a social thing it's like for a dog to be able to get on top of you and and dry hump you it's not just that he's horny it's also that he's trying to let you know he can do that he can impose himself on you like my two dogs they have very clear rules like Johnny's a mastiff he's a big fucking dog and you know he's got this giant fucking head he's a sweetheart of a dog but the other dog's a bulldog Shiba Inu mix and the other dog doesn't get no saying shit that's just the way it is they don't fight they don't argue but when I open up the door Johnny walks in first every time every time the other dog will stop and let Johnny go through first why because Johnny's 140 pound Mastiff he's fucking huge you know so there's just clear rules if Johnny wanted to hump Brutus he could get away with it but if Brutus tried to hump Johnny there would be chaos it would be like what the fuck Brutus probably would growl and snap at Johnny if Johnny tried to hump him but the point is the other way is absolutely preposterous it's never gonna happen there's like a this is what with animals there's an alpha and then there's the the ones who give in to the Alpha and your dog clearly it's like the most beta dog ever I know it so much tell me don't fit it together as I was so he hit an army dog so I guess the way it works is that they just feel her submissiveness and they want to mount her their instinct is to mount her and dominate her and this the old dog I used to have was always a bad dog and every time it was bad I would just like kind of put her in between my legs my arm and kind of get in like a crouching position and kind of just like put her in between me and like holder and so I was kind of like on top ever I wasn't like fucking her right she was just like on like underneath my belly like a little cave I would make I would just sit there for like ten minutes and you could tell the dog at first trying to get out and then finally just kind of some misses are so you know just kind of lays down and it gives up dog is just fine you know well walks around good I don't think you're supposed to do that I think you fucked up your dog's head you like rape your dog every time it's shit on the carpet every time when shits on the carpet you rape it well no no it's it's something I learned kind of from Caesar oh really like is that what Caesar does he fucks you after show times that's after nights Showtime version of it now he had a secret yeah I'd probably be the best way to do it yeah he said well he didn't say it like that he said that you should grab it by the back in the neck and like hold it down yeah for a while but that's pretty much what I was doing I was pretty much getting on top of it and just kind of like getting like yo I am the master it's the whole dog thing is crazy man you have these animals that listen to you right now like what the fuck or what's wrong with us there's not another animal that keeps animals that they love right now it's weird and we've got them engineered to be like the sweetest nicest things ever I mean look at your dog dude your dog's ridiculously affectionate right I've never seen a dog but not just affectionate but so needy to her it's like every breath but taking a breath she needs that much attention like it's like as much as she's breathing she needs someone touching her as much as she needs to take in the air she needs someone to touch her it's like that extreme it's like a stripper or something way worse way worse since i yeah is there any animal that has pubic hair I was thinking the other day I was like it wouldn't be cool if like animals had pubic hairs and like even like trim ohm or you could just get a full bush you know like good cat that's it the animal would have to have nothing else around it I mean they have pubic hair over their whole fucking body that's basically what's going on yeah kind of sure but I mean like like even like bald eagles if bald eagles I bushes those are feathers but I mean like why don't they have do you talk to him like bald eagles have penises right yes why are humans the only ones to have peak of pubic hairs cuz we don't have hair on the rest of our body there's very few animals in it we see my family very few animals that have exposed skin that ain't shit dude if you were a viewer a coyote I would take you to the vet I believe this poor thing is dying because altair is missing yeah what you think is hairy is only hairy too a hairless person you know I'm covered in here too that's not like hairy is that's your hairless you just you have a little hair compared to the other healers folk all right why don't monkeys have huge bushes they do Ben they do they have pubic hairs they do they don't get long and crazy like ours because they just have different kind of hair but they have hair around their dick and balls the fuck is wrong with you son I'm gonna do some research before you come over these crazy pubic hair theories well I mean they don't have bushes like that's what I'm talking about why do we have the because we don't have it anywhere else Joey if it like it would be weird if like animals you know I mean there's only the only animal that's like us that his hair and certain parts as bodies like some some dogs and I just wish all excuse Aryan why this will be a fuck about animal puberty is not worried about people dying of radiation poisoning and fucking why are we in Libya the CIA's involved in her life I'm worried about animals do you think PETA would exist of animals appears wine don't let me get bill Bergey of the population to have the computer nobody's gonna fuck you answer this laptop with fucking Brock Lesnar right now nobody put you into the microphone bro me I'm alright I'm straight thinking my voice is fucking too big are below the speaker like maybe call brockless black dog alright alright what's going on Bilborough did a video where he fucking talked about the thing that there's a video on youtube so he's made it six minutes long he talked about the argument on his own for another six minutes and at the end of it he goes yeah and I was right that's the point that guy that little computer guy he doesn't know about computers and they're trying to rip you off and take the money for the artists they never had money for the artists fucking RSS feeds you know what you know what the thing that bugged me the most six minutes this is expenditure talking was the thing that bugged me the most I met him like four times five times before right he even did I we did a comedy show that the for one night or that night the way that night we did a comedy show and knows the following following night and I was like the host of the show and I'm like he knew that I'm a comic oh oh he knows who I am right if he's not he's fucking whatever so he on the beginning of the video he goes yeah and so there's that guy that little guy that whatever that the male assistant guy the cameras on that it's a fucking male assistant to something over there yeah yeah this guy whatever the fuck he is hey I can give me a gyro yeah come on but but fuck into that the thing that bugs me the most is and I I was pretty baked when that argument happened but the thing that bugged me the most about everything was my whole thing wasn't that I'm like yeah what stitchers doing is a hundred percent legal know what what I was saying is if you have something on your website that that you put on your website right that is only put on your website if you want to broadcast your stuff you don't want that then take it off your website it doesn't change anything my whole argument is like why do you have an RSS feed on your website why what what why did you put it on are we really having this conversation what are you doing no but not me already so my art yeah but but my argument that I'm just I know what your argument was here we going I know it is argument is I know your arguments I'm aware of the the general details of the disagreement I know but how cozy do oh is what I'm saying is that's not a wrong or right thing that's just a question actually care anymore I don't care anymore what's way more fascinating to me is how involved you two got that was way more fascinating when you're getting a tackle issues trying to explain access issue somebody the actual issue was miniscule compared to health psychologically captivating it was and how he was genuinely getting upset and you were getting upset too and I was trying to mediate because I genuinely did see both sides I genuinely did but what I couldn't understand its how you guys are getting so god too upset and then when I would bring it up building oh this is a fucking new spot Joe Rogan the Joe Rogan from 1994 would have fucking stabbed somebody by now maybe we'd even know each other back then man you're just assuming you're assuming I would have done that well you know it was just to me it's like I've already said this I think five times I I can't say anything else about that I couldn't get you guys to stop it's fascinating you like to dogs bark shut up stop there also comes to a point where you are like feel like you're talking to your mom doing email that's how I get about certain things well you didn't you must have saw his point a little bit no I see what he's saying but that's not what I'm saying I'm not saying I agree with him or disagree with him on that he wasn't willing to listen to what you were saying about the whole concept of an RSS frame which stands for Really Simple Syndication right and what syndication mean you want to send a Kate yeah what's that mean it's you want to spread it out to as many people as possible in your website absolutely but the real problem was the problem is iTunes numbers and that's what he really wants to say is that stitcher was helping it hurting his iTunes numbers and probably that he doesn't know what an RSS feed it why it's on his website if he wants people to go to his website take off your RSS feed that's all you have to do make don't make your RSS feed public just give it to iTunes only hide your RSS feed and then everyone will come to your website and you'll have your iTunes only we do one better than that we allow people to download it not just on stitcher but I allow people to download it directly yeah so the moment it goes live I have a download link so I don't want you have to wait just so my iTunes numbers will be higher I did to me all that matters is that you get it out there you don't get cookies for being number three or number four you know it's cute it's nice to see the number but what's important to me is just that it gets distributed to as many people as possible as easily as possible some people don't like fucking with iTunes whereas some dudes who love the Zune you know I heard the news is pretty badass I think they stopped making in brown oh did I yeah I lied on my ass I mean there's some people that have just little mp3 players those little flash mp3 players are like a little animated so you gotta have it available for everything in anybody yeah Lloyd's and especially when it's it's if it's a free thing that you just want to get out your podcast to people you know you're not you're not doing like Doug Benson we are charging money you're just trying to get your body has calling out Doug Benson I can't believe I mean what that honest thing is the future of podcast well how our podcasters gonna make money what Doug is doing is pretty interesting he's charging money now for like certain shows I don't think it's every show I think it's like he has like certain shows Maron does that sue yes like something will you become like some super members I'm shit right I mean I honestly think the only way really to make money is to get sponsors you know yeah I think the way you gotta get a lot of little lot of listeners and get sponsors the way to do it right I think I agree I think because I think we've just reached this time on the internet we have to look at the music industry we have to see look the music industry has changed it's not that people start stealing and taking shit from from the music industry it's it that happened and that's there was no way to stop that so the music industry has to reorganize refigure how they do it and that's gonna happen with everything and you can't fill up and stop it you just got to go with what you think is going to happen and that's like podcasting no one knows what's happening with podcasting but you have to pretty much go with what you can do right now well we already have the lobby thing we also have the luxury of doing other things you know I have the luxury of not having to rely completely on my podcast with the UFC and we're doing stand-up especially doing stand-up right because the podcast definitely enhances the stand-up insanely and also just look at Philly I mean Philly you just sold out all Philly right yeah it's sold out it's too weak ain't no I mean how would you last on that have sonna it wasn't happening like that before it's like that everywhere yeah pull Seattle last weekend was fuckin crazy man 1800 people and when I asked about like how many guys listen to podcast it was like the whole crowd it 100% of the crowd do you get that now Joey I get people yelling out do Joe Diaz market has changed completely and with music what's really going on with music is that they had to give it away so now you you make money and performing but these bitches can't perform yeah there's a lot of water fakin sorry they can't perform that's the music that's what happened

looking for you are you smoking pot mm-hmm what's wrong with you and I sat like for a minute I got all like there is something wrong what's wrong with me what's wrong with you if you were fucking high you would be worrying about us not smoking high it was like 10:15 the morning but to say it's 10 o'clock and only how now how can you be smoking pilot you really smoking pot why wouldn't you and that's what we came up with that name from the real fucking what's wrong with you fuck is wrong with me what's wrong with you bitch fucking problem you were high you would worry about me smoking dope yeah with it's it's a weird thing where people want to stop you from doing something because they think it's an indulgence you know they you're being weak you're indulging you know my wife said to me two days ago she goes you know what the funny thing is at 5:30 the more than hasn't Haley alarm go off but I heard you do a lot of bomb hit that's what you know if you learn my wife told me Tuesday morning she was you know how to Haley alone but I definitely heard you bucket ah you got a bong in the bedroom I got a bong in the office then they are faster so you step off into the office or head up oh when I get up I brush my teeth I piss and put the coffee and I feed the cats and I go right for that I pray for 10 million you wake and bake like a motherfuck yeah right I used to wake and bake that fucks up your hope now you wait five minutes I need a little right I will balance out the body either will cantaloupe the bounce out the pH yeah to get the fucking bowels moving cantaloupe hmm I think it doesn't bug me up what you take it if you yeah I can make it five usual day it fucks you up your whole day I mess up your whole day when she smoked me you're pretty much all day for the rest I've done a thousand times I'm the king of it I ain't gonna lie to you my 11 o'clock you like I fucked up would you call the doctor's office you're like I ain't gonna happen do - how many days you take off on a regular from what take off whatever thing any days fucking for what I said when I went to prison that was long enough ah eight fucking months without smoking weed how to pop acid and fucking sneaking around so you're addicted to it I'm not addicted to it I just can't have a head dog I'm the real deal yeah ever had like the smoked dope that's my bag some people alcoholic some people like to drink like I can't imagine a life without weed I've been smoking since I was 14 have you thought maybe because you can't imagine cuz you don't remember it no I can't imagine it not the first first of all red man I'm the real fucking the I remember I know you're the real deal so so I just like smoking weed the people I grew the type of person I grew up with when I went to Colorado I was all around a lot of heads they like weed they enjoy weed when I got home yesterday nice knit that that thing was 31% I tweeted it ten people got back to me that said go drive up in San Diego that's a head that's not a kid that says oh my god I got the blow with something on we're Pineapple Express no there's certain weed that's got a name that you smoke it to be cool then this dish what's this stuff again cuz qualms at number one OG Matt's number one over looking at like some famous growers no no Matt is the guy that owns cush Mart so when he took much more he bought that brand and wanting to grow for him and this is a hybrid it's a hybrid that he's got the Snoop Dogg that's a 28% this stuff might be the perfect weed I might be the greatest we'd ever I smoked it and I realized when I smoked it the other day I've been going to I know it's EC and I've been buying $50.00 fucking eighths and I realized that the pot was good and some days my bigram like by 6 o'clock after Graham was gone I'm smoking too much pot on the bottom that's too much when I hit wheat and I remember that Wow I started this diet was it Matt Shoji when you smoked in the morning the sativa would take over your mind so quickly but I have to get out of the house before my head blew up and I was have to get on a bike and I would just get on the bike and pedal to something chasing me and that's how I lost 100 fuckin pounds on that bus smoking the mat so G coz a team a wooden speed drop by cocaine it speed you up and Greg control you and it went from being a sativa into methodically like an indica it was the weirdest people don't understand the sativa actually makes you ambitious people think that it's people who look upon you look at people being you know potheads being like unambitious and lazy sativa makes me way more ambitious it makes me aware of the consequences of not working as hard as you can and how you feel you know it makes me super sensitive to my own actions positive or negative so it makes me super sensitive to doing things that I should be doing as far as like getting work done as far as like you know writing and performing and you know and doing podcast and I don't ever cancel podcast man you know after I'd have to be sick as fuck and I don't get sick very often so we do them you know it's like sativa makes me you know hyper aware and when I'm hyper aware I'm more diligent you know so I think it makes me more ambitious but you guys think if you had if you wanted to take a month off do you think you could possibly easily do it sure I've done that I'm not having taking a month off but I've taken weeks off I can take a couple days off but why does he think it yeah I don't see I mean what does this be effective and here's a here's a perp I tried I thought about it and I've smoked a shitload of weed you have to be spending a shitload of money so I smoke I'll shitload of weed the people around me smoke weed I get it though it's really weird that the people around me are into it like I'm into it like the tight people well we all have fun together and what people don't understand about marijuana is if they think it's some sort of an escape it's an enhancement it's not an escape we're living in the same world you're living in man it's just more fun when you're high it's really that simple and it's not ruining your body it's bullshit but I'm not going to pepper on your steak no it may be you today for Tate Tate can smoke weed you know Stanhope doesn't like weed there's a lot of our friends don't like weed that's all well and good man it's fine yeah you know I don't like I mean I've been smoking weed so much that I mean I could take a couple days off I could take probably a week I probably taking a week off recently but but that the idea of taking a month office so we're foreign to me that I almost want to do it just to see what happens like I must start talking about it who she'd become a Republican I watched Bill O'Reilly yeah I have no idea it was right we I do have to be afraid of Mexicans I was looking like 14:15 I tell a point in my life of my weed career I can't write anymore well I get really high really you're like when I get up in the morning I get high it's to go on Twitter and Facebook and make adjustments here and get my day ready right but like now when I write I try to be a little straighter really well I work out I got a blaze dog if I get good at edible I gotta get him edible on me I love working out stoned that is my life that was how I did there is a grain I love not remembering what said it is and I know my shoulders on a fire you know I'm saying I love the fact that if I get if I don't get high I'll still work out an hour and I still do a good job and if I work if I get high I work out an hour forty it's just a little tighter I concentrate on my kicks I concentrate on the form yeah I know what you mean yeah I do everything I hiked when I kick the bag of them how useless oh what is real I don't usually it's a coal holding the bag by mistake I won't yeah I left roundhouse with the fucking head but I like getting on the bike stone yeah think about it I like the articles the elliptical stone is a fucking different world you know many people roll stoned jiu-jitsu well you have to everybody does no no I'll tell you like cities classes eddie's classes like you walk in that room you smell reefer you so everyone smells like reefer there's like half of his fucking students or high as fuck when I techie laughs you need a piece of banana cake and you go to yoga oh my god well you know that that's McKenna used to say that that's what yoga was invented for but yoga was invented for was maximizing cannabis it was you money's people would be eating cannabis and when they were eating it they realized how good it felt when you hold your body in certain positions well I did so they came up with this like connection to spirituality through eating cannabis and holding these poses these difficult pose amazing yeah because something I don't know what it is about the energy of the pose it makes you go into some some state when you're high as fuck but it really does even if when you're sober man I've done yoga sober and after it's over I felt hi well the breathing the breathing intent the breathing that's going through your body and focusing so much on the breathing when I go in and ate a little piece of banana bread because it's 8:00 during the morning but I gotta go to you know my I gotta start blazing the 7:30 go by the time how longs it take tit for a banana bread hit you 20 minutes 25 minutes i kicking a little chaff and j to get everything going but I didn't after nine knew I've been downward dog I've been fucking pigeons I'm in fucker and it's in its you think about your breathing is is so beautiful when you're high I want you to go in the water and you have like it and you could hear your breathe like right now yes yeah when you do yoga you can hear you if you hear that you've reached it right you reach that level in that position right and with the weed it makes it a lot easier for me I'm a loser I know ain't gonna lie to you know you and what a metaphor really like I said that's what the reason why you may have very well been invented according to McKenna they believe believes they were in they invented yoga to maximize the the effects of eating cannabis it's something I've got I play basketball I've got my lifting weights there's nothing like eatin a little bit of weed and going to yoga even if it's a basic class just to focus on your breathing I do it every Tuesday tomorrow I got a Russian thing on the airport but I'll do it I'll eat it edible in the morning cuz I have nothing else and it is just fucking breath in my body randy parson do your good friend ryan ryan process was that the gym one day at adjustments and there was an argument going on between trainers and these guys were white guys they wore the head and the guy was saying that he's been telling all his clients - if please after their workouts their weight workouts to smoke a little reefer because it's a anti-inflammatory and it works better than anything else even like the lettuce and should have pulled the ass italian muscles lettuce like lettuce when you eat lettuce and pulls the asses out of your muscles we don't work out something like that acid does something Alevis does something after you work out okay acid out of your muscles so they could recover or something okay well this guy was talking about so we does that we'd an anti-inflammatory yes really and let they're scared to tell people because we'll go fucking crazy well it kind of makes sense if it's a painkiller if people enjoy it for pain it kind of makes sense that it would also be you know for if inflammation he said it's really good for your joints yeah do some with their well that's one of the reasons they prescribed it for arthritis try this yeah people a lot of people that have chronic arthritis like I've talked to people that said that they they literally couldn't move and then they would smoke weed and then all of a sudden they could walk around like they could function you know it allowed them to be to be mobile I don't know man makes sense I mean it helps a lot of people a lot of different ways it's just a shame that we have to pretend that something wrong with it if me and people want to think it's not a big deal like why you guys talk about weed all time fucking losers like first of all we're not losers and don't be mean and second of all it is a fucking important issue man it is important we know ourselves how it affects us we know ourselves how much how much more aware thank God you turned his mind off right and stick it here and still be yeah that's not it from you know what I wanted from weed 20 years ago it's not what I want from weed today you wanted to escape 20 years ago um I liked it I have an only child so I love living in my head guys you give me a full left me get in my head you're a dead bed well he'll say yeah you let me get my I'm a lonely child I'm breaking fucking down in no time I know it is to be in the closet playing GI Joes making up your whole world that Disneyland is outside your fucking closet I'm an only child I know how to get the party started my fucking head that's why I like being alone even though is that you give me weed and an iPod you go fuck yourself never mind two o'clock you go fuck yourself hey I'm one of those guys jelly of a vanish sometimes I could go on an island solo I like I enjoy I don't I don't creep out of my skin well listen man that's a beautiful quality in comparison to the alternative the alternative is someone who needs people around them all the time and needs attention all the time and everybody knows how goddamn annoying that is I love rare that someone's is extroverted as you but also I guess it's just a balance to yin and yang right you need that downtime too I really enjoy my I never enjoyed this throughout my life I always taught you how to be moving where that's what kills people people don't make enough time for themselves mm what's that not a trip to Jamaica one hour well people don't know we don't make enough well it's hard you got to manage your life correctly to to get to a position where you can enjoy things because some people are just scratching every week man every week is scratching trying to get ahead can't get no fucking traction trying to figure it all out that's a tremendous amount of stress you know last know how he came over was smoking the Mets OG and it was not ten after six or something you can we heard this bout being being it's the Mexican ice cream man it is the best ice cream you'll ever have it's Dairy Queen vanilla ice cream he makes a delicious banana split I've been there for a year now one brown spot no banana right and it's funny he said to me you get so much enjoyment from that ice cream truck your life is what you make enjoyment I'm not filthy loaded but I get off on that fucking ice cream man coming would you be enough on the end when I went to New York I talked to Ralph for you he's in this hotel in the city and I got this and that nothing fucking Fort Lee ever drove how coming Ralphie doesn't use the internet because he feels that his clientele doesn't use the internet what I don't know that's the end that's the ones we dig this thing ever he's found the 1% of the population that isn't online I mean who the fuck is online that's so silly it's just really weird whose name I know that expression is so true that expression is so true one man's chicken is another man's gumbo yeah yeah that I did a show of the city oh my friends let's go to Chinatown let's do this bulb Foreman kind of time sucked that place sucked my place of Richfield Park Chan's dragging it still the pound-for-pound Weiner an old-school Chinese food you gotta hit the floor I grow shrimp and lobster sauce those has the pork in it old school the noodles old school dog all-school 30 I've been going there since 1979 to get steak on a stick when I was a sophomore take on a genuine they send a cup they have one of the best poopoo platter xanimation Chinese food so good on the East Coast it's China closer it is right the East goes into New York must be you could get great Chinese food out here but it's not consistent that everything is good I go to a place that the pork fried rice you think you're in the Bronx but don't get the shrimp and garlic sauce or Lobster Cantonese you feel like you're eating it with a white dude named chant Lobster Cantonese nobody told us to kill a lot of it last we come on respect Lobster Cantonese a rare ones don't get that everywhere so people gotta eat pasta trails you and I both know you take a little train to fuck with LeBron so you the mountain pop store and for 1495 you getting clam sauce oh go get hard the you know a hundred bucks you could sleep in the back for an hour Yeah right notice when I lived in New Rochelle we used to go to Frank enjoy know this so Frank and John's in New Rochelle this is when I lived in New Rochelle this is old-school Italian place that the fucking food was so good it was right down the street for me I never ate anywhere else I barely could afford to eat there every day but I scraped by every day barely affording it are you drinking more you're just little Sam you gotta finish this that's it we're gonna do a blackout cast oh yeah let everybody know Portland Oregon baby well it's all the shows are almost sold out and we're there Thursday Friday and Saturday at helium comedy club and it's gonna be fun as fuck I can't wait I've never done like a long weekend in Portland I've only done like one night there we're there for a UFC I did one night in Portland have a good fucking time there's great food just get great strip clubs we got no radio so we're going out yeah we got no radio and your helium helium is this shit salute we didn't and we gotta run this house non-stop comedy non-stop jobs comedy tonight Bryan Callen is gonna be down there at Sal's that Vince Doug Benson's gonna be down there towels Sal's call me hole in Hollywood which is this really you're gonna see it you're gonna go really are we in the right fucking place it says Vienna cafe outside doesn't even have a sign that says Sal's comedy yeah the most low-rent ghetto setup ever but it's growing and eventually he's movable he's doing construction he's gonna have the back room it's gonna be much better and bigger and this is just a spot he had a nice spot in La Brea and he's a cool guy and he was always cool to comics and so we did you you recorded secrets gonna be great there's would you ever do what that CD they recorded there I could use it no there's garbage no what happened was wrong it was really weird Joe because if you notice after that I changed everything I hate listening to myself or watching myself let's get this out of the way I got boxes of shit at the house people give me a but I taped yell to see myself and I thought there was a problem then well then I watched a Johnny Depp on Letterman and you let him said to him so after the thing is living in it after I shoot it's over I don't watch myself because really I felt okay I'm not the only retard I don't like nothing about that that's why I never listen to myself doing stand-up I can't take my voice but after I take that special and I listen to it I was so ashamed of myself that I made notes and shit and really helped me and I still I bring the iPod I'm I take myself on short sets during the week I'm up to like six minutes and I gotta shut it off you know I can't listen to the whole thing at somebody it's hard to listen to yourself but it's good it's good because like what you said how you you force yourself just five years twisting you got to do that man you got to do that you can't just take it on the audience's reaction you got to judge it as if you're a comic listening to another comic - you know when I when I listen to my stuff like hmm how would I feel about this is this funny to me you know I listen to it and I you know dude we'll forget about how the audience is laughing what does this make me think does this make me do I think this is the right way to do this bit shy shorten this part is this too verbose is this - this is - that and when you do that man everything gets tighter and stronger you focus on it it's uncomfortable though it's a terrible feeling you feel like it's a weird thing man wait because the same the energy that brings you to be creative the energy that brings you to smash it onstage that is not a selfish energy people think it is because it seems like it is because you're onstage going what the fuck cocksucker and everyone's laughing crap but to do it right to be tuned into those people really you have to be almost selfless you have to be you have to be tuned in this crazy way where it's all just about this fun that we're having it's not about me it ain't about me you know I'm saying so it's like the opposite that you would get from like someone who like listens to themselves like yeah shit listen to me I'm the shit it's almost like you know that that's the poison that thinking like that is the poison that takes away the magic because if you start thinking you're the shanty you start thinking you know you're something special you'll lose your whole connection with the magic you know so that's one of the reasons why you feel uncomfortable you don't want to listen and you don't want to be that guy who wants to get get my car this is my new was my set last night Oh tell me what I did know you ever been in someone's car and they make it less another fucking routine Oh tell me about this new bit is there anything you could add to this like oh geez wrote this a joke I want to try on stage yeah give you a output yes don't try I've never tried own try to do that yeah you say it or you don't say it you know if just the idea that you're trying it out look at ain't a fucking weapon alright it's goddamn joke do a stage do it on a stage take your goddamn chances and the more you do that the more you know what the fuck's gonna work in the first place you don't have to talk to people about stuff like that I know it's crazy cuz with me I have a hard time writing if I love this zone hmm well I'm with people like how I get pissed off to a degree before I go onstage like I like get a little pissed off is something I mean yeah you get mad you get like fake arguments with people I want to do that one time with Eddie Bravo we were on the back at the House of Blues he's like you guys with your fucking bullshit you're fucking me and he's like why is Chile getting upset oh my he's just got to put himself in that place he's not really mad at us though I'm not mad at nobody but he's getting so y'all need some new fucking guys fucking oh I need to use a vaporizer listen cocksucker I was smoking weed with an apple when I was five it's just really crazy how well I'm around you guys sometimes just be mad makes me say something you're like Joey you gotta fucking say that hey yeah and I'll forget for a month I'll forget you guys like Joey you sell a puppet stage yet I'm like but you guys gotta force me I'm like your records keeper I'm always wrong a beautiful Saanich did you do you still doing that thing about a dead dick you're still doing that thing yeah but the soldier yeah don't say anymore these people must see that onstage Oh what you did that we have that video still do you have that video you gotta do something with that video but just even if it's for internal use only I need to see that set get me that set please Brian I thought senousy or no you didn't you didn't get me that's that Joey from from Brea it was last night right it was Sunday night yeah jesus fucking christ I've never seen anybody kill harder than that the only thing that was closer to someone killing harder than that was when you killed in Vegas at the Mandalay Bay Theatre holy shit when you were doing that bit about fucking having that fistfight with the nun holy shit I might not ever laughed that hard at anything ever in my whole life it was the finest thing I've ever seen that we missed a comedy store and that's the bad day because during the week that's what you enjoyed laughing each other laugh at each other yeah that really took away from my career because you see build burgle than a Tuesday yeah and want to die you know he don't care he's so confident sixth and up that you want to try different things and you know we always get into conversations nostalgic about the store at the end there were cuts or whatever but you know I don't take away the truth from anything that's what's really lacking I wish we had and Sal's is becoming thousands becoming they know we just need some more people going on in support I've been out of town on Wednesdays we've got a plenty of plenty of people bill burr was by last week and Sarah Silverman was by the week before and it's Doug Benson's coming down all the time Steve Rannazzisi came crushed it's really fresh really Katt Williams I need to meet that dude I still never met that dude no he is is he in jail I don't know I'm a big fan of that dude that dude makes me laugh he makes me laugh like very few dudes he's one of my top favorite guys to watch that was like if someone sends me a clip someone sent me a clip and says like hey check out this cat Williams clip that fucking thing where he was going after Steve Harvey oh shit that's funny and one of the things he's accentuates something and as they accentuated he slides across the room like he's kicking someone in the nuts and as he does it he goes I'm a little nigga I fight dirty and he sliced slides of the stage lose little foot up in the air like he's kicking something in the boss I remember was a wild man he makes me laugh hard we were talking about him and everybody you yeah no idea that nub is he does oh he does crazy because you know that place where we go to the UFC he does that he does the Pearl at the Palms it's like 5,000 seats that's a big-ass place they have big bands there Katt Williams sells that fucker out man and his pictures of him in the casino with like fur coats on and shit diamonds he's hilarious man he that dude really makes me laugh because he's just going for it all the time he's not trying to be anything other than he is he's just trying to be funny he's just going for it all the time going for the funny going for the funny he's fucking good dude he does a funny thing about fucking Shaquille O'Neal trying to be a cop dude fuck tattle arias is about how Shaquille O'Neal's three-year-old with his height it's oh oh dude really so he wanna have that special and that thing that he did on Michael Jackson that made it mister but you watch that bit on YouTube you watched it and you see the black people they don't even know how to act because you see the truth yeah see the truth is a motherfucker when you say it the right way on stage even if it's wrong what he was saying where's Michael Jackson he's probably smelling little baby's booty holes or something that is a classic fucking line and he just runs from there with a guy yeah he ain't runs with it he attacked when was the last time you seen Michael Jackson with a woman not never he does all that crazy shit bro that shit was that made him Ascar that little piece of him being himself just that little piece that comics pray for that utopia to come one day it's important to have guys like that out there I like guys that are just going for it you know I like guys are out there just fucking going for it there's a lot of people to think the comedy is you know comedy is about the respect of your peers and creating the proper clever joke with the right wording and it's not man it's about entertainment value if it's about your stand-up comedy and to these these days man you comedy doesn't even nearly have to be that deep anymore if you want to get deep man why you tell you know you can you could do a podcast and get deep you could write a blog and get deep you know you could you could have a conversation with an intelligent person get do y'all have to get that deeper your comedy the shit that makes me laugh is Katt Williams slide across the floor kicking some dude in the buff I'm a little nigga I fight dirty he doesn't so natural it's so funny man ah that God kills me man he's got some great shit I I and you know what he had he actually had some real good advice to that I took he said um that he listens to he has on his iPod he has like a playlist of all music that he listens to right before he goes onstage and I'm like damn that's a great idea because I have just like a group of like some of my favorite songs on my ipod that I just I throw on it's on my iPhone - I'll throw them on like when I'm at the gym or whatever whatever but I don't have a specific list just for for stand-up but that's a good fucking idea it's a real good idea so I started doing that I started doing that just based on that because I know music if you listen to like the right kind of music you know the right kind of music can fucking get you in a good groove man you know especially if you haven't sometimes when you know you listen to music too much you for you lose its power you don't have that feeling anymore just loses its impact but every now and then a song will just Jack you and let you know what's possible remember when we were at the Brea improv and we were in the parking lot and I had that Nissan truck and you got out and at that crazy sound system man and you got out of your car you like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan put this fucking CD and right now assemble down a summer hot stuff you put on hot stuff in my heart oh shit oh they're great call some music drives you fucking nuts I love music I love music I love loving skin embolus - lets get in namely the-- oh shit oh love Lynette Skinner I love Allman Brothers from the 70s Leonard Skinner I love that vibe man there's something about that time like if I'm in a pool hall and Sweet Home Alabama comes on it's like like your girlfriend just comes over and rubs your neck you know I'm saying it's like someone comes over and gives you a hug like that song don't don't do you hear that yes oh is sweet so what a great song where this guy's uh blue what's up nothing in it they're singing it man weed holy don't
