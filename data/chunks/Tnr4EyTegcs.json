here we go Joe thank you thank you for being here really appreciate it now it's pleasure to be here it's a fascinating subject of I'm really looking forward to talking to you because the conscious mind and how we how we evolved our conscious mind how we have our conscious mind I mean that is one of the more unique things about being a person it is how did it happen it's only a four billion year story is so shall I tell you how I got shortened to it and where how I ended up thinking about that problem so I've been working on how the brain detects in response to danger for most of my scientific career a little bit before that I'd actually studied consciousness and these people who have their brain split apart to control epilepsy called split brain patients so I got interested in consciousness and also in how behaviors that might be produced non-consciously affect what we know about ourselves so we see ourselves doing something and then we kind of consciously build that into our narrative of what we are but a lot of what we do we do non consciously and when we interpreted that kind of solidifies the fact that you have a non conscious system that's controlling your behavior when in fact you you didn't do it but that system did so you got to make sense of it and generate an explanation of narrative so that that was where I got started and I tried to figure out well what would be some kinds of non conscious systems and said well maybe emotion systems or producing behaviors that we don't fully understand and I started studying that and ended up figuring out how this part of the brain called the amygdala receives information about the environment and then controls orchestrates all the responses fight/flight kinds of responses to help you protect yourself and the you know after many years of doing that I started asking well how far back does this ability to detect and respond to danger go we know that bugs and flies can do that and research had been done showing that bugs and flies have certain molecules in their brain that are important in these kinds of protected defensive behaviors and including the ability to learn about them and store those as memories so it's easier to work on those little tiny invertebrates than it is to do studies in a complex brain even like a rat brain which is pretty complex so given that what these people had discovered about invertebrates I and others who were studying mammals decided to see if the same molecules might be involved in mammalian learning and in fact it was so now that raises the question you got the same molecules doing the same thing the same molecules same genes doing the same thing in ancient invertebrates and then in animals like us so you ask we're back in time is the ancestor that made that possible you know if we've got the same genes either it kind of happens spontaneously separately or there's a common ancestor and indeed there's a common ancestor and that goes back to the first organism first animal that had a bilateral body which means had left right front in the back and a top and a bottom so it has kind of three-dimensional sides before that there were animals like jellyfish that were radial but no front and back they just have a top and a bottom and before that they're sponges which have no front back top bottom they just kind of randomly organize so that's kind of the that's the story of animals sponges - jellyfish - these bilateral animals so the ancestor the bilateral animal that we're talking about gave rise to those two lines one that became all these invertebrates like flies and bugs and snails and octopus and all those things and another two animals like us vertebrates on the fish reptiles mammals birds and so forth so those are two separate lines that inherited these genes that make the memory and defensive behavior possible so you said well how far back in it does it stop there and no it doesn't because you can find those genes on through Jellyfish and then keep going into single-cell organisms now these are like protozoa things that give you intestinal there intestinal parasites so they can you know give you upset stomach and things like amoeba paramecia that you might have heard of and you know biology class in high school or something these have no nervous system and yet they detect and respond to danger they learn about their environment they do all these sorts of things and where did they come from well if you go all the way back to where they came from the even simpler kind of organism still single-cell of course like bacterial cells now these guys go back to the beginning of life the first cell that ever lived some 3.7 billion years ago the gave rise to the entire history of life was a bacteria like cell that started dividing now what's interesting that cell that started dividing is the mother of every bacterial cell that ever lived so that cell is it's it's more like it's you know that cell is still alive because it's they reproduce by cell division so that still cell just keeps reproducing and part of that first cell ever is still with us today and all the bacterial cells that are that are around it's kind of a mind-blowing thing is it's incredibly Manon do we have any idea why the first cell decided to divide well this I shouldn't say it's the first sound that decided what this it's the first cell Tyrael so it's the first cell that was able to sustain life long enough to give off offspring that could sustain and sustain and sustain so there were probably lots of experiments before a kind of cell a kind of group of cells had the right stuff to be able to do that so they those others never made it because they didn't have quite enough of what it took to be a cell that could do that so the first cell I mean it's kind of a hypothetical cell it's called Luca the last Universal common ancestor of life whoa and that's so that's about 3.7 for an eight billion years ago but he could have been a bunch of cells you know a collection of cells cell types that that one of which then you know populated all of life the weird thing about life is not just that it's different and it varies so much but that it's its ever increasing in its complexity well if you go back to the single cell and then you come all the way to today to a person right like what a weird sort of transformation you know it's dangerous to talk about as if we're moving towards some kind of goal you know what I mean we are the goal but nothing I don't think we know we're not we're definitely not I've been more and more thinking that artificial life is the goal mmm-hmm well that I mean there's no goal of life there's survival is the only goal of every organism and that's that's what that first cell was able to do is to generate a set of biological properties that could sustain itself long enough to reproduce that's all you have to do you have to live long enough to reproduce and to do that you have to have energy resources so you have to incorporate nutrients you've got to balance your fluids otherwise you know you have to keep your eye on straight or the cell will get too big and explode or get too small and collapse you've got a thermo-regulate because all of these things depend on the right kind of internal temperature and you have to reproduce those are the survival requirements of a cell but they're also the survival requirements of a human so the same things that a bacterial cell has to do to live through the day and create a species is exactly what we do every day to reproduce ourselves we have to eat drink defend against danger incorporate nutrients and balance loads and ions that way defend you know reproduce and so that was the mind-blowing thing I see I wrote the whole three-quarters of the book is a scientific journalist dude I didn't know I need this this stuff I had to just learn it and there's a lot of fun but it took a lot when when you think about the original Lucca and then human beings do you ever try to extrapolate you ever try to like keep the the process rolling in your mind and see where it where's this gonna go oh yeah so the end of the book I paint a not so rosy picture of what was just going well yeah so let's talk about the end of the book so okay I you know say okay well our but we have these two kinds of significant experiences in our lives that that occupy the human mind one is the kind that we can call an awareness of facts you know I this thing is here and the other is what we might call a self-awareness well it's it's me that is aware that that is a bottle so that's a that's a higher level and that is what appears to be unique to the human mind the ability to represent the self as a subject in other words to have these subjective experiences that have a personal past it's not just the past but your past you lived it and a personal present and a potential future that you can imagine different scenarios of you existing in in the future so that requires I mean that's called Auto noetic consciousness the ability to to self know about where you are in time and it depends that this is an idea that was proposed by a guy named Endel talling a very distinguished psychologist who's retired now but his idea was that the unique aspect of of the human mind is mental time travel the ability to project ourselves in the past present and future and without that kind of consciousness we're limited to kind of factual information something is there you know that might I might be able to say oh food is there or drink is there or a sexual partner is there but not necessarily that I want that food I want you know you might have a kind of biological urge towards it now from the outside it looks like everything we do is intentional and willful so I think I'm controlling my behavior you think you're controlling yours I see you do something that I might have done in a similar situation I think you intentionally control that we see a dog doing something that would be similar to what we do we think we know why the dog is doing that because it had some intention but the fact is if we start taking these things apart in the brain we see that the systems that control very simple behaviors or not the ones that are doing all this high-level conscious thought take the example of the area I work on for all these years which is threat detection now the part of the brain called the amygdala is key to the detection in response to threat in a kind of basic sense you know threat comes up you freeze if there's a snake for example now it's all because of that it's been assumed that the reason you freeze is because you're afraid and therefore that the amygdala is also making the fear because they make de la experiences the fear and that's why you produce the response but I've for the longest time in throughout most of my career I've said the amygdala does not consciously experience fear and yet my work has been used to kind of sell and and defend this idea of the amygdala is the brains fear center I think that's completely wrong the why do you think it's been misinterpreted it's a long complicated story but did you know it's partly it's my fault because I was not as vigilant as I should have been when I was described need to see what I did was I I would talk about the amygdala as a non conscious state of fear non conscious implicit for you and I would say that while the neocortex is where we consciously experience fear and those are separate but that was too complicated the the journal is kind of ignored it and it was just it just became the amygdala the brains fear center even the side just ignored it because you know we were studying and you know I kind of gave up after I said okay we talked about it in terms of fear because you know that there was a lot of money to be directed towards research if you're studying fear and how you could treat that but I think it's you know it's been kind of a wrong path because it's led to the development of medications that don't really work so all the big companies are getting out of the anti-anxiety business Manti for your business because people still feel fearful or anxious when they take them you mean like xanax yeah these are getting out of those annex business benzos sanics I mean they're not either that are repurposing them for other purposes you know but so what happens is you the way these things you know these things the basic drugs were discovered in the 60s almost accidentally in some cases you know not rather than by some hypothesis so the only thing that's been discovered since then is more versions of the same thing with you know slightly fewer side-effects there's been no new discovery of a new kind of drug that's going to help people and why is that well the way the drugs are discovered is that take a rat or a mouse put in a challenging situation give it some different medications and the ones that make the animal less timid in those situations is assumed to make the animal less fearful that's why it's less timid so when you give it to a person they should be less fearful but what you find is say a person with social anxiety might find it easier to go to the party and they're less timid but still like just while they're there and the reason is that we now know is that damage to the amygdala in a person doesn't necessarily also eliminate the feeling of fear it gets rid of the the body responses but not to feel mm so it was a misunderstanding of what behavior can tell us we treat behavior as if it's an ambassador of the mine but behavior is really a tool of survival it goes back to those first cells that ever lived who had to defend against danger bacterial cells move in there in the water and then they come across like you know a gradient of some chemical that's a toxin as soon as they detect that they bounce away and go in a different direction if they go if they find a gradient of something that is a nutrient they keep going and absorb it so they have the ability to detect what's useful and harmful in their lives these are not these are not there for psychology they're simply there to keep the organism alive and many of the behaviors that persist throughout the whole history of life or like that they're there because each of the cell and cells in the body has to you know do all these things to stay alive and so the organism as a whole has to do it as well defend against danger incorporated nutrients balanced LeWitt's thermoregulate reproduce so these are survival tools not mind tools now we can use our mind in conjunction with these things and because we can we conflate every time we're freezing in the front of the snake till the fact that the fear is what's causing it but the fear is a separate process it's the awareness that that stuff is happening to you the awareness of that stuff is happening to you so it said no self no fear oh that's my t-shirt yo that's my merch on the book now how do things like xanax work what what's the mechanical process okay so the that's a part of the class of drugs called benzodiazepine and they will they bind to receptors in the brain the brain has receptors for all kinds of chemicals and many of these things are things that exist in nature and what the development that they bind to as a receptor called the gaba receptor which is the major inhibitory transmitter in the brain so when you have a benzodiazepine binding to a gaba receptor what it's going to do is increase inhibition so the you know the kind of simple reason why those things can help is they kind of in here that so they toned down the brain a bit and so things that would normally trigger a response no longer trigger it so it's like increasing the threshold for something to bother you in a sense and a lot of people enjoy that with alcohol they're not supposed to well the alcohol also attacks those herself or so it's like it you get double with the effect right is that why they tell people don't have sex yeah because you can you know if you take a lot of sin x and drink a lot of booze you can OD or you could just say crazy things not totally be aware do you remember that story about a woman she was I believe she's a publicist and she got on a plane and she's flying to Africa and she said I'm going to Africa hope I don't get AIDS just kidding I'm white lol she's being funny and you laughed and she landed in Africa that's a bit a surprise do you know the story no but there are other stories this was one of the original stories of someone ruining their entire life just putting you know one little tweet online she thought she was being funny like she she would say a bunch of snarky things like that a bunch of funny trying to be fun right but she was on xanax and drinking there and woke up completely oblivious and her life had been destroyed yeah she was fired you know she was a social pariah and I'm pretty sure that was an annex and alcohol that she was blaming it on yeah well you know these are powerful drugs and so you know back to how they work you know they work so a drug like that all of the drugs that we take go to the entire body you know they don't they're not able to just you know find their way to one little spot in the brain to do their trick there's this you know talk about magic bullet by bullet Joyce it might be able to be targeted for specific circuits and but that's you know fantasy at this point so if you reduce inhibition in the entire brain yes you might reduce you know anxiety but you're also going to change of other things so you're gonna make for example forethought and ability to rein in things like the stuff the woman was saying more difficult because they're attacking the prefrontal cortex where you have some inhibitory control over behavior they're going to alter your ability to retrieve and store memories and to attend to things and you know to the extent that these drugs have a positive effect on some people it's been said that part of the reason is that it's kind of a general blunting of emotion it's not an anti-anxiety drug it's just kind of a dulling of everything and you get bangs i.d anti-anxiety as a part of that but if we want to understand how to do better we have to you know figure out what the brain circuit that's really making us anxious is and not just what's making us you know but not toning down to everything it's kind of like you know you go to restaurant but musics too loud so my sis please turn it down so they turn it down a little bit the music stays the same is the same song but it's not as annoying you know because you've turned the volume down and I think that's what a lot of what these medications can do is turn the volume down a bit or turn it up you know depending on what you do correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there some sort of a slingshot effect like after you take these things and your anxieties ramped up afterwards well it can be a rebound you know the fact that can also be kind of a lot of people next day feel depressed you know because they're just the stuff is out of your system and this coming you know if you take it's kind of like taking sleeping pills things like ambien are of the same general category of drugs benzodiazepines and so you get this hangover the next day okay so it's just a physiological response to the medication yes not that if you alleviate some anxiety then the anxiety wants to come back in stronger know that I mean so I you know I've also proposed and in my previous book that we chavin anxiety set point that you know that let's say you're worried about something and all of a sudden that gets resolved I just makes room for the next thing tomorrow so you know we've kind of filled that void because our brain is you know we've developed a brain that has a certain kind of set point for everything it's doing and that just makes room for you know to fill that fill that up if you're an anxious person you probably will always be somewhat anxious so there's no magic bullet that's going to take that out what you have to do is attack the process from knowledge of how it all works and that requires that we have a more sophisticated understanding that when then as possible from simply observing behavior because behavior does not tell you necessarily what's on them on behavior tells you how the brain has responded but you know just to go back to the the fear thread example when let's say I bring you into the laboratory I show you a picture of something like a blue square my colleague list felt - used to be - I use now at Harvard did experiments like this and every time the blue square would come on the person would get a mild shock to their finger and so then she would present the blue square subliminally that means you know really quickly with you know something that follows it that kind of masks that and that prevents the information from getting into the conscious mind and so the person so that I didn't see anything but if you put the person in an imaging machine fMRI and image what's happening that's stimulus that threat the blue square gets to the amygdala turns it on the heart begins to race palms are sweating but the person has no fear hmm the person doesn't know it's there and doesn't experience fear the amygdala is not about fear it's about detecting and responding to danger in order to be afraid that has to reach your conscious mind so that you can experience it as the state of this automatic consciousness we're talking about a self involved consciousness that's hard for people to separate yeah well believe that there's a physical response but that your mind is unaware of it right but when you understand that that's why you couldn't understand that's why the medications are not working they're targeted to work on these underlying systems and rats or mice but that's not where we are experiencing our anxiety but these these medications are very profitable right I mean people enjoy it millions of prescriptions get written yeah we're just gonna phase those out they'll probably you know like they're probably all going off patent and because the company can't find anything new they're not gonna keep pursuing it because you know it's not gonna be a profit anymore but don't people still want them I mean it seems like that's a really popular medication yes I'll be like they'll go too you know they become generics and people will be able to get them for less money and they'll just do with whatever they want yeah off label whatever yeah I mean it's you know it's I I do think that for example the drugs that are available do help people because it's important to reduce the behavioral timidity and the physiological arousal that goes with that because if you don't treat that then the conscious mind will be reactivated by those responses if you only treat the conscious mind then the physiological stuff will bring the conscious stuff back yeah everything will bring back there everything else unless you treat the whole system and you have to do that you have to understand the system and we've just misunderstood it I think for so long I have a friend who he takes it every day takes xanax every day him and he says he needs it he says without it he's just a mess well you know whatever gets you through the day I guess you know it's I'm not a therapist I'm not right advocating that I know I understand but from your perspective from an understanding of the human mind and all the systems that are at work it seems like that's really not the way to do it yeah I mean it's you know I'm sure that that that you know it in a sense maybe that's his crutches way to get through the day and he's come to believe that he needs that much like an alcoholic believes they need to drink yep yeah but I'm not calling him and you know welcome he does like to drink - yeah but he's a great guy what these these systems that are in place and the all the various things that have gotten us to 2019 as a human species when you study anxiety and you study fear and all these different things is are we experiencing high levels of it because there's not as much real physical danger as our ancestors experienced and it's almost like we're looking for it when it's not necessarily there like we're we're programmed to be able to deal with it yeah that's a good point I hadn't thought of it that way but I think that's a good way to think about it I mean you know the philosopher Kierkegaard said that anxiety is the price we pay for the human ability to choose and this is where our auto noetic consciousness comes in our ability to think of ourselves as having a past in the future and to be able to plan and choose in the future you know he said it started with Adam making the first choice as a human in the Garden of Eden and that was where it all began so in our ability you know you can rephrase that statement by saying our ability to choose is what allows us to be anxious because that is what anxiety is a worry about what we have we're gonna make the right decision you know how can we deal with this thing that's coming up it's a worry about the future and the ability to think about the possibilities right like what could go wrong would I go right am i doing the right thing yeah and then to contemplate all those various choices right anxiety yeah so like you know you're walking through the woods as a snake you might freeze but almost instantly that fear that is generated by you freezing and seeing snake morphs into anxiety you know will the snake bite me hmm if it bites me will I get to a doctor will he have the anecdote if I die what will happen to my family you know that's word that's sayings on you so these are they're kind of separate fear is about a danger that's present anxieties about one that hasn't happened yet almost always as soon as you're afraid that makes you anxious about what's going to happen and then there's general existential angst mm-hmm just the life itself existence is that just what is it what yeah and all of that is due to our prefrontal cortex our ability to conceptualize to you know imagine things that have never been imagined before to create art to build to create architecture build buildings imagine going to the moon designing an instrument to do that and actually pulling it off and make sure it can get back all of that is something that our special kind of consciousness enables but it has a dark side which is it also allows us to be incredibly selfish and self-centered and narcissistic and to support tribes and groups and you know unless we I mean I think that the world survives best when it's either completely isolated all the cultures are isolated or if we could also somehow be together in a more unified way because of the direction we're going now where each country is isolating itself but it still so entangled with all the others is recipe does it for disaster is this because we evolved essentially without long term travel I mean we kind of evolved to stay in whatever area the resources were in when we're hunters and gatherers and then somewhere along the line somebody figured out boats and how to get on a horse and the next thing you know you're visiting I think it's more about you know we have a special kind of inquisitiveness that we can because we can mentally model the next step and plan what are the options you know try to anticipate the the problems that are going to come up and take those steps and and that's a pretty special thing but it also allows us to plan in a kind of devious way where you know me or my group is going to benefit and if mine benefits I don't want the other one to benefit because we got to keep everything separate mmm so it's you know consciousness are kind of consciousnesses are you know greatest achievement but also probably our worst aspect move but it's but it's what makes us human is imagining humans with no consciousness is impossible and no it's a there's no way to go in that direction that's so is is the key to this thing as the human race is it managing our consciousness of perhaps maybe work like yours giving us the tools to understand what are the mechanisms involved that maybe that can help us sort of navigate our biological traps and maybe I mean I think it's you know certainly we don't i think the i have no idea what your position on climate change is but personally i think that things are happening and something needs to be done that's clearly things are happening and that you know there was i read a couple of editorials probably in the new york times or something a couple of months ago one was about how yes the things are changing and we have a right to worry but you know we shouldn't worry about the earth as you know the famous quote is guy is a tough bitch so the earth will survive but the configuration of life on it is unlikely to continue to be the same under the conditions the more that everything changes the conditions of life change and the first things to go and this is what happened to the dinosaurs or large energy demanding organisms because as the conditions change and you know the climate that we've lived in we've succeeded because we were able to benefit from that kind of climate but as the climate begins to change our kind is not going to be able to succeed as well because those conditions are you know the waters are rising the deserts are expanding all these things are happening and it's just not going to be yeah species don't last that long few million years and they go so our time maybe we've only been around for what three hundred four hundred thousand years and something well depend on what what we call we yeah but then the inner dolls were around quite a bit longer than that yeah they're not here anymore so we don't have a I mean I think that we can use our minds to try and you know help us get through this but that's only gonna work if we can do that collectively that's the scary part we have to work together collectively as a world because these are not local issues these are global issues yeah and that is who has that good luck getting you know especially getting other countries like China to comply yeah but yeah you see the small successes I mean like auto companies deciding well we need to you know rein in the emissions and they there's probably a profit motive underlying that at some point sure and people are conscious there's green dollars Yeah right like you wanna like when when you think about technological achievements and you think about the the conscious mind and the ability to create in the creative process do you envision the possibility of some sort of a technological solution to a lot of the problems that we're facing I has to be a social solution social how so we have to we have to figure out how to balance this worldwide you can't this we can do whatever we want in this country if we could do what we want but you know if if even if we were the best country in the world for the environment that wouldn't solve the problem you know it's it's a worldwide problem you know Amazon forest that's affecting a lot of people you know it's just not a it's not a simple thing that one country can solve right but if one country takes steps and imposes some sort of a technological solution that pulls carbon from the atmosphere that does enhance some sort of a cooling process to bring homeostasis to bring some sort of a like generally agreed upon state right of the environment if that's technologically possible I mean that's going to come out of the creative mind right well you know I don't want to go too far off into my not area of expertise like climate and salt labs I just think there's I think I would from the kind of the social perspective and what are the ranges contributed but I don't wanna I don't think I can really dress the details of all that right but even like socially if we did address it socially we're still gonna have to deal with the actual physical limitation right of the just the environment that we live in and what we've done this how do some how other mitigate it yeah I agree yeah so but yeah so I think you know creators coming along and trying to find technical solutions that's great when you analyze the human mind and knowing what you know about the thought processes and the way people think and work when you see people in denial of climate change and when you see people that are so enamored with the the concept of capitalism and big business that they don't really think that it's a big deal or they want to deny that it's a big deal so that they can continue short-term profits right what is that like those mechanisms likewise watching that take place in a monkeymod yeah what do you what are you thinking when you see that happen with humans I you know I don't think it's simple it's not simply denial of climate change for climate reasons I think there's a lot of social you know within certain groups there's social stigma for being Pro environment yes and so it's tribal tribal it's it's people yet people cling together and it's a kind of form of self-protection that by identifying a set of issues that we all can agree upon because they're kind of dictated top-down in a sense that or our thing and then that thing is somebody else's things yeah yeah that's a weird aspect of being a human being right these tribal identity things where if you're in this group you must be pro-choice and if you're in this group you must be pro-life you must be anti-war you must be pro-second amendment no there's very little deviation and and that that's left right that's everything I mean that the belief systems rigid belief systems a you know part of just part of being and when you look at politics and you know that these belief systems are when do you find it odd that we have these like sort of polar opposites or at least left-right choices red blue choices that we've limited ourselves to these very distinct tribes right and that's yeah I think that's unfortunate but that's where we are is there a way out of that I think the political side just have to take that one what do you think is the source of creativity like somewhere along the line I mean and we've seen it right I mean there's some speculation and scientists have sort of generally agreed that some monkeys are in the Stone Age that some primates are in what would be considered Stone Age they're starting to use tools they're starting to use sticks and it is a famous photograph that I love of an orangutan and where are we gonna get a copy of that we should get that orangutan with a spear we make a note of that there's a crazy of Ranga tang image of an orangutan holding on to a branch and then spearfishing mmm it's amazing and apparently he had seen humans do it and that's where he learned the behavior imitation yes but still that is a primate using a weapon right to try to spear fish look at this photo is that incredibly nice I mean that is incredible that's like really thoughtful and skillful and the way he's hanging I mean my goodness look at that I love that picture that picture is amazing yeah now this the creativity that allows you to get food when you couldn't get food allows you to escape from environmental conditions allows you to escape from predators all these things are rewarded by the continuing of your genetics so but there are other things that come into play one of the specialties that that came along I think is a byproduct of having language and by language I don't mean words but what language did but what was required for language to come out of the brain which is the development of a cognitive sort of architecture in our brain that allowed all kinds of mental jumping around so for example for most animals to learn you know who to trust and who not to trust and what some what who's what in a given situation who's gonna do what to whom by just looking around they have to go through trial and error learning it see the experience all of that a lot but the human mind can simulate create a mental model and instantaneously make those kinds of predictions on the basis of very limited information and this is based on something well we the relation to language is that syntax gives you those kinds of options because you can you know you have past present future States that can be related to you and two others and so forth and personal pronouns are very important in terms of me I mine you yours that those the the point when those come in and a child is the first point when I think self-awareness can fully be tested and shown have some people say well they have it but they just couldn't express it others say no that the arrival of the pronoun personal pronouns are very important in the child's development of a sense of self but anyway so language changes the brain changes the cognitive architecture of the brain and allows for something just to throw out a technical term hierarchical relational reasoning just the ability to think across kind of conceptual categories laterally and horizontally so that the information you can just jump around and that's kind of what creativity is the ability to just jump around in middle space and come up with something by a unique combination of those things do you do you think that there's variation in terms of the types of languages like Chinese versus Spanish versus that they allow you to interface with the world in a different way as the language is structured very different yeah I think that's absolutely right but I don't know if enough about other languages to say exactly how I think it was Malcolm Gladwell if it was the outlier so they discussed this like the limitations of certain languages in terms of pilots was it Gladwell I think it was where they were they're discussing how Korean Airlines because they have sort of a hierarchy of you know the way you're supposed to treat the upper levels of management and they that they had to force these pilots to all speak English so that they didn't have this hierarchy like that this presumed hierarchy being able to address situations that planes had crashed because co pilots were in their place they were put in their place and weren't allowed to address pilots and that once they had switched over to English that the language like theirs so many different versions of dealing with your boss or someone who's an upper-level person there's so many different ways that you were supposed to address them and that they had eliminated all that by using English yeah it made me think like just using different styles of language the way human beings communicate here is very different than the way people communicate say you know some African countries write that we have these different styles of interpreting the world around us and those in turn have a profound effect on the way we sort of interface with the world I think that's definitely right so it's a you know it's so interesting to think about emotion and language so it's often said that an emotion like fear is universal across the world but I don't think that's actually correct what's universal is danger and the way fear is interpreted by different cultures is obviously different I mean different the agents have a different kind of perspective on fear every culture has their own perspective on fear so if it's fear is the you know the the kind of cultural assembly that you have in your brain in response to danger so every culture has to have a language of fear but not because fear is universal because danger is universal hmm and what they interpret as danger is different right and fear for one person something could could create fear whereas for another person the exact same situation would not right depending upon their personal experiences and maybe even their genetic makeup well yeah I mean yeah I'm genes contribute so we every part of our brain is under some kind of genetic influence so every for example the amygdala will be genetically kind of slightly more roughed up in one person than another so a little more sensitive to danger and so that person might be responding more to danger in part because of genes but also maybe because of experiences that they've had and so then the conscious mind is seeing those responses and starting to conclude oh I'm an anxious fearful person and that all of that information gets collected in what's called a fear schema which is a body of knowledge of everything you know about danger and including the way you react you react to danger and you're just you know who you are in terms of danger and so whenever you encounter danger that schema is what's called pattern completed so presence of a threat in the world is enough to go into your brain and activate those memories about danger that give you and the non conscious representation you know an activation of this fear schema that is what then bubbles up into consciousness that's your experience of fear is what has been activated in your fear schema knowing what you know and then watching whatever anxieties or fears may play out in your own mind is that for lack of a better term a mindfuck well I mean not heed this so much and you're human yeah I assume you have the same things I have a lot of anxieties I'll do them and curiously it helps to some extent in 1996 I published a book called the emotional brain and few years later I started finding out from therapists that the lot of patients were reading the book with their therapist and they were saying that it was really helping them understand why you know how different things were happening that the the amygdala was causing them to react in certain situations but their fear was their conscious understanding of those reactions and those are not the same thing and that separation helped them you know navigate their own situation and in a situation of danger separating out okay that's my body is responding this way my mind is responding this way and these are two separate things I need to work on in control have you studied various ways that people mitigate anxiety and fear like meditation and yoga and all these different things that sort of change people States I mean I haven't I you know I haven't studied it myself but I have researched it a bit after I try to do meditation myself because I think it's the probably the most direct and effective way in the moment to sitting in the room outside waiting for it just had my hat and sunglasses on just trying to chill out meditate a little bit get ready for you mm-hmm do you do that on a regular basis you know it's hard to maintain it because life gets busy and it seems like it the hardest time to do it is when you need it most right yeah I think it's one of those things like hygiene well you sort of have to say well it's hard to take a shower they don't have to take shit don't stink it you have to brush your teeth yep you get cavities you have to meditate you'll go crazy yeah it's perfect that's the way it should be done I think that is what so when you examine those kind of tools like tools that people have sort of imagined or created to sort of in some way alleviate anxiety or enhance perspective do you do you spend much time dwelling on the creation of those things and what's going on there what I mean by the creation well like a human had to figure gotta meditate Bryson had to figure out these modalities these different ways to sort of interface yeah so let's take that from take that to the nature of most approaches to fear and anxiety today hold this hold off the meditation part slightly okay so we have you know psychopharmacology it's a major line of attack and also what's called cognitive behavioral therapy and which is arose as a form first called behavioral therapy because it came out of the behaviorist movement which said there's no consciousness you know that that the human is a stimulus response organism that is based on the history of reinforcement with certain kinds of situations so behavior therapy was about using Lovan or operant conditioning to change how the brain would respond to threats and how people would act in those situations it wasn't about the mind at all is all about behavior and then cognition was added to that so that became cognitive behavioral therapy but again the cognitive change was used as a way of changing behavior because so much emphasis has been placed on behavior in our culture including in the drug therapy world it's all based on changing measurable things like behavior and physiology and that I think that that's why all of these things in some sense have not worked out as well as we would like you know the best in the best medications and the best CBT trials will give you like 75 percent record of help in a group that's pretty great though isn't it you still got 25 that's but yeah but you also have to extract out the placebo effect mm-hmm and in many of these drug studies for example depressive anti depression drugs the placebo effect is you know only the drug effect is only slightly better than the placebo effect but when you have cognitive behavioral therapy there's I mean you're actually going for the placebo effect right I mean you're trying to nothing wrong with let's say perfect in that sense though you are trying to sort of you're trying to use some sort of strategy with your mind and therapy whether it's meditation what are you doing you're trying to enact change right and if that changes enacted there's not a pill involved right so it is kind of like the same mechanism that's involved in a placebo effect your mind is creating this new change yes and so but the question is a person that goes through the motions but doesn't get the therapy right how much are they changed by simply by kind of going through it there's so many variations with humans or I'd like to find out like are they lazy self-destructive like and why is that the case like maybe all of the above oh yeah yeah but whenever you have I think 75% it's amazing yeah you consider if you have a group of people what are the odds if you have a group of a hundred people what are the odds of twenty-five of them are gonna be lazy pretty good right yeah pretty I mean I would bet a ton of money that twenty-five percent of those people don't do what they're supposed to do all the time right so you know you're right but I think the the issue is from the scientific point of view we need to know exactly what really works what's different from placebo right so that we can see what to build for medication for medication for cognitive therapy as well but the therapy thing is so strange to me because you put okay maybe we're using the wrong word with placebo because placebo is a word for a medication that has a psychosomatic effect right well it's it's the control group that doesn't get the treatment that you get that it's not really doing anything physiologically but your body is interpreting it as medicine and saying alright change is coming and then the change comes and that is a real thing but when you're thinking about cognitive behavioral therapy you're thinking about using techniques and strategies to change the way you think and behave though so the concept of the placebo effect doesn't really apply there well you have to have a control group right in the study you have to have randomized control in order to make it so when you have cognitive behavioral therapy and you have randomized control and you have a control group do you just give them shitty therapy we need to get a therapist on here to give you that to that cuz I don't know the answer you gone to therapy yourself I have yeah did you do that to examine this I you know I mainly went into it with for the meditation port hmm to try and calm some of my you know restlessness has writing and all this study that you had to do to write these books has that enhanced you I mean that you have much more of an understanding about what's at play than the average person does well you know again it's kind of like the patient who's reading the emotion of bearing with the their therapist I think by writing those books I learn a lot and it helps me see things and that doesn't necessarily help me lead my life any better but it I think I understand it better but no self no fear yeah well no self no fear means that you have to be you have to have this automatic consciousness ability in order to be afraid and that is a special human quality the ability to put yourself in the moment in your past and in your future if it's not you that's gonna be harmed by that snake then you don't have to worry about what its gonna do to you so if you are part of it then you worry and it becomes you know it's an emotion when you're involved so I think emotions this is a crazy idea that's in the book that emotions didn't arise through natural selection really well that's the idea that they were byproducts of other capacities that came along first you had some kind of crude language that enabled this hierarchical relational reason to jump across you know language gave you categories to like conceptualize things hierarchical reasoning allowed you to jump across those categories and those kinds of things allow you to conceptualize yourself as an entity with an experience so you had to have a self that could do that kind of reasoning and across those conceptual categories and that is what enabled an emotion the ability to put yourself into a significant situation so now that it's here now that we have once emotions are there then they become selected but they weren't selected by for example the amygdala having evolved to be the fear center and inherited that from animals your animals probably have some kinds of experiences but it's scientifically it's very hard to know what they have well we know like dogs have emotions right dog wha dogs get happy well you see their behavior right but I'm not saying they aren't but scientifically you can't measure that right but if you have a dog and you come home and he's so excited to see you and he's running around circles that seems very emotional well a kin yeah but I don't said let's talk about the brain for a second okay so the parts of the brain circuits in the brain that are involved in this kind of auto noetic emotion that I'm talking about this self involved in motion that's so human such a human quality I the part of the brain that I think is important and this is still hypothesis it's not a fact is something called the frontal poles very very front part of the prefrontal cortex that region is unique to the human brain no other not even another ape has that now other parts of the prefrontal cortex are present in other primates all of the primates but not in any other mammal so if we can figure out in the human brain what that frontal Pole does and what that other part that all primates have do then that gives us an anchor for speculating about what other primates what kinds of experience other primates have given what those parts of the brain enable in us and that would allow us to then extract what other mammals don't have that we have because they don't have those parts of the brain so it's a it's a kind of you know use of the brain to tell us some things about what might exist in other animals but there's no way to ask a dog what's on your mind right who can measure the brain with an fMRI or something along those lines where you get a reading of but that's not an answer I mean it scarlet right so a human like I can you know if you ask me is there a pen here on the table I say yes I can respond verbally or I can point to but when I'm responding verbally I can only do that for something I'm conscious of I can't respond to something on unconscious of by naming it follow that hmm other animals can only respond non-verbally so they don't have that other kind of response that is only reflecting a conscious state so I'm not saying they don't have anything but scientifically is very hard to know what they have and the fact that we can study it we know and for example fear that the fear itself probably doesn't depend on the amygdala but that all the behavior that we see does makes us have to be cautious about observing behaviors that look like they're based on fear love and all these other emotions when we can't really know because we can't measure that well I mean it's a tough problem again I'm not saying that's not there it's just like right I guess scientifically you know you have to you have to the evidence yes you have to now now measuring it in humans is I mean there's this concept of people I'm an emotional person you know I'm emotional like you I get emotional like people love to say yeah those those kind of things what is it possible to measure varying degrees of emotional response in terms of like how it's affecting a person physiologically whether or not these emotional responses are physiological or whether you've gone down a well grooved psychological path that you've been sort of participating in your whole life so that you have these sort of triggers this happens and then up I'm gonna I'm gonna start crying this happens up I'm gonna get angry and people sort of fall into those paths without self-reflection without this ability to be objective and introspective and go why am i reacting this way like what maybe you should stop being so emotional Joe right anybody ever said that to you yes my wife is say well what does that mean but you know what I mean like the this the varying degrees of promotion or response and whether or not those are beneficial or whether or not they just detract from your experience or inhibit your your ability to be productive so you know I you've really nailed a lot of interesting stuff in there and you know it's a very kind of deep analysis of what's going on so the problem is that our language is so bad that all these terms that we have we borrow from what's called folk wisdom or folk psychology you know that they've come through the ages and this is true in every aspect of science that you have folk terms you know folk physics becomes real physics and then the folk stuff goes away bulk biology becomes real biology and then you know the folk stuff goes away but in psychology the folk stuff never goes away because we always experience the folk aspect of it when we have a conscious experience that's what our conscious minds is our folk psychology of ourselves and of others and of other animals but the underneath that is the part that we can get rid of the folk psychology because we can understand how behavior is control how these physiological responses are control and ain't because you know we've had fears causing it you know but but when you're afraid you're almost always running from the bear and feeling fear but and so you assume that when you're running from the bear fear is what causes you to run but fear is not the answer fear is your awareness that all that should is happening to you mmm but also the the ability to contemplate the consequences right yeah that's gonna get me me yeah that's all that's all you know one interpretation after another running forward but no self no fear that's no possible either right well if though I mean you need the self to be afraid yeah so I mean that's your and to be consciously afraid but you can react to danger without the self and that's what yeah that's K you you find yourself freezing or you're walking in New York City and you jump back in the bus goes flying by so you've reacted to danger but only afterwards do you feel freer when you cognitively become aware that that's happening well in that sort of a situation but in the situation like we were walking down a dark alley and then you see some guy who seems to be following you yeah yep so now you're you're in a situation where you're in a potentially dangerous situation so now you're anxious about what's gonna happen so you're not starting with restarting the things I did't worry about what's gonna happen nothing there's nothing there that's made you but then one of you ramps it up hey Joe yeah let's come over here man I'd like to borrow some money from you oh my gosh it sounds fear is that fear now you've got a specific threat and yeah so you now you're into fear and then that's gonna morph into another anxiety about what the hell is this guy gonna do to me right so but all of that Malloy is gonna go into your brain and trigger your muscle tension your heart to race and so forth and the dark alley is going to go to your cortex and you're going to be interpreting the fact that you're in a dark alley and your heart is racing in terms of being anxious and fearful and all of that but they're happening separately it's not one bundle it's like separate things in the brain and once we understand that it becomes I think a much easier problem how to approach problems of fear and anxiety you've got to separately treat the behavior in the physiology from the conscious thoughts and in between those two you also got to change the cognitions that underlie the the conscious experience but also the cognitions can trigger behavior so you know one of the things we've we've proposed a proposes in my last book anxious was a kind of test program for exploring this where be kind of a three-part three-step program first you would you'd have to do it with something simple like a smart or phobic of what spider phobic or snake phobia oh so you would do exposure therapy subliminally that means you're imminently present the picture of a snake or the spider so fast the conscious mind doesn't know it's there so like those old hungry eat popcorn things exactly and that's a very common technique in psychology so they would show you a film and there'd be at one or two frames of a spider if you had a wrap or just a picture you know art but could be a film yeah okay and but it would have to go very fast in the film so they would so with a picture you just present it really quickly and because you know normally if you show a spider phobic try to do expose your therapy they don't want to do it because they don't want to deal with spiders but they they they're conscious mind doesn't know what's happening because it's going through subliminally so the amygdala is being tamed by the exposure and now they can look at the picture without you know the body reacting they're not jumping they're not their heart isn't racing because the amygdala has been turned off so all those body responsive have calmed down so now the person can kind of go some undergo some cognitive change about looking at spiders and so forth and then finally once you've done those two steps the brains ready for talk therapy and meditation and other kinds of mindfulness approaches because all of the the impediments to all that have been put aside by these first two steps so as anybody ever like officially cured someone of arachnophobia or video field video phobia or you know fear of snakes or spiders like those are those seem to be almost like deep-seated genetic fears well that we right now our ancestors yes had a snake and but they very right which is what's weird that means they're certainly experienced venomous snakes and but there's something about some people have almost illogical reaction to it that it's often been speculated that this is some sort of a genetic memory of someone perhaps in their ancestry lines surviving a snake attack or losing someone to a snake it's more you know turns out that the it's more about the ability to rapidly learn about those kinds of dangers than to innately respond mmm so there seems to be it's called prepared learning so you have an evolutionarily based thing that's with you that everyone has some version of but you know varies from individual to individual and then some people are prone to rapidly learn that either because of other experiences or because of their particular genetic makeup and so they tend to go down the road of acquiring these kinds of phobias now so it's the problem with treating that by just extinguishing it through exposure is that the extinction is always impermanent you know if you once you've been reduced nothing is wrong this is true in a rat or person let's say the rat has been given a tone that's been paired with a shot and then it hears the tone 20 or 30 times stops responding but then if it goes back in the the room of the chamber where the shock had occurred the tone will again bring it elicit it and the spyder phobic returns to the place where he or she was bitten by a spider or a place where spiders it was supposed to be present it can come back so these are imperfect temporary solutions they're not enough and that's why I mean they're called these are called you know reinstatement and things like that because they pop back up so maybe medications can help tamp that down a bit so medications are useful in in that sense of being able to control the behavior in the physiology but less so in terms of changing the mental state because you know how could you possibly design a medication that would know how to change the content of a mental state I mean that seems like an impossible yes and that's what you want to do you don't want to change all mental states right you want to change the one content you know I'm afraid of spiders yeah uh it's it's so fascinating though how people vary so widely in their their reaction to certain fears or to certain things that could induce fear whether it's dogs or you know whatever irrational thing that people have the the source of that is really often speculated that there's like some sort of a genetic component to it do you buy into that so let's say let's say that you know in any kind of situation like that there are multiple systems in the brain that are going to be involved we're gonna isolate the amygdala as you know hypothetical part of that system that is detecting and responding to the stimulus so we're gonna go into the amygdala and focus on one little part of it called the lateral nucleus that doesn't matter but it's the part that gets the input from the outside world so that is the gateway into the amygdala so now let's talk about let's say it's got 100,000 cells and neurons and each of those neurons is going to have a bell curve that's based on the genes that made that cell and whatever kinds of electrical signals it's had throughout the life of the organism so you can have a hundred thousand bell curves you know various degrees that when the stimulus comes in those cells that that are activated their little bell curves are going to determine how much they respond to that and that's going to propagate to other cells that have their own bell curves in areas and so on down the line that what happens at the level of behavior is a very complicated kind of summation of all those bell curves of all those cells that happen to be activated so it's not like you know one thing is progress it's not like a brain areas program it's all about what's happened at those specific cells both through genetics and experience so we often kind of oversimplify things by thinking well there's a gene or an area that has inherited that thing when you think of human beings and you think of what we used to be when we're some sort of a lower hominid and now what we are now and you think of all these various components that are at play do you do you ever try to imagine what a human of a thousand years or ten thousand a hundred thousand years from now will be like well they're they're gonna be different you know that we're not every organism is in constant change you know the racial mixing interbreeding happens and so in the mutation random mutations we're living longer and so you know that's creating meat people are having babies later that will change a lot of stuff so we're gonna be a different thing at some point we may split out into a whole new kind of human the the thing about people having babies older I mean there's certainly physical limitations when people start having babies older but on the plus side you're dealing with someone that has a lot more life experience that's raising a child yeah you know versus my mom had me when she was 20 21 you know what the fuck do you know you don't know much but if you're a woman who has a child when you're 40 well hey that's a rich life of a lot of experiences and maybe you can impart some of that wisdom to your child and look at things in a different way and maybe that in turn will raise a child that's more balanced you know I'm talking out of my area here but I I think that probably you know the eggs sit around for a long time and I don't know what the effect of aging on the egg is mmm I just don't know well there's also a big factor with the male sperm male sperm is a thing and that's one of the main contributed by autism and schizophrenia is supposedly I've heard of that you know older fathers are more likely to have male sons that are schizophrenic yeah that makes sense I would say that is the fact but I've heard that well it all makes sense that there be some glitches and the matrix's yeah I mean we're not we're not supposed to live that long are we not what are your thoughts on people that are trying to live longer and and trying to sort of squeeze out as much time as I can on this rock no it's like I see a lot of old people that just don't want to live anymore and I understand that you know your body starts falling apart mind is going what's the point at that point yeah but what about the people that can keep it together yeah yeah I guess if you keep it together you want to like you know okay let's just go sports okay let's go to the moon and go to Mars well pharmacological solutions to it I mean if we if there was some sort of a genetic component that they identified to aging and they gave the option to reverse the process would you participate or do you like it do you like the finite nature of this existence uh I do I think so it's like I knew you I think I don't and that I take certain medications but rather just live most of my life as as possible without them so what medications do you take you know blood pressure and mainly blood pressure stuff yeah do you exercise not enough that's all yeah they got a big effect on anxiety and a big effect on just yes a general alleviation of angst so that's a good example of something I know I should do yet is that a discipline issue uh I used to be kind of discipline but what happened I've been using it a lot to you you know to do things like I really want to do like writing or making music and so those are the things that kind of I know I should like do the exercise too so I can do more of that longer yeah you think do you have a finite amount of discipline uh possibly each person has it you know define that has that sort of anxiety quotient that discipline quotient that we kind of you probably can work that like a muscle yeah what imagine you can yeah yeah you could become something different might me and my friends have this thing that we did last year called sober October for the entire month you know no alcohol no marijuana no drugs and crazy exercise like last year we had a competition to see like who could exercise the most we wore these heartrate monitors and we we measured points like you get a certain amount of points at 80 percent of your max heart rate per minute what my point is one of the things that I got out of this and we all got out we all talked about it because we were exercising hours and hours a day an incredible alleviation of anxiety incredible like to the point exercise regularly but I don't exercise at that level that that level that we were doing cuz we were in this competition was really a lot of cardio but my god that runner's high is real yeah I felt amazing I mean I felt like so good all the time the alleviation of angst was unlike anything the internal chatter yeah that sort of can fuck with your head yeah that just didn't exist anymore well I think that that's wonderful that you're saying that because you have so many followers and I think that's such fantastic information to convey to them it is and it's so available to all of us I mean anybody that can move their body can experience us and I don't recommend what we did because we were working out five hours six hours but even was you know I walk I live in New York so I walk a lot and that's great yeah right you have to yeah but I mean just that alone yeah it's it's there's many people that don't walk you know you just sit here and then you move to that spot you sit there and you get in the car you sit there yeah you get on the train you sit there and there's very little use of the body and the body starts to atrophy yeah by pumping that blood through the system and cleaning out the pipes and getting that air into the lungs and forcing yourself to move when it's over you feel better I'm breathing better and imagining it imagining this exercise what do you take what about nature do you take any time in nature at all do you go to Central Park well we have a house up in Sullivan County in the Catskills oh that's nice how often you get a chance to get out there we spend a lot of time there in the summer oh that's and do you go better when you're up there yeah definitely interesting right it takes a couple of days to like get into the rhythm yeah but then it's good but once you do do you ever think man what the fuck am i doing living in Manhattan always buildings yeah you know my wife I'm not shitting my wife's in New Yorker so I'm by births a week there we need we need to go in and then we want to come back my friend Jeff has a place on Fire Island it's a beautiful place he beautiful and he lives in Manhattan as well but he says like as a welder birthday your birthday yeah he says as he's gotten older he really don't doesn't think that he could live in Manhattan anymore if it wasn't for this ability to escape right and go somewhere and just wake up in the morning look I'll see the ocean having a cup of coffee moving to Brooklyn was kind of like that getting out of Manhattan yeah yeah I know that if you don't live in New York that may not make a lot of sense to people so you know you Manhattan is just like this supercharged all the time and it's not it's not a try thing it's you you know you it's it's a true thing that you once you get out of Manhattan everything is just a notch down yeah and I've definitely step off the subway and you kind of feel a little bit more relaxed do you think that's cause Brooklyn I mean it's just speculative but there's still a lot of people in Brooklyn yeah but there's no skyscrapers whew I mean they're starting to be lots of tall buildings yeah but what's a good tall building in Brooklyn like 30 30 right residences you know what's Manhattan like 89 yeah there's some giant buildings I'd looked out the other day I guess from the airplane and there's something in north Manhattan that looks like it's way above the Empire State Building in terms of size I don't know what that is if you thought about that existence like in terms of like how unnatural it is and how recent it is this ability to jam untold millions or how many people are in Manhattan oh boy you know I have no idea like I think eight million is something in New York City but probably and then for some commuters as well so eight million plus all the people that come in from the different places to work there yeah and just stuffed into an incredibly small area and stacked on top of each other yeah that has got to be a completely new psychological State for the human animal all right yeah there was just I remember when I first got into psychology I was reading something about something called a behavioral sink it was about how rats living in an impoverished environment under highly crowded conditions their behavioral repertoire sort of like diminished a lot so I think that was you know sort of used to kind of challenge urban living and to blame a lot of urban decay in the seventies on I don't think it was necessarily a good idea but it was kind of a way to explain some things that I think it wasn't really good at explaining yeah it's true that that the people do live under fairly crowded conditions but you can't explain everything in terms of very simple processes are you aware of the studies that they did where they set cameras up on streets and they set them in distance apart and they measured footsteps how fast people walked and then they measured the way people talk how many syllables and how many sentences they can get in in a certain amount of time and through measuring footsteps and how fast people walked and the way they talked they could accurately determine how big the city was that they live that way yeah they could accurately figure out whether or not they lived in a high population density whether or not they lived in a small town by the way they talked and the way they walk interesting that there's a profound effect I have a caller I used to have a colleague at NYU named John is that Yale now and he used to do these studies where he would he was a social psychologist he would have people that come in students come into the lab and take these letters and they were like scrambled and he'd have to like they'd have to unscramble them and to send so I guess it was words and you'd have to unscramble them and put them into a sentence and if the unscramble sentence was about being older and elder him anything about being elderly and age it would take the students longer to walk down the hallway to get to the elevator afterwards oh is this like activating this kind of schema of aging that top-down had some kind of effect on the way you walk that well that makes sense and you do see what's really interesting to me is when you see the differences between people who are the same age who behave and think very differently and I always wonder how much of that is biological how much is that a psychological how much of that is like well this person just has a better genetic makeup you know and so they've you know in their 50s they still have tons of energy whereas this person maybe has a shit makeup and bad lifestyle choices and they look like what we considered you know an old man when we were younger then well I mean we're all so complicated and there's so many factors to go into you know you know shaping how we end up at any point in our life where do you think selfishness came from out of noetic consciousness so that's this ability to put yourself into an experience which as I said earlier is responsible for our greatest achievements as a species but also is what will potentially do us in it allows us to not only envision a world in which you know we can be self less self you know not selfish but help others but also how to exclude others and it I think it's a natural basic animal instinct to stay alive obviously you know with Richard Dawkins said the theory The Selfish Gene animals are incredibly selfish and you know their struggle for existence so that kind of automatic selfishness is there but what the auto noetic mind allows us to do is to be intentionally willfully selfish to allow us to choose to do these things for our own personal good for example I think that the the auto noetic human human mind is the only entity in the history of life that's been ever to put the organism and we're talking about the conscious mind being a small part of the what's going on in the cortex to put all of the rest of the brain and all of the body at risk for the simple sake of a thrill mountain climbing you know swimming and shark-infested waters or taking drugs at dangerous levels no other organism can commit suicide in the sense of intentionally planning to put an end to an entity that it knows has the possible end so our conscious minds are special in good ways and bad ways yeah the conscious mind that seeks thrills what do you think is the root of that like I've always wondered like why certain people are drawn to doing like flips on motorcycles or certain people are drawn to climbing mountains with no ropes like what do you think that is you know I'm just guessing I don't really know but I think that we each have these kind of physiological states that that we try to maintain you know some kind our homeostatic levels are are different and some people need a little more adrenaline or a little more you know I hate to use adrenaline in the kind of cheap way of you know just saying it's just need more of a rush or kind of potty activity because all that also affects the brain and so consciously you strive you may go looking for those kinds of things to get the rush and it's you know it's a it's sort of on the spectrum of addiction in the sense where you need that that physiological change that the drug induces but you know we also have addictions in our lives that are habits and things that that we develop and pursue they're not necessarily good for us but that we kind of feel compelled to do do you know what Alex Honnold is yeah yeah I've had him on podcast a couple of times and every time I talk to my hands start getting sweaty nervous for folks who don't know who we're talking about he's the probably the most famous free solo climber in the world and he climbs these seemingly impossible mountains with no ropes and there's video of him doing it like this drone footage of him climbing these Peaks and my hands just pouring but when I talk to him what's really interesting is he's a calm rational intelligent man who's very thoughtful and he's he's a very kind guy he doesn't seem like some you know I think of when I think of someone who likes to do flips off with a motorcycle or do radical I think of some crazy wild thrill seeker some-some dude who just needs to constantly or a woman who needs to be constantly freaked out he's not that guy and when he describes it what's really interesting is he goes it's very mellow he's like if there's anything if there's really a thrill I've done something horribly wrong like the real thrills are so scary because that means you're about to die so he's instead of getting the thrill he's getting that piece yeah but he's getting a piece from putting himself extreme okay and there's also the thing of other people praising you for your risk-taking which is an odd thing about humans and they've shown through natural weather there's a natural selection aspect of with females and mates that females are attracted to men that do those crazy things and take crazy risks for some strange reason whether it's some sort of a remnant of our ancient past like that thrill-seeking a man has got not gonna be he's not gonna shy away from combat he will protect our children or something like that right yeah I mean there's a lot of evolutionary psychology you know you know that a lot of that is speculative of the horse but it's the thrill-seeker is that's one it's one of the weirder things when everything's great and you have plenty of food and you live in cities and like okay look I'm not getting enough juice here yeah I'm gonna have to learn how to hand glide or something you know and yeah some people may do it for attention yes yeah the things people do for attention um creativity is that debt to me is one of the more interesting aspects of being human beings our ability to create things and our desire to create things and in a way that's also along the same lines right because you're getting rewarded right for it well probably yes I mean all these things are as a child is developing and growing up and passing through different kinds of situations in life I think a lot of stuff happens kind of randomly you know so the child may do something that someone views is creative and so as you said the child is rewarding them so then that allows them to figure out what you know explore kind of how they did that and and maybe continue to do it but other people may simply have minds that go in that direction on their own where as as we talked about earlier their thoughts are able to jump across conceptual categories and and sort of transcend those categories into new completely new ideas and so forth and you know I don't think we know how the brain does that at all that's a very good question for the future but it's not something we have a great deal of understanding of I mean there could be an area of research on it that I just don't know about it it's a big feel but I certainly don't know the answer to how creativity comes about well it's interesting too creativity has a reward system built in for the person who creates even-even without recognition from others there's some fundamentally satisfying feeling of creating something it's fun yeah why do you think that is well novelty is rewarding not very enforcing you know it's a and certainly creativity is novelty it's like anything that it's novel that you do has a kind of you know charge effect to it I would think yeah I mean it's people like you who study this stuff to me are so important because most of us are just banging into walls just trying to figure out why we do what we do and to have an ability to understand the scientific explanations for the various things that are at play it's it's so it's so critical because you can kind of like not necessarily stop the process but at least be aware of it while it's going down is that part of what you wanted to do when you were writing well I don't thank you for you know crediting me for that but the you know a lot of what we've been talking about we've just been having a conversation my work is very rather limited and all I don't work on creativity and all these things so I'm you work on the way the mind work I work on yeah I mean I think about how the work the mind works but I work on how the brain detects in response to danger so that allows me to go back to my early work on consciousness and to bring it in and layer it on top of all that other stuff but yeah it's a you know I get tremendous value out of sitting there writing and because when you start a book in my case I think this is probably true of many people you don't you have no idea how you're gonna get to the end you know you have a beginning and you just see where it goes so this idea of writing a proposal so that lays out the whole thing to me doesn't work because you just don't know where it's going and the fun part is getting to the end the brain reacting to danger do you did you did you do any interviews with people who are soldiers or interview fighters or people that are involved in extreme activities that yeah not having to haven't done a lot of interviews I mean I have talked to people like that and you know every individual cases are interesting because they give you stuff but it's not data so the data you have to go out and collect yeah what do you got there for notes you know pile of notes RJ oh I don't want to discuss I just thought this brought this I think we covered most of what I want to say you know the amygdala is not a fear Center behaviors not primarily a tool of the mind it's a tool of survival we think we know why we do the things we do and others do them but we don't really because we our conscious mind is not privy to all of the things that the body and brain are doing now when you wanted to examine danger and you want to examine the mind and how it reacts to danger and fear and threats what what we trying to get out of this well I started out thinking this was a way to study emotion and at the time I had been studying these these human patients with the split brain surgery and can you explain that because you tore that earlier but the split brain Center is alleviation of epilepsy it's a way to control epilepsy that can't be controlled in any other way medications are not working so you have like young kids teenagers that have lived most of their life this paralyzed by epilepsy and not being able to lead a life there was one patient to basically his parents from constantly having to hold him down on a mattress he was seizing so often so and this is not this is only done in a very extreme set of conditions and it's not done that much anymore but when it's done it's the connections between the two sides of the brain room are separated so information one side doesn't cross over to the other they do that they open up the skull pull the two you know you've got kind of two loaves of bread sitting next to each other and they're connected by threads which are axons that go between them and so you pull apart here and you can see where those axons are and you open it up from the top so imagine like a hot dog bun okay and so you open it up at the top and you can look down in the center and imagine that there was like a bunch of wires crossing between the two sides of the bun so those wires would then be surgically sectioned and so now you end up with two sides of the brain separate and independent so typically language is on the left side so you can talk to that side the right side doesn't have language so you have to ask what what can it do so if you present a stimulus that only the right hemisphere sees and you do that by flashing a picture of an apple on the left side of space because everything to the left of center goes to the right hemisphere and everything to the right of center goes to the left hemisphere so you send a stimulus to the right hemisphere and you say what did you see and the left hemisphere answers because that's worth languages he says I didn't say anything so okay you said reach into this bag and see what's in there the right hand goes in that's connected to the left hemisphere can't find it the left hand goes in connected to the right hemisphere that which saw the Apple it pulls out the Apple so the right hemisphere has information that the left hemisphere can't talk about what is life like for people once they've done that operation well slowly it the left hemisphere kind of comes to dominate again the you know they they come to live with it and how does it prevent seizures well the the folklore of it I don't know if this is actually true but what is often said is that it prevents the seizures from jumping back and forth and having you know because the the electrical activity jumping back and forth sort of gets into a kind of endless loop that can't stop but cutting that isolates the seizures and the two hemispheres and makes each one more controllable like taking the medication Jesus so imagine being though first gotta try that out everybody I got an idea let your brain like a hot dog bun so but what we were interested in in these patients that we were studying like this was my mentor Michael Gazzaniga and I were studying these at Dartmouth Medical School we were at Stony Brook out on Long Island we would drive up to Dartmouth to see these patients was how does the left hemisphere cope with the fact that the right hemispheres performed a behavior that the at the left hemisphere that you talked to didn't come and so we would you know put information in the right hemisphere the guy would stand up I said why'd you do that I needed to stretch or you know scratched his hands or I had an itch so I needed to scratch it and so time after time the left hemisphere would generate a narrative that made its behavior makes sense so that's why I got interested in how non conscious systems would be generating behaviors that we had we generate narratives to explain because at the time that we were doing this the idea of cognitive dissonance was very popular and what that means is that when cognitively when you do something behaviorally that is incongruent with what you cognitively know it's disturbing it causes dissonance and so you have to engage in some kind of dissonance reduction so our hypothesis was these narratives that the left hemisphere is generating about right hemisphere behaviors it was a way of the left hemispheres conscious mind kind of keeping it all together the consciousness thinks that it's in charge that you know the brain and body are it's you know it's it's the control center and everything else is there to satisfy its whims and so it generates these narratives to keep that sense of unity going even though it's no longer unified that is so fascinating that the brain tries to seek some sort of an explanation for the actions that you provoked right externally and that's why I got into emotion because well maybe emotion systems produce these yes I'm doing what I'm looking this up alien hand syndrome came up do you know anything about this I don't I'm sorry okay so there's a long article explaining this thing called alien hand syndrome and also known as dr. Strangelove syndrome a fixture of doctors truth the explanations are very strange about people's hands doing something that's not explained right it's kind of the same yeah do they generate an explanation when they do then it just explains different scenarios people have had like a leg walk in the wrong direction or buttoning up your shirt with your left hand right hand starts unbuttoning that seems to be like some sort of a neurological problem well they split brain patients with you know the right after surgery when things are really like fucked up so really it would be like pulling the pants down with one hand pulling them up with the Wow so there's one patient I saw in the hospital the young kid the left hand reaches out to grab the nurse on the ass can I say that day yeah and the right hand is pulling it back there's like a physical struggle yeah there's like this and you know and it all kind of like over time they don't come back together but the sumthin ago she ate something where it's not so dramatic the woman who thinks her alien hand wants her to be a better person yes I'm thinking these are some sort of physiologic yeah well it's uh what a crazy solution to epilepsy I know there's other solutions that but that it was a last-ditch effort yeah and so for a severe severe cases yeah and I think it's not done that often to eventually sort of achieve some sort of normalization yeah you know that they've lives the kids have lived so long in the state by the time they get there their brains changed like that that I don't know really ultimately what what became of all these people because I moved on to other fields and but I think in general they live a somewhat better life but I doubt they ever live a completely full normal life for me how could you after all that but I'm really interested in the the the brain creating these narratives to explain yeah that's it there's so many people that do things like that yeah right they'll try to explain their life away and give themselves excuses and give themselves reasons for behavior and one of the things you see with the more rational people is it's never their fault it's always someone else's fault well that's the four billion years story that how we generate how we got to these narratives that's what it's all about Wow listen man this is amazing stuff please tell buddy everybody your books where they can get them how they can find them are they available in audio as well right yeah so the the new book is called the deep history of ourselves the four billion year story of how we got conscious brains and you can get that on Amazon you can get the other audible on audible.com you know Barnes no I think all the major booksellers have the books last book was anxious it also has an audible version always wanted to get like Christopher Walken to do my did you not not do it a night into it they didn't ask for anything I would want you to do it that's your work I get bummed out when someone else reads like one of the good things about like Pinker and Gladwell they read their own books like they've never offered it to me you should decide next Amanda well for my for my memoir all definitely yeah oh there you go well thank you for being here I really really appreciate it and thanks thanks for all your work did I just say one thing yes please so sometimes I when I release books I also release music to go with them so anxious had a record with it and deep history has some songs of life that are on the deep history.com website oh that's cool so you're you are a musician yeah bringing that up all right yeah I got a couple of bands and a couple bands well then the main band is the amygdaloid amygdaloid calm that's awesome and yeah it's a rock band we created our own genre heavy mental songs about mind and brain and mental disorders they're love songs but most rock songs or love songs about mental disorders anyway yes yeah you just be the mystic duo so we are which is a lot easier to get around without drums and amps and stuff it's two acoustic guitars awesome we play the acoustic versions of the amygdaloid all right well thank you Joe appreciate you thanks been fun thanks you [Music]
