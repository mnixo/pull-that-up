the gyro can experience an honor to be here a pleasure an honor to have you sir brian is uh my longest running friend in Hollywood I think so right yeah for 20 years yeah we've been friends a long ass time almost 20 years yeah 94 something like that people still so much to me it was 90 1995 and and people still come up to me and ask me if we're half-brothers you are the ones used to say it on Wikipedia that's right I am DB one of those it's a rumor I like keeping a lot I keep it a lot of I'm I never refute it yeah neither do I now now I think you were the one who told me about gracie jiu-jitsu yeah I remember that I remember we connected immediate yeah told you you show up in it those guys are all just low blood sugar and just a bunch of actors all sudden this guy see I'm like wait a minute that guy looks like me but he's thicker and he looks way more extreme and you had a ten-time how did you really could possibly must goes like that guy looks like he fights you're like yeah I fight I like to fight I need to fight i didn'ti I need to be in class otherwise I'll end up in jail I was like that guy's gonna be my friend forever we connected so quick right away with everything every retarded thing we loved pit bulls and-and-and where we both know it's retarded that's the difference like all of my extreme macho psycho shit I know it's fucked up kinda like I know my tattoos are fucked up I know my neck is too big I don't give a fuck you know I know my car's too loud I don't care I know you've all liked it you've always been my canary in the coal mine you'd you as well you know as long as I know you're still out there alive someone's rockin it the right way no doubt you're crazy to think that you would ever want to do anything different because whatever you've done has made you you you know I you know I'm sorry for anybody that ever hurt their feelings but I'm so happy everything turned out the way I guess you're right man I never thought of that I really like that as I was thinking as you were talking I went I spent a lot of time wishing I was somebody else that's why I'm an actor that's why I'm a comic and by the way that is Who I am isn't it we don't want a guy who wishes he was who spends last time wish you was somebody else that's my identity every guy wants an undefeated record okay but I'm telling you that shit ain't good for you you have to understand what it's like to lose of course you have to understand failure you have to you have to be able to look back in your past at a moment where you fuck something up and feel uncomfortable about it and that should provide you with a certain amount of humility in there I think a man is is the product of what partially a large but largely a product product of of how of the actions he chose to take as a response to failure you know yes yeah for sure I don't know how you learn anything other than the hard way I don't you don't really you don't really look we're worse we're a strange animal that's dealing with infinite variables and the only way to truly find a focused way through this path is to have accumulated a massive amount of experiences and forged positive information and game plans from these experiences and be able to move forward you you cannot know it all right away from the get-go that's right you know just you all you can do is control how you how you respond to failure yeah what you choose to do differently yeah readjusting your approach and by the way though the one thing for me is I've learned just to enjoy enjoy that and allow the frustration well how about be able to make fun of yourself when you fuck up how many how few guys can do that so huge there was a guy number so big and you're great at it there there was a guy recently actually recently was in within the last couple years it was back when Legends was at the the old bomb squad on Santa Monica Boulevard where the jujitsu gym used to yeah anyway this guy picked up a hooker he came back from Iraq picked up a hooker turns out the hooker was a dude the guy had sucked his deck friend I think I was a guy shot him dump the body in an alleyway in an alleyway like a movie so the cops apparently see this guy dumped the body they high-speed chase ensues they chase him all the way up to the desert gets out the car with his gun suicide by cop they shoot him dead Wow and all I'm thinking of is this motherfucker if he could just make fun of himself without the best stories abso true idea an emissions double on this guy did it really quiet suddenly a vision cut oh you don't know that story um no interesting well if I may if you please leave I've never told you this story I can't believe you haven't either and you might have I'm at I'm at Club USA in New

romantic I mean deep Oh God so there are these booths there were these peoples at Club USA where you could go in and there was a glass thing where other people could watch you so I take this girl into the Pete booth so I don't give a fuck yeah so other people can watch they want to come into the booth they can watch but then what the fuck am freaking out of the 20 no 23 I didn't I was like I'll

gonna get her this is my girlfriend as well it's my girlfriend forever so I'm Kissin and I'm making out and I'm feeling her body studies little dance I'm like these are small it doesn't matter her waist is so hard number the ask was on another level oh yes a beautiful ass and I reach down and I go for well I grab a grab a branch I grab a fucking branch branch that had been tucked under and she he goes up and pulls my hand away and I immediately realize that was a cock I've been I've been deep kissing deep kissing for two hours so I'm definitely a little gay I mean deep kissing and I just grabbed a cock oh yes I did you not know about the cock and tight how'd I not know dude at least be beaten though you know there she was taking hormones obviously secondly she was already like had that skin latino or Filipino whatever she was where she just didn't have hair on her body she was petite he I keep saying she's a girl because he doesn't want to believe in you know but here's this here ready here's the here's why I'm a good guy here's why I'm a really fucking nice guy you let him suck your dick no III looked in her eyes she was so hurt his eyes he was so like he was just like

out and I left and I never said did not come back to that quote I can't believe you went back in the game gotta you gotta be I didn't want to be rude no yeah let's wait a minute wait I would've been the odd person some person pretended to be a girl and tricked you into kissing him and never even told you something that for a lot of guys would make them violent I know gay bags for a lot of guys would you million I would have been mad if this person trade other guys it's an experience wanna have all right spirit okay for you but for a lot of guys it's an experience they don't want to have and someone tricked them into doing and they could get violent yeah and I don't I don't justify it but I'm saying a lot of guys that would be the reaction the fact that you felt bad it's very strange you went back and amidst and then word or a poem did you have a tongue after that I don't believe a kiss with tongue but if I tell the story again I'll definitely use that yeah isn't it funny how Lego a memory from that far back is almost bullshit anyway cuz it's so like fragmented and odd it's like I I can recite the facts of a lot of details of my life but do I truly recall them and if I didn't have a language they wouldn't even exist in my memory banks I'm talking I have to tell you another story I'd do it yes yes please do yes all right that was Larry did I tell you the Jimmy Burke story which one a minute I'm no million Jimmy Burke stories the one where where we were both together with to bed yes yes okay yes all right that's good okay so I had my best friend's thumb in my ass all right ah but that's a whole different story Joe what you put your thumb no I know another best friend oh but should I talk did I tell say my thumb let's be clear about because we refer to each other as best friend I tell my thumb was never anywhere near your round I gave up I gave the punchline away but there's a very very good excuse for it no wonder why Joe's voice not on lockdown Oh what should I tell on the podcast well it's a little late cuz already gave away the punchline is if you can tell the story somehow or another make it entertaining even though the punchline is dirty I used to have ice date I two girlfriends for a long time that I had sex with 10 years after the fact they were just my two girls love them love them I had sex with those girls I you know that we dated in college and then I dated him we want to have right after college and and for the next ten years maybe longer they were always a booty call I always kind of relationships are so strange I think it's so weird even through their boyfriends two girlfriends that we would always get crazy parts how many how many girls like that have a like thou somewhere in their life where they just have some arrangement and then always at places yeah right and if it I know early oh yeah yeah how can you tell what do you top most of them cuz they're there they talk about him a lot because he's still in their life because he's still really important to them they have a long time I can always tell oh you're saying you could sniff it if a girl's doing it to you yeah yeah you can tell you go I mean I know and it just give you like a nice green light though yeah you're like okay yeah yeah yeah you should be friends you live no one you do automatically cos can assume that she's doing that just whore

oh yeah well we set up like this a lot of times we set out with this B me and my buddy and Jimmy be over there drinking a beer at the end of the bar this worked fuckin every - every time and you know we'd be in there like a couple yokas we find really hot girls I come up and go excuse me sorry to bother you girls um were doctors and my buddy just said he's a great surgeon but he just lost his first patient he's really bummed out if you guys went over there just talk to him and make him sealant feel so much better and they'd be like he's a surgeon like yeah we're all surgeons but if you talk to a girl and she was actually a doctor that well hop well how about the girl was asking a medical advice and you felt bad you had to come clean I felt horrible she's asking that medical advice thing he starts giving her like general advice right and then yesterday we saw it is your most grill not me man I mean I fucking stuck to the end I was like I'm getting late I don't give a shit about

android screen and go yeah it doesn't say shit about you how about town how many have a fucking movie at Sundance and liar it is weird seeing you hang out with different people though because it seems like certain people you acted from you know like your s'more silly or when you're with believe me and I mean I'm a chameleon yeah you mean like my sister who calls me the chameleon you know what my buddy has new tan back is said about me he goes you know Brian walks if Ryan walks takes a walk with seven Cherokees when he could well you know what comes back a Cherokees I was like ass fuck shut up it's true that I had to be that way as a kid I had to blend in with I moved moved every two also very unique I mean it's not like you know your your very unique bullshit I try to be oh you yeah us unique either yeah your your unique dude but yeah you and I always wind up with caveman conversations and then I always go fucking right to the bottom of the man's soul but we think about violence and sexuality and you know all this fucking societies and illusion and you know happens when it crumbles down that fucking guy's gonna fall apart but that's what you're you and I have always had this friendship where like like it where no matter what if we're lying to each other like if we're just we're like we still want to deal with the truth right now I'll just start saying something like like I would be like I really love her you'd be like hey who are you fucking talking to now you don't I'm like but I live with her yeah so what you don't love her break up with her immediately you know I could never get away we can never really get away with like lying to each other oh you know you were just too good of a friend to have these crazy girls you did when I say crazy girls folks I'm not an invasive sort of a friend when it comes to friends girlfriends like Brian to tell you I'm usually pretty supportive right will you say Brian yeah oh yeah absolutely and I did a lot of crazy girls and he's dated a lot of crazy girls and but my no fun but my take on it was always just be sweet to them be nice to him fuck the shit out of them and if they leave they leave I know that's how you go but with you you had a totally different kind of crazy and developed an addiction you had a fascination with girls who were gigantic problems yeah Brian's girls are sweet girls yeah they just what happens in life you take a left when you should have taken a right you get stuck you can't pay your rent there's a lot of shit that happens to people in life so he's dealing with centrally sweet girls that go down a bad track right you're dealing with fucking crazy people whatever you could lose your fucking house oh not just was your house your life you had he had a few of a man where he would bring over like it was it was like Joe Louis's bum of the Month Club he was great bring over all these new silly bitches that he was dating one of them I called bunch of naps yes great it's how she came over I met her cookies yeah she comes over and I go that chick nice looks like she needs a bunch of naps right and then ten minutes in to hang out at my house oh my god I'm so tired she takes her shoes off and curls up on the couch she was a fucking catch it was literally she was like having owning a high-tech patch she was so strong she's my pet it was so strange I have never met like a more cat-like human right I've never met a person who just like had no desire to have an intelligent conversation just want to take now well I talked to this guy this is fucking I talked to his awesome dude who's at like a well-known um like good like a psychiatrist guys PhD he's really smart guy he said a lot of times people in relationships like he works with a lot of like couples and stuff like that and and addicts and stuff yeah he said a lot of times what human beings do is we apply a construct on someone so they'll you'll find somebody that looks the part and then you just apply a construct you just go oh that's who you are you're this girl you really like to work out yeah you're the j.crew girl I'm on on a fucking on the front of a sailboat that's what I want a date meanwhile the girls like I'm from fucking Michigan and everyone I sell bought my fucking life and I like to do drugs everyday what do you talk about no why were you trying to construct that that's sort of a really non realistic reality all the time I don't know because it wasn't like it was really strange it's like that's the kind of behavior that you get from people that have a hard time meeting girls but you had no problem eating girls it wasn't that at all you were not shy you're always charming and you're always funny so I mean I can't remember a time we like dude I can't meet girls I was tired of being alone it was never that it was it was you you know for whatever reason would wind up getting I get crazy girl they were so nuts dude that I was trying to figure out I spent many an hour by myself yeah thinking about you after many of our crazy adventures thinking about you going how did this happen how did this guy get to this state of mind where he lets this person in his life and then he can't see that I don't understand that I don't know what I'm hanging out with you I'm like here's this insightful intelligent objective self-deprecating guy who's really well-read and yet he's hanging around with legit meth heads right you were hanging around with like scary people they were like no I really don't know what that was I think part of it was just um I think what it was was I'd go oh that's a project and I can save that person yeah I think that was a lot of those I found that very intriguing where I'd say you know what all you need is someone like me to change your life and I know how to help you and it took me a long time to realize that that is the dumbest shit you can ever come for anybody that's a dead fucking end oh you never want to do that shit my goodness it is no you never want to do that because you can't you know my father said something interesting to me the other day he said look you want to give advice to a kid very different don't ever get advice ever ever to an adult even if even if they can use it I'm never doing I said yeah but I the guy's he's headed toward a wall he goes that's right they know they're headed to a wall never this is your dad yeah and he

going to Italy right now is to brush up on his Italian oh my why you doing that he goes I don't know I'm going to Rome for three weeks Wow he was a greatest she said uh Saucony he's like we're talking about by having it you know when you're with a woman you want to be able to talk to her and sometimes you can you just talk to her why would you want to talk to her I've been married to your mother for 50 years I want to talk to her oh my god that's ridiculous go to work go to fucking work nice she's stupid it was so great he's such a bottom bottom line guy and and has read everything but is also just a real man you know real real sounds like a fun guy to talk to this world needs more of those I call him every day when I need when I when I want to talk about something in the news or talk about just if you get crazy with him how deep do you go in the rabbit hole as deep as it gets really without okay you can go all the way in the rabbit hole with all my personal secrets fuck yes anything fuck yes and and be careful by the way cuz you'll fucking you know he'll he'll smell you he'll smell you like oh my god back smell you how about this how about this I'll give you a great story ready watch this my buddy comes in swear I'm with my dad were in my office my buddy comes in he just happened to be around cuz he was gonna unis just comes I goes hey brah how you doing I go hey you know let's say his name is Jeff hey Jeff what's up he goes not much hating I go I'm good and he goes alright man whoops question baby says a couple words and he goes hey miss gal I do nice to meet you yeah and he just leaves and my father my father goes what's that guy do and I go eyes he's a writer my father sit now I suspect that's not gonna work out for him I go and I go how did you know that he goes pattern recognition I've been around I'm 71 years old that's how pattern return Russian mission so he's like that guy from the Bills Ben Stiller movie where he has like the human lie detector on that's that's what he can read you in a heartbeat dude he can read and see you walk across street he knows you're all fucking okay then again how the fuck are you so bad at that well I'm actually good at it I choose to ignore it really yes actually I think I'm very good at it but when I see a project I go hey I need to help you so you almost well there was a self-destructive aspect to you that always disturbed me being your friend yeah that's what would drive me nuts you know it was a distraction and it hurt my career by the way really yeah yeah yeah it hurt my career and it hurt my relationships with people that were significant in my life and yeah um and I think a lot of that self-sabotage we all go through that stuff you go through it man you weigh less than than anybody I knew actually you were always very good at cutting out the fat and I kept it because I wanted an excuse maybe to you know it was like a parachute you know I mean I think um there's very few reasons in life to give yourself more problems and if you can find all your own problems and address them and try to deal with all your own problems and be real honest about that then it makes it really easy to see other people's problems but I found that in my life when I wasn't being honest with myself about my own problems when I had issues when I had unresolved things in my mind just when I was a real young man I was still growing up and trying to get over my fucked-up childhood I found it much more difficult for me to see problems in other people because of the the shield that I put on recognizing my own issues I wasn't as intuitive or insightful when it came to recognizing other people as I get older and I became as honest as is humanly possible which is how I am now uhm now then it became where I just see it everywhere that became really obvious that's what I have now become obsessed with and that's why I don't suffer fools anymore like yeah that's why because what I'm what I'm very interested in is figuring out I want to stay as undiluted as I can and as authentic when I was watching Springsteen what I would the word that kept popping into my head was just authentic he's never lying it's everything about him the way he dresses the way everything about and nothing is in his way there's no resistance is why he can do a backbend and touch his head at 62 yy-you can literally back bend he went all the way back and hit his head he can he can run he's 62 that's amazing on stage on stage on her back at 62 and I went and I went that guy so out of his own way you know I've said this before maybe on the podcast but it's one of my favorite metaphors that Michelangelo said when he was a carcases named Michelangelo when when Michelangelo sorry guys I speak a time when Michelangelo sorry there are no girls here okay sorry when Michelangelo said when he carved the David the Statue of David oh and he had this piece of marble and he said and this is a great metaphor for art he said it's already in there I just had to get all this shit out of the way he said that's how you should look at yourself as a human being you're born and you acquire a lot of shit as you're as you're growing up right so as you grow up a lot of shits put on you look your family how they define you what they what they do to you peace school high school the trauma of school the grief you go through you know your body isn't what you wanted the loss is and stuff and you put on a lot of stuff you you come to the world when you're ready to take it on at 30 with a whole lot of fucking baggage and a lot of it's negative you know and the the job then is to figure out a way to get that stuff off you to shed that stuff and get back to who you really are the authentic you and that to me is at least as a comic and somebody writes and said that's that's all I think about now you know what is what is how honest can I truly be with my expression even if I'm being silly and like talking about saving a whale there's a lot of me in there that I'm I'm talking about you know and especially now the stuff that I'm working on now just you know being a father and things like that and that responsibility and what that really means and and and with my daughter and not being able to show up her a part of me and and who I want she's gonna model them and she dates after me so I got to be a fucking I got to be the I got to be her hero I got to be the guy that she actually I don't want a date and the guy I used to be you know what I mean so right there are all those responsibilities that you start taking on as you get older but so much of that is and so much of fucking thought you know that I got to think they they act like it's a active process thinking and being creative is actually learning what not to think about because the rest of it comes to you if there's that's a real philosophy if you can open yourself up and think of thinking as being more of a channel for what's available to you that's a very important distinction this notion that they'd see a lot of people come and say well I'm missing something I'm missing something that I have to add to my arsenal no in fact what you're probably doing is there's there's something you've got to let go of and when you let go of that you'll get what you're looking for or you'll find that that's a that's a fundamental difference in thinking about thing and I think a lot of times we're taught hey you you're missing something you got to add to your your you got to put another arrow in your quiver in fact you might have a better better advice may be to say you got to let some stuff go man you're holding on to some stuff you got to let some stuff go you're still defining yourself along lines that are not helpful to you you're still you still have people in your life that are not your friends even though they seem like they are you still have you're still doing a job that you hate because it's an excuse to not do not go for what you really want there are a lot of things that you should be deleting you should be taking out of your life and and and then there will be room for something that's much better that's it that's a very it's a scary way to think of it but I don't think we talked about that enough
