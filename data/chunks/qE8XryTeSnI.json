and we're live right when I'm this is not a corona cough this is the marijuana crop I think I haven't been tested get in there any problem let's just go out oh shit whiskey son we're gonna whisk you to break that Blanton yeah that's great so we were all chillin in home under quarantine not really quarantine la is not under quarantine yet but I hear word I hear word that California and Washington State are gonna get the lockdown treatment for two weeks I don't know man I don't know I planned at home I plan for a month I planned for a month of food yeah me too I just stocked up like a dick I have tons of meat though I'm a carnivore it to the end of the year legitimately that's what I did drink Creek water I got a fucking filter I got a pump filter the kids I did though campers yeah they love it man just everybody can make carnival they'll just have to I don't think that's it's gonna come to that not really don't I think I think if you look at the numbers like this is not a good cold it's a dangerous one it's a dangerous one because it kills the fuck out of all people but so does a bad flu and it's it's different than a bad flu in in some people's accounts in that it's causing some serious damage what do you got there Jamie oh it's causes damage to lungs damage you hear on both ends though you know like you hear one expert says it's how terrible's can be here another expert goes it's actually go about your life but I'll just wash your hands because just go about your life though you hear both ends of it there's a good article on Atlantic there's a good article in the Atlantic about it and the article in Atlantic was basically saying we're all gonna get it and one of the reasons why this is a really tricky one is that the symptoms don't show up for a while yeah so you could be contagious for a long time I had it three weeks it doesn't kill people quick see the thing about that avian flu that they put the kibosh - that was a really deadly one you know 60% of the people that got it so China acted immediately they killed something like a million five hundred thousand chickens it's all in this article and they just shut everything down they're like this is x2 this is something that's gonna fucking kill half the population like legitimately kill after popular there's an article Washington Post that gets like a bunch of experts and kind of what those things they agree on about the coronavirus and when you read that makes you feel better yeah now granted a lot of people day a lot of it is up in the air they don't know well what scares me is what's going on in France because Jake Tapper just tweeted that some large number more than 50% of the cases that are serious like hospitalization are people that are under 60 which is very unusual because the other people in other places that we they're they're reporting that it's mostly old bolder more people with underlying health conditions we do meansis yeah weak immune systems people with high blood pressure but you know you really stop and look at the numbers of just the flu and this is supposed to be way worse than the flu but if you look at the numbers for the flu the flu kills a fuckload of people who's a motherfucker thank you 50,000 in world just in the United States cheers I gotta take a sip Bryan Callen will be here probably here with cheese he's probably the cheese store right now trying to talk to that wait for our line no idea the cheese store is it oh they're everywhere a shirt with did you guys sell with Bryan with cheese there's gotta be no no no Dan had a cheese cheese and wine and she was the microphone just wound up just bright and snacking in the micro I get it folks if you're listening and you get upset at us and people get upset at me for clearing my throat they get upset for if you drink on mic people say because you're in their head now I get it but Sarah if they're at the gym right now and they have ear pods on or if they're on a plane even better because you don't hear anything else right you're not making a lot of motion yourself you can hear all that no it's awful it's annoying it Drive tries for us drives me nuts shit at work you're concentrating and hear that shit could fuck people at the work also should happen thing well it worked a three hour show with fucking four guys under the influence if you have a job where you're allowed to listen to a podcast like this you got a good job hell yeah cuz it'll make boring shit much better like when I just deliver newspapers I used to listen to the radio morning while the morning mattress was the big Boston morning radio show with Charles Lockwood era I love it drive about 45 45 to hour a day you know into the studio and all I do is listen to podcast I love it man yeah and when if somebody misses if it's late like fuck you so I know how important it is I love what's gets quicker you learn it so wit we're we're slowly evolving into liking traffic I like traffic because that's where I do my I'd listen to music on the way to work and on the way back I listen to the news it's your times the same it's like the only time I'm by myself I don't have to talk to anybody I like it too yeah I like it when it's all red like let me take the worst fucking we're ours and to come when I was it like walk around looking for a coffe shop no one was really around and this garbage truck pulls up you take this shop what the fuck you doing up here my dad shot shows bro I miss the fight too bad your bro he goes you are you trying to score some up here I go excuse me is trying to score how you go score coffee just out in the round you're in the wrong area papa he's like this or people get drugs let's go back down the hill what kind of drugs I think Aaron's by I think like Carolyn now yes fantastic good toffee up there yeah bro I didn't know yeah you can be in the wrong place at the wrong time I'd be awful yeah if you're wandering through some city Diana Tacoma that's why I've spoken if I go out I'd be so sad yeah how many people died from that shit every year we're not worried about that like it's a disease affecting all of a sudden all sneaking out everybody so many people I was talking about those on stage the other night that's like some deaths we just get real accustomed to really custom to those kind of deaths but if all the deaths that were happening because of cancer and people being fat if all those were from wolves oh my god quickly would we want to kill wolves how scared would be happy but what because it's because it's disease and who are the failure and all that kind of shit we like okay but what if CNN and Fox News all that I know you hate a minute but what if they just in you know they create kind of this this panic what if they just on 24/7 car crashes and people dying from obesity and you know we'd be fucking terrified we'd be tariff it's not in our face but it's way worse media so power so power so powerful they can get the people to believe in fucking anything anything anything if they said if they said guess what we found Santa Clauses fucking bones in the mountains and fucking in Norway people would believe it they could do a lot of people you know there'd be like you know what do they you know they found Santa Claus bones they'll be flying up there right no dude immediate powerful fuck yeah he's super powerful this this disease is a good example it's not something that we shouldn't be afraid of we should we should definitely be afraid we should be afraid of something that could come down the pipe that's more deadly that's we should be afraid of that's what those people the Center for Disease Control told me and Duncan we did a show there years ago they were saying we really have to worry about is these diseases just jump into people he said then it happens all the time we can't control it but learn from China learn from Italy like they were unprepared they didn't take it or maybe they just didn't know didn't have the resources but learn from their mistakes you know address information they try to suppress information China with the moon you know they went to the moon who does right now they went to the moment things different people know no China and a million people's a lot of people out here they went to pick up video blasted out to the surface of the Moon to the dark to the dark side these are awesome come on this is the other thing Joe about the corona virus and cow encounter jump on this cheese called it this is the best you've ever dressed oh you have a kombucha on a water bottle that's it looks appointed look fucking great we don't shake hands but with the crumb they're also saying that you know because the lack of testing there might be way more people with it so it shows that how how it's not that deadly because we know how many people die that's for sure but we don't know how many people have it so it could be a less deadly than we think well I like to think of the half-full Joe it doesn't make you a new Tex word me no but doesn't make you think about the flu - I mean if this is supposed to be ten times more potentially ten times more deadly than the flu right this is what the worst-case scenario they make a lot of predictions they do but they trying to write with these prediction see if we start going - you're right how often are they right you're right but if they are right we have to be prepared for the worst see the best for the exactly it could be an inconvenience to be prepared for the worst oh really it should open up our minds and our brains as to what is causing this and is there another way to generate food pop-punk you know when we're old when we're in our 80s the kids during those times are gonna look at us is weird because it's like old people love toilet paper they just hoard toilet paper because from this point on we have never lived through a toilet paper shortage I have never heard about toilet paper shirts are really the what the problem is is way bigger than that making diseases we raise food is making disease I'm just talking about toilet paper I was but I'm saying just like it's crazy we were making viruses well they like avian flu that was bird agriculture right the swine flu that was pig agriculture when they Jam all these animals together occasionally one of those fucking bugs with let's but didn't scares Marburg if all the Tamara Jarek fevers came from fruit bats I think yeah that came from another animal there's a type of these flus though Brian are the ones that jump and they're all they're all consider our coronavirus they're all labeled as coronaviruses are just different type of these are all the same string it really was more deadly even than this one and that's charges it's a wake-up call man it's a wake-up call for anybody that has anything to do with regulating how people raise food but like there's been mistakes made but this does seem like a wide this does seem like a massive overreaction in terms of a virus that only kills people who are what to me and age is 81 that would I Sam Harris told me about some duties in his 50s unavailable that's one example that immune system indeed evapo buddy could that could happen it's not a normal thing for a guy who's really fit my dad scared you know why that's 16 my dad's terrified and I got that thing he said he said a thing to the the group text where it says Trump confirmed corona fight it's just this dude sitting on a bed with this black dude that's famous curves in your life it's great so I said to my I thought it's funny I said to my dad didn't find it funny he put what the fuck it's funny like my bad Tom cigar sent us a picture that says if you know this guy's face you have fucked up friends John Makdessi Lucy fighting these are good fights this is a really good car Marcus Martin Gilbert burns me Maya Maya that's a great fight who is a not so McConnell fighting Jamie do you have the cards pretty stacked it's better than the last card it's a very good card and usually in Brazil they show up but when there's no in the crowd what's weird is all train Aldo oh this is a good fight Ronaldo 67 years old but this is a good row he's a bad motherfucker though that guy throws I've been a dangerous a dangerous foe you can listen because there's no crowd and you just hear Michael Bisbee's voice narrating it right commentating it sounds like a you're watching a golf event because he because they're kind of subdued too because there's no energy so he's like any ghost amount elbow here nobody here there's no no there's no one there's got one in the crowd bro we're living in a movie strange shit ever we're living in a movie it's a horror moon why didn't we have this reaction with h1n1 that put a lot of people jobs the arena here right but the swine flu was fucked a lot of people but this is this is madness it's insane this is madness is an empty arena and then I still don't do Tom hey has it you son of a bitch talking you guys guess what he'll be fine yep I'll be fine Tom Hanks I don't get I'm still confused nobody's told me why this this virus no no no it's all theories well there's some real dangers that it might be as much as 10 to 15 times stronger you don't think the media the media is running with this because it's bad for Trump I'd take an ax kill the economy I don't think the viral adjusts have that in mind when they make their decisions I think all these disease experts are trying to save millions of people from unnecessarily dying they're trying to stop a disease in its tracks that's what they're doing ad they've done this forever with polio they've done this with smallpox this is what they do they try to stop us not diseases are trying to kill us every fucking day it's as if we have a war and there's a war against viruses it's a it's almost like a real war against a thing but we don't think of it as a thing because it's it's even you can see it but it's a it's an attack on the human system yeah it's an attack on human beings and it's a constant and it's evolving it's always changing there's too many of us and that's what it recognizes and it's trying to get rid of us is crazy I'm learning out of how many people how many people have died in the u.s. so far 50,000 50 it's no 50/50 what is the average IQ very what is the average 81 them and the NBA and all canceled everything everything canceled because nobody in the audience one okay then the average age is 80 yeah you would think while they're worried about going home you would think if you just found out about this you just woke up from a coma and then you see how everything's gonna be Bo you would be thinking people were dying on the street right running it was like the zombie apocalypse where I'm asked to stay home there's zombies on the street exactly what you would think right but the average age of the people dying in the United States is 80 and half of them are from an old folks home in Washington how did they get Hey and then the you you see in the back of a lie soul bottle it says it lists all the viruses that it kills and it says human coronavirus like oh but it's a different strain you know so I'm like wait a minute the average age is a B pause for a second I give people the time it's 230 of the first round to 29 to 28 to 27 to 26 to 25 so if you want to sync it up we're watching John Makdessi vs. tree nalddo francisco scene although badass kickboxer he's like shot with our san he's always a dangerous ah he never has like an off night he's just yeah it's been fine since he was 7 it is a weird thing to see no audience and it's a weird thing to think that so many people are so afraid of this that they don't do anything and go out but it kind of makes sense if it's as bad as they think it is now if it's not as bad as they think it is the problem is there's gonna be a lot of people that are not gonna believe them the next something comes up to the next ones no no no they'll believe everyone dude we believed everyone the younger generation some people this is gonna work no I wouldn't I know it always why I don't know it always works it works every two years you by NAS II think it's of work just Eddie I think there's a constant battle going on between people and viruses this is a story that has a real I'm just so you get intuitive but it has a real clear beginning and you could follow the history of viruses in the United States and in the world it's kind of like little herds right we're old weak people to be shitty very young oh yeah there's a or the Spanish flu right that was really bad for young guys it's way do you want to see or something was killing a lot of guys with great immune systems by some some way the the way it attacks and this is what the nineteen twenty or twenty didn't hygiene fix most of that when I do to sanitation yeah it's it fixes a lot of it doesn't stop it viruses always - and all Brian is saying is where are the bodies that's all he says no no I heard your bodies that here you ought to describe what what the disease was that guy just woke up from a coma and I'm like he must have got oh my god NBA canceled there's nobody at the UFC this is nice a flu for most of us the guy would think like what is it thousand times more powerful than the flu right and then you would say well it's not even quite the flu so far this year the flu is kicking its ass cuz 20,000 people in the US have died so far since January first but the thing is so far relatively new thinking it's good I know they don't know is the problem my thing is maybe that we're trying to yeah the scientists at CDC might be saying let's stop a peak in cases that overwhelm hospitals in our infrastructure because we don't have the infrastructure yet to deal with this this might be a very good dry run for if one we really do face a major virus Nikoli that's you know really a killer would wake up call two people that are living their lives like like this can't happen they're like finally the world I level right now it's it's hard about hand sanitizer and no one wants to shake hands yeah so we're like cleaner than we've ever been as a society but is good but them homeless are the dirtiest ever for that they're finding mystery they're finding like a bloody Flags shit right yeah we don't have chickenpox well I don't want to be rude nobody's shaking hands anymore there's gonna be a time when we say dude remember when people used to fucking shake that's why the Japanese when I was a kid people I remember that kid would really touch hands we all have to recognize when it comes to homeless or anything like that is like you're not responsible for other people's actions now some people might have done things to get them to that position that we're foolish or they got addicted to drugs or their life fell apart all these all these things could be contributors right but you're not responsible for them and what to pretend that we are and that we just leave them there it's ridiculous like it like if someone was just littering where they are and just throwing shit in the street and throwing needles in the street you arrest them but but you don't arrest them and they're setting up camps under these bridges this is not since you got to figure this out you got to either find them some way some some form of cheap housing for people as medical health services medical change you know whatever the budget is for other things there's got to be shifted to that right like that's a real problem I think I think interviewing as many as palomar crazy though maybe they have a story but nobody will listen to them because they're crazy and homeless but maybe like why are these people on the streets all of a sudden like what the fuck happened there couple things one is one is new laws did say you can't move and someone unless you have somewhere for them to move to yeah but I think what Eddie's saying is like what happened these people's lives Isis I think the opiate crisis has some drug craze until Helmand denominator they all have cuz all of a sudden they popped up and they're intense you are everywhere and it wasn't around when we were kids no and all over the side of the freeway yeah and there oh wow it's crazy like Mexicans it's crazy white people we used to be super rare you would see an encampment and like you were driving by on a highway see a little encampment yeah guys got a tent yeah I give me - yeah - that was weird even when I was very very a lot of this came from the Supreme Court decision remember when when the Supreme Court ruled that you could not keep someone else in a hospital unless they were a danger to society it's also really expensive though - yeah it's real expensive that - that was during the Reagan administration right because I remember I believes like all of a sudden there was homeless people yeah but it was it wasn't it was challenged in the Supreme Court so the idea was the state cannot take you a family member put them in a hospital if they are not a danger so it used to be if somebody was crazy they'd show up with a paddy wagon crazy quote unquote I'm putting that into Congress and they would just go into a facility a mental hospital that was also nice do some weird stuff so there was a challenge in the Supreme Court that said the state has no right to keep somebody against their will based on the they are cooking a little crazy very hard thing to define is there are dangerous society so that by the way somebody correct me if I'm wrong but I think that was at the heart of it that was the challenge and it was deemed unconstitutional to be able to keep somebody against their will if they if they seemed a little bit off crazy whatever was unless they were a danger is it hot in here of crows you going crazy bro he's got a fever I'll make you a sticker Chino thanks man well that's that's what you know a world is weird where idiots like us are explaining what's going on I read that breakdown oh no it's done you're gonna get no it's done right here the best breakdown from all the different angles what were you a sight when you had homeboy optional first time we heard like a legit expert yes on the disease control bag here's one from my point of view here's what's going on other than that it's you give it every whim well he's I'm in the middle he's an expert you know he's a legitimate expert I see his take on it is that these wet markers is something he fuckin wrote about in this book he wrote about this book years ago he did build dates though warn us about this shit Danny has a lot of people have they've got but when Duncan and I did a fucking special this is deadliest enemies this is Oscar Holmes book when Duncan and I did that that sci-fi show back in the day about diseases we were worried if like someone could create a super bug we're asked them about it they're like yeah it's possible but you know it's way more likely these things just happen in nature egos we're fighting them tooth and claw every day it was happy so there's how easy thick ass walls and vacuum-sealed suits and you're moving around it like you're in another world they're dealing with some of the most infectious diseases in the world but we deal with what to grow food look at the amount of pathogens we had to overcome parasites everything else is it I'm in the fucking building with Dinah's do you understand that's how I looked at it it's like these are demons that are locked in glass invisible demons Devils it would kill me millions of people whether here well how about when they work with fucking Ebola infected monkey monkey wakes up invites you to trial dose Rowan dude this makdessi's got great fucking defense they're both honest and fantastic yeah it's incredible Ronaldo has been in the UFC for a long time and he's still a good fighter like he hasn't slipped he's still super dangerous dude I swear to god Corona got Tom Hanks for your game you take cab even Ferguson and fucking shut your mouth dude they gonna do that the apex Center job Trump's gonna make sure the fight must take place let's do it April what is it 18 April that's imperative the fight must take on that date it must take place dude right and I'm like sad about it man I just I just think that's to me that that's gotta be in the conversation is the matchup of alt Koretz gotta be in the conversation it's in the conversation that's complete it's not a Russian destroyer it's number one and the one deal set was who them take him down to me everyone dude him the one dude that's in his head you know what I mean yeah not just you know what you call them but I think for it to be at the apex Center man it's gonna miss all that glitz right dude save it let's make this fight happen four fucking times already listen to my perspective it's gonna happen man if it's gonna happen we should be happy like we let the fucking let it be weird but the silence 11 so much Dana we could sweeten it like a god you know I mean no it's just all the fighters concert the dope to now is cracked Makdessi well if you and some of the dope this would be about the fact it's so you can hear everything yeah like the adult emit fighter is like that right there's only your team is in there and it's it's it's a different energy it's like so you're so focused you're not worried about impressing people it's it's pretty dull were you nervous were you more nervous fighting in the Ultimate Fighter or more nervous fighting UFC you have seen a big Rondo when I found trying oh my god yeah maybe cuz there's just it's like it's weird it's like it's almost like a pickup game it's you and your boys your train with you like all right let's do it that's what we do and there's no one around you can hear all the coaching hear all the punches yeah we did you fight me around then no I fought Matrona in Toronto okay yeah that's but I'm not gonna fight I didn't who um how old is homeboy those gotta be does report he has to be Ford I'm gonna go imma guess 43 44 isn't the oldest guy on the card I who's the oldest guy in the UFC no joke there's a couple guys in there would have been John Farnham look at how he can stand at the edge of the pocket like this he's getting he just doesn't get hit he's a tribe's type Bennifer I think your look you're mistaking like like Amazonian for old man you know what I mean 41 signs it's 41 bro okay I was wrong I was off I thought he was a little older 41 ain't that all speaking of a fighter it is Brad Pitt is 53 no not enough for human for a professional cage fighter fighting Joe Johnson 56 to us Johnny Depp he's a pirate have some respect Mike he's still dressing like he's a phantom listen uh what are you gonna do good golfer Jorgen I have a question are you gonna 42 and old and you have seen do you have a take on why Yoel Romero didn't wrestle and hold down Israel at asagna know what he does and punch him in the face well you know that's a hard fight for both fighters right because ul wanted to present some weird Yoel wants to create some weird scrambles yeah he wants a lull you into a false sense of security and wants to get you to do something dumb there was a couple of times when he countered with left hands that are so fucking fast he hits him with his iron last that first one that first one fuck this yeah both had the same game plan and they wanted to stick to it and they think champions stick to the game plan I'll stick to it don't get crazy and both of them have the game plan let him come to you let him come to you don't go you'll never use never both wait rather to come forward yeah it's a little bit but style bender was at least on the outside trying to make things happen you know well yo would you always do don't get me wrong it's very effective because it's so crazy he was standing there just standing there 1:44 he forcing a like yeah but he's it's that's it look he could have worked here's the thing if he did that to anybody else if he did that to Robert Whittaker if did that any other fighter other than style bender it might have worked and then we've been looking at him like the middleweight champion here's the thing I want to tell you okay they did a study on him they did a test on him because he got he had a fracture around his orbital and they thought that maybe he was going to need surgery the doctor calls the UFC I can't wait says where did you get this guy no no no he's not amazing he goes I've never seen a human like this no he goes he listened he was biologically I've never seen a human like this he goes the tendons behind his eyes are four times as large as a normal person's behind it things that's holding his fucking eyes against this measuring this area where they thought it was gonna be really really badly fractured you know like first of all he's healing he's already involved like the tentacles I've never seen a human being with structure like this before he goes I've been a doctor for over 50 holy shit said I've never seen a human being with structure like this he's a Cuban Wolverine Luke Russert was really hitting cement because I've never felt a body when in his hand he said I felt like I was hitting and kicking say lemme let me get you down the rabbit hole Eddie Bravo okay because Castro apparently was really into anything that could extend life and anything that can improve athletic performance cuz Cubans were badass rats monsters badass so badass boxers badass Taekwondo team Cuba everything like there's the fucking sports when they play sports how many pro ballers came from fucking suit money and and and baseball boxing yeah monster so wrestling so many genetics office try like the German Hector Lombard like wait come on man the conspiracy is that they're doing things to people to make them like that like Russians that sometime either wet there's also another factor hold on there's that too these blinds also now in the womb experiments that they could do on full-grown people that Russia definitely did I'm sorry you know Corral you saying the cute girls have a lot in common 100% okay but net sound is not just that but I'm talking about medical engineering you want to go down the like conspiracy hole of medical engineering you know Karelin right one of the most amazing wrestlers of all parents like this big yes the people I bet out of all the people that have ever competed in anything ever he's been the scariest huh those are three guys which isn't really that big it's it's squashing against his side you know anyone its squash so it's not that big but we used to throw there's a black-and-white photo of him go to this there's a crazy look at the fucking anger in his ignite hugs now imagine with him now 305 pounds 643 pounds undefeated wrestler just rag dolling everyone Wheeler's the other side he lost when he was 16 it was the last time before he lost to Baumgartner whenever he long garden that's it it's it's just a difference in the new rules didn't like it so fun the studio crazy that's not beating that guy so fucked up it's whispering one yeah Rulon did but of course Chris corn son he did MMA with shoes on after he lost a toe in a fucking frostbite he's still Jack and fool yeah but Carolyn Carolyn when he beat who was the Iranian American who was the silver medals Neelix you can see him whispering to him in the finals he's whispering arunya not a novice and watch after he beats him he'd beaten him 16 times or something because in an international tournament and he's whispering to him he's got him here and he's going you know and then you can see what's-his-name crying he's leaks can't stop he's understand and he's crying Iran didn't have the good steroids but no he was an American we weren't cheating yeah I know sorry I think that Kim just kidding about the steroids but when do you think I stopped when do you think they stopped because they definitely is to make Olympic athletes you you know that right yeah 100% and it's they still yeah what I wonder I wonder one thing to keep in mind by ul is like if you if you look at the Caribbean slave trade and the Caribbean sugar when when they were brought to Cuba and places like that to harvest sugar and stuff it was so horrific for those Africans it was so horrific the conditions that they were living on cornmeal and then they would salt cod and you need God and at the end of the day it was so horrible that the people that were revived that very ready already I mean it was horrible it was horrible sifting of the fittest of the strongest but for sure you know they did performance-enhancing drugs - yeah yeah also there's that makes that that - yeah welcome this is just what I think every single fucking country did as soon as whoever was the the in the 50s yeah that was World War two dude there was never never injected under the 40s but he's right - conoces were jaws yeah I think steroids though I think it was in like the early fifties well that's definitely popular in in sports yes somewhere around then but that was given to his stories of Hitler getting shot up with testosterone and cocaine imagine if a steroids back in the second time back in the Civil War they needed food that muskets but they miss his fear back then back then there was there if you ever see the pictures massive number war Ziggler know the success that's due to the use of testosterone in 1954 and begin experimenting on us weight lifters if you go back to that I felt like in the 60s 70s like Lyle Alzado those boys were doing some shit I used to get human growth hormone from cadavers back then like wait why hey Johnnie Walker fights an X by the way no scrilla is that next yeah that's a good fight that's a real good fight Kirill visit talented strikers so today what is shit he's got an interesting what does it mean I know what it means what is wrestling it's wrestle it SEMATECH mixed martial arts yeah shit bugs right but what is the difference of a I know Pancrase you guys started in Japan they called it shoot box is the Brazilian by the time I got to Rio de Janeiro they were saying shoot the ball shoot the puck they both know she walks but shoot the box sounds cooler yeah total that's the cool that's like plus what a legendary team man oh think about see the box come on man that's curitiba some people get knocked the fuck out on a handy basis some of the greatest fights of all time out of pride involved those guys think about the gym more about them old teams like remember Miletich get the team cuz he had tim sylvia right here obviously matt shark yet sean sherk people sleep on sean sherk yeah fucked up teeth but silva did a little bit you know like those legends i want to do you think about how good BJ Penn must have been his BJ Penn stomped a prime shirk when shirt was a demon peacock got it when shirk was a demon BJ Penn just beat him down does that flying me up against the cage got in trouble two for P DS if you fuck with him yes if you could survive that first minute you know that would be the first goal did you ever see Jay in the beginning back in the game yeah normally came out with Cory Thomas fight he just comes out swims at you you want to throw down in the beginning do did you ever see that it was like when they first start doing the countdowns they did a countdown on Sean Sherk I remember train it changed the way I thought about training showed him with this weighted vessel yeah and he's climbing up stairs yes like he's doing it over and over yeah dude did his entirety I was sure the charts off that he was the big paydays him Invisalign he was like like like where Steve works he was nice in UFC he was open Evita sighs but he had like a Ken Shamrock he was so he was so good so Jack that whole squad you're right man yeah Pat Miletich team is we know what I have whatever you know what else I would give a million dollars to see a prime BJ Penn versus khabib Oh muskan the case is is BJ Penn's jujitsu you shut your mouth hey guys I will bring my school you want BJ you worry about Corona pan one two Mundi Al's as a black belt three years in the training do you understand the reason I know but happy bro do you understand I'm saying is I would give a million dollars to see that fight to not saying I know who would win also BJ world class bond to you bitch a lot whole motherfucking hey guys hey guys hard though when he locks up your fucking hey bro DJ pen down good luck man bounces around sort of a fucking pre-transition have you ever seen the takedown defense of primes use your head around on one leg do you watch out because I really know I don't like the way you're fucking getting all straight back because I'll meet you halfway and you know this with a serpent Brian listen Matthews is one of the freakin most freakishly strong guys there's a ever competed in the welterweight division he was freakishly strong he would get a hold the motherfuckers in his pouch you would see it horrible wrestling just fuck farm boy you sure sure sure when BJ Penn just fucking took his back and strangled him I was like holy KJ punched him in the face and knocked out a second time he beat her the first time beating he took his back and strangled oh no this is I was like holy shit I hear you listen to me primetime BJ Penn was one of the baddest motherfuckers that ever walked the face of the earth hundred percents of fact there was a few years in there and most people don't they don't maintain that kind of level for longer than a few years he was supplying a pen do you primetime BJ Penn was one of the bat I'm fine yeah there's no doubt guys do this fight right here like this 100% dude I know hey you don't want to break it about - I don't mean to go you know people forget it here it was fun Frank Trigg Mike Craig look at this this is the first time we tapped yeah and the second time we knocked him out it was late in his career man was leaving to his career he finally lyoto machida to write on the rock ran right through Ludwick herby beats him well he was too small for George you know the the George fight was a mistake he's look at him here compare his physique to George's I do know after he would after him he tried who's gonna be balls and BJ no fuck he'll find it bars look I'm giving way I'm kidding nobody did to GSP they just showed our boys at teen on like Davy is a real legit street fighter yes he's been fighting on the street his whole fucking life he's a street fighter who learn jujitsu the Sean Sherk one remember when he was it Kenny Florian that he tapped he wouldn't let go and lick the blood was that Kenny or was that Diego I thought that was Joe Stephenson know with with Kenny he kind of went like this over him there was who would he who did he fight where they were opposing each other's coaches on the ultimate fighter who was BJ beats so many guys he also fought didn't he get yet there's many right that's like what there was one where he like didn't want to let go I want to hear my BJ Penn story how I first sure I met him dude no no no interrupt in here we just watch this awesome I'm a but when I was a blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Jean Jacques Machado as a competitor I sucked I was Tara I wasn't that good I was I was just too nervous and I was and Scott Redondo he was a blue but also he was a good friend of mine in competition he just fuckin won at Bluebell he'd go out there my Scout redondo got balls he goes out there and fucks everybody up I'm too scared but I'll go out there and maybe I'll sleep you I don't know but how was I never thought of myself as a fighter ever right so me doing jujitsu I was like did I'll take fucking anything you know the man people said you never want a championship I'm like dude I never try to win no championship I just got in here and had some fun and I'm out you know so some dudes like to help but Scott redonda was the man so Joel Moreira back in the day 1996 he was throwing all the the only Jiu Jitsu tournament in LA it was Joel Moreira every it was odd and everybody was a fucking blue belt there was no purple belt sir Brown those everybody was a blue belt and when he threw a tournament down here in Irvine people from San Francisco came down and BJ was training at half Gracie in San Francisco everybody was scared to go to help Gracie school cuz you go to help Gracie school you tap he'll fucking punch you so you're not allowed to tap in health Gracie school so everyone everybody was scared and that's cool and helpful fuck you up if you tap so they came down Dave Camarillo Dan Camarillo there to judo brothers there were black belts in judo and now they're blue belts in jiu-jitsu they're coming down BJ Penn I had no idea at this point I'm just at the tournament I'm thinking Scott redonda I already lost and I'm just following Scott Redondo he's about to do a turn but he's fucking people up like he always does scour don't fuck everybody up and then on the other side of the bracket I was I noticed that was this kid this dude looked like he was 13 oh shit and he was fucking everybody up sorry this fight just got crazy okay okay I need to a punch yeah I can't came down with a did you notice Joe he has a for us in his corner Oh Johnny one who's that Tristar that's a good five six even know how they cry laughs no punk either Doe Jesus Christ no and krylov's tight with his his offense is tight everything is like real good sharp technique straight down the pipe oh right long spit around and Johnny Walker coming off the KO loss to Corey Anderson like you never know like it's whenever get skill fighter gets kod you never know do you have our cm kevlar movie oh shit mark our dude crazy power oh shit these are serious help those are legal those are legal boy I can cry laughs baby is well cry love is not really arrested raise a karate guy I mean he can sure pretty sure he's gonna get back down that's the tape he's obviously he's done on MMA stuff limits guys but he's original his original martial art I believe is karate no she looked like the third phaidor brother pronounced in karate okay that's how my sensei my sin separate forces to say that otherwise he would beat me with a bamboo a green bamboo cane brendi remember when dis guy was fighting heavyweight he's like man he's not cut in any way no no I mean he could he wasn't bad there no you're just undersized and the powered engines like somebody tough this is a tough fight for Johnny Walker it's not like an easy one he's right Johnny Walker is racially ambiguous well take a Brazilian I bet his mom was like straight Brazilians dad's black I'd love to have a little Brazilian a little Samoan and me god damn it well maybe a little boy I think you would do well with a little bit of Japanese if you had like sweet smile and I want you can Islander him but he didn't claim samurai blood shit like that we're gonna inject new genes into you and like I do in seven years you start turning to another race I do it 90% happen if we could all do that that's CRISPR hey Brian I'm trying

like I like Buffalo Trace I like Jack Daniels or gel and Jack you've not had this whiskey because you're a goddamn American Japanese shit my favorite was Buffalo Trace because it was made in 1772 it's called making it they know I love them oh there's no way this fight seems to have his you should calm and telling you coach no no you know they should fire for us and put you in there be no respect I know man this training is nice amuse he doesn't need a trainer he needs the music I know do better when I when I trained cut out the and gufu we always kept our hands off my train Jamie do you have a towel or something just so it doesn't strain we need a trick I needed a shirt says I do train peerless that's perfect for it I think you're right babe for real train like dogs like I train dogs no no let go train bro tell me what says like I'm your master some shit Lee do you know many guys I've asked that when I look at them what I know you train them sure I already know you know it I could tell

against him shit I don't like that guy get off you else nuts okay the loss can be the whole game let me stress this cuz I can't stress this enough 99.999% of the population would have got loathe or lured into a trap by ul in that fight that's how good stop its house it's damn old respect yeah and there was a lot of people that were saying that he didn't touch him I didn't strike much how about the kid he fucked his leg up with cakes for sure but I think that's the one of the only ways you're gonna beat that guy why would you risk everything you're the champ you're the number one middleweight in the world why would you risk everything and and play to his game well it's also looked how it worked out for Whittaker in the second correct in the second fight Whitaker got hit with some big bomb or any way to survive because he's tough as fuck but there's a lot of people that would have gone night-night wouldn't you I'll hit him with those big ball Jude oh they announced Whitaker chill air I know Coronas fucking matchups pretty sure they never deal I believe a motherfucking fight that's a motherfucker let's say till I stop Andrew a while till style bender crazy dude tail style Darren tells a beast 5 to view but his coming out party was against me yeah he's so big he should have been at 85 a long time ago he weighed 201 or 203 pounds when he stepped into the Octagon with the gorillas son you have seen John Liverpool's finest so when is our UFC Dublin Oh Saturday August 15th Oh there'll be a world by then fight last he's pot stomping he got knocked out what til til til he won last yeah he beat he look great Kelvin Kelvin Gastelum good fight great fight you talk fire yeah yeah by Kelvin no tight shorts man tells dangerous he's got some of the best hands in the fucking sport and just toughness and wrestling and cause he's got sneaky hands like crazy family left that left hand that he hit Bisping with remember that Samet aw I don't know a lot of people think you know most people weren't satisfied with yo l against style bender but at least like for me anyways I never really I didn't know how good style business is footwork and his fainting in his family moves like even though there wasn't that much action I was a little little bit like into this movement am I thinking god damn I didn't realize he was 6 foot 4 holy shit and he moves like he's a hundred and fifteen pounds yeah everything he does every movement is like I'm like a terminator like the perfect Micah the perfectly crafted machine he also believes a shit that's a six foot four I couldn't agree more six foot four and he moves like perfection and take a bunch I described him as the most sophisticated striker dude we've ever seen I got more than Anderson Pierre mansion but at the same time he's just level up here sometime you look at your well in the same goddamn fight a whole different robot his robot is like he will jump at you with the ultimate fury fucking with some lightning and take you down and crush you all within a second different matches my head doctor that was examining him like who the fuck is this guy oh he's the second best better way in the world he would explode and it would explode everybody's like what the fuck was it he is so he's any so good at wrestling that's the one thing that you rarely see from them I was can i point his team in the third and fourth fifth how come noise like dude that game plans not working they start taking such a blast under give the time to take them down if anybody knows hold down style bender it would be guy named you all it's not for example - no it's crazy it's style manners not easy to take down you could tell right you make your own pie I think he could have held him down Yeah right what if he could you think you would take him down and let him up on purpose the only one the only nosal's don't know the only person not gonna take him down at that way class and do what you think he could do is someone who's doing it all the goddamn time and and is known for it you got to be a fucking professional like a beep he's known he likes fucking people up on his feet he's not he loves it nobody down he wants to fuck and just explode you know what I think it is or you'd wanted to be able to style bender I just don't know Ryan comes from a family of boxers yes I do yeah I also think it's hair from because he doesn't he doesn't want to he doesn't want to gas out is he tired you see a head kick Oh see if we get the knee bar he's got to go for a knee bar oh shit what is he doing five months ago we were saying Johnnie Walker is the guy to beat John Jones yeah well you still as dangerous as fuck I don't just this is uh this hotties no match for him coming off of bouquet oh nice to eat the body how is that other guy gonna win your fight those guys exhausted but it it's anything like if it's ending like this I don't think the last it doesn't matter what you did the whole fight it doesn't even matter I know I know you're right but that's where the flaw is right there because these poor not win the motherfucking fight if you again if the end of the fight looked like that and you said I want but if you're winning for four minutes in 30 seconds and the last 30 you get roll your reionization who you right no can't give the other round no no you're right that's what that's how the sport oh yeah but that's where pride got it down the best I green and how are they do because because are they doing hey listen they got some problems OC said cool story get the fuck out of here oh well bye you guys know we're gonna leave it open site close up shop give us all your talent okay so that means they go down financially and that means they didn't all their theories and ideas are shit is that what that mean I mean it could have took some good ideas from them talking over each other are we gonna see style better John Jones yeah how crazy cuz you John demo this house the second round guys this is one more round yes the third round jungle up is down two rounds okay it looks like Johnny Walker - oh yeah deep breaths keep it on its hands brother keep it on its feet I mean John Lahr coach Allen the corner keep him on his feet keep - are you talking the time you Johnny walkers corner cry off for Krylov well I he's Mike he's one of my profile oz body why did you wanna get him in the face down dude he socked somebody you just gotta start from the ground it's not great hey tell him to get up with a guillotine time to stand up he's right there oh sweet legs yeah tell him to sweep him here Ryan that's this gag is not working all right no it didn't come the job hey from I gotta read though we got to read the room did every room read the room sorry guys I get so involved in fighting it's my life dude you saw a bug fly across the screen I panicked so the fuck did I call Big Bird dude a corona fly Oh mounta oh dude where I loves to travel come on pop pop pop pop do you remember back in the day oh please forever oh shit doh Tasha coming back these guys are guys remember when hoist fought and he mounted someone no no no Marco who us I'm trying Marco I'm trying look at this look at this oh he had it he had somebody fought Remco part two way back in the day and when he mounted him Remco tapped out because we thought once someone got the mount that was where now guys are so good off you know they're so good you know what a smart mother we're like dude I killed off mess the Marco who our era like calling fights live they get a chance to see you know your yeah after I wasn't hitting the Paul varlyn fight dude I remember training jiu-jitsu and and watching the UFC I'm I'm doing jiu-jitsu for a year year and a half and all my friends are there afraid to do what they won't do it I'm trying to drag him but they wondered we're watching the UFC and I forget who it was but he was a Taekwondo guy who had been doing jiu-jitsu for six months and they said that like he was about to find forget his name he can't worship he had been used a Taekwondo black belt had a bunch of schools and he had been doing jiu-jitsu for six months and I remember telling the whole party I said DJ you've been doing it for six months like it was a long time like it was a very long time I'm like he's gonna for sure look at this no I thought for sure he was gonna armbar this guy and the whole time dude krylova's good top control had a brief conversation with your voice what you stop dogging Kron Gracie no yeah exactly it was God dude okay I don't appreciate throw people under the bus I don't want to go bro bro had a conversation with Kron Gracie I see him let yes yes sir everyone and he's there and I say hey what's up because hey and then out we're talking a little bit and and then I go like this he goes yeah I'm looking to fight you know pretty soon and I go cool man you know he dude to fight her don't fight you have nothing to prove and then he goes yeah I do I have a lot of us you know if you want proof I was over there yes sir it was it yesterday uh Thursday I was over that's why I called you oh really yeah yeah did you ever see Gary tonin versus Kron no did you just say hell yeah was there life as a résumé one that was before korone throne did Kron did in the last moments of the match did he get a guillotine he we shook hands we shook hands off him sorry man I Crona off the top of my head I did smoke a lot of weed it Gary was all over Kron and it was less than a minute and Kron turning around somehow fantast and then choked out Gary talk did he get his back he got his back it was one of the craziest matches ever because it looked like Gary's memory was beating wrong Gracie everyone's I have you had crows yeah yeah yeah I love I'm a fan of his I fucking love his his juice is off the hook man he's a master yeah it's beautiful great guy yeah nobody really knew Gary Tawna back then and all of a sudden this fucking guy's bringing him home no heat on crown and it looks like it's over and something happened where I forget man Nixon's in his corner he's just oh no this that was a different match when he went out crowing against otávio Souza from Gracie baja otávio was playing you know the game everyone smile the game sound the outside its chrome chrome they'll fuck you up you tried to take him down he wants you in his guard Kron is one of the or black belts that is really dangerous from full guard he fucks he tapped out jttours off his back and full guard with an armbar I mean Roma's Kron and Roger Gracie are two of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu legends that are known for attacking from full guard not too many more attack control guard basic ass shit this is super basic but chrome get you in that super basic shit or Roger Gracie get you in that super basic shit close guard you're in trouble so it's even so Gary told us all about that - Gary Turner was all over them you know everyone's more Beijing dude Cersei there was 14 people in the audience in Beijing it was like yeah why is that right why only 14 Eddie dude I don't know we just went up for their own assumption we don't know about it but they always got dude do you think the government is not privy to the fact that you can control the masses with some with some disease should we do to the government dammit Brendan Brendan he made him take a turn he won first laughs one there was nobody there it was Abu down to four basil no bud that was 13 people in the art that's so weird dude they didn't give a shit out there no but Garrett tenem was all over Kron and then the very end dude he was the craziest comeback ever people were like holy shit who is his Gary tonin god you're still here Tony's a shapeshifter New Jersey he's a Jersey guy yeah and they started with homeboy at Enzo's right Donna Hart was he at Donna her product he was originally he Cassandra and all those monsters no no he's got he's under Danaher now yeah originally he was like in a hen's of affiliate in Jersey or something but yeah then so was that was when people first found out about Gary Turner right that he was still a brown belt I think maybe he just got his black belt or something nobody knew who the fuck he was but right there from that vibe came on and then he DBI and then he won five EBI titles kenny kenny floor and he was saying Ryan Hall trained with the men's gym in Santa Monica what's his gym called B you go there which one Kenny Florence I'm Eric Meraki my son Trey yeah in Santa Monica and he says Ryan Hall you know he trains Ryan Hall he's like this shit he does do it he says like fighting water whoo because I made well right off with water and you know Ryan Hall just got paired up you just got a big fight finally someone was like y'all fight that fucking guy what's his name big fight big fight for right now bring that shit up Joe damn it I forget who it is to be infected be with it we all have remembered it we have crown you got CT now enjoy shit yeah yeah Brendan Schaub CT who's he fighting Ricardo Ricardo Lamas is a good fire trying halls up the motherfucker Ryan halls is like he took the same journey that Fabricio Werdum took and and like when Fabi so came out Brazilian black belt world champion everybody in the jujitsu world knew that somebody still was the fucking on the highest level you can get in jiu-jitsu but in the beginning in MMA his you know he was out there doing the little boys but he started with cro cop yes is grappling : ride yes yes yeah when you when you look at his actual fights yeah he's a stand-up is not good he's not at you in his early fights he's clearly not a striker so he went through a lot of growing pains when when a lot of jujitsu instructors at that point would go you know what fuck this taking dudes down was really hard and I don't have that much time let me just stick to fucking teaching I'm fine you know but Bobby sir just kept on he he wasn't a strike a lucky guy he was a gigai and he came on and all of a sudden you know he then he became he started fucking knocking dudes out and all of a sudden he stuck it out and then he became a a very respected striker and then he became a champion and that it's not just a champion you want to accomplish the same thing with runs tapped out everyone great for dooms top three heavyweights of all time a hardness number one Dashiell accomplishments but it was out of phaidor and Kane are you fucking kidding hey fade or what it was fade or cool yeah well I beat the fuck out of Kane my point is people forget about three-foot timeline where there was a there was a time if you remember no big deal he didn't look as striking didn't look good but then slowly he stuck it out for like six seven years it was a long period of time its keys stuck it out that's a Ryan Hall that's what I'm getting to Ryan Hall he got in he he's known as one of the best jujitsu players but he gets an MMA he's just like you know the reinhold knows four legs only document no no but not only roll straight fucking legs that's about he he's a good striker this is a funny conversation a person has to talk about it he's a good what I'm saying is Ryan Hall is a he went through the exact same thing buddy silver dude went through he stuck it out and now if you look at his striking he said people are they're afraid to throw down with them because he's gonna take you down if you get in close so it's strike he's long he throws high kicks he's like he got great footwork he's got the striking to make his jujitsu work that's what I'm saying sorry I've not seen a lot of stress I was on the 18th balaam Ahamed and lymangood I thought that Tony fer to be fight whew that's a good one that's a barnburner so that's one of those ones you holy shit occupy wild if Tony could be Bill who's more bodied up in that lineman fella my word Mary so jacked 170 but he ain't 170 about thirty second let me get mad he's a big fella dude Kevin Lee at Tristar I love it man yeah now what do we know about he miss wait and then he came back and made is that were we're hearing I heard he made it is that right Jamie that he originally missed it and then he made it but there no one who's an Intendant yeah but that's what does that count I don't know that count I don't know what the final well who is a corrector who's that guy that was fucking beast and who was undefeated at the time he's still yeah like that's why my good side life what are you talking about my son cover Brazilian Fitness motherfucker this he's over jacked looks like he could sound like hey hey not so hey not so Ranjha like he put his words easily you will you'll never be happy I'd like to stop right there that pictures you know what him and Luke Rockhold I love tapas one of them's battling I like

written all over it do you know who this who not to my car knows fighting do you know the gentleman no I don't know this guy god there's so many fighters now do you know the UFC how many fighters a

stop shooting change things 3 there's only a few people on set oh no there's a shitload of people inside crazy I know that's crazy the thing is the thing is they're responsible if someone in your family is you know not sued Eddie they don't want people to die if your grandpa lives with you or your dad lives with you or you're in contact with them on a daily basis and you get it from a set but your immune system again handle it and then all sudden grandpa dies 20 years young problems that's real like that grandpa yes your grandpa your seven year old grandpa its percent more men than it is

blood pressure people are well it's like your resistance to any kind of disease the the thing that they're saying that's really good for this is good for everything's be fit get yourself in shape get your body in shape it's it's a defense mechanism that you you can actually build up yourself hey B so what's with your show so it's like obvious lying can be like come out and I obsequious I know but what they do is like sorry we already shot the finale actually oh so that's where that this yeah oh that's a word so you shot him out of order yeah but we kind of need it do you still get paid no because you know the NBA MLB they're not they're not gonna pay with the soft and I've gotta pay them they got families well they should be I've lost a lot of money we all have just not this one episode yeah and also I'll you know if they cancel my road gigs which I hope they don't already scheduled you can get that money back I saw the most outrageous article I need to find out if this is true so Jamie help me out here they're saying that Amazon not Amazon Whole Foods was asking their employees to donate their sick time to other people who might need it if they get the coronavirus parents to just stop and think about instead of saying hey you work for us we got you we'll take care of you we know crazy times fortunately we have a lot of money deeply it's like no no you guys need to get your money together and take care of your little problem because we're over here it's craziest we're making most of money I hope it's got some good cheese dude I don't know who makes that decision but I know who should definitely never let that massaging get get out that decision get out there's Jeff Bezos he's the richest man on earth so if he's the richest man on the floor honey let him have his money if he's a richest man on earth and he knows about that he's like sounds good to me that's fuckin car you know what the guy works hard he got Whole Foods he's got probably got a divorce and his wife was she the richest female in the world now off the divorce here we go have respect look at this the CEO reportedly recommends that employees donate to PTO at a time on any time off to another amidst the corona virus pandemic well look at that booty okay they're going after him for some reason we fucked up they're turning that's fuckin Bezos the guy has five trillion dollars why do you think the did he get the burning on him he's protected he's protected he made a deal with the CIA see hey you don't think so don't you think he's an ageist you don't know about Jesus Christ he's supposed to be protected and they're fuckin smearing him he fucked up he fucked some time I read it he somethin happened because he was protected okay he was protected and now they're throwing him under the bus he hit on somebody's wife hey you know who's nice to get murdered like your boy who supposedly commits suicide yeah but your boy hard wines he's gonna go any day now he thinks I'm gonna murder him he has too much beef too much batches he's this celebrity to the celebrities how about that Weinstein is is a thousand times bigger and more powerful than Brad he could make or break your career for the phone call out so just what nobody knows who yes but every celebrity knows who he was everybody knew who he was to though they would and they're friends with them they would say his name when they went to exam speeches you know thank you my point is they got him he's body's immune Hollywood well in Hollywood nobody's himself piece of shit gonna start going down one by one watch Tom how much was the first one they got the kingpin and now everybody hears Madison he did big he's fine oh this is what you're seeing is King behavior right when you hear about mad Kings when you hear about mad Kings when you hear about people that are in these gigantic positions of power and they act like savages and yell at people and off with their head knowledge and shit that's King B he was the only one think of assassinations at Kings what do you think of you think of off with their head kind of fucking head off the picture but this is what happens when someone gains absolute power like what is that old expression absolute power corrupts absolutely Harvey Weinstein was a piece of shit yeah but Brian that's part of why it's part of why he was a piece of shit why he was a piece of shit because he was in this incredible position of power and he recognized that that was the way that he could act out this power was to have immense amounts of influence on people and then he can get away with all kinds of crazy shit and he could be the guy that was untouchable oh shit it's over look at my car it's over what Connors under the chin Hamas Oh who's the one in 45 seconds the guy got a second guy from the Bond movie he's still talking shit to him after he tapped him out mikanos filled with a ton of anger dude he's a bad motherfucker he's a bad motherfucker I mean he got stopped by Aldo but Aldo hit him with a perfect liver shot man remember that yeah we heard you use the rampage for whether that's claiming I poked him that's why fuck that's what he's claiming exactly why else would he be talking shit after he got choked down I think Meccano start talking shit to him no no maybe maybe he was trying to get out he stuck him in the eye and we didn't see any sense got me in the eye talking to right now there's no crowd there's no one here see what happens let's see if he you could see him poke him in the eye resumption if it's bullshit no before that Oh before that he's saying that's why he got his back I read this image well what's going on married there get your ass out of my face he might have been trying to jam in the eye dude it's hard to tell but once you're in the back no there's no problem look he's he's talking shit and the Connells don't he start talking shit when he does look like the cameraman didn't get the opportunity position to catch that yeah well 45 second rear naked choke is due to a professional fighter he's a beast monster he's a guy that's always been kind of on the cusp right I know he's right that's right fuck there's a lot but listen there's a lot a lot of MMA fighters that don't train correctly on the ground oh yeah there's a lot there there's a large percentage that really don't even work on the ground too much like I show me how to get out oh no you gotta get out of a rear naked choke once he's a fucking champion and I showed me and I know and then I'm gonna fight and I'm gonna revert back to what he showed me there's a lot of dudes like that out there they don't realize the only way to know what the fuck you're doing on the ground is by training on a regular basis multiple times a week consistently for years that's how you know that's in he Kevin Lee was not allowed by the doctor can't continue come wait it's up to Charles believe it if you know so he missed it yeah it's all right it's not likely is it in physical condition to fight but it would be impossible to cut to two and a half pounds in one hour the counter didn't give up - see abb MMA said stillborn the Brazilian Commission we managed only cut point five pounds I think Brian reading so he was two pounds over no problem I like to skip past all of it I read you boys can see you can see that I admit that I really I do I've read three books my whole life I admit that I admit that how you dislike used to wake up when we hadn't like books that when we had book reports should I would just make up my own stride go up and I just make up my own fucking fuck and you know what miss Michael in seventh grade she everybody around me knew I was making up stories gonna here with him sang and Miss okay God what's he talking about why was he so mad it's gonna be all it's reduce speak Portuguese Brian yes he does shut your mouth when it was a spy he learned myself through college his head Portuguese interpreter when his parents were consonant and humping small child he was schooled in many arts oh he's talking about a kid Stevens yes yes yeah well CB Calvin cater he's a bad motherfucker and cater fight right he was getting a title shot after the Jose Aldo but then you know Calvin cater fight word K he started kicking Calvin's leg yep what's he fight at 145 despair but Bisbing remember Bisping fought 205 in the Ultimate Fighter right and then fought 85 through the majority of is promise I'm fucking huge in fiver yeah the kids big man cuz Bisping's he's a big fucking 85 hobbit okay he's big man when you compare like he doesn't look like he's forty pounds like oh he looks pretty fuck I guarantee you that dudes cut in twenty well at least there's so many of them that our customers wait this is awesome you know people don't go away dude I wish they didn't I really do I really do I really do oh dude that's right or take us submitted them oh that's right dude you see or take in Queens aam be going at it yeah slap that shit about that guy I can't believe you did that why would you slap a rapper I don't feel like you should talk shit online well no if that's the thing that we really did the guy Jane you gotta get slapped [Applause] people love to talk shit so you slapped impersonal if you can make the connection if you could verify this the guy you give them a little combat jujitsu no big deal that's exactly what you're talking shit you you should be saying shit you wouldn't say to somebody to their face correct correct yeah or no for sure yes yeah but you shouldn't be smacking people especially when you're a professional depends on what he thought he said it was something about how his friend Korean Zombie was gonna kick or take his ass most likely I'm just guessing most likely that kind of shit like he's gonna fucking I'm gonna cold oh really isn't it kind of cool that I dude who talks share on the Internet gets fucking smackdown isn't that kind of cool a little bit a little bit isn't that kind of cool but it's not that well it's not exactly what's going on he's hyping up a fight as well he's a famous rapper so he's a famous rapper he's hyping up a fight those fight no but any break his bones come on but if you're if you're shit this is a silly piece you're a pro fighter you don't want to be doing that there's no slider it's it's a nice thing Sara Curtis you never know know but if you talking shit online you should take a little little smack but Eddie it's not regular talking just to promote a nice man oh no big shit to promote a fight it's not you insulted his manhood they're talking shit about a book for Humanity if the good things for Humanity no it's not No violence it's fucking stupid her justice do is to find sex violence sucks between a guy who has no chance please what is this we shit I'm not bombing Iraq which I know a guy I'm a professional fighter smacking a guy who's not you know shunned do that a little slut ask me what I would do with brown Ortega slapped me if Brian you would drop to me ask me what I would spit on this class me what I do drop earring hell spit us balls from now you're both wrong you know what I do you wouldn't mess with his asshole because you don't know him like that for at least three weeks before you start fucking with his eyes oh he's a beautiful young man if he slapped me I turn the other cheek I like a Christian yeah like a Christian and then I'd suck is God all right you don't have to suck it no no sorry not sorry my point is I think that he even probably would now probably apologize it probably has you should apologize you should apologize he's sharing a dunny now and then when you hear a story like that it kind of makes you feel like maybe if it's justified maybe it was justified if someone just says something really heinous if he mounted him and dropped some fucking scott morris fucking elbows pat smith back in UFC - - that's a different story I don't approve a wake up call little wake-up call maybe he's a professional fighters just some acting guy that's kind of helpless shouldn't do that you shouldn't do it cuz he's a killer man he's a good guy and he got worked up about it he probably shouldn't be reading comments first of all and second of all he shouldn't be reacting that way to someone who's trying to hype a fight if I had to guess why the guy was saying that you saying it to support his friend and he probably didn't understand how offensive it would be to Brian Brown Ortega for life Ortega now I'm a fan I am a fan of Ortega he's up there and I just can't wait for him to get back in because it's been quite a while heal a knee injury it all started because they let that the guy who he slapped jay Park they let him run cream zombies social media the screen zombie gonna talk shit so that J part was like oh let's hyping up so I can show on there and then Brian's like do I'm telling you keep talking shit when I see you it's gonna be a problem and then they see him and they're like oh crap he went to the bathroom and then Brian's like no no I don't have problem screens on me I know you guys told me he's running what's up now dude and then slap them I like so that's where you're looking like I kind of give it I don't need it but I kind of get listen I'm a thousand percent I don't need Brian's also straight Street Brian from the streets toughest dudes in LA like that's what he's used to I swore him to but I think you got to have some more respect I knew was bad because I was tapped I was disappointed in or taken I was just pointing that I called Henner I'm like dude what's your boy doing this here's what's going on this why I did I don't approve of it either I wish II didn't do that but Brian told him dude you guys we don't need to talk shit you keep doing this when I see you it's gonna be a problem there's gonna be some laws eventually eventually there will be some written fucking bills and laws where if you say a certain thing or side be cool fucking just combat jujitsu be cool it's worth this it's a fucking the main knuckles the main knuckles like my dad I go dude who's gonna be a lot of people built like Karelin just running around smashing people if that's the kind of world you want or it's gonna be bigger people that run everything bigger stronger than when everything nothing well we gotta have rules man the reasons are you can't talk shit on the Internet if you don't expect a little slap okay well don't mind going to jail because you can't smack people and go into combat today the Commission you talked about if you could talk guys that are in problems with each other into engaging I'm with you guys you just to rather than have a physical altercation I have talked to people online and someone combat jujitsu slaps you and the fussing strong oh you're talking to you should cause nickname is talk shit get hit get hit and then I hug and I say okay look at Woodley Edwards that's a sleeper people are sleeping on a party that's everybody if he's to fill out good performance because people sleep on Edward yet sleep on Woodley oh fuck no I'm not saying he beats him I'm just saying if you were to beat him and committing it's his show good it's just coming up he's love prediction when cowboy was compromised cowboy was sick in that fight and didn't fight well still went to a decision and Cowboys not Allah I mean he certainly can beat guys and good guys at 170 pounds but he still could make 55 the real 70s can't make 55 away tyron woodley not making 55 tales not making 53 buddy he hits goes down you look what he did there until darren tells this terrifying striker this destroy Cerrone looks like a fucking animal smashes people has a wicked wicked muy Thai nasty elbows middles and the smash ISM drops him to the ground and and beats on them and then strangle so it's hard with least so far he's welterweights of all time he doesn't respect man knows the last fight with this man was a tough pill to swallow he wasn't he didn't perfect a shit but even before that when he was reigning champ the US he never gave Woodley his due for I think it's also because there's too complicated performances against wonderboy they weren't they weren't that exciting so for whatever reason look different people have different ways of looking at things my way of looking at the wonderboy tyron woodley fights is that's as good as anybody had done against wonderboy at the time and that's the only way to fight he figured out the Rubik's Cube but have used have you come back come back and watch them it was way better stop bender Joel Romero oh yeah some songs routes would he clips yes wonderboy yes like it's a good fight oh well he hurt him bad particularly in the second that's one mm-hmm you know what to fix a lot of these problems it's people to sleep is and you gotta have a submission or knockout bonus and it's got instead of instead of five hundred thousand per photo and five hundred thousand to win it's five hundred thousand the show five hundred thousand to knock out or submit that's it not win if you win by decision you don't get the wimba how dare you so they get less money it's too tough that's that that's good fighters to raise they make it apology I fucked up last time we did a fight companion and I confuse Sam Greco who's in someone's corner for Mike Bernardo two things for you down where do you go from k1 legend so shout out to Sam Greco my apology sir how dude he's in someone's corner and you were sober no but to him I want to send there's somebody fax sound Greco's of beats today you ever see sam greco fighting anyone who's a bad back from a bad back he's a bad motherfucker we're like 12 dude those guys you want to talk about like a whole there's a whole era of sport that didn't get the attention it deserved the United States its k1 during its prime during the Andy hook days what here's the drama hurt us Ernesto Hoost in Astros per se it was all my god even though I think these early 2000s I'm watching her like 93 97 how old are you 9 97 10 4 so I was 14 it's a little kid let's let's come up with a classic fight and try to figure out the year went down Bob Sapp okay Bob Saturn esto who's I want to say like 2002 2003 no zap Ernesto I say I say I say mm no it was when it was a little later than that because sap came along around the same time as Nogueira right no for that no not really Nogueira Beto right remember piledrive Nogueira yeah but rusev I did before that because that suffice out for that yeah Nogueira was fighting before so I was fairly new in the scene fairly new in a scene window Gera submitted him and he was smashing everybody when you fought to see the k1 fights were kickboxing and the only guy to fuck him up in kickboxing was cro cop cro cop broke his eye socket he straight left at him and broke his eye socket people who get what a wicked kickboxer cro cop was so scary so scary what year was that Jamie why do I keep calling Henry it wasn't the first one Henry who I said this is number 7 mm mm - then again December 7 2000 so 2000 to Ernesto Hoost I like his guys one two left hook to the body right low kick the low kick would come down his left hook would come to your body and the low kick would literally come down and chop like a tree how many people are watching those why isn't it major panel it was so big it pan gigantic over here there was like we're like all underground watching like everyone we have people over when I've seen MMA but when crow cup fought phaidor I don't want time telling guys to come over and watch it like rather give us a fuck dude but that at least most MMA guys know about those days most and on the new pins a lot of the kids are figuring it out when they hear people talk about fado and the fact of phaidor still fighting fade just knocked out rampage yeah it was Heights definitely be shitty but I said did the fighters release the Allen back I reached the end I mean there's only so many times you could fight no like dinosaurs it's over yeah no dick boy what is that is that you that's me yeah it's my match your brand thick boy yeah three C's like for the last hour going not these two are you I'm thick as fuck look at this belly get out of here I'm doing I'm fat as fuck I'm the fattest anymore oh boy you're talking I'm thinking that that is English hey let's do thin boy boys you're gonna make millions too wrinkly work oh I want to do this thick no no thin boy cuz their guys were like me or a thin that's true I want to do a thin boy series see how that I love these yeah because this is a good fight folks Jamie minds this is a good fight for both Gilberts avert a little more explosive on the feet he's fastest fire that but he's also he got his name in jujitsu them hmm you don't get from Jitsu phenomenal BJJ oh he's phenomenal they're both he's same level on the ground and he can bang on the feet yeah yeah you would give day me my other nod no interesting on this returns is he's phenomenal high level right now the guys about the world format because he can be any average is world class fight an e bi he didn't do a B I didn't know he died BJJ that's not everything I don't know yeah yes high high low but he's just like Damon Maya that that same level the same level but younger Tim you know yeah he's really good I love doing even might not be a might not be able to pass this guy's guard if he gets him down he might vary the only variables are Damian I used to fight at 85 Gil were used to fight at 55 anyway better competition and he's got old man strength there you go and yeah he's been just know this there's no way in hell Damon Maya manhandles him on the ground it's gonna happen super high level hey Joe the other thing is he's a Henry hoof guy right listen yeah I love Demian Maia I love him but if Gilbert Burns took his back and choked him out I wouldn't be shocked [Applause] control Burns is good hey listen I agree he's really really good I wish I'd just go on the ground Dolph for a minute we'll see what's up hey can I say - I love Dave me man look at this this is not good man this is not good at all for Damien I'll hook it out come on look at that's beautiful oh you see how good that was - yep you see how sweet I don't want to see him showing highest level just admired same thing - yeah he's high level to the dinner - takedowns no punk they're both the best you can get he's a relentless motherfuckers been in the game forever the one thing Danny Meyer has a big advantage on is the experience of jiu-jitsu with strikes in greasy bodies no rash guards yes way more expense a cage that's it there's a lot of em in fact there's no rash guard the greasy sweaty and the strikes but he's got a lot going for him I mean he's got everything but he's also experienced so real last competition I thought Damien Damien Maya fought since Silva back in nice guy Gilbert burns yeah why does a little taste in my peepee that's hilarious that was brilliant what would have been and winstram blast from he went straight charitable chance he really did hit him again look look at this this is actually kind of sportsman like look that's good very good stop but what a beautiful left hook check this is why I love Damian I'll always have a special place in my heart for him when I got knocked out by Nogueira and Brazil I planned I thought was gonna smoke no guarantee like party and whatever do my thing in Brazil so I stayed another week and the lowest point of my life I'm so depressed all my team flies back I'm there just with my brother and my best friend clop and we're at a bar and you know people are nice to me with whatever I'm the white boy there and then Demian Maia sees me and gave me feed biggest hug and I needed it so bad yeah I just saw him randomly on the streets he's like we love you man he's a good day me mine's a good man I love him too I hear nothing but great things about it as a purse he's the best best he's been he's been in the game for a long time and I what's funny is when he was fighting been asking us guys want to go with granny how he seen me on the ground I think I think bands can get it done I remember you Texan like did on townie man don't pump because and put a lot of money on Ben because I love Ben and Joe's like I'm telling you dude bet it's it's a bad idea what yells to the ground you the only guy who told me he's a terrible idea when he goes to the ground he gets cooled he's a Blue Bell dude you know he's a great player but all he's gonna do is try to stay once to have a step ahead I was thinking the scramble and out of all the shit I constrict that's what he is he's an expert in strict he's an expert in strangling the fucking life out of you I talked about Gilbert Burns day me - still takes his back yeah my foot down my throat damn tickling my special combination of he's got length especially 170 also he's got a tremendous amount of experience against way bigger guys remember when he fought all those fucking beasts at 75 or at 85 7 name I came out in 5 and he found them he thought if he's the guy 270 at the beginning lose UFC career who the fuck knows the chance he's world champ yes real good chance real good chance there's only it's him and then Jacare buck when he what he did to Carlos Condit what he did to Neil Magny you watched those those situations that he fought Neil Magny that's right because notice what Neil loses the good BJJ how did he look against phenomenal Jing Liang phenomenal phenomenal you know they came in he came in that fight Neil Magny was an underdog what you guys know where does Byrnes fight out of what's his cattle um he's uh Henry hoops Henry hoof Florida same guy where Luke comes from B yeah I think I met him I'm sure he's the nicest guy in the world yeah literally the nice gun yeah who spawns down there and that's that you want to talk about if you're a fly on the wall in that gym look beautiful do do we know what's next for did they announce one monster at all yes they dead yeah Mon Mazda I think is gonna happen in July that's a month at

they're gonna try to control things but they have to they have to I will I just got my my subscriptions yeah I got my people that I watch and I love it and I understand where you're coming from but here's some let's let's just make an agreement that some censorship needs to take place if people are doing live execution videos maybe you two should want to show let's say that was the Nazis react that's how they are they wanted to make killing like stop stop stop so where does it start where does it stop in terms of if you you can't allow Isis to make execution videos and you can't allow a certain amount of sex or certain amount of violence I like that where do you cut it off right there but where do you miss that the thing is eddie the where people used to think that line was in line like that yeah you can't kill my buckets on youtube okay what so what would you like you bet no penetration this is this is bodied up black dude massaging these big girls it's you tube it's also on instagram and everybody's asked the question would you let this motherfucker massage your girl he's like a very handsome well-built man and he's rubbing the sheiks ass but she's big she's large I generally when I go get like real legit massages like I make sure female you say female right only always dudes fucking hands in my ass oh you got a man no but I sucked at work no I fucked up I was at

strong strong girls masseuse like you're fat crazy thing is hands I get it they're fucking tired and massaging people all day so that's why they use the elbows right but elbows is too strong but it's lazy no no seriously I'm not even gonna give her away that's how you get to certains not there's an in-between there's a baby to come out before me and I don't even want to give this this is about this dude if the girl is like a hundred and five pounds yeah did I rent to this massage you stood on you she had this in the metal contraption over mine she started she the whole time she's a sister

this is a very very good fight no more massage thing no no please done this is the last fight here's one of the things that I've been thinking when guys don't make weight the record like the regular guys record so your first word no but here's what I'm saying guys who don't make weight do really well oh yeah yeah it's such an advantage that's why the um 30% yeah it's um there was someone had pieced it out like over the last amount of big fights where someone didn't make weight how many times did the other guy lose yeah they get fucked up none does this fight not count though since you didn't know it can't count it's just used to give up 30% of his purse apparently okay here's the other thing Joe have you ever heard of a guinea imagine ready let's say you and I are fighting and we're getting ready for a fight and I miss weight and then they go to ego hey do you want the fight to continue you're like fuck dude that's why every five years yeah right yeah I'll take 3% but fuck dude yeah it's not good because you don't know how much they really gave up and maybe they'll come in stronger because it didn't lose that extra 2 pounds and we get Kevin Lee Kevin Lee looks super angry the audience I can forget look so thick in comparison to how he looked before forgetting there's nobody in the Nam you know what I need to do I need to I don't need to hear this I wish I had

Tommo see he's super super technical to not just on the feet on the ground in transition see Sneaky's got long strikes and oliveira has gotten much much better like over the last like 3 or 4 years he's on a ramp as well Oh Kevin Lee's younger oh yeah people forget how young Kevin Lee is Kevin Lee with ferocity me championship material skillset championship material 100% yeah best way to get them I tell what you want to get on the bad side of the UFC especially Dayton white miss wait really oh dude there's nothing they hate more well it's like I'd rather him slap of me the man wins the four which is what's fucked up it's like the only thing that makes any sense is there might have been confusion as to whether or not the fight was actually gonna take place I like the credit you're giving them but come on he's like yeah can can he how crazy is Tony khabib gonna be with no audience yeah everyone's so goddamn scared there's no way that shit even WrestleMania people do Beatlemania

know you guys don't even know me I'm Brennan or like lovers right prediction not in prediction predictions cabbie like heavily TK leg around really Wow I just think Kevin bright and early is a bag mother you know why Kevin Lee's don't talk over each other I know right do you know why Kevin Lee's about muhfucka because he's a wrestler who uses his expertise to win fights he likes to take motherfuckers down and pick their back you can Kevin Lee likes to take motherfuckers down clean left hook not very many wrestlers think that route dude Oliver Oh joke's on but he's better but okay now on Oliveira side that guy is a fucking savage on his feet Oh Mac you up on the ground on his back on the to the face dude Oliveira looks real good standing up he's a SAP you kick him right in the face dude there's both fucking take him down that's high level high level two different styles but still fucking crazy well Talavera doesn't have a weakness in his game either you know his stand-up is nasty as fuck and his ground game is terrifying charles has a ton of experience people forget how long he's been doing he's just like this hot streak right now six to six or seven in a row yeah just hit his heart they both need to step it up run nice shiny body shine I shot to the body good fucking fight what did he transitions right in the leg locks beautiful beautiful eyes higher level GG doesn't have high level jujitsu we'll see we'll see how advanced T is there's a lot of shit going on right I've been doing the right things people think leglocks our juris MMA keep you second however if you lose you keep attacking with the wall to keep you safe the reap something oh look at that he's safe although Wow people forget that it's it's one's gonna blast them in the face right now oh Jesus oh no don't give your back keV oh my god holy shit this lady's a half guard they're in a very complex configure a busy what the fuck you know what we're seeing here is punch you huh consistently offensive leg locks while you're on your back you break your black they'll go to look at that this is leg locks are great family look out kick outs Devon he's been gone four leg locks the whole time and Kevin Lee Kevin he's gonna blow his life yeah this is real bad he's gotta turn the other way yeah Christ look at this fucking knee dude Jesus Christ oh Jesus Christ no it's hard to see from the other side like what it looks like that's not good oh my god that's not good dude bro that's a Kevin's in trouble here does have from this is probably not gonna tap from this but the whole story so this is Oliver it's got him in a position where Kevin you can touch more yeah and then you don't the whole time he's throwing look at his arm he's got his armpit the holy shrine candles are lavera goodness but they're both olivera's high level did this is high level shoot with the leg locks incorporate incorporating the light he's good constant he's always a defensive look at that always yeah that's a high guard he did I never seen a worker guard that effective I have to go back and watch this and listen to it with no audience I bet it's so weird oh I was watching the prelim like god this is Oliver and this went Delhi he bought him and then Kevin Lee back stepped into like he could he could go into a honey hole but I love how relaxed what were you gonna say about John n ik don't know that he tweeted when Gilbert burns yell direct it was very eerie how it echoed in an empty arena that's so strange who do you give this first round to so far no no but even though even though Charles was doing worse is the entire time end of the round they're both doing work I mean I Oliveira hit him with some really good shots but when Kevin Lee is on top at the end of the round when you up you know hard in the judges eyes to smile I give it to Kevin but Charles had been close just an acting all times back I love that I'm all avoiding I'm all about Charles Oliveira I love the fact that he's a jiu-jitsu black belt and his jiu-jitsu is unorthodox I love all that but at the end of the round if the guys on top of you fucking battering you down how did you win that round yeah all that shit you did didn't really mean that much if this guy's on top of you beating you down right so I give that round - Kevin Lee yeah the you were saying earlier I agree with about the price the old pride rules at the end of the fight counts more not though who's that jumping kick that face so look at this boom there's some nasty ground-and-pound son yeah he's so calculated when he's punching now it's it's so dangerous for him this is a danger I'm biased I'm biased one more round how bright is that fool around on the Kevin Lee twenty more minutes I'm a little upset they make Mike Beltran hide his fucking mustache he's got a mustache get to cut it I thought no it's tucked in it's tucked in his shirt okay look at this man it's wrapped up like a beer I love that guy in there like he's the best guy he's my favorite red he's nobody better than Mike Beltran the best month doesn't interfere he say let's find Oliveira oh dude all right II can't dude but he's so technically nothing's wound up he doesn't wind up with shit you just fire stuff Oh big big shot by kept there yeah I seem to be taking oh my goodness good leg kick ouch goddamn ass good fighters sure and there's some around two kids Oh Kevin goddamn Charles is bringing it that motherfucker but you see what I'm saying about him why not anything but work so good Charles Oliveira he can all day at the office wants to work out blows shoot give a fuck look out Jesus Christ look how clean is technique it does not bother he's like have slow whatever okay look what happens crew do you got okay I like it okay keep doing the uppercut all right turn it up a bit because this is getting boring gotta keep dude he's Holloman you and me talking over each other oh Jesus Charles Oliveira don't give a fuck let me look at him he looks so good I've never seen him look this good and this is one of the biggest fights of his career dude you don't give a fuck oh my [Applause] having me on top now the greatest man this is a great fight can't be smart the Kali is a beast look at him dude he's a beast that's a hard one to finish these are fucking four and he's a strong guy for this weight class all the pair's got to get him off of them right remember there used to fight it 45 yes sir so he wants that back considerably the smaller guy see that's the beautiful thing about Kevin Lee right now is he wants the back cuz that's do you know that's his spot that's what he's known really michael chesson black belt he wants to back those super super impressive that he choked ESL I just wish they'd let it go a couple more seconds so you can see go to sleep just so he taps or goes to sign up but still never doing really she's wrestling the choke when a referee stops the choke that's not necessary unless the guy goes out I agree he wasn't out I agree but he was finished either way but he go guys relaxing in a room right I would bet I would bet the house on it hundred percent I would want to see it I agree also Michael chess at 170 is a mother follow the girl he's a motherfucker always get tender love michael chesson it's impossible to imagine that he actually made 55 well she's a big 75 time he's he's the get he's your dark hers at 70 yeah he's paid for seventy man great good I'll be late on the ground hey right here Kevin Lee wants the back that's where it well that's what he wants their battle going on how would I score in this battle look at that he took he turned that top half into a leglock battle now it's a whole sport whole different sport real quick remember in sales port remember it's in Brazil portrait in Brazil so the judges vision though this position is a whole different thing Kevin Lee's in the top half what why you see that be no I just yeah it depends I score yeah I know I know so I would give Kevin the takedown and control but is that what those always as worth as much as the head strikes that he was what's the most dominant thing that happened this render that and he ended the round on top that's only the second round he held no that's the second are you sure the third no the third coming up next yeah round cardio is not fantastic well look at least got some windows fired here you think so Kevin's going the site this is a hard fight for both guys yes is a hard fight yes and on the feet it's hard because least taking a lot of shots before we can get it to the green skin fuck he's getting piece tough he's getting blast on the feet yeah dude I'm really impressed me tourists don't give up but it's just a technique it's not me doesn't give a fuck it the difficult follower but his techniques super sharp look at that no fat to any of this we can stay in the pocket too and read it and it's so good no telegraphing he just comes me exactly it bribery yeah there's no telegraph that was mean but then he met you bro I teach my guys never do sure your book Kevin and your boy Tony wrestled in college together here we go against each other here we go three Oh jumping front kick two started off see this is where it's most dangerous he's probably a little tired tap to try to go back to fall no no you can't find no Oh what dude he tapped any web BAM my god oh my god oh my god he got caught yeah Olivera is you see she went to sleep right there you put him in a guillotine you think you put him in time I don't know look at that shit he tapped the Geyer right man to rest like a nobody's hoping people didn't see the top let's see it god damn oliver building that front kick to the body what a sit-in much confidence you have to have a bunker to do that half cuz I got this bitch half guard he does this shit that's his shit he's like dude are you kidding me you're coming into my shit oh look it's like he woke up oh shit yeah it's like you woke up and jumped on his back oh my goodness there's a poster right there wow that's crazy yeah he must be great but I was just two more rounds look at this they're cool each other no that's nice to see yeah dude he must have choked him out he must have choked him unconscious and he woke up thinking the fight was still going on that's crazy who's better than ever better than mercy trainer Brazil's better than air what weight division he's so good 45 guys it beats out 45 or 50 55 45 I was 35 that's 55 because he used to be 45 yes and now he was cutting too much weight at 45 1 7 Monroe pretty sure he's awesome 555 move I didn't know you made that move he pull up his record crazy amazing I wish I wish I'd 2 more rounds let is that a Pringle okay that guy's ready first 1 2 3 4 5 6 that's a big fight this is Center submission Jim Miller that's a big fight 3 or naked show of Clay Guida like we'd a goddamn Nik Lentz TKO your boy pal felt or beaten without his last loss in 2017 as he's in lost in 3 years fouled there's a beast remember Felder got on top of them and smashed him that was a fight where he was tested two men he was tested two the guy's got some sneaky hasn't lost show since when he wants us to hunts him do you know what he's got a little spot they could put him in you find that a little spy you could hold him in and you could fucking grind out a decision even Kevin Lee damn it he is super dynamic he doesn't give a fuck standing he's gonna come forward he's gonna throw down some shit you gonna take him down he's gonna choke you or he'll take you down and choke you what's interesting is also that same precision what's interesting also is that his style like when you when you when you watch him fight if you were thinking he's gonna fight Kevin Lee would think well Kevin Lee's best chances on the feet hundred percent that's what you think Kevin Lee just knocked out Gregor Gillespie Kevin Lee is a big powerful powerful guy he didn't make the weight you know he struggles to make that way but on the feet dude he was just a technician the problem is is a flood Kevin's main path is take down to the back and it works on most of these motherfuckers but Charles Oliveira that's a it's gonna be hard to make that path work down and then you're gonna take us back Dan that's a hard task so this guy I saw 55 cents that's his best path so he took it away that's what happened here tonight but it's also his stand-up is so sharp that Kevin was always behind here's what he coming up on the feet he hit him with uppercuts and lead hooks and jabs like he looked like a like a world champion on the feet how static how stacked is 55 ez start it's the best of the UFC phrase you go through the damage of women's women's honestly it's a good thing when I was watching that Chinese chick I swear to god man when Zhang Wei Li Wei lat the color she'd look like a like a super destroyer like that you can't get to your honor though that didn't look like yeah she got a guy yeah I never seen shit like that back she looked like Vulcans were the best friends Japanese fucking samurai destroyed you know but she she was like some childhood in the bathroom yeah five animal Wing Chun destroy her she's we've never seen any I went to the bathroom and I thought you honor one I was a guy I'd give to you honor when I came back though that's one where the judges couldn't got it wrong well they get to waylay all right that's cool all right yeah for sure rematch it's here either been a draw or eyelid raw dude I lean towards you on I did too so barely yes if I tried to buy here I leaned towards you like they i it could have gone either way but you got a you know physical damage that you could see it's got a it's kind of it was a weird hematoma be like yeah they can be the loser can't like have no cuts and then the whatever okay whatever was you gotta go with the one who physically look less damaged if it's that close they're both been six months of it you gotta go yeah okay yeah if she looks kind of fucked up no Eddie it's one strike it's one strike caused that about fucking hundreds of strikes landed just happen to swell up it didn't affect her her performance she still performed very well you can't judge her based on their appearances you got a judge based on the amount of shots that landed is she so close what I'm saying I'm saying it was fucking Aragon either way it could have gone it was fuckin close right everybody agrees it could have gone either way so what's the deciding factor damage physical how about our boys Ronald Mallett shit you gotta count that physical damage our boy Sean O'Malley was fuckin good that Chinese girl family she was fine you know what I mean you know sad yeah he was going back she was gonna party this shout-out to fucking civil where I just say Sean O'Malley looked fantastic Sharma he looked like he looked like a legit legit two years off superstar we came back how crazy is that two years off of that kid comes back looking better than ever never stopped raining he got wrapped up in a bunch of little injuries and then there was a bull shit you saw this like you saw the thing they're like I'm Batman they spat yeah our bad but they had already done it and they already suspended them they don't do anything when that happens either even if you didn't do anything wrong they don't do anything here's the I know it's fucked up but here's the thing it helped a young kid like that because he got better better skills got better so he doesn't get fucking thrown to the wolves also today because of social media and he does video games video games online people still know who he is yeah he stays in the public eye puts up the social media training footage lets everybody know where it's at two years later comes back I got a world beater I'm coming on the food truck diary I love that kid yeah he's awesome and when he doesn't have the cornrows and his hair is preposterous yeah it's a tough guy but you know you like it event of that we're very very tough it wasn't like a like some bomb they tossed them what's crazy with him is you know he didn't know why I didn't know that until I had him on the podcast he didn't have a background like traditional karate or Taekwondo or anything did you see the way throws his kick she like really yep like nobody you didn't like do this from the time you were 14 or something like that no no no learn wouldn't fight together he's just one of those guys where you just put like that weird it factor yeah he puts it together they're wrestlers in jujitsu guys like that they just pick it up faster than everybody else yeah but he's neither of those he learned MMA he's a he's an interesting dude straight MMA fighter straight a really interesting cat just his he's got some weird quality about him that people pay attention to him and he's really good there's like both things happening at the same time you know like people like BJ Penn we were talking about earlier when he was in his prime there was a thing about BJ like when BJP at BJ's fighting yeah it wasn't just their skill level it was just something about him like people have a something about him this is John sean has a something about him oh this he just love this kid it's like when you see him throw his kicks like that spinning back kick or the round kick when I did a little bit of training with him we showed him a little bit of stuff Taekwondo stuff over there yeah we after you do the podcast we came and we talked about some stuff and him and his coach I forget his name really fucking cool guy Tim Tim Welch thank you really cool girls great yeah but when we started doing some stuff and throwing some kicks and things I was like do you have a background on this and he's like no well he just started learning week with MMA you look like yeah it looks like a karate guy he's also when he when he was in there so it's just last time it's all like you tell he's calm and yeah it's comfortable I'll fuck he imitates in in my opinion like a lot of the ways he throws some of his techniques is very wonderboy like which is why I thought that he not at the same caliber of wonder Boyd I'm gonna be wrong but let you know wonder what boys one of the best strikers I think I've ever seen inside the sport well if this doesn't slide he does a lot of slide things that you really don't learn normally unless you have a background in traditional martial arts like like Raymond Daniels probably does it better than anybody fighting MMA right now because he's got a background in traditional point garage and he was a point karate demon so Raymond Daniels well he'll slide in on you I Pro shouldn't say demon I think he's really religious demons fun so I am in Taekwondo ugz Raymond Daniels do crazy shit Farsi man a fuck demon I'd like to fuck did you ever seen his uh ko highlight reel he's one of the most ridiculous a guy who has a background talk window you would love his highlight reel it's ridiculous he even glory he does touch jumping sidekick spinning back kick in the air and not you've never seen now against the rings against I guess the ring ropes no I dude I love I love hard there's not a guy alive who's more flashy who's fighting MMA or kickboxing the Raymond Daniels no dialogue not a guy alive Sean Sean O'Malley's like car McGregor and Wonder Boy had like this weird baby yeah to me at that same flavor as Conor with the hand things that feed a little bit of wonder boy it's yeah well this listen to me no bullshit Raymond Daniels think about how good Michael venom pages another level another planet the planet credentials planet well they fought each other in point karate and yeah but it's Hayes's no but he went over but Michael venom page went over to glory and fought guys like Nicky hold skin and Joseph fault aleni he fought assassins and kickboxing coming out of like basically a whole lifetime of point karate and then he kind of got his Groudon my venom page no talking about raymond Daniels fuck you said venom page also fuck well venom page did he fought Raymond Daniels in point fighting look venom page one my favorite players so when he fights iTunes without what I'm saying is as far as their accomplishments in kickboxing like yeah Raymond Daniels is a world champion if I'm Bellator though I go all in on Michael venom page that's your nature that's your cash town well we give this the whole shit that's your cash you got to go in on Lima cos Lima K owed him but it's but he if you look at him he's absolutely the most exciting guy to watch cuz he does crazy shit and he does things he's exciting well he also takes people that are like really competent fighters and they make him he makes him look they have no business like we fought Dave Rickles yeah like what Sarge does to stop this star stop this it was that he did fight Dave Rickles right yeah that was that was the one he's a cyborg you broke his fucking that was all that was ridiculous and then the Paul de Leeuw fight which was that was incredible that was incredible but I know stuff shit all daily took him down I was like wow Paul de Leeuw decided to win the fight it's not Paul Daley thank you so man that dude they talk so much shit well dude I'm just thinking British fighters right now how about fucking Wilder fury threes happening I can't believe it event I can because that's box and that's where the money is at but if your wallet it's like do I don't wonder when I've one maybe two rounds under how many rounds have they fine twelve so you know I'm saying so that of the 20-plus rounds I've won two and we had we I get this fucking trilogy fight boxing so strange but it's crazy give us Joshua fury you fucks well who knows if they're gonna have any fights for months now let's stop and think about that look at this guillotine god damn it beautiful tap tap tap and look you know what he did there was beautiful says right here than that wakes up I don't like that I / - I made a call I thought the Kevin Lee second round TKO Joe Carroll ear in the fight so everyone is back at the mat and he ended up in guard he's holding spent any time in supers say it was a scramble and Kevin Lee ended up on top and as soon as he got BullGuard he started throwing elbows Kevin Lee covered up and then he threw an armbar in the armbar didn't work and he ended up in the omoplata he just went after him immediately with elbows and put an armbar I might turn into a mile out but he's safe the whole time even though none of that works if that's in your blood in this it's just like keep him busy boom armbar omoplata you can't you yeah you thought he was on the offensive the whole thing - he's only thirty guys that's crazy he's 40 in fight you remember he's 41 Efrain Escudero and choked him out remember it took his back standing remember that you gotta say that nobody knew who the fuck you was yes is at 40 here's some he has some amazing wins man I'm amazing who I don't know why his name slip in my CT but the the jiu-jitsu phenom that fought on the card with Jana and Whaley who was that he was on the undercard you know I'm talking about submit him right away but hurt his eye he's won the best dishes of all time come on he's fighting you'll see now he's undefeated come on Asha he's full of all Duff over here yeah what happened to him he won or lost he was submitted much he got his he hit swollen shut like you probably would the probably took him down triangle oh he's so good what how something in a scramble he got here that's it and he got it bro I said during the crunch took him up in the same lab they put cooked uphill Romero Pollock oh so jacked look at his eyes I was completely shut out of his head all submissions undefeated in the jiu-jitsu world he's hot he's the man so Jan abu-dhabi worn it and never stayed like your photos look at that guy was at Bellator I mean I'm sorry at that may yes I remember him come on dude I love that's a crazy so nice I love him the craziest one look at what listen natty legend up there yeah natty legend he's his bodied up against you're not buying it the natty part come on controversy days the plague I rolled upon acai in Brazil yeah maybe they put steroids it might be corneas may be eating that Brazilian beef well either way trains like a

I do yeah he's not changed at all no he's actually better since his divorce he's the best ever yeah I'm talked about it yes on point yeah he's just a unique human like there's no one like his kind of funny is different kind of funny like I don't know that kind of funny like he's uh he's likes to talk about riding horses you know I mean I can't you like if you said you know that comment Keating jokes around about riding a horse like what like what the fuck about riding a horse and you know that he talks to the animals like what Julia interruptus that the other night on at the storing us what you talk about animals he's a unique dude is the best there's no one like our friend Brian that's one thing that I'm hoping it's good it's gonna come out of all this nonsense of no crowds and everybody panic to touch anything or shake hands that will appreciate each other a little bit more yeah talk to your friends yeah that's what I wanna do if I came so bad today meant yes I haven't see anybody wow we got a little drunk though we're at least you'll have to touch nobody no more yeah people you want to touch you know I don't think we're in trouble but I think I think it's a wake-up call I just see I didn't know that 90,000 people sometimes died from the flu either I didn't know was that high when I saw that that number I was like why that's a rough year for the flu I was like wow with the krona they don't know too if when the weather heats up if if it's gonna go away they think it might be a different strain that's not where I don't know did not think that that makes any sense at all yeah they don't know who said this is what happened because the culture guides he said he usually coincides with it running through running through a community so it seems that the flu goes away but what happens is everybody that survives the flu develops an immunity to that flu and if it sticks around that's why like when those guys in the the pioneer days encountered Native Americans they gave them all these fucking horrendous disease but they had no immunity for it yeah but these pioneer people were carrying this shit around with them it didn't seem to be a problem with it at all soozee starting intermingling with the white man they started getting all kinds of crazy decisions you know it killed 90% of all the Native Americans at some point in time 90% of some tribes 99 0 that's crazy just from bugs yeah but but I can't like it like histories is so you can't trust the history well I know the numbers of Americans killed fuck I don't know I don't know all I know is 50 people have died of Corona so far that's not true America in America but dude Italy's shut down it got there first it got all these other countries first it's killing people it's only been here for sure one time you know an Obama called the state of emergency or like national state of emergency what the swine or SARS one of them too right I forgot it was after a thousand Allah died after well but Eddie do you understand that way more than the thousand people who died in China and in Italy more than a thousand people judgments right but it's just getting here that's why they acted the way they acted just supposed to hit peak form like it like two weeks right well they don't know yeah that's well that's why the state of Mirchi happened because they don't want it to get out yes the idea is to try to nip it in the bud and try to keep it from spreading can I can I ask Eddie this say it could mean that he had been going back and forth of text why would if it's if I'm a conspiracy guy why would they do this Eddie what what's the question you know I'm talking about now what's the question why would they do this like why would I think it would fake a disease or make such a big deal out of it for Trump I know I know trumpet hurt it hurts his so many theories some people think it helps him so many ways Hanley yeah some people think he's handling it well but there was a woman from I forget where she was from want to say anyway she was a press lady who asked a question like why his administration disbanded the pandemic office and he didn't know about it and so he turned to some other guy that was on stage with him it's like do you know about this like why did we did a lot of people in my administration's like I didn't I don't know what I didn't want to do things and he goes we saved a lot of people and stopping travel save thousands of lives and he told her was a nasty question nobody fucked up more than Joe Biden though when he got in that argument with that guy on the floor of that uh you know that argument that he got with a union worker was talking about the Second Amendment and it's it Biden has said that he they're gonna take away certain guns he said that this is recent no he said that in interviews before and this guy was confronting him on it and he called him a liar and no I know it wasn't good buddy anybody talking about like making our gun smaller and they're like spending time like oh we need smaller magazines you you guys got 15 we drop it down to nine all right any time you you anybody says anything like that I'm like I don't fucking trust you at all why are you worried about the size my magazine you fuckface I'm trying to protect my family who cares about 15-round oh we need smaller guns we need less ammo Mike anytime someone says anything like that I don't you already done with me dude if you're you're like trying to you're spending time on the size of my guns I know you're done I know you say okay I know what you're saying but hold on a second you're looking at logically you're looking at like that's his real feelings the problem is when something comes along politicians have to make a move they have to do something in response they have to have a response for a crisis and if they don't have some sort of response they don't have some sort of response in terms of take away some of the guns guns you have that response hold on man but it's it's it doesn't it's not logical I agree with you they're like saying you're gonna shut down the amount of rounds or you gonna like if you're trying to stop a mass shooting a more effective way be better mental health that'd be a way more effective way and then it's common sense yes common friends as a kid like you you okay some kid shoots up a fucking mall now I gotta give up my gun your guns are too big like how does that make sense I'm just trying to protect my family against any motherfuckers coming in and now you owe your gums to fucking big wiener like to me that's some I of course that's not when you're trying to you're worried about your the overall goal is to take the guns totally but I see what you're doing you're going piece by piece inch by inch that was a great one spear see that's what they would be doing but what they're doing is they're politicians and the left generally wants gun control and then will people want a piece to people and don't want to hear anything I understand what you're saying you're into gun control I don't want to hear anything else I think what's weird is no matter I don't out of all the people in America like you give me a choice of Bernie Sanders or fucking Biden like that these are the guys well not like it's Bernie Sanders anymore he's out he's basically out that's such a bummer you know what know what they're not talking about is they're not talking about what if I wouldn't be surprised if something like so-called experts on hey listen if we eliminated all the tax scams going on throughout the United States and all Congress we eliminated all that sharing really put our tax money to work and we had some tax fucking tax force making sure that the tax money isn't siphoned out and scammed on all these scams if we eliminate I wouldn't be surprised if if we have a straight flat tax of 15% would cover everything beautifully if it was just managed no one's talking about managing but am i raising taxes they're already stealing all our money and now you're gonna raise our taxes more then why don't we dig around who the fuck stealing all our money and then we worry about raising luminate dams eliminate the scams and then figure out get I bet if we fucking clean out the scams I bet were let's wait to water scams what are their scams can tell what they are that shit that Biden was fuckin bragging about on video on the CFR that you could see on YouTube those are the scams that are going we're talking about them getting paid by foreign governments right dude they're scams they're scam all our tax money is being scammed so they're talking about we need more tax money to go to something at it like the tax money like some something has to pay for the fire department something has to pay to fix it sure there's this core some balance of all those things that's not what I'm talking is tremendous talking about there needs to be a fucking task force then monitors where this fucking money is going and as our people siphoning and scamming and they certainly could we that's what they need to be talking about they're talking about more tax with obvious that were being scammed left and right with our money our money's being scammed we that should be top priorities like who's stealing our money let's have a task force let's figure out where all this tax money's going and and how all these politicians are fucking riding these bills to siphon off money into their foul Asians let's look into that shit and then I bet I bet when it's all said and done and we clean that shit out I bet if everyone just throws in fifteen percent flat everybody's good it seems everyone that seems like something an economist is sit down with a mathematician and they'd have to work this ass for ten months and say no no I don't know exactly how much everything costs no no yes fucking do this evidence of scams talk about some scams bet on okay I'm sure there's a job our money they're scamming that should be our number one priority it's mismanagement as much as it is no no it's a bunch of tax money who cares there's people looking after it there's people looking after it okay we should find out who the fuck is monitoring all that shit it just seems like a billion dollars to that country aid they they kicked back five four hundred million into fucking foundations that's what's going on right yeah yeah I did we know with yeah right we're a scam like this should be a way that you could get it like an account of all the money or show and then that should be all counted and everyone should know that all the money's accounted for it's not just you can't be able to save moving to Texas in Florida look at all these politicians that are multimillionaires yes I do I do think about no where are you when I get them out to let you pay for what you get are you aware that there's politicians out there that are worth like 50 million isn't Nancy Pelosi worth like they all have a shitload to run that's the game how was that well maybe they got into business like Bloomberg before there but that's a game but if they made the mama Obama became rich after he left office that's what he can truly welcome well what's the CM song on what's the salary but that's a different that's what a tax you know when the hold on a lot of Hills being hot Eddie come on you gotta let other people talk it's not a tax scam that's a scam where he's getting paid to talk to bankers correct and all these different people and they paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars for all these fucking speeches if it's very scamming it's a difference it's very scary but it's not was the wrong scam I'm sorry but it's you were talking about taxes no no I'm sorry I was all on the tax thing but you're right different scam my bad I'm a realist am still a scale listen that's the Clinton Foundation the salary in the White House is 200 is it 400 L oh it's probably that but Trump doesn't take any of it he's like you can keep it he said this place he said this place is a long con yeah he'll take that long money long days okay that's enough we did it all we made it we got here even though the plague the government's gonna come get you hey Bravo take JJ calm T fat K calm might be capcity next week Austin OC may be right what's up in here I think it's locked down we'll see plan plan your weekends stay home bye I did not want to go
