five four three two one and we're live yes hello hello what's happening not much I'm excited to be here I'm excited to have you here your father speaks very highly of you that's good what is it like to have Jordan Peterson as a dad is it weird you have to check yourself constantly make sure you're on on steady ground and is anything ridiculous no not at all not at all I didn't realize it was weird until I went away to university and then kind of so like just what was away for a while and then when I came back to the house especially because the house was full of like paintings and masks and statues and like 32 different paint colors and they came back and was like oh maybe he's a bit eccentric no he's definitely eccentric we were talking off air about what it was like to watch your dad become famous and become famous and in his 50s right like yeah I hope 54 55 that's when he became famous before that relatively unknown respected professor one issue with this one transgender bill the the preferred pronouns bill and then BOOM off to the races yeah just strange it was yeah I was super weird especially how the media was portraying him and how what was actually happening at the events wasn't what was being portrayed in the media so that was weird to watch and then people recognizing him on the street is strange it's yes when you say what what happened in real life was not was what was being portrayed like what was different um mostly what he was saying so most of what he said is on film anyway so you can go to youtube and see what he's been saying like not there's not like some secret that's going around but what's been portrayed has been so much more negative than what he's actually said or they'll take like sound bytes and just weave a story that isn't quite true which I didn't read for some reason I know it looks silly but for some reason I just thought that what the media was portraying was honest always yeah yeah me too yeah you and it's not well they're writers you know in what's there's a real issue today that issue I've talked about this before but the issue is clicks yeah it's not just about what's the facts of the story it's about these publications are struggling to stay alive and one of the only ways that they can get people to click on stories a salacious headlines will make things really click baby and that's what they focus on and they focus on negative aspects that are going to get people riled up they have to have an angle and I've talked to people who are writers who will write something and then I'll talk to them and I'll say hey man this is not what we talked about or what happened and they said I'm gonna be honest with you I didn't even write that the head was completely written by the editor so the editor came in changed it all up change this switch that put some dot dot dots out of things you know like the so cut off sentences so that they seemed more you know just more controversial than they really are because they didn't allow the counterpoint of you know if sometimes you say something and then you say or it could be this well the or it could be this part is cut out you know they do things like that just to stay alive because I think when I mean really big publications whether it's a New York Times or with you know the Boston Globe like big publications are struggling for their life right now because people don't wanna buy newspapers anymore and you know and getting people to read things online is very difficult and you have to you have to do something salacious you have to do something that's enticing for them to click on it yeah I guess but I wouldn't you say that's just driving them down yeah yeah would yeah they're fucked it's it's a bad place to be yeah and I think it's you know it opens up the door for alternative media but some of those alternative media sources don't have journalistic integrity either so then it becomes a real issue you know that's that that's a problem with a lot of online news shows is like they take a very obvious editorial spin as well on the news and if you just read or watch their show you would go oh well it's this way because these guys are saying it's this way but it might not be that way there's no real objective sources very hard to find a good objective source I mean sometimes I count on the New York Times but there's been some things that I've read from the New York Times I didn't know or not I think they they had a terrible article about dad owned in like June or something yeah he didn't make it any easier on himself by using that forced monogamy our time now in forced monogamy argument or term because I don't even with when you understand it as a psychological concept that it is a culturally enforced idea I still don't think that applies to in cells I don't I just don't think you know I don't think it makes any difference at all and he and I discussed it on the podcast I'm like you're not just because you say it's a good idea and the culture agrees that it's a good idea for people to be monogamous I don't necessarily think that that is gonna help these guys at all I don't think we know what's gonna help those guys yeah well obviously they're all individuals in their situations very but what we're talking about people like what the fuck are they talking about there was a quote in the New York Times where this woman was asking him what to do about these in cells which are involuntary celibates and one of them had driven a car into a crowd of people and killed a bunch of people because he was frustrated because he couldn't find a mate mm-hmm and your dad suggested that in culturally enforced monogamy would be perhaps the solution for that and then a bunch of people went crazy saying that like women he's saying that women should sacrifice themselves and fuck these guys so they don't drive cars into crowds yes yeah it was the whole everybody made a mistake yeah yeah for those guys I really don't but no with that but that that was kind of articles are like the editorial articles and opinion articles it's really it's a different thing than reporting on the news right yeah I thought I thought so honesty was always a big thing in our house and was like don't lie because if you lie eventually the lie will surf we'll be so much bigger than the hell you get from telling the truth mm-hmm so I kind of just assumed that the media did that yeah the world just worked like that yeah no no I know that now yeah so you and your dad a bolt on this wacky diet mm-hmm you're both on this wacky carnivore diet and this is probably one of the most controversial things in relationship to in relation to food today when when people discuss diets you know there's a lot of people that are vegetarian or vegan or trying ketogenic diets or paleo but when you say carnivore that is one of the ones where people just universally seem to like step back roll their eyes most people don't think it's good idea they don't even know why they don't think it's a good idea and then you tell them about people like you or my friend Chris Bell who has similar autoimmune issues and he's had hip to hip replacements he's only 36 Wow and I think he had both of them done by the time he was 30 right pretty sure because he's had them for quite a few years you know massive joint pain all sorts of issue and you when did you got a hip replacement how old were you 17 and an ankle replacement 17 that's crazy it's a rough year that's crazy um what you so your whole life you've had arthritis issues or yeah um so I started walking kind of funny when I was two according to my mom and she brought me to the doctor and they said she's just having growing pains or something when I was seven I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and I had like 37 joints affected and then I was put on immune suppressants in grade four so I was actually the first kid in Canada to be put on this biologic called enbrel I was on an berlin methotrexate for ever like leading up to the hip and ankle replacement and they did help reduce some of the pain but I still ended up with no cartilage in my joint and had my hip an angle when I was 17 and this is just from the effects of arthritis and the inflammation swelling and just chewed the cartilage up so I wasn't even particularly swollen I didn't have a very like inflammatory visually inflammatory arthritis so my rheumatologist who'd been at SickKids for 20 years said that I had the worst arthritis she'd ever seen so it was very severe it wasn't particularly like swollen my joints just disintegrated Wow what do they think causes something like this they didn't know so it was eventually after the hip and ankle replacement the diagnosis was changed to juvenile idiopathic arthritis so it was literally like we don't know Wow and how did you go from these medications pharmaceutical medications to getting into this carnivore diet thing what was this this path Wow okay I'll give you a background of the path we were very like science oriented especially dad so even though mom kind of wanted to delve into diet and was like we should go sugar-free or stop eating you know whatever make sure you'd whole grains like all that stuff we never gave diet a chance because there was no scientific evidence for it so I basically got sicker and sicker and sicker and I ended up by the time I got to university I ended up with arthritis as severely depressed I was on antidepressants as well I had idiopathic hypersomnia so I was sleeping about 18 hours a day my whole body was itchy all the time that's started when I was about 14 and so that was when I started University and then my diet just got disastrous in university and I was like drinking all the time and eating like pizza and beer and I gained like 30 pounds in the first year and ginger ale a lot of ginger ale anyway I gained about 30 pounds in the first year my mental health declined even further and I didn't really know what was going on and then I started getting skin issues so I started getting rashes cystic acne and I was like okay I can deal with like four really awful health problems but I can't deal with things affecting my skin on top of that there's too many things so I went to dermatologists and they basically told me I was anxious and like causing these rashes by itching so that was the dermatologists opinion which was very unhelpful anyway I spent a lot of time I was eventually prescribed adderall for the hypersomnia so I spent all my time googling reading papers trying to get a background on skin disorders and eventually I came across this celiac disease rash online and that's what I had it looked exactly the same so I cut out gluten I read a whole bunch about like the effects of gluten on the gut and thought oh there's actually some evidence that gluten isn't good for people why aren't people being told this like why didn't my doctor test me for celiac disease because celiac disease couples with autoimmune disorders all the time like they test type 1 kids for celiac disease but for some reason they don't test kids with arthritis for celiac disease so I cut out gluten and that kind of helped maybe like 20% but it was hard to tell because it was the summer I was like maybe I'm just feeling better from the summer my rash kind of went down but it was still there and then so September 2015 my mom dragged me to a naturopath and they gave me this sheet of foods and like try this elimination diet and I looked at the sheet and thought this doesn't make any sense like why can I eat lemons and not oranges and why are almonds on there but other nuts are off so I cut so I thought okay if I'm gonna do an elimination diet which I didn't believe in at all I'll cut down to what I considered safe foods and I had no idea what I was doing so I just thought okay vegetables are pretty safe I'll get rid of nightshades cuz people talk about them being bad nine shades what is night shades night shades like tomatoes eggplant those kind of foods for some reason there I just knew that they were them referred to as night shades I feel like literally everybody has heard them referred to as night shades no have you heard him I've heard term but not I couldn't tell you what I wouldn't have been able to say where tomatoes and eggplants I don't think I don't know let the YouTube comments decide don't let them decide okay like calling demons for help anyway I cut down so I was eating mostly like green vegetables I was still eating rice at that point because I thought everybody eats rice rice is safe and meat but I cut out like dairy most grains soy sugar processed foods and then in the next month my joints got way better and my skin healed and my skin never healed like for a couple years I'd always have these flare-ups and never went away and that was just on a like relatively low carb diet just like just less I don't know I was still eating rice right but it was still mostly meat and vegetables and I thought okay maybe there's something to this and then I made almond flour gluten free sugar free dairy free almond flour banana muffins and I ate a bunch of those one night and I woke up and the next day my wrists were sore and I thought okay maybe that's weird and then I had a bunch more of the muffins because the muffins were good and and then I went away to a cottage that weekend and I couldn't walk cuz of my knees and I never had flare-ups that badly like I used to get my shoulder was always sore when I slept so I took tylenol three at night for sleeping and my wrists were stiff but I never had like a flare-up like I couldn't walk so that was that weekend so then I went back to the diet and got really strict with it and then things were better like my skin was better I I lost this was weird I lost five pounds which wasn't a lot but I went down to three pant sizes so it was all bloating that I didn't realize was bloating cuz it never fluctuated so that was the first month and then 2015 and then I started trying to reintroduce foods because I was having cravings and I missed going out to eat with my friends and everything so I tried to read the first thing I tries to introduce was sour patch candy because I was having really intense sugar don't look at me like that I was having really intense sugar cravings and I looked at the packet and I thought okay no one's allergic to put sugar there's no dairy there's no gluten there's no soy this will be fine and I really wanted to eat them and I had those and the next day my whole body was itchy again and it was like like mosquito bites everywhere so I thought okay maybe maybe that was a bad idea so I waited a couple weeks and I tried to reintroduce almond butter organic almond butter cuz I wanted something fast protein fast and then I had it's like abdominal cramping diarrhea then this itch came back Jesus Christ yeah so for the next year well I'll slow down we've got some time so that was that was the almond butter so then I waited awhile and I felt pretty good and this was November 2015 and then I started feeling really good and I went off of my antidepressants and I had been taking antidepressants since I was in grade five a really high dose of an SSRI which had been very helpful but did you wean yourself off and do it under a doctor's supervision no I didn't I weaned myself down so I went down to half and then I went to a quarter and then I went to an eighth and then I stopped taking how long two weeks it was nothing really over two weeks it was two weeks yeah I didn't have withdrawal symptoms like I think to me I was lucky that way and so you died at this point was so at that point I was eating rice occasionally but it was mostly like broccoli salad chicken beef fish you know olive oil apple cider vinegar salt pepper at that point I was also eating pears and apples so it was kind of like paleo kind of very restricted paleo dairy-free and so you're feeling good you're off your medication your joy feel better no more rashes no more rashes yeah so everything seems to be improving I was shocked when the depression lifted because I thought that runs in my family that's familial we have some sort of brain chemistry problem that can't possibly be diet I thought I thought the skin maybe that was diet because this gluten link and then maybe because of the celiac gene that I got tested for maybe the Arthritis was part of that but I never thought mood was associated with it so that was a surprise in November anyway I went off of the antidepressants and then I'm about a month later I tried to reintroduce soy and this is when things started getting really weird that year so I was having why you reintroducing things if you're having all these positive benefits I was having cravings like crazy and I we missed eating out and I thought there were probably like four or five foods I was really sensitive to and I if I could just figure out what they were I could eat pretty normally I didn't realize like I didn't know what was going on if I had known I would have done it much differently but I tried to reintroduce soy because at that point I still thought soy was a health food so I ate a huge meal of like edamame beans and bean sprouts and miso soup that I made myself so it was gluten free and soy sauce and tofu I literally ate soy in every forum and I had the same kind of reaction with almond butter I had immediately got bloated I had diarrhea like within maybe 20-30 minutes of eating it and I thought okay that sucks I guess I can't eat soy and then about four hours later my legs got itchy and then my whole body got itchy and I was like okay that sucks I'm clearly I'm reacting to soy and then the next morning the depression came back and it came back like that was the worst depressive experience I've ever had I was medication free and it came back in the morning and I got in the shower and I just like I bawled in the shower and thought how could I be so naive to think that my horrible autoimmune disorder and the depression and everything was caused by food like what an idiotic thing to think how could I be that hopeful and then I had to remind myself okay no you ate a whole bunch of this food then you had this like digestive distress then you got itchy and now the depression is back there's clearly a pattern here but it was hard to think like that when I got that depressed so that day was like I spent a lot of that day crying then the next day got worse and this is this is when it gets weird so that night I went over to my parents and I was just like I don't know what's going on right and they're like well you want to take a car back to your apartment I said I don't think I can drive like I can't I just can't think I don't know what's going on so just my brother drove me home and I was like on the verge of having a panic attack for no reason right it was just like my heart rate was increasing I was trying to find my keys and I turned around to look at my brother in the car and his head was a like a kind of a demon this I know how this sounds but he had like a demon head for about a second and a half and he looked at me and then he turned and then it was my brother again so I was standing up for like yeah about a second and a half of hallucinations um that year yes before that no that year yeah after this I'll get into it so you ate soy and started trippin yeah two days later I know how it sounds that's how it sounded to me too have you found comparable stories so so obviously I did as much research as I could possibly do to soy no to gluten to people who are schizophrenic from gluten yeah there are people with celiac disease who have schizophrenia induced by gluten so I found that but I didn't find anything for other foods but the seeds of schizophrenia include hallucinations I rarely visual but I did find a case study of a woman who was seeing demons from her celiac disease gluten know when you say you looked over and you saw your brother and his head was a demon head like describe it like no I found mmm no it was like you know when it's really dark in a room uh-huh and I don't know if this you've experienced this but it's really dark in the room and then you kind of kind of see things in the dark mm-hmm it was more like that it was dark at night and it was like I was so anxious so distraught you're a mess and maybe you just caused yourself - well something okay yeah I mean I saw it like I can remember what it looks like but it wasn't a vivid demon or something it was like but it was there okay so you're freaking out I'm so I'm freaking out so I'm like okay that's not good I find my keys and I go upstairs and then I went into my bedroom like shut the blinds turned on all the lights and then like smoked as much weed as I could possibly smoke to try and calm myself down and then hate under the blankets all night I would think that would be the worst thing to do you see a demon you'd think that but then if you spook I've had that comment before but enough and it calmed me down okay so then I spent the next couple of weeks basically stoned because I didn't know when it was gonna end I didn't know what was going on and I couldn't find anybody on the internet who had had the same experience as me and then about two and a half weeks later it started going away and so you say it you mean the depression depression dr threats it wasn't that just the depression that came that's just the worst no I didn't go back I mean I didn't eat soy again but I went back to the initial diet I was eating so essentially just this one meal this one great meal of soy threw you off for a couple weeks Radek yeah like almost for like three weeks but after two weeks it started getting better okay but the symptoms were like so this deplorable the itching started I had bloating and then the depression came back and then about a week later my skin started breaking out and then maybe 10 days later and my arthritis came back so I wrote all my symptoms down every day because I was going crazy and I didn't know what was going on and I wanted to write it down to see what was going on okay so then it started lifting and I started feeling better again and I was like okay thank god that's over and then waited a while things were good again my symptoms went away and then over the next year I tried to reintroduce foods over and over and over again and I was making like I tried whey protein powder and that did nothing ever got to as bad as that so experience but I had a number of other experiences where it was the worst depression I've ever experienced and it was on the verge of seeing like I don't know seeing faces in things okay so you're having all these health issues how do you get to the carnivore diet so I decide about a year later I decide hey maybe I don't want to keep cycling in and out of a horrible autoimmune mental problems maybe I'll just stick with the original diet mm-hmm and then I got pregnant and so then my autoimmune symptoms flared again during the pregnancy yeah like right away as soon as I found out I was pregnant it was like before I found out I was pregnant that my autoimmune symptoms came back so I what my legs were it she again I was my joints were stiff my skin was breaking out my anxiety was back and it was hard to tell well what part of this is pregnancy and what part of this is an autoimmune disorder so throughout my pregnancy I cut down on all the carbs I was eating so I cut out fruit I cut out sweet potatoes I went down to meat and greens and I think dad was on here one time and he was on a meat and greens diet so I was during that part so we're both on a meat and greens diet mostly because we didn't realize you didn't need greens to survive so we were eating meat and greens and then I have to say mostly because we realized you didn't mean we didn't realize only he wasn't officers yeah yeah we hadn't realized that we didn't know that so it was meat and salad and it was a very simple salad with like olive oil apple cider vinegar salt pepper cucumbers lettuces spinach pretty simple salad and then meat and fish so we did that for about a year and then I had my daughter and then I didn't get better so then I found out okay so these symptoms aren't really pregnancy related it's just me now for some reason I've lost the tolerance to these foods I used to be able to eat and in your just eating salad and meat yeah and I'm still having autoimmune so now symptoms that you used to have not in your eating not not nearly as bad not nearly as bad like my fatigue wasn't back my anxiety was manageable without medication but you hadn't achieved the levels of I didn't know that you had and you were eliminating things from your diet earlier yeah exactly exactly like I reached a really good point and then I got pregnant and I couldn't reach that point again okay so then this is 2017 so it's like November and I'm getting really frustrated about being itchy I'm just randomly itchy again and we randomly or eating meat and meat and salad yeah and I thought okay maybe I just have an autoimmune disorder and I can't control it with diet anymore maybe this maybe I'm just stuck like this and so I googled like out of desperation I think I googled allergic to everything food wise something like that into Google and I found this story about Charlene Anderson who's been mentioned a couple times and she'd been diagnosed with Lyme disease and has been eating nothing but like red meat for eighteen years and there are pictures of her family online and I thought okay I know I'm not I think I googled allergic to everything except meat oh so I found her then I found that Shaun Baker episode you did and he'd been doing it for two years and I think that night I thought screw it I literally have nothing to lose here I'm only cutting out salad so that's when I switched over that was December and then I switched over and the itching got better pretty quickly like within the first couple of days but then my digestion just got totally screwed up so like bloating and diarrhea every time I ate and after about a week I thought okay this is a bad idea obviously diary every time you ate meat just me just me and salt roast yeah so I thought this is a bad idea obviously this isn't working my body doesn't like it so I reintroduced salad it was literally lettuce apple cider vinegar olive oil and salt and pepper that's what I reintroduce and I woke up the next day and the itch was back and my joints were stiff and I thought okay if I have to choose between itching and arthritis or diarrhea I'm gonna choose the diarrhea I was in a rough place mm-hmm yes so I stuck it out and at six weeks of just doing this mind I'd the bloating went away the diarrhea went away and everything started to improve so that was mid-january but I was still pretty skeptical because I thought I thought maybe the reason the carnivore diet worked for people was because they just accidentally cut out everything that wasn't working for them processed food sugar you know grains all that so I tried to reintroduce olives like organic olives in olive oil and that was February and then I had this itching came back with the depression my skin broke out and it was minor in comparison to like soy so you think essentially to give us the cliffnotes you're allergic to everything yeah it's like fucking crazy it's crazy but then here's the thing I started this blog so the blogs don't eat that mm-hmm and I started this blog because I thought if for some reason there's someone else out there like me and they're googling these things it'd be nice for them to know that they're not alone right and I've found other people like this who are equally as sensitive I'm sure I mean look if you exist is there's probably quite a few people that have that issue look yeah it makes sense that we all have different tolerances and we all have different allergies mm-hm some people are allergic to cats some people have no problem with peanuts some people eat a Brazil nut and they die yes just we yeah we know this so the idea this is one of the problems with diet is that people want to think that a diet that works for them works for everybody and it doesn't work that way and things and people want you to follow their diet no matter what it is whether it's vegan or paleo people are very ideological with that they would love you for you to do exactly what they're doing so to reinforce what they're doing is correct there's a lot of pushback against this carnivore diet idea but I don't I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that someone like you might actually really be allergic to everything yeah I mean I was like very sick and from coming from that place to now I can see how sick I was and it was like I was dying a bunch of medication did you ever do anything with probiotics yeah I can't tolerate probiotics can't tolerate them No so the original idea was heal my gut mm-hmm repopulate with bacteria that maybe I'm missing and then maybe incorporate more foods right so what happened we tried to that same autoimmune flare-up okay but this is the same autumn immune flare-up that you got when you ain't salad no not quite not quite as bad not it was different it was like with salad there's more of the arthritis mm-hmm and like body pain and then with probiotics would you get mood issues so like really volatile and itchy right so I still got the edge yeah so I think it was I probably had leaky gut mm-hm and so the probiotics was just going everywhere one of the things your dad brought up to me when he was here was emulsifiers yeah yeah and then I started reading up on it after he discussed it with me and it's something that I never even considered before but fast rising yeast and all these different emulsifiers that they put in bread and and various foods mm-hmm they're terrible for you oh my god yeah terrible for your stomach in there they're so prevalent they're everywhere yeah soy lecithin it's in everything it's and everything yeah and then I started really paying attention to it and I've read several articles on it and in a couple of studies it's it's crazy how this is something that's never even discussed and it has all sorts of negative effects on your gut and your gut lining it's awful yeah combining that and then it looks like grains aren't so good for people combining that and grains it's no wonder people are ill some people yeah some people most people though if you look like obesity or I wouldn't go most I would say some I'd say most people are sedentary that's one of them primary yeah but I don't think that's the issue what do you mean I mean okay say I mean I guess no I'm not a great example but I mean people start gaining weight if they're lucky when they're middle-aged if they're unlucky when they're around 25 and they start gaining weight I don't think it's from lack of exercise I think it's from diet and yeah I think dying has a lot to do with it yeah for sure um but it's also lack of exercise I don't know I'm not convinced because people who've gone on to this carnivore diet especially mm-hmm lose that weight right but there's a lot of people out there that are not overweight that don't follow the carnivore died so how do you explain that Wow I'd like to see anybody above the age of 51 on a standard standard American diet what does a standard American diet I mean terrible no I just mean standard American diet I mean do they not eat I mean if this is these blanket statements are a real issue and that's one of the reasons why your diet is fascinating it's guys like you know I don't think you can make blanket statements when it comes to people and diet you know that I think there's some people out there that are goddamn food dumpsters you could throw anything in there and they're fine my brother is pretty well he's not so good with like lactose but he's pretty stable compared to me anyway well you know Michael Phelps that Olympic swimmer yeah it's like 10,000 hours a day in several pizzas yeah I know I read about him fucking checked there's no problems at all he's not fat it said but that's an issue of enormous like expenditure of energy I mean he's yeah it's the only exercising in his body has ridiculous károly calorie requirements yeah lauric yeah I mean it's it's hard to say but I think sedentary lifestyle is a giant part of it but most of what people do is what we're doing right now most of what people do is sit down but is that because they don't feel like running around because some people like people who exercise generally you have to put in a little bit of effort to make yourself go X but a lot of people who are overweight and sick don't have enough energy to do that I don't know about that some of them maybe but I think some of them just don't have discipline there's an issue with that as well there's also an issue with momentum you're not used to doing it it's not a part of your life it's not something you're accustomed to pushing yourself there's been many many many many many many many days where I didn't want to work out I just didn't feel like I had the energy and I just forced myself and I think there's very few people out there that know how to force themselves that's a learn yeah that's a learned skill yeah that that kind of discipline and focus you have to have like real rigid requirements of yourself where you don't allow yourself to back out of things and you don't allow yourself to slack off and I don't think people put those kind of requirements on themselves as if it's it is a daily principle of life like what you must get done you know you must brush your teeth yeah yeah exercise for 45 minutes and if you did that I think you'd be healthier and happier and you your body would perform more smoothly and you if you require your body to do things like that I think it rises to the occasion there are very few people that have that kind of discipline so because of that they come up with excuses and excuses are a giant part of the problem it's not simply a physical health issue there's also mental aspects of it and disciplines a big one I just know way too many people who are weak mentally and I can't I can't just chalk it off to only you know their physical the way they physically feel because I felt like shit a hundred times and then I worked out and then I felt way better yeah just it's just a fact of life that's real you know you just can't and I people don't know how to do that it's not and if you're used to doing this getting your car sit down drive to the office sit down go to the lunch sit down you know go to the board meeting sit down get in your car on the way home sit down get home in front of the TV sit down and then go to the gym fuck off they don't have any energy you know their body's not the body's like I don't know II didn't mean to do this and I don't believe that I don't believe that I think it's it's a lot of it is the the mindset so I agree with that but because and I know I'm like I was a very sick individual a different case you have real legitimate diagnosed physical issues this is a very different thing you have a severe autoimmune disorder I mean listen you get your hip replacement een yeah that's crazy yeah you don't hear that this is a different I'm talking about the average fat fuck just sitting around being lazy that's really what it is it's like I'm sure a lot of it is diet and a lot of that diet affects their physical health but there's been many many people that have just put their foot down and said enough I'm gonna change my life and they don't takin excuses and they feel way way better diet is most certainly a part of that but there's also a discipline aspect and these things are not mutually exclusive they exist together they're all together there's an they work symbiotically the way you your your mindset affects the choices you make with your diet and the mindset also affects the choices you make in terms of like whether or not you require yourself to exercise and I think these are these are critical aspects that people like to gloss over or they like to make excuses about and they get very angry if you don't accept those excuses and that's a sign that they're trying to they're trying to enforce this standard and this idea and push it on you and give themselves an excuse since one of the reasons why they get angry it's one thing if someone has an illegitimate they have a sedentary lifestyle and they have the momentum of this sedentary lifestyle that's holding them back their custom to being lazy okay I kind of kind of agree I just from like my perspective I've seen my dad and he was very like you can see from the videos from 2014 before he started going low-carb and everything he was carrying about 50 extra pounds right and he didn't exercise and he didn't have enough energy to exercise but it didn't look like that that's not true he just didn't do it no I don't believe that when you say didn't have enough energy to exercise did he walk well yeah but you can't drag yourself through things then you can drag yourself through an exercise routine you can are you most you most certainly can you most certainly can you don't have to do a lot you just have to do something you walk up hills you jump a little rope you take a little tiny kettlebell you do a couple cleans and presses you do a few push-ups you do a few sit-ups you get your blood pumping you're moving you're alive you're exercising to say you don't have enough extra energy to exercise that's crazy can you walk to the refrigerator then you can exercise I'm not saying that you have to run marathons you can exercise and everyone should fucking exercise I agree everyone should exercise don't ever say these people are so crazy they say they want you to believe I don't have the energy to exercise god damn it everyone does if you're alive I believe that I've been there I know I'm a different case but I've seen my dad there and then here's the thing once he fixed up his diet once he went to this carnivore diet he's exercising now sure he's got less weight on his body he feels better and he has energy that's wonderful he could have exercised then too he would have felt shittier for sure when it felt as good as you feeling now but to give people this excuse I don't have the energy to exercise that is crazy to say can you walk to the fucking refrigerator yes well you can exercise you don't have to do anything crazy just walk around the block there's a there's 80 year old ladies who take yoga with me they're fucking really old and they're in there they're going after it they could easily say I don't have the energy to do that but they don't it's a mental attitude they make a decision I agree like there's a lot of edge discipline you're gonna get people who just get access to kill yourself you have to go to a CrossFit class and try to do the workout of the day you don't have to go nuts and do clean and presses with 150 pounds you'd have to do that but you have to do something just get get your blood moving your body has requirements it wants to move it really does and when it does you feel better but people like to give themselves this excuse I do not have the energy to do this whatever if you decide that that's true but if you watch a motivational video there's a hundred of them on YouTube thousands even you go watch one you'll get fired up you're like fucking I'm gonna jump some rope you jump some rope you do something just do some push-ups do something do some bodyweight squats you'll feel better but it's also like learning that learning that and having that as a part of your daily life it has to be you know again I'm not talking about someone like you who's in the throes of this autoimmune disorder where you're getting your hip replaced at 17 I'm not talking about someone with like serious degenerative illness I'm talking about just a regular person who's overweight you can do it there's a lady who's like 450 pounds it takes yoga with me she's enormous she's in there she's probably really embarrassing very hard to do yeah you know and she's in there we could anyone could do it we can do it and again I'm not saying do what Michael Phelps does I'm just saying just do something got to do something we have fucked-up lifestyles yeah the lifestyle people have or just the human body is not designed to sit down all day and it's certainly not designed to be stuck in traffic and be in an office and just be you know fluorescent lights sitting there in front of a fucking computer monitor watching your soul gets sucked through the the the LCD screen it's crazy yeah yeah I agree I think we got to be really careful with just the way we describe things just like say I don't have the energy to do something let's fuck off stop I don't know I believe it still that was good but I'm still not convinced you still know I think well I think you change your diet so and then you can exercise you can exercise without changing your diet there's a lot of people do they do yeah but I'm not as partly that's discipline yes but partly that's being able to I'm still I I don't know you haven't so what do you think is holding them back um well I think if you're carrying around extra weight like a quite a bit of extra weight and you say I don't have enough energy there's something serious going on that isn't just oh I have a few extra pounds dude and I don't think we know exactly what that looks like but a lot of that has to do with energy I mean dad was sleeping he was sleeping for two hours a day in the middle of the day and he was impossible to wake up he couldn't wake up I'd to like shake him and right couldn't wake my dad told me he was on a standard diet of likes sandwiches and pasta things on those ones yeah I'd have that big insulin dump yeah yeah but I mean most people who don't have enough energy are and a lot of those people don't realize like we were eating whole grains we didn't know that whole grains were just grains we thought that whole grains were healthy so I was having sandwiches for lunch because I was having cheese and bread and that was protein right but your dad has autoimmune disorders as well yeah any significant right and the depression was significant that was the main one that was very significant yeah I think you know it's hard to do it's hard to also figure out like what is depression depression to a person who doesn't have depression like myself I hear that and I go okay what does that mean yeah I mean you feel bad what does it mean does it mean there's like a thick wet blanket over your life that you can't get out of yeah it means like there's a couple of things the closest it's a it's impossible to think of when you're not depressed but the closest I've get to is if you're in a really really stressful situation and a whole bunch of things go wrong at the same time that's stress you feel is kind of like a really really mild version of being depressed but being depressed is like if you look at something the colors seem muted you don't get joy out of any like this color the sky Red's like just colors everything's in greyscale kind of feels like you're walking through molasses and then you have a whole bunch of anxieties pop up all the time that are like worst-case scenarios of everything in your entire life that won't happen but that's all you can think of all the time that seems partly anxiety but it's hell like I having arthritis I would choose our thright us a million times over than this depression will just wrecks you so what leads you to the carnivore died this lady has been living on it for 18 years you read about her mm-hmm and that she's still alive without eating and her Lyme disease gone and she looks great there's a before and after picture she's taking vitamins as well nothing nothing beef and salt right so this is what you hear so this anecdotal story is what leads you to give that a try why yeah 20:17 so december almost yeah so not quite a year so I switched over and then I had these transition transition symptoms yeah that was basically it she's craving it's bold to hang in there with six weeks diarrhea yeah but the alternative was like anxiety and itching and arthritis well you were also probably at the end of your rope right where you're like yeah I can't even eat miso soup there's nothing I don't care about salad I've already given up everything I love just take it away and then after six weeks he got better and then I reintroduce all of his not went badly and I thought okay I'm done with the reintroductions I'm just sticking with meat your dad said he's gonna try to reintroduce mushrooms yeah we'll see how that goes he seems to be weirdly sensitive too like in the same category as me but instead of getting arthritis and all these other things as well he just gets the depression which is the worst one well he said he he introduced something to his diet and he didn't sleep for like 24 days yeah so it's not even possible Wow dead know it that's what it felt like I had the same we I had the same thing we ate the same thing I think it was sulfites in apple cider in a stew I made mm-hmm I don't know what it was I think that's what it was and yeah and then it was the itching came back and the doom came in this depression came in and then that's that's weird and it hasn't happened very many times but I got stuck with insomnia and it felt like we weren't sleep so you slept like a little bit and you wake up probably yeah it does not what it felt like but I'm sure you know it's not physically possible to stay awake for that long but I didn't feel like sleeping what's the world record that someone's ever stayed awake I think it's only like ten days yeah I think it's eleven ten or eleven yeah something along those lines God why would he do that was it just a test version eleven days in 25 minutes what that's what he submitted that dude went down a hard Wow that's crazy so obviously God must unless you dad stomp the shit out of that world record no I'm sure he was sleeping but it was like it was it didn't feel like that and it wasn't very much it's just crazy that one thing what what do you remember what it was that he reintroduced to his diet that that was might have been it wasn't a reintroduction it was we were just still eating apples at that point and it was a cider and it had sulfites at it and I looked at it and thought whatever it's like parts-per-million sulfites it'll be fine and then that was the only thing that was new so do you think that as you get on to this elimination diet and you start taking things out yeah you get more sensitive it's like one of the things that had that I noticed in a big way is when I cut sugar out of my diet if I have sugar now like if I go crazy and have an ice cream sundae I hit a fucking wall so hard where I can't even get up yeah I had to sit down the cast my oh it takes like an hour or two for it to get out of my system so for like an hour I'm like oh god I feel like shit and then two hours later oh my god it's done it's passed that's it it's two hours yeah about two hours it's like 24 days for me yeah I believe you I believe you but for me it's just for two hours I mean and again it's not I'm not depressed for two hours I just feel like I have a brick in my stomach yeah and I feel like I'm on a tranquilizer yeah yeah yeah so most of the that's how I lived a whole bunch of my life the tranquilizer like the it's idiopathic hypersomnia it was like I was falling asleep during exams I drove home on the highway one time when I was 22 and I was falling asleep at the wheel and I was like oh my god like I can't stay awake passing out and I like moved over into a lane and a truck came by and honked at me and I was like oh my god I'm gonna die and then I went on adderall well I was like I need to stay awake or I'm gonna die it was oh yeah yeah I'm off of everything and the outter also I stopped taking the immune suppressants when I cut out gluten just to see how my arthritic flare-ups would go if anything would happen then I was then I got off of the since November 2015 and then my fatigue lifted in January 2016 so I got off the adder all right away then mmm I was taking a lot and it was great when I was in that like feeling like I was on tranquilizers it was great but once you don't need it it's kind of awful being on that amount of amphetamine all the time I know so many people are on that show it's so disturbing to me how many people are taking that and they talk about their productivity and they're always it makes you feel like you're being productive I don't know if it actually makes you more productive and it just destroys your short-term memory does it destroyed mine I was taking a lot dogs on 40 milligrams a day in the morning the long release it's one of those things I've always thought about trying I'm like mmm if you have energy if you have energy I don't think it gives you the kick like if you're exhausted all the time it's just kind of unpleasant and it makes you like weirdly antisocial mm-hmm okay so you haven't been on this diet for a year now what has the change once you got over the diarrhea what has the change been like so dear arthritis and like the autoimmune stuff went away fairly quickly when I was still having diarrhea I went away the mood started to pick up six weeks into the diet and then in May so I'd been December Jennifer March April May so five months into it I had a huge improvement so things just got better and better every day and I finally got to the point where I was pre pregnancy so since May is I would say it's still getting better so it's only been three months that you've been okay no I've been okay since January but my mood went from like a eight to like a nine and a half like great in May so I was feeling good after I started after this first six weeks but then things got a lot better in May it seems to be just improving now what kind of blood work are you getting while you're doing all this are you going and getting tested for nutritional deficiency because one of the issues that many people who are nutritionists or who are studying biology have with this carnivore diet is that meat just meat is very deficient in many many nutrients it's just it's very deficient in vitamin C it's deficient several things that we think that you need in order to live yeah well I did get blood work done because people were asking and not because I particularly trust blood work because my blood work was always pretty normal I was always low in zinc and vitamin D since I was a kid even when you had severe arthritis yeah everything was normal I had no blood markers and I was like dying what Jesus what about for inflammation my white blood cell count was high because that can be a sign of like infection right so that was high my vitamin D in my zinc were low right but that's not so much showed up but that wouldn't be normal right if you went and got your blood tested and they showed you have a high white blood cell count they would go there's an issue here yeah it wasn't abnormal enough to have caused the problems I was experiencing how different was it from the norm white blood cell count um well I had white blood raised white blood cell count and I had white blood cells in my year and when that's that's a little weird because that is generally like well some sort of bacterial infection which I didn't have symptoms of mm-hmm so that was a little weird but that was never focused on from the doctors why not well that seems like that's that's an issue if normal people don't have that and you have problems that normal people don't have I would say like your blood work is not late I mean your blood work is not normal that's not normal no but I mean I was on all the medications they could put me on so there wasn't and they never looked at diet so I was kind of at a standstill right but when you said do you don't trust blood work and then why did get it done right mostly for the blog so everybody could see I wasn't dying um I can pull it up okay that was one of the issues with Shaun Baker Shaun got his blood work done and one of the things that people notice is that there's quite a few issues there and one of them was very very low testosterone which is crazy because he's a gorilla he's a big he's huge six foot five 250 pound dude so it's like well he doesn't look deficient in testosterone like what the hell's going on here yeah I don't have testosterone readings he also said that part of that might you know he and I have gone back and forth about this he said part of that might have been had to do with taking the test when he had done like a very heavy weight lifting workout the day before he'd done squats and deadlifts and all kinds of stuff and so maybe broke his body down a bit yeah it kind of makes sense it would be nice first like a medical professional to take some of these groups of people doing this diet and just do a study mm-hmm so we could actually get some information yeah instead of like everything's anecdotal and I put my stuff up but just because so I can show it to you but everything is normal everything is normal my ferritin is slightly slightly elevated but like he was ferritin iron okay so that's slightly elevated because lightly red meat but that's not bad not necessarily and it was still like my doctor said he didn't care it wasn't elevated enough but like what about vitamins so for vitamins vitamins my zinc is still low my vitamin D is still low that hasn't recovered it's been like that and it's been like forever well it's hard in Canada like I have some pictures on Instagram and I'm green because there's no light for like six months and then I'm outside all summer so I'm probably deficient mmm I think that has something to do with the autoimmune disorder I tried supplementing with really high dose vitamin D and didn't see any benefits socially and I don't take supplements anymore the high dose vitamin D yeah I tried once when I was 21 for about a year and then again when I was doing the low carb diet but what about now when your issues with vitamin D or and your blood just got my blood work back okay so I was doing no no supplements so that I could see what happened also I probably wouldn't recommend high dose of vitamin D I just recommend supplementing with a normal dose of vitamin D I think I'm just going to wait and see and get tested in the year I'm not too concerned and see what happens because here's here's what's interesting when I went to the low carb diet my B vitamins were low so this was during the pregnancy I got this first test and it was my b12 was fine but everything else was low folate was low b1 b3 b6 and biotin we're all low on the low carb diet right and my naturopath said maybe you have a microbiome problem whatever that means whenever someone says my naturopath said I need a crystal when I grab it yeah keep a crystal with you at all times oh you know what they were there telling me to cut out gluten for years and I was like what do you know right crazy person yeah I could have probably stopped stop some picture on your wall put a dreamcatcher above your bed hmm anyway this new micronutrients test vitamin D and cat not calcium vitamin D and zinc are still low but all my B's have gone up so none of my B's folate is still borderline but it was deficient before and all my other B's are have gone up what's normal what about vitamin C vitamin C was always normal vitamin C hasn't changed at all that's fascinating because that's one of the ones I think people are deficient if you are on this diet wow I did some background reading because I've been I thought people died of scurvy if they didn't need vegetables just like everybody thinks that right but it turns out vitamin C and glucose compete well so if you don't need glucose you just don't use as much vitamin C mm-hmm yeah and I haven't been supplementing but my vitamin C is totally fine yeah Shawn Baker sent me something about that something along those lines that some of the vitamin C that you're taking in is competing with glucose and that you need far less of it and it's far more effective mm-hmm so there is some vitamin C and beef yeah are you trying to eat grass-fed beef or you do care eally I tried to get rid of all the variables because I didn't know what I was reacting to so I was eating grass-fed antibiotic-free all that stuff and now I'm eating mostly I try to stay away from the antibiotic and hormone meat but I'm eating grain finished because it's just so much cheaper than grass-fed and it doesn't I have no problems with it how would you know whether or not beef as antibiotics or hormones in it you just trust the labeling right that's it but I but I've gone out to eat in restaurants where I'm sure the meats lower quality and I haven't had an autoimmune flare-up with that mm-hmm so when you go out to eat you know one of things you posted the other day was that you had a steak that had pepper on it yeah I had pepper on Monday pepper like ground pepper and you freaking out I was freaking out on Monday yeah I don't know what happens it's okay I'm fine but yeah I was freaking out I was stressed out for the whole day but it's like if it flares first of all these flare-ups don't happen instantly so it gives you enough time to freak out about if they're going to happen for a couple of days right and then it's like a month of an autoimmune disorder and depression and brain fog and not being able to think and is horrible so yeah I don't freaked out but I'm okay the one thing I found really helps the only thing I found that helps these reactions is an infrared sauna if I get in there like once a day and sweat only an infrared one what about a regular one do you know honestly no I don't know you don't know so the idea just to elevated heat temperature whether it's infrared or not yeah I don't know if it's I've just read all the benefits of infrared mmm but I have benefits over a regular sauna wow there's like longevity studies from Finland those are done on a regular sauna that's a regular sauna yeah the ones that are done would that show the decrease in mortality of 40 percent it's a regular size regular sauna yeah why don't you uh google that please there's a state may be Rhonda Patrick has it up on our website but because I asked her whether I should get a regular sauna or a infrared and she said the studies that were done were done with a regular sauna but she said the real issue is that your body is producing heat shock proteins so whether it's infrared or regular the whole the real issue is your body's in this extreme 107 degree temperature produces these cytokines and these cytokine cytokines and your body is reacting to this incredible temperature and this is what produces anti-inflammation effect I would think for someone like you with arthritis in particular anything that reduces inflammation would be a great benefit so yeah I know it's sorry be awesome I just if I'm reacting like sana makes me feel like 20% better like a lot better laughter I get out now if I'm not reacting I don't sweat as much when I get in and it's nice but it's not like a huge relief like it is when I'm reacting it's giant for me I mean I don't have the autoimmune issues that you have but boy for me it's just it's a game changer yeah get in there for 20 minutes half hour and I get out of there it's just like everything just feels better yeah yeah and it hits me like about 20 minutes after I get out and I get this mood up it's just like ah once your body I think that what that is is your temperature normalizes and your body temperature normalizes after you're out of that heat and then everything's just like oh yeah I know it's great no it's great have you done cryotherapy yeah similar feeling right yeah not as good I don't think no but similar feeling it's better actually for paint so I have my ankle replacement still gives me problems because it's an ankle replacement so I've done cryotherapy for that and that's works better for pain I think than the sauna does no what do they do when they replace her ankle do they cut off the bottom of the joint and recap it and put something else there so they cut off yeah they caught off the bottom of the tibia that's a big bone tibia and then they replaced the top of the talus it sucks and I got it done in 2009 when the ankle joints weren't as good as they are now so now I'm left with this like old ankle joint and I'm 26 so I have to get it looked at because it's giving me problems another one oh god no I hope not I think they're just gonna try and fix it did some super dope carbon fiber new model I know they don't have that nobody's like making anything cool no no it seems like them they're constantly proving that I mean what it looks like on YouTube but that's not really what it looks like in real life no no I was like maybe I could just get a new foot I could get a better foot right you want a new foot do a new foot Wow I'm some robot foot maybe I'll salon like what the fuck is this depends on the robot foot you'd be down for a robot foot if it like took away all your pain oh my god yeah if I could run again I can't run with an ankle replacement what about you hip replacement you can yeah but they I have friends that have got a hip replacement they said running is out of the question it's out of the idea excuse no way you can't run I could run on the hip replacement really I can limp along with my ankle but the hip replacement gives me no problems it's great but I thought that the load that is placed on the hip is not I don't think they recommend activities like that all the time all the time but even like a what's an elliptical mm-hmm that's pretty low impact and I can't do that because of my ankle but my hip is fine have you ever tried to versus a climber no we have no was it sort of an angled like a beam with handles on it phenomenal cardio it's amazing works your core because you're at an angle so you got your kind of planking almost a little bit while you're doing it oh wow yeah I'm a tourist matter yeah I do do sprints with it and then do like Tabata is like 2010's Wow 20 seconds on ten second break 20 seconds on 10 second break phenomenal yeah it's one of the best exercises in terms of cardio huh I stopped so can you do a bike I can't really do anything with this ankle but I did start yeah it's a huge pain I'm gonna need to get surgery I think I'm getting something done in January and what are they gonna do so basically bone has grown into the joint so it's basically fused so I just don't have any movement and it kind of hurts and it doesn't hurt like it hurt when I needed it replaced but it hurts so they're gonna go in and clean out all the bone and pray that that works Jesus that's what my January is gonna be does this make you think that like if you got on this diet yeah when you were younger why I'm not very pleased with the medical community well how did they know me they didn't know back but they could have said I don't know they could have looked at the celiac thing and I would have at least been clued in that gluten was a problem and maybe just removing that would have been good enough well it seems that the amount of research that they would have to do I mean think about how many different things you had a look at to come to that conclusion the time you got to spend like three years and yeah and Canada has public I mean you have public health care right so it's it's it's weird right yeah they're not as motivated they're not it's not ideal for people with very special problems right for general public and it's great if you don't have money and you need to get taken care of but they have a lot of people coming in and out right it's constant I'm getting the surgery done in North Carolina Wow just fucking turn your back on Canada huh I could wait around for like three and a half years for a surgeon that's not as good yeah yeah that um this infrared thing I'm finding it very interesting stuff so I remember reading what you said but I'm not finding that and I've only found stuff that I have found a Ben Greenfield I think it was a transcription of a podcast he did with Rhonda mm-hmm and something else very similar there's information from dr. Joel Khan mm-hmm that says only sunlight sunlight and far infrared saunas have been shown to increase core temperature for effective detoxification because they get you can stay longer in the threshold area they won't have around 130 degrees you can be there to up to 45 minutes or so hmm and you I guess you can't unless you can withstand it and a railer heat one because it's heating the air around you're not light heating your body Oh interesting yeah so the infrared one is heating your body and specific rather than you being in the heat correct ah interesting so you can do it longer and that's where the benefits but how much longer how long you supposed to do it for I'd said at least 30 minutes but that's what I do anyway I don't know the difference so infrared saunas good if you're a pussy so that's where I didn't want to say that well if it seems like you get more benefit with less suffering that's what it would seem like because you could do it longer I think that's what they're getting at but yeah I don't know if that's the reason why like I don't know if people have to just quit after twenty minutes and I can't get to the thirty well people do man the kid does get uncomfortable with it but if you could have if you get the same benefits and you could avoid the discomfort why wouldn't you do that right mm-hmm it also just it's just uncomfortable right before you start sweating when you're like oh I'm really hot and then you start sweating and you're it's not as bad there's a new company that's making an infrared sauna that you workout in it's got a chin-up bar in and it's got all these like like resistance cables the other part of this too which is I'd have to go more into Sciences that I don't know is that the LEDs like the infrared light can penetrate your skin whereas the heat maybe can't because it's just heat that's heating up your skin it's not look like infrared is literally a wave it's a light wave it's a different kind of it invigorates your mitochondria works and that level of studies that they did in was it in Norway Finland Finland yeah maybe they just didn't have infrared there maybe maybe I don't know because like those Russian banya 's they do the regular saunas these regular saunas and they go hot-cold hot-cold and they've had some pretty awesome benefits of that so there might be something to that because they're using like dentist season light now to harden fillings so alright and that's pretty new yeah science Suzy blinded me with science fascinating stuff it is all very fascinating stuff but so sauna definitely helps you either way yeah yeah and I think like I've read some studies on it working at a mitochondrial level I don't know anything about it I'm just there's something to it and it after about half an hour it's the only thing that's helped I've tried like I tried everything to get rid of these reactions faster like detoxification things or mostly just different weird different sort of detoxification things and nothing's helped except the sauna mmm they still last for as long but they're not as awful so I was telling you that this guy Kevin bass who's a PhD and a scientist and he contacted me and I contacted him put on my glasses so I can see you better and he we went back and forth about this online and so he sent me a bunch of stuff what he thinks and one of them is nutrient deficiency and that immunosuppression from a nutrient deficiency and that in the idea is that maybe in having less nutrients and having less the the you you your dietary immunosuppression via deficiency might be helping you oh and he said basically crazier things have happened and that you reported still having symptoms when you get sick even on a carnivore diet and he said this shows that the carnivore diet is a symptomatic treatment it's not because she's removed the offending antigen what yeah I don't even know if I understood all that properly hmm well this is a very long he wrote a very very long piece on this and I appreciate that he took the time to do this one of the things they saying is like vitamin A that this this that this diet could be vitamin A deficient vitamin C deficient over their efficient vitamin K deficient so you got your results back so you got tested in my vitamin case everything's good it's normal vitamin A is normal normal like above it says anything above 30 is OK for vitamin k2 mine's 40 everything about 70 is OK for vitamin A mine 79 hmm he said also that a lot of your symptoms including joint destruction fatigue depression etc can be caused by the drugs that are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis although our rheumatoid arthritis came first though mm-hmm right but then the joint destruction was that and how do you test was that post you being on those medication studies even done how do you you know if it's the drugs or the arthritis causing it I don't know I mean this is his take on this is the potential scenarios I mean without rejecting and totally you were on those drugs far far earlier then your joints destroyed right yeah I started the drugs grade 4 and then grade 11 mmm were the replacements yeah this is a this whole thing is a very fascinating subject because people are not having the response that nutritionists would like them to have no right nutritionists would like you guys to be freaking out and falling apart and everybody seems to be doing well I have a friend of mine lives in San Diego who's been on the carnivore diet for a while and he's a Navy SEAL he said he feels fucking fantastic you said you know he said he just tried it out see what it was like he's never felt better in his whole life yeah elimination diets this is this is a big thing like getting getting yourself down to a very small number of foods you know and that this seems to have some sort of a large benefit for people as well yeah I mean I think it would depend on the foods yeah it's like your body not having too much to manage and that people with autoimmune disorders and diseases having less to manage could potentially be what what is benefiting you as well I don't think it's less though because if you survived only off of soy you're not gonna do well I think it depends what you're eating one of the things that he's saying too is that when you get sick the systemic inflammation probably opens up your intestinal barrier which causes autoimmune systems to kick in again and so the same thing happens with any food that causes your intestinal barrier to open up and he said why is this happening I don't understand and that you and your father both think this could be some sort of hereditary thing have you guys done any 23andme testing yeah and what is that I haven't genotype for different gene disorders perhaps yeah and nothing showed up I ran it I ran it through Rhonda Patrick has something on her website right I ran it through that I ran it through prometheus nothing shocking shows up I have the celiac gene dad doesn't so that's not exactly the issue that was it Wow the whole thing is just it's it's one of the more interesting things is how people they always want to attach all these other things to it that environmental concerns and the concern for you know the health and welfare of these animals and that you're supporting factory farming and always it gets very very ideological oh yeah super fast real quick right but it's not what we're talking about no I also I don't like I'm concerned about other people who are suffering as much as I was suffering yeah that's it right before you're concerned with animals like way before like dry living if your choice is to live with an autoimmune disorder and like die slowly that way you can do that and not eat meat if you want to well this all it's also I think a disingenuous argument because ninety-seven percent of the people in the world eat meat or some so it's easy to tell other people that when you're not experiencing those symptoms it's also yeah I mean definitely it's definitely easier if you're not experiencing those symptoms but there's so much meat eating going on already mm-hmm and if if people really can benefit greatly from just an all meat diet you know what you gonna tell them don't do that go vegan and keep thinkin and be covered in hives and itching and and being depressed states the rest of your life yeah it's just such a hot subject and I feel like this is something that we're gonna have more insight on over the next few years oh yeah we're starting to study it now and it's starting to be I mean you know Shaun Baker who's you know is a physician and then you've got some really dedicated athletes that are trying it now like you know Zac bitter mmm-hmm what does he own on the north American record for 24-hour race or if not for 24 hours for 100 miles he ran a hundred miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes Wow fucking insane and he eats almost nothing but me yes almost his entire diet he supplements with high levels of glucose like those gels and shit like that and ramps his carbs way up when he's going to do 100-mile races and things like that but that's that's obviously a ridiculous requirement on his body he's yeah he's asking his body to run a hundred fucking miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes Wow Wow yeah that's crazy he also weighs 5 pounds he weighs like 140 but it's just you know his his his diet shows that it is possible to do extreme physical feats while while you're on this yeah he does a podcast also with Shaun Baker so this is something that people are really starting to study now and and there's an argument there's a lot of hesitancy anger I've read some article today criticising you and your dad and now yeah that's okay I find it kind of like I can understand a lot of people who go on the carnivore diet get really like vegan Haiti well that's what I was doing they were saying well that's true but what they were doing is they're going off about the environment this is like like methane gas produced by cows don't think I saw this article it's just it's not it's not a good argument because this is this is happening like if you're a person okay I'm not saying that we don't all have a responsibility to do our part I try to save the environment but if you're a person who's deathly ill you go to the supermarket there's a lot of fucking beef you can go buy beef it's right there and if you could buy that beef and it fixes you what why don't you stop and think about the ecological concerns the environmental concerns and then the physical concerns of people that are forced to take on these fucking ridiculous pharmaceutical medications and goes into their lives and think about you're also empowering these pharmaceutical companies and they're lobbying to stop natural natural cures there they're trying to make kratom illegal there's there's a lot of fuckery that's involved in pharmaceutical companies that were well aware of a lot of cherry picking studies yeah they'll do a hundred studies one of them shows that there might be some benefit to this 99 shows it fucks you up and they ignore those and they're allowed to do this there's a lot of weird shit that we really should take into consideration before we support any sort of pharmaceutical alternative and pharmaceutical drugs aren't demons there's a lot of people that benefit greatly from pharmaceutical drugs I did I don't think I would have been able to figure this out unless I'd been on adderall and had the energy to Google I'm sure I mean look there's these benefits it's not they're all not all bad they're not all good but I don't like that argument like hey you know if you go on the carnivore diet you're you're contributing to methane that's fucking up the world like okay is it better or worse than pharmaceutical drugs is it better or worse than what they're doing is it better or worse than the fact that look pharmaceutical drugs are in the water supply then you know they've they've done tests on reservoirs and found pharmaceutical drugs in them they found pharmaceutical drugs and rivers yeah shut the fuck up there's a lot going on here don't don't if you're gonna look at this you better look at it you know if you want to make an argument against it you better be balanced about this cuz otherwise you're showing your ideological Bend like to say that it's about methane and about cows and factory farming not really no there's a lot going on there's a lot going on yeah it's this is a this is a long and nuanced discussion and if you're you're painting this this article in one way and talking only about the negative health and negative environmental concerns that are associated with beef production like look that beef production is going on no matter with you like it or not yeah if you think we can curb it back and slow it down a little bit that would be wonderful but we have to look at it accurately you know and also I believe they've proven that methane sea Google if this is true that methane production from cows and so only makes sense is far less when they're on a natural diet when they're pasture-raised then it if they're corn-fed but it makes sense because all they have all sorts of ourn yeah when they're eating grain you know that that could easily be a part of the problems they're trying to fatten these cows up quicker and they're force them to eat something that's not natural for their body and have you ever seen that king corn documentary no yeah it's a mindfuck of corns and everything everything and then that your DNA like your whole body's like filled with corn it's crazy they they've done they did these guys did tests on the carbon in their body and they found corn in their body yeah I think was the carbon in their body whatever it was they just and they go through the supermarket aisle and they find how many things have corn in them yeah and the corn is subsidized by the government yeah soy soy and everything yeah did the articles MIT but again this is the this is also part of the problem these people who are writing these articles about your diet and about your dad and and his this is just taking a shot at dad that's the other problem yeah certainly a lot of that but no the articles aren't great I mean it would be nice if someone instead of saying maybe she didn't have arthritis or maybe she's just pussy being herself into this or maybe it's deprivation that's making her feel better like it'd be nice if someone actually did a study what does it say Jamie it says cows are being fed a new diet they can reduce the amount of burping and cut a mission methane by 20% it's from a 2008 article in AP what are they being fed what's this new diet didn't say I don't think they're being fed other cows cow what does it say okay special machines used to cut the straw okay but still yeah mix with slag silage wheat maize soya or sugar beet which can be mixed with you know see if you google methane by cows who are pasture raised methane by cows methane produced by cows were grass-fed see if there's no I thought I read that it was grain-fed cows that produced less methane really which isn't what I would have guessed that's interesting grass-fed cattle do more methane what does produce produce do more methane the fuck I'm not reading that grass cattle do produce do more methane because it's harder to digest okay obviously do produce more methane because it's harder to digest grass than grain however some argue grass that is continually grazed by grass-fed cattle sequester's enough carbon to make up the difference in methane okay that's what it is yeah and healthy soil keeps carbon dioxide underground and out of the atmosphere okay yeah there's a big story behind there right so that's why it's it's better for the environment if they eat grass which totally makes sense because they've been eating grass for a million years yeah yeah so so here you are here you are on this diet now and you've started to what are you doing consulting people online so I am now yeah I started about a month ago and how what does that involve people Skype me and basically want to see me and how I'm still alive only eating beef and then they asked me how to cook and things cuz nobody knows how to cook meat without anything on it well how do you cook like how do you cook with just beef they don't know what to do they're like what Oriole do you use I don't use oil like eat I think most of these people I've been talking to a lot of oh I use tallow I need travel a lot but most of these people are really sick and really desperate and they haven't had any help from the medical system and so far and this is completely true anybody who's gone onto this like beef and salt and water diet anybody I've seen who's been able to stick through that transition period where you like get off of carbs explosive diarrhea not everyone gets that dad didn't get that you once it's like it seems to be 50/50 it looks like the sicker you are seven ya know it seems to be but like seriously 50% of people and it seems like the sicker you are the more likely you are to get that I don't know if it's a inability to digest that amount of fat right away or if it's a microbiome switch right or something but it seems to hit 50 percent of people the other 50% just switched over but everybody gets some sort of carb withdrawal especially if you go from like a standard American diet over then insane cravings oh do you get your ketones checked have you done that data I went to paleo FX this year and I got my ketones checked and they were ridiculously high that was with a breath test mm-hmm and then I have a urine strip test which I know aren't as accurate but I haven't gone out of ketosis my diets about 80% calories from fat so it Sloan I eat ribs which are really fatty I eat ribeye sometimes but I been eating more and more fat so just calorically I'm getting a bout 80% from the fat mmm see I eat a lot of meat but I'm eating really lean meat because I'm eating a lot of wild game hmm I'm not getting as much fat paying to fats the good stuff I think it's a bet definitely it has a factor mm-hmm I just finished I didn't finish I'm halfway through a book called fat of the land by I'm gonna butcher this but like Vilhelm er Steffensen mm-hmm it was this dude who went to live with Inuit people in Canada for five years and he made like they ate and it's amazing like historically it shows how they dressed and how they lived and what parts of the animal they ate and so he lived off of what they which was basically just meat and sometimes eggs for five years and then he came back I don't know if he was in England or in the States but he came back and said hey look how healthy I am all I eat is meat this was in like the 30s and they said no way you're supposed to have scurvy so him and his partner who's his last name's Anderson I went to Bellevue Hospital and they stayed under monitor just eating meat for a year and there are six studies done on them and you can find them online and they monitored like vitamin levels they monitor ever everything because kidney function because back then like nothing's changed in the last hundred year they said you're supposed to be dead of scurvy so I'm reading that book and he says fat was one of the main things they ate they also didn't eat any salt hmm no they were eating like whale blubber and seal fat mostly caribou caribou they also had rain though yeah but they I ate he said they gave a lot of the really lean cuts to the dogs so they ate a lot of the fattier cuts they ate the brain they ate fat behind he goes into some serious detail they ate fat behind odd the eyes yeah they boiled a lot they boiled bones for the marrow so they got fat out of that and then for part of the year they'd also eat seal the fat behind the eyes tastes like it's like bread like dough you know that yeah I haven't had that yeah I had it the first deer I shot we ate the fat behind the eyes taste it's like good no it's not the best okay but it's it's definitely though it's just weird like like dough that's weird yeah huh yeah it's a good book though and it there's another person who was just eating meat and for some reason people have forgotten about him so like maybe the best to eat would be those really fat Japanese cows those Kobe beef cows or why yeah cuz those are fat as fuck yes those things you look at those marbled cuts and you're like wow I don't know it's terrible they're only nothing good yeah and good now those poor cows yeah what I've been doing recently which is a lot cheaper is getting ground beef which is lean mm-hmm an adding tallow and just frying it oh that makes sense and it's way cheaper than steak but it's super fatty it's just spoonfuls of tallow in there and you just eat it just put it in a bowl and eat it are you getting bored with this oh no not at all so after the first week sucked because first miner kind of sex was one of the reason it sucked but I always also like a missing salad I was having and I only went from greens down so it was a pretty easy transition kinda but it's the rest your family on this diet as well as your home mas yeah he's on it as well yeah really and how does he have any issues health issues he was depressed pretty severe depression really what what was causing his depression like foods he had the same issues and as me and I know how that sounds but oh my dad was like this seems to be genetic how can you have it - whoa but so it's not genetic hmm that's interesting the reaction well he was like this is wow I mean those food reactions were kind of strange you know people have like weird sympathetic disorders you know like someone around them has something they start to develop the same say yes so that's what dad was thinking yeah it wasn't like this though he'll turn green his skin turns a different color when he's wrong thing yeah I mean not like green but he gets pale you can see it huh oh one thing I wanted to address when I was on here in Shawn Baker's episode he said something about eating apples but gave him low back pain and you were like apples gave you low back pain and people in the comments were freaking out right that's a symptom that happens to me too and it's not the Bulls yeah when my mood drops I get lower back pain and so does dad and it's funny to freak out about till you get it but that's very commonly associated with depression and it is triggered by food with me - well I know that that's triggered by some people that have lower back issues when they eat and Flint inflammation causing foods like pasta and sugar yeah that's all I went to a physical therapist once when I was having I had a bulging disc in my neck and she suggested that I cut out gluten I thought she's a crazy person yeah what are you talking about cut out gluten omakase she was I know it sounds crazy but a lot of these things cause issues and they caused inflammation that was like the first steps that I chose the first up yet gluten yeah well well also the first steps that took to understand that foods cause inflammation I had never thought of that at all I thought no no someone yanked on my neck and on my neck hurt and trying to fix it how do I fix my neck and but when she was saying this that the reduction of inflammation causing foods would lead to healing and certain issues I I was very encouraged elasaur sounds like some fucking wacky yeah bullshit yeah but there's something to it and you know there's there's something to first of all the weight reduction as soon as you cut out all these sugary foods and you your body's just carrying less stuff around you're carrying less meat I mean and people don't realize how much that is do a workout do like a bodyweight workout now do that same bodyweight workout with a 40-pound vest on it's way harder fucking way harder yeah and most people out there wandering around Italy's forty pounds over at least forty pounds yeah it's a lot of work it's a lot of weight you know I do this I have this um this backpack that I put metal plates on it's it's by this company called outdoorsman's and it's like a basically leg of the frame of a hiking backpack you snap it in and it puts an olympic plate on the back and locks it in place Wow so that it really centers in your back as opposed to like a lot of people do weighted hikes but they put sandbags in there and it kind of shifts and moves around but this was like really centers it and locks it in place but if I do forty five pounds and I go hiking around like he kind of kicks my ass it's hard going up the hills with 45 pounds think about what most people just go through life with a lot of people go your dad was 50 50 pounds overweight yeah thank you that it's a lot of weight that where is your ass out made that and then that's one of the reasons why people say they don't have the energy to exercise so carrying around all this weight er yes I always look at like really heavy overweight persons people and I look at their legs I'm like that dude probably can kick through a wall someone could teach them how to kick like think about how much weight you're carrying around all the time their knees are probably super strong like all the tissue around their legs just constantly carrying this heavy load upstairs yeah if you could lose weight you probably have amazing legs yeah yeah look a diet so how do you go though from this to doing consulting and is it is it a big leap to like I mean you're just trying to figure your own life out to try to help other people online do you don't have a degree in nutrition or anything right god no but what am I gonna get a degree in nutrition for they still teach people eat grain so that was never in box do you think that today like if you went to a university today like a really good school do you think they would still be saying that grains are a good good idea to eat I do I don't know that so I could be wrong but yeah I would say it's still pretty food pyramid II well I don't know if they go the old way was all rice and wheat I don't think it's really changed I think it's like eat a good mix of make sure you get your fruits and vegetables mm-hmm they tell you when you're pregnant but for most people I don't think so grain really we've been eating grain for what like maybe 20 thousand years in some areas mmm more like ten thousand years and in some areas two thousand years and if you're Native American like two hundred years they haven't been eating grain for very long why do people suddenly think they can digest that just because we're people so you don't believe rice rice is a grain rice I think is a lot less inflammatory than some grains like the gluten grains are obviously a lot harder on people and even I tolerated rice kind of for a while but yeah I don't I think grains feed a lot of people and so that's why the agricultural era came around now we can feed tons of people but doesn't make people thrive and I don't think it's good for their gut I don't think that's surprising considering we haven't been eating it long enough to evolve with it but other than grain what are the issues you have with what you'd call like a paleo diet or a healthy diet so with vegetables and do you think there's an issue eating vegetables I think it really depends on the person I think that this beef salt and water diet is a really good elimination diet and if you're seriously suffering and you have like nothing to lose you can give it a go suffer through the transition period and then try and once you feel okay try and reintroduce foods and see where you stand what about vitamin supplementation though and like why wouldn't you tell people why wouldn't you recommend multivitamins or a multivitamin pack that covers all your basics I say if you want if you're really concerned about vitamins get vitamin infusions I react to multivitamins so the fillers there aren't any pure vitamins you can take unless you take them in powder form so you can get like vitamin C powder potassium powder but it's hard to get the other vitamins in powder form and I react to everything so she ran the fillers and cups yeah I probably wouldn't react to pure gelatin capsules but like filler what kind of filler microcrystalline cellulose isn't a lot of them why do they put that stuff in there well a lot of them is to like bind it together you know if it's like a tablet well then most of that is like powdery stuff that isn't the actual vitamin what about capsules um I don't know I haven't tested it out like by because it's this month-long reaction I pretty much just say get rid of all the variables you can get rid of and start from scratch and then you can see if things are bothering you if you're worried about vitamins get infusions right but what I was saying is that you were talking about these binders do they exist in capsules as well yeah you have to check the ingredients they're just it's very hard to get vitamins that are pure unless they're in powdered form or right there by infusion I I couldn't find a multivitamin I could take a lot of the vitamin K is derived from soy so I'll react to that amount of soy mm-hmm Wow so in the infusions you're talking about IV yeah and I did those though I did that during my pregnancy because just in case right I don't react to that at all it's fine I didn't find I didn't see a benefit it didn't make me feel any better hi how do you react to fish oil not well but it was hard to tell because I was reacting to other things at the same time mm-hmm so I don't I don't eat chicken anymore and I don't eat fish anymore because it doesn't make me feel as good as beef but it doesn't give you a bad reaction not like soy or grains but but it's not to the restaurant and lobster was on the menu you would need a lobster no Wow no dessert no but the thing is the cravings go away after you transition over so I don't even care um three times usually if I'm doing more I eat more otherwise I'm eating about two and a half pounds a day if they're fattier then I'll eat less so just like a walking beef catastrophe yeah it's great though it's um it's amazing and then I drink like sparkling water which I love Perrier excites me so just Perrier and beef and salt that's it now what do you think about people that say that this idea might work in the short term in the short term but in the long term it's not sustainable I don't even know what kind of response to have to that like what I was doing diets as they start off they feel great they're like oh my god this is the diet for me this is amazing then over time their body starts reacting to the lack of nutrients lack of cholesterol lack of saturated fat and it doesn't doesn't in different bodies I mean obviously some people have no problem with it but some people have like legit like Chris crecer is a perfect example he started out with a macrobiotic vegan diet and had real serious reactions to it over time yeah started out doing well and then over time started to break his body down and long did it take I forget but when he started reintroducing meat back into his diet he had a massive ramped up you know it's ramped up like he got worse health health Wow Oh fantastic yeah a sudden everything started kicking in again yeah yeah so I'm not worried about it like I was so sick before theirs and now I'm better what I was concerned I was gonna die in the long run before now I'm feeling good I don't see why I would just randomly get sick suddenly I'm getting my vitamins tested because people are curious but I I don't have any symptoms and who's the besides this woman have you been in contact with this woman that's been doing this for nine years not personally no but somewhere in the states mm-hmm and so Shaun Baker is probably the loudest proponent and one of the most vocal and most public and he's been doing it I believe two years my friend Chris Bell has been doing it for a while as well I think he's less than a year but he eats apples he loves apples I had a hard time giving up apples seriously it's cuz I limited like I went down on all my sugar and then I was eating hordes of apples and that was my sugar right and that was hard to kick and apples somehow or another give you low back pain among other things but yeah huh it comes along with a depression and arthritis the whole thing is a really interesting conversation because there's so much going on with it it's and it's not an objective conversation it for the most part like many people that get into this they get into this it's very charged it's charged almost politically it's charged ideologically it's charged whether it's you know ethically and morally it's its charge where people are very skeptical also they have this diet that they believe in that they've been following and so anything that's contrary to that they reject yeah well I used to be like people when I was really sick people come up and go well have you looked at your diet it's like what disorder I'm dying have I liked what stop eating sugar and all my problems will go away like thanks so I've been on the other end of the spectrum and I used to get mad when people said but it was like condescending right if you've like tried have you tried exercising have you looked at your diet and it was like I'm dying and I thought how crazy is it then this wasn't even a conversation ten years ago right yeah like ten years ago did you ever hear this no that's what's so weird like the cutting the sugar out and cutting the carbs out this is so new it's so new and this like meat diets really new and but by the way but when I say new I mean in terms of like being popular really popular like yeah or something people have heard of yeah it's it's it's really interesting it's and when I see your dad and how healthy he is and how he looks so his skin looks younger it looks thinner like it's like it's like he's all sucked in yeah looks like yeah looks healthy I know he looks like a different person than the person I knew and I look like a different person than the person I knew my face looks different in a good way yeah well I think there's something definite definitely healthy about getting a lot of fat yeah and this is something that I think we've ignored with our obsession with carbs and one of the things that is a giant benefit for people that cut the carbs out is the way you you feel about food like you don't get these massive craving oh my god yeah yeah I used to so when I used to go to eat I was starving all the time I just felt like I was starving and I'd eat and then I would feel so full and it turns out it was bloating right but I didn't know that I just feel so full that I would literally have to ask people to take my plate away or I would keep eating because I was starving but stuffed and that was just my state all the time you know what's fucked up no matter how I am if you put a plate of french fries with salt on in front of me I will go after those bitches I can't help myself just I'll eat one of my all is so good and then with some ketchup like fat steak fries that are like kind of well-done --is-- with some salt on them and ketchup there's just something about that trick that biological trick that those goddamn potatoes play on you yeah that's yeah it's kind of addictive yeah I know and it turns out that even like the amount of solid I was eating lettuce mm-hmm it was still kind of addictive because I had like lettuce cravings lettuce cravings yeah I mean not like my Apple cravings not like my sugar cravings but they were that they were there so when you just eat only meat your body takes that meat and through a process of glue code gen is's converts it to glucose right yeah so I'm I haven't been out of ketosis and I'm always in ketosis but my glucose is normal that's what's weird the fact that you're always in ketosis because most people think that if you eat high-protein yeah but that's the thing is if you like convert what I'm eating to the fat ratio 80% of my calories I'm getting from fat are you doing this on an app or something I'm mostly typing in the cuts and then I can kind of add in how much tallow I'm adding to lean ground beef and how much tile do you how do you do it by tablespoon I do it yeah I do it kind of by tablespoon I just scoop it in but if I if I was measuring it I'd like four five who do you heat the tallow up first and then cook the beef into it or do kind of small - I just mix everything together it's way more satisfying though because eating lean ground beef just isn't great gets dry yeah just try roundel cuz even worse Wow it's delicious but it's so sinewy you know but when I mix it with butter and stuff like that yeah so I'm just mixing it with tallow it's great so when you're you're looking at the future and you know you're saying okay this is going well this is you know much better than anything I've ever done before I feel so much better do you feel like this is the way you're gonna eat for the rest of your life yeah and do you think it's sustainable yeah no I'm not arguing against it I'm just I'm just sustainable in what way nutritionally oh my god yeah I think so I'll keep getting my vitamins tested but this book that I've been reading about this guy who lived with Inuit that's what they ate they were healthy they didn't have teeth that fell out like they weren't sick like we're sick the Inuits are the people that went up there the anyways yeah but the Inuits didn't they evolved that way I mean if you stop and think about it I mean but didn't we evolve that way too I don't know man we can't say we changed like ten thousand years ago in order to eat grain looks like we've evolved to hunt kind of yeah yeah I mean but different people that grew up in different areas of the world I think they have I mean isn't that been proven that there's different nutritional requirements that different people have if you're you grew up in different areas I don't think so no I haven't read that no what is that that diet that people there's there's like some some diet that they they try to was based on blood work oh the blood type diet yeah that the idea is that different people that have different blood types they're they're coming from different parts of the world yeah I don't know I didn't really look well man so my diets I'm I know dad told me like he went over and he said I don't think I can eat fish I think fish is giving me a flare-up and my response was like well that's not possible I'm like all I'm eating is meat and I still have the same response and then I told you I don't eat chicken well when I switched over chicken started to make me not feel good when I was eating it what about ostrich I haven't tried ostrich I've just given up on birds ruminant animals seem fine I tried bison bison was fine bison what do what do you call it bison is that a Canadian I'm just gonna go without the Canadian bison by god I hope it's a Canadian thing well dad says it so it's his fault um ostrich is interesting cuz it's red it's a bird but it's a red meat that's interesting yeah they have ostrich burgers at Fuddruckers you can get an ostrich burger the fucking good guys everybody the sky-bird I haven't had that that's a sandhill crane yeah yeah sandhill crane is a really dressed guy that's what they call them yeah they they hunt them and they cook it and it's a really delicious lean but like soft juicy tender red meat huh yeah yeah look at that that's what looks like what yep sandhill crane wild Canada goose hmm where I don't think we're allowed to eat that in Canada well some some you're not allowed to eat some migrating geese right but sandhill crane I bet you could eat Wow Wow I wonder I have some buddies that hunted those in Texas and they said they were fantastic so it's some of the best meat they've ever eaten in their life we could eat that but I wouldn't want you to eat it then get fuckin hives and shit yeah now I'm going me Joe from number five weeks yeah yeah diarrhea everything all over again yeah so your plan is just sparkling water and steak forever yeah and I mean it could be more like I could be surviving off of eggplant it could be worse oh yeah enjoy everything I eat all the time yeah I love it and I don't get bored I thought if there's one thing I have to eat forever I hope it's steak because I'm not gonna get bored of steak and like I said the first month was kind of rough but then the cravings go away and now it's like every meal I'm like hmm stay you get hate from vegan people not really I don't think I'm as inflammatory as some people because I can understand I mean if you're easily ideology ideologically possessed that's different but if you go on the vegan diet you cut out processed foods you get rid of Dairy Dairy was a huge trigger for me and you feel better then I can understand why you'd be going around saying the vegan diet is the way to eat right so I can can I can understand where those people are coming from if you're ideologically possessed and you're saying well it's the environment all this stuff I don't really care um so no I don't get i've got like a couple of emails about me spreading lies this is like well I just I don't I don't really don't care there's a lot of loonies out there a lot of loony people but that is the issue with the the vegan diet is that it carries with it a moral high ground yeah yeah and that's too bad like that part sucks the people trying to figure out their health and going to that because it's they're trying to figure something out that's different but the whole moral thing like just let it go well listen I think this is very interesting stuff you know I don't have your health issues and I think very few people do but obviously for you it's it's made some massive impact yeah and for your father as well I mean it's really it's very very interesting and and like I said my friend lives in San Diego no problems I mean he's loving it I know several other people that have jumped on board as well too and they're they're seeing big benefits from it yeah I mean it's almost enough to make me want to try it but you should try well the proper doesn't take long yeah but I I have hundreds of pounds of wild game meat that's perfect yeah but I have to eat it with fat I'd have to figure out a way to get fat into it you can order towel here yeah this order towel it's on it like I haven't I've talked to people like programmers in Silicon Valley who have Skyped me and they're healthy and they just want to be more productive and the cognitive benefits it takes like six weeks and it's worth just seeing what it's like but they get that just from the ketogenic diet no I've had people switch off of the ketogenic there's there's something here there's really something here and it's worth seeing no I think people would see benefits if they tried it even healthy people what do you think those benefits are coming from I don't know I don't know if microbiome switch or if there's less you're just ingesting less plant toxin or if oxen what do you mean by that well plants have like naturally occurring toxins depending on the plant to get bugs and things to stop eating them that's just their defense mechanism so like oxalates that's a big one lectins like all those types of things are inflammatory and it's just seemed like we've just found the plants that we can tell are like as humans we've found the plants we can tolerate the easiest and don't kill us and we eat those and we've bred them so that they're easier to eat but so maybe removing those from the diet seems to help people but it seems like giving it a six-week try i don't see a downside like and i've only I haven't seen anybody switch back really mm-hmm and I've been talking to a lot of people on skype over like periods of months and I haven't seen anyone switched back including the healthy people all right well I'm curious this conversation is evolving that's for sure and you know it's evolving with many many people all across the country and you know when you take out the ideological or the moral high-ground argument that the vegetarians have it's it's it's interesting to me at the very least it's interesting yeah something going on so if people want to check out your blog what would that be well that's Michaela Peterson coms both the mi KH Aila all right Peterson dot-com calm and it's isn't there another name for it isn't it don't eat that don't eat that if you go to don't eat komm is that it no I don't have that somebody's bought it and they're trying to sell it back to me for a lot fuckers I know these fuckers listen thank you thank you Mikkel thanks for having me yeah it was
