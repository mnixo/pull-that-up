hello freak bitches you're doing something right now with this hole don't be a do-nothing bitch thing dad you are you aware of like how big this movement is I Pike tweeted about it the other day that I was I don't forget where I was but these two girls were arguing about the merits pros and cons of being a do-nothing bitch and it was completely it was all after your fight and it was it's completely brought on by you like some girls were like well listen you know like I don't like to fucking work you know I don't I don't wanna you know what's wrong with being a do-nothing bitch and the other girl was like no she's fucking right you know like just contribute nothing to society like you or you like all you do is consume if you are do nothing bitch all you do is spend somebody else's money and try to look pretty like that's all you do is you use stuff up you use up resources and you give nothing and so you're pretty much a drain on society that's what I think they they don't think it that way they think what they are is something that all these men want to fuck though so in in working really hard to attain this this appearance all these men wanna fuck that what they are they've created capital they've created like a need for this I was just brought up to think that it wasn't your mission in life to be happy it was your mission in life to leave the world better than how you found it and by being a cum bucket you're not gonna do that that's a fascinating thing say that it's not your mission in life to be happy so but what's the point in leaving the world better if no one's happy if everybody follows that same principle the world just keeps getting better and better than everybody as miserable as far I product of actually living a fulfilling life you know instead of just trying to you know if I tried to get drunk a party every day and get as happy as I possibly could every day you know I'm gonna live a really unfulfilled life and die unhappy this isn't this is not like a microaggression this is human curiosity that's something that's abnormal yeah it's not a bad thing that it's abnormal do you think there's a gender issue yeah you wish you were a woman when you were born a man or you wish you're a man reborn a woman it's not a bad thing it's just it is there is a difference though and and I think that we what we're experiencing now with the transgender movement and even to an extent the gay movement is the pendulum swinging all the way in one direction and it's a it's a reaction to the fact that and and this is just a fact when you were a man or a woman and you felt overwhelmingly like you were a different sex and you took measures to correct your current sex or you just dressed up in a way that made you feel more yourself so if you're a man and you're dressed in drag or whatever as a woman or for that matter if you were gay and you started having feelings when you include the the problem was that in most of our history you got the fucking shit kicked out of you yeah you killed your turn mr. John ostracize and that anger and that that injustice doesn't doesn't go away and so you have a lot of people that have are that that memory is very fresh that wound is very raw so let's have some fake pronouns the way that yeah way the way that is then to then try to control the majority of the populations behavior what about here z h i like that re z r they have those z it's one of them yeah i know i was in i listen i went to high school in massachusetts i remember when i had to when i had to say I couldn't say freshmen I had to say fresh person I dated a girl who graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in women's studies well Oh women studies it's all about women yeah I know it's wonderful Wow shave her legs there's a white girl the way I suffered I dated a white girl yeah she didn't shave her legs yeah it's very European no it's very hippie bro it's not a do it your opinion me this is fine but her roommate was Greek I got a trouble yes with her feet looked like Bilbo Baggins Oh hairy feet brochette hairy toes hairy feet no you were with nope the other girl when you're younger man you'll fuck a bear no she was beautiful but she was blond like she's a pretty girl and the the roommate there was a girl I dated who was liberal oh there was this white girl and she majored in African Studies in college no I went and all I did was this I go why cuz I knew the answer was she was a liberal white girl and just wanted other black people to be like oh you're my favorite white you're my favorite white and you understand us and her down with our cause I know it wasn't because she was interested in African Studies and then I said because I said why why why what about why did you choose to study African Studies not that there's anything wrong with it and not say what you come from like European history why would you care what she studied I just wanted to know the answer okay what was her answer she goes I find that question offensive and I said that's what I thought you'd say it was really you know it's really funny it's like you always see gangsters on TV but when you're confronted by true Psychopaths it is unbelievable you know I well I told the story with Gerry once on his community and coffee but I didn't hear it okay I got a call I could call one day from Sinatra he says hey Jay this is the Sons of Italy dinner in Italy can can you do it when is it he gives me the date and I said Oh mr.
