the Joe Rogan experience very hard when I started doing nights are doing yoga when I travel oh I feel better I feel a lot better doing that that's because all the girls are yoga pants in the class it makes me feel better - is that what excited maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing no that was the pig I could just go to the yoga pants sure yeah you could just go to a strip club you feel great well I started going to strip clubs on the road and I just I really really picked rip Club name I played Largo the other night and there's a place across from it I don't know what it's called in the phone book but the name on the outside of the door is star strip this is all the same font and font size star strip totally nude live nude girls girls girls the star strip on La Cienega yeah yeah dude I had a bit about that a true story where the girl was dancing and I said hey do you do you like doing this she goes I don't talk to guys who come here and I said well why I mean it's an open door I mean like nice people can come through too and she goes well most guys who come here they only come here for one reason I mean why did you come here yeah like she was like shutting me down yeah and I said because someone told me there was a place that I could do go where I could see a strange girls pussy for a dollar okay and that was the joke I'm the asshole no all I did is show up where you work all right I'm not a bad person because you work you know different people go to different places he's different reason a strip comes a lot and you know I turned me off I was in Nashville once I saw a commercial on TV for a strip club and I was like I would like that seems fun I'll go and and they went and then I gave the guy my ID when I walked in and he goes hey I like your comedy and I was just like I'm never going to a strip club yet I've never got back why because I don't know I don't want to be I don't want anyone to watch me watch someone be Nate I know I can't you need a wig in a fake mustache and a wig or a fake mustache anyone we're in Hollywood there's plenty of stores yeah I I'm here I saw a it took so long for me to get to the point but uh yeah do you have like a costume I really wanna go the my favorite California thing is whenever you know someone's come from California's in the first 30 seconds they tell you something incredibly Enfamil and intimate about their life like oh yes I speed if you do drugs or like I was molested and I'm like burden me with this shit I don't want to know that sad but that's why they're here yeah you know it's weird because this is also the obviously people create all over the world no doubt about that but when you come to like creating things that get attention this is like the hub of the universe yeah creating things that get attention it's almost all in Hollywood it's like a big chunk of it whether it's movies TV shows blah blah blah blah who needs attention people that didn't get enough or people that got too much of the wrong kind yeah and those are the ones that seek out and seek out validation so they all come here it's a weird mathematical process we always loved Angelina I believe he always loved her now the whole blonde bombshell just put up fucking billboards of herself and came famous just for that I started the other day just picking her nose and eating it and then you posted something about you saw somebody picking your nose and eating it like the day after I'm like what the fuck that's hilarious that pink Corvette around an old lady in a wig she was on the PCH the Topanga to the PCH on the merge were stopped at the light and I look behind and I watch this old lady and a wig just dig pull out a whopper and just start chewing I mean she was openly chewing it mouth open chew and I was like wow and all I could think of of course for the rest of the day was that she probably came over here in 1955 and she wanted to be a star and she was hot and it just didn't work out and now she's wearing a wig on the PCH chewing her burgers in her her blue Saturn with fucking faded out paint it was very weird watch I thought it was that that she always drove a vette no that's Angeline sigh Angeline I saw some random crazy lady okay light blue Saturn I think yeah I do that with people I like it tried to piece together what their story was what's what's what that fucking mine always goes down to hugs and blowjobs the stories of their very unoriginal they always you know somewhere along line someone blew Burt Reynold's that's always in my stories so Jordan would show up at a place in 2000 women would show up to meet him there 7,000 women would get the text message Michael Jerome like I imagined the pussy who has been thrown at Michael Jordan it's not even know it's like it's like locusts yes step outside oh yeah he says multiple suits now for people to like this this is your kid and he's actually won suits and keeps winning he's winning them cuz there's that's how you know he's so famous I think there's probably people that did fuck you did fuck me I didn't make a kid were you well there's also probable I'm sure but there's also probably people that are like hoping he'll just pay them of course she's shut up here's some here's a grand about shut up yeah yeah but you can't just keep doing that now especially when you're not making money anymore I mean how much does Hanes commercials pay oh he makes unbelievable money still doing what well his shoe brand is the absolute crazy oh that's his journeys are his it's nine nine he owns his brand of air Jordan but he is a huge huge benefactor of that Bret and he is the number one Jew among like that you know basketball shoes are a huge huge multi-billion dollar business yeah his shoes still outsell LeBron and Kobe which is and he's been done for years that's so crazy yeah I would say that Michael Jordan still probably makes probably like 40 million dollars a year god yeah he's as far as business goes he is set up man that's unbelievable yeah Wow yeah I didn't even think about the sneakers but it's it is incredible when you hear about a guy who was so awesome that's still to this day it's amazing his name rings in the hallowed halls they do that oh look I'm sorry I was off by 49 oh my god yes insane but how many athletes can say that none none he's not more durable they do that that I think it's like a Q rating where they ran the impact of just athletes and the top ten is like always the craziest list of guys who you all we all know that Tiger Woods right right I mean Michael Jordan is number one he's been number one for like 25 years and the lowest he ever dips he went to like number two once under Tiger Woods ice probably pissed very pissed I bet he was yeah yeah thing is that he is a notorious gambler mmm he's also a really good golf golfer like he has a like a real game you know and he would give up bet I wouldn't I wasn't uncommon for him to bet a quarter million on a round of golf and he would also they said like when he goes to Vegas he does you know shit like that for fun because he makes 80 million a year he's nice credible yeah what a weird life that guy has yeah it's amazing and he's getting married he got married he got married yeah something young hottie too so hot Cuban I think she's a half Cuban or a Cuban that's like far god I just gave her a little piece yeah give a little piece of this cash you think that's a pretty airtight prenup you get when you marry Michael Jordan oh I imagine it goes through several layers of lawyers like looking for anyway your lawyer sends it back they're like listen do you like them you want this to work just sign there's no other like this just sign it you can't there's no one to get on you ago she eight you get 23 in you for life that's a good deal all right and he's just a maniac gambler just going off with an 80 million a year coming in every year and that's why you can't say shit about what he's gambling who I lost a million dollars gambling today so ten years plus he's making like a hundred I mean think about that it's so crazy hundred million dollars a year close to it for ten years I mean how long does it take is he have a billion do you think he has a billion billion yeah yeah I mean if you're making 80 million a year and he was famous yeah I don't know if it was him or his agent at the time but he's famous for being one of the innovators in that when he was getting these crazy endorsement deals he was getting stock as part of his deals so like he would get millions of dollars to sponsor you know to be the endorser of Gatorade then it insisted on owning stock well guess what when Michael Jordan started endorsing Gatorade stock went up pretty significantly and he made many many more millions than he would have so he's pretty innovative in that sense too
