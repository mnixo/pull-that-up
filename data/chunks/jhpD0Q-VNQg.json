join my gang Joe Rogan podcast by night all day well at all tribes the nature of tribes you tell something that makes your tribe look like the good guys right right so each tribe has that's that's the conservative story and then the liberal story is like we're fighting racism and sexism did you see the Golden Globes I did see the Gold Edition she's a Meryl Streep so you didn't see the Meryl Streep suite god bless her god bless Meryl what she was talking about mixed martial arts people get so mad that's what animals like of course she doesn't watch cage fighting but she's talking out of her ass for sure but she'd you know to say that some people aren't artists martial artists aren't artists well that's completely open to interpretation like what do you think is beautiful you think that fucking stupid movie when you play that rock star what was that one that nobody went to see Ricky get your gun whatever the fuck that is listen that was art that wasn't art an Anderson Silva front kick to the face is a thousand times more beautiful nutty shit movie put out lady just I'm sure she's a very nice person she probably thinks she said she's standing up for what's right yeah get ready for Ricky it's Ricky flash with the fuck out of here three people saw that moving they're all related to her okay son that movie did you see that movie I even heard of it that it was like what are they doing to the eighty year old lady she's gonna be a rock star Ricky's coming back and but it's also like such weird casting for her too cuz like she does like these emotionally difficult like Sophie's Choice movies and she's like trying to do like a poppy Rockstar movie well she was interested in it you know she's a amazing actress she's an amazing artist in her realm and I just think it's the you could you could sort of say that without disparaging what other people enjoy including disparaging with a lot of women enjoy like and foreigners like one of the things you're saying is that Hollywood's crawling with foreigners if you take them all you have left is MMA and foot moon MMA mixed martial arts not the arts but you wouldn't that's not true because like 80% of the fighters in the UFC or from other countries yeah they're from Ireland like Conor McGregor they're from Brazil like Amanda Nunez I mean this is a good incredibly diverse lineup of people from all over the world so for her to say that is like so silly but I could understand saying that you don't think it's an art by your interpretation I understand that but the larger point is that humans are silly yes right humans in general are silly and we're not individually that smart I think performance arts like as far as dance I mean their dance is clearly an art right if you watch Mikhail Baryshnikov that's clearly art and I think in many ways competition in performance like gymnastics is also an art we don't think of it as an art we think of it as a sport but when you look at the ability to execute these spectacular moves yeah maybe that doing it to a concerto but it's still art you know like you see some amazing gymnast fly through the air and nail a landing it's beautiful its glorious well that's art in competition but it's not one-on-one competition now art in one-on-one competition is Edson Barboza wheel kicking Terry Adam I know it doesn't look like art to some people but to me it does well it's a technically extremely difficult move it's taken a lot of time to practice and get good at you know it's just the fact that when he does his beautiful pirouette it just lands in someone's face well someone has to suffer and because someone has to suffer and perhaps sometimes both people after some room in terms of a very brutal fight right but if you look at like Amanda Nunez his knockout of Ronda Rousey if you're an Amanda Nunez fan that is a beautiful work of art yeah cuz she didn't get any promotion for that fight she was looked at like cannon fodder to go in there and fight Rousey a lot of people are predicting a first round victory and she was out there and fucked her up in 48 seconds - art - well to some people it might not be to her but [Music]
