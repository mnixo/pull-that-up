hello freak bitches I would love to play you the dinosaurs are not real video just do it God we probably can't play it on YouTube where we'll get pulled but we could play the audio right play the I will put the video up on the screen and play the audio for you and you could just fuck it your head could turn beet red smokes could come out of your ears because the thing is about these videos and this is the issue that I have with not just videos but also with blogs people you're writing things and you're not you're not being checked as you're going along so it's it's just you broadcasting an idea it's not a conversation and because of that you can give off the illusion of expertise without being checked here it goes dinosaurs never existed and by the my god Eric Dubay this is the flat yeah the guy that does 200 proofs the earth is flat everybody has debunked fucking no no no she kills she'll yes yes shows are listen to this guy don't you dare mention Owens name the brass holes in 1842 or in other words the existence of dinosaurs was first speculatively hypothesized by United Museum head coincidentally in the mid 19th century during the heyday of evolutionism before a single dinosaur fossil had ever been found wrong they pause every time pause dinosaurs we we discovered marine reptiles and the first dinosaurs about a century before that so that right there Eric you're fucking wrong whoops it's like don't bring your Flat Earth bullshit into my profession now I'm pissed well we keep going yeah keep keep us rolling constrain press worldwide got to work hyping stories of these supposedly long lost animals and then lo and behold 12 years later in 1854 Ferdinand van Devere Haydn during his exploration of the upper Missouri River proof of Owens theory a few unidentified teeth he mailed two leading paleontologist Joseph Lee D mm-hmm who several years later declared them to be from an ancient extinct tract Adhan dinosaur which beyond ironic so that's because we can do things like look at modern analogues and see how teeth are fucking made we know if it's a predator or if its prey we know if it's an herbivore or a carnivore we know how to thar fucking built even back then even when they're doing naturalistic drawings like this it's like like the the Megalodon tooth on my arm it is a predator it's obviously a serrated Megalodon or Megalodon how do you say it it's it depends can be on a different sulabha it's it's both it's not like nuclear and nucular no no because because it doesn't have to use but it's spelled it's spelled the same but it's like Dimetrodon or Dimetrodon is it the same thing Magali Donn or Megalodon yeah keep doing it what is it 20 minutes firstly it should be needless to say that it is impossible to reconstruct an entire hypothetical ancient animal based on a few teeth but even more importantly it is dubious that a myriad of Baguio tile bird and reptile mammal transitional forms necessary for the blossoming theory of evolution would be hypothesized and then conveniently discovered by teams of evolutionist archaeologists purposely out looking to find such fossils and Glenna Brundtland is even more dubious that such fossils have supposedly existed for millions of years but were never found by or known to any civilization in the history of humanity okay evolution okay yeah the reason why we didn't know about things beforehand because we weren't doing shit like wholesale intellectual studies of science when people were building fucking pyramids and stuff like that that's why we have different ages in throughout anthropological records we have the broad age and iron and all that because we have to do things like figure out the land around us and when we start finding really old bones like hey this looks like a really big chicken bone what the fuck or this looks like a huge human with a single eye what the fuck we start looking at stuff like that saying just wholesale fucking bullshit like that goddamn but that's a that's what a YouTube videos YouTube conspiracy theory video is oh it's not one person getting to spill there's nonsense and they're unchecked yes why was this for you and response videos can be blocked by the original person they can curate all comments they can only allow certain ones through they can moderate everything same with a blog same with all that they control their own criticism mm-hmm there's a guy right now that a lot of the paleo communities going after his name's David Peters he's a jackass who's like doing stupid things like all reptiles are mammals and all of these clades should be in this and just all this crap he wholesale copied an article from a colleague of mine posted it which is a violation of copyright because he's attempting to supersede that work by importing his own ideas to it he will refuse any critical comments to be posted on his WordPress site hmm that's really common though yeah it's really common with people the war of ideas in the comment section that's where it's being fought yeah it's because it's an echo chamber yeah it's like people don't look as why do people think the world is flat or why do people think dinosaurs don't exist they're Google boolean search is dinosaurs don't exist or creationism is true evolution is false the earth is flat chemtrails exist they're creating their own echo chamber and preaching to their own fucking choir yeah and then they have a message board and then go on that message board massive confirmation bias nobody anybody that doesn't follow that line gets booted out let's play more of this because this gets better soon isms Masonic Renaissance it mid 19th century David Wozniak ins in all the years previous when they roamed the American continents because they weren't doing a fucking dinosaurs in the Native American religion or tradition because they were all dead that matter why were there no discoveries prior to the 19th century in any part of the world there could have gone you didn't know what it was that's the world book and it's like the same thing with mammoths Cyclops we didn't know what the fuck it was we didn't know as a massive you know a massive elephant species we thought was a giant person yeah when the first animals were discovered in the liberated Tar Pits before 1913 they thought it was livestock that got trapped in there and died then they realized holy fuck cows don't have 9 inch long incisors that are you know perfectly evolved you slash open the throats of things and then you started questioning so the Native Americans and all the people they were finding possibly scatters of bone and didn't know what it was did the did the northern first people start licking bones and rocks no we we discovered that you know the science as it figures out going hey this is porous material if I lick porous material it's gonna stick to my tongue holy fuck that's a fossil this this kind of just he the problem with you Eric is you are starting from an improper position you are starting on a confirmation bias you are stating from the beginning that dinosaurs don't exist and you were using parody Leah and apophenia the ability for humans to find patterns in order to fit your bullshit and then only cherry-pick what belongs that's that's what that's what he does with fucking Flat Earth and the problem with this is like I was saying earlier because now the stupid minority has a voice all I don't know how many million people subscribe to his fucking channel every single Flat Earth dipshit is gonna go sixty one thousand people okay look at that 300,000 use and here's the thing check out the comments that comments he curates icons down are almost identical look 3486 the 3494 are you kidding me but remember being forced to have the same dinosaur toys as everyone Matt yeah that's because it's called consumerism flatter if no dinosaur what's the point in making these ok see good good for you go in there extremely great research love is very amazing Thank You Max Haskins don't breed don't ruin dinosaurs with facts fuck you were my favorite animal here's another problem his voice is annoying it's fuck oh my god let's play more oh thanks I mean open sale appeared before the 1800s no one ever knew that dinosaurs existed during the late 1800s and early 1900s large deposits of dinosaur remains were discovered why his man suddenly made all these discoveries no tribes cultures or countries in the world ever discovered a dinosaur bone before the mid-1800s and then they were suddenly found all over the world in North America South America Europe Asia Africa Argentina Belgium Mongolia Tanzania West Germany and many other places apparently had larger deposits of dinosaur fossils never before seen that's because we find the first one and then were like holy shit there must be more of these out there and then the bone war started between Ogden and Marsh you had the mantle collection with the first Iguanodon that was found and they put it and they made these really stupid statues and put him in Crystal Palace in London and Mary Anning one of the first female the first female paleontologist and one of the first people actually find fossils she discovered the ichthyosaur Mary Anning was the girl from the rhyme she sells seashells on the seashore because that's what she did as a child and as she was looking for seashells she found a skeleton of an ichthyosaur buried in a cliff oh yeah as like a kid I think she was 12 13 I think paleontology Twitter is gonna rip me apart from not knowing the thing but come on I'm hyped up now drunk he's hyped up I'm not dude that's one beer all right I've got ya before you got here none excited I've got nine more in there I'm gonna need them yeah it's just so Mary Anning discovered it via Soares and once you discover something like that you want to go around the world and say hey where else is this stuff let's go somewhere that no one has been hmm which means North America South America Tanzania Belize all the things that captain jackass just rattled off Captain fuckface let's bomb cap cap nut face fucking fuck wooded shit Gibbon I don't know just something oh yeah I stole that I stole shit given from a trauma thing but it give it shit given one that we like a monkey like a Gibbon ma a I think they're technically Apes I think Gibbons rapes have tails no all right please all apes monkeys but not all monkeys or Apes no apes and monkeys are prying but a monkey is just it's not a technical term right it's not a scientific term there was an article that was written there's explaining that all Apes are monkeys but not all monkeys or Apes see if you can find that well let's we'll go to that afterwards you know that probably because one of those beers all right let's let's keep this rolling well I don't want to I want to see how deep we can go with this for this time why had no one ever found a dinosaur fossil before according to the book the dinosaur project paleontological journalist Wayne Grady things the period following this from around 1870 to 1880 became a period in North America where some of the most underhanded shenanigans in the history of science were conducted that's because the paleontologists going at it against each other going I can find the cooler thing no I can find the cooler thing I'm gonna find more shit than you it was called the bone Wars Ogden vs. Marsh he already talked about this right yeah what it was was underhanded about it they would they would sabotage each other's digs they would try and yeah steal fossils they were assholes but because of the competition it's it's like a fight when you have one dude that you know two dudes have been training all their lives and try and do the whole thing the more amped up one gets the more amped up the others get it's gonna be a fucking just Throwdown this is what happened on an intellectual and fieldwork scale you had two guys trying to make a name for themselves in a burgeoning brand new field that just wanted to get in and roll and they had direct competition with each other so it's gonna be you know fuck you I'm gonna find these bones first and it got nasty man Wow yeah it's like it's think of it as Edison versus Tesla paleontology right except a Tesla wasn't very aggressive he's sort of like let all that shit yeah true true very true play it people keep this going Owen as the great dinosaur Rush born the bone Wars Edward drinker cope of the Academy of Sciences Marsh Rafael Marsh of the peabody museum of natural history began a lifelong rivalry and passion for dinosaur huh yeah I said or done it oh my bad but became bitter enemies during a legendary feud involving double-crossing slander bribery theft spying and destruction of bones by both parties Marsh is said to have discovered over 500 different ancient species including 80 dinosaurs while cope discovered 56 out of the hundred and thirty-six dinosaur species supposedly discovered by the two men however you for sanction pose 32 are presently considered valid as the rest have all proven to be falsifications and fabrications bullshit bull shit not a falsification or fabrication turns out a lot of those dinosaurs were the same species that were previously discovered so oh look this sauropod femur looks a lot like that sauropod femur but I found this slightly in a different place so I'm going to name it a new species nup turns out those are both brontosaurus or Apatosaurus or Triceratops or stegosaurs anything like that that that that is just an outright fucking that he just said when things are discovered and it turns out that they're the same it becomes taxonomically what's called a junior synonym so for example Tyrannosaurus Rex had another name for a really long time it's totally syn mega mega lot know what regardless whatever the first name for it was was technically the first discovered name for it but since Teran asaurus rex became the more popular the more documented the more thing that became a junior synonym or what or and obscured that one actually became what we call no mum obscure him there were the obscure name no longer no longer talked about but that's what happened it wasn't an outright fabrication it was two dudes finding bones of the same species or type of animal but not naming it the same thing so that's that's an absolute bullshit Eric Dubay outright lie lifts them once claimed to find a complete skeleton either so all their work involved reconstructions in fact to this day no complete skeleton has ever been found bullsháá and so all dinosaurs are reconstruction bullshit sooo in the Field Museum isn't well not a hundred percent complete ninety-eight percent complete including formerly unknown elements from any other Taranis or I believe a commercial paleontology group just found like a 99% or almost a 100 percent complete dinosaur we have found entireties or near entireties of animals so he's right by a very small technicality of one or two percent exactly exactly but what he's implying is completely misleading yeah he's implying that they're finding a shin bone and drawing a dinosaur around exactly but no like we will find we could find 70 percent of Tyrannosaurus Rex we know what they look like so yeah we will use 3d printing or casting of all that many and yeah I'm happily admitting this because everyone knows or at least everyone should know many dinosaurs in museums are what we call it will be a a triceratops the skull will be real maybe the front half of the animal some ribs maybe some tail vertebra or the pelvis will be from one animal we will have to use casts of other Triceratops that we have throughout paleontology in other museums many of the fossils you see on display are casts now cast doesn't mean bullshit created on the spot it means very technically this is a cast it is a replica of an actual existing bone that was wrapped made a mold of and then filled with resin painted to the correct color it is the exact match of a bone that exists it is not something we are just making up that is bullshit and I hate that when they come in and go oh wow look that's like plastic yeah it's plants think it's all well yeah you know why fossils are fucking fragile it takes us weeks to get a single bone out and then it is covered in glue it is wrapped in tissue paper sometimes tin foil a shit ton of plaster and reinforcement is wrapped around it then it has to be very carefully slid down a mountain on a car hood in one time or airlifted out in another and put in this back of trucks and then taken all the way to its museum and and cracked open and then then prepared everything has to get get left off it very carefully and we're adding more glue as we're going because if you sneeze wrong on some on some mineralized specimens it goes away it just goes boom so you have to work very carefully in a booth with like an Arab Raider so you're just you're shooting extremely fine particles just to get the top millimeter of material off this is hard detailed work on things that are 65 plus million years old that if we're not careful they fall apart we are not going to wrap something like that in fucking steel and put it up on a mount especially somewhere I don't know like Los Angeles where things like earthquakes happen it's a statements like that that he may they're just fucking irritating keep it keep David Wozniak of arees and excavations seem not to be made by disinterested people such as farmers ranchers hikers or recreationist bullshit building construction bullshit it's a fuckin lutely bullshit fuck you Eric I'm a paleo monitor you asshole I am actually contracted to go out to fucking building sites and make sure fossils are protected and dug up correctly in fact you know what jackass I found a whale in downtown LA fuck you Eric Dubay you found a whale I found a whale in downtown LA oh you talked about this last podcast you were talking about how they had a shut down construction exactly you know why because building construction finds fucking dinosaurs and met and whales and prehistoric animals you jackass oh fuck fuck you farmers so sue was found on a guy's farm there have been numerous dinosaurs numerous prehistoric animals found on a guy's farm by the way there's an entire private area up in Bakersfield called shark's tooth hill where they find Megg teeth mcgowan on tea all the fucking time and it's angers fields in Bakersfield it's on private land farmers builders recreational people yeah hey guess what a couple people hiking in Red Rock Canyon up near Palmdale found a trackway from an ancient camel wreck we recreational people yeah this happens all the fucking time the reason why it's happening more and more lately it's because people know what they're looking for now they understand Wow there could be shit out here hey if we're digging a road if we're widening the 99 freeway in Fresno holy shit we hit a mammoth or holy shit we found a whale in downtown LA like with within blocks of the 110 freeway and Good Samaritan Hospital I won't tell you where I can't but yeah just want to say creepy yeah it's just part of the part of the contracts that's that's the deal because if you find something if you find something there you can find more shit mm-hmm we found over 400 specimens of shark teeth whales or ribcage of a whale snails fossil Coral all of this because town la was underwater seven million years ago and yeah that's oh my god it's fucking bullshit Oh keep you like blind trench diggers luck you and mining industry personnel found all the time by people with a vested interest such as paleontologists both scientists university professors and museum organization personnel who we need trained motherfuckers dinosaur bones or who have studied dinosaurs previously finds are often made during special dinosaur bone hunting trips and expeditions by these people to faraway regions already inhabited and explored this seems highly implausible more believable is the case of the discovery of the first original Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 which were unintentionally discovered by a child and which were all published by 1955 oh ok so it's perfectly fine to accidentally find ancient scrolls or silver denarii I from the Roman period or a never before known pyramid in South America oh no that's cool you know why because humans fucking made those but it's completely out of the norm for some kid some nine-year-old kid to be walking around Montana and find a mummified hadrosaur because I don't know why I made that distinction that's a weird comparison this yeah it's more plausible to find the Dead Sea Scrolls in Qumran than it is to find a Megalodon tooth bull shakers field yeah no no it doesn't make any sense he's he's anthropomorphic sizing this and he's using a very an absolutely invalid lot invalid argument and logical fallacies trying he's trying to its absolute false equivocation he's trying to go oh well you know you can't find this stuff because it's super super old but you can find this stuff because it's younger and it's humans and you know people live there so we'd expect stuff there well guess what asshole there's 65 million years of difference between humans deciding to write shit down and go hey there's a day and a night that means something's ruling the day in the night gods religion and Industry and all that and dinosaurs eating shit 65 million years you we were tree shrews and moles we didn't we weren't building shit we weren't writing stuff down such a false fucking argument god this guy's a jackass some cases of a discovery of dinosaur bones by a disinterested person it was suggested to them by some professional in the field no loss mistake in a certain area it wasn't also very interesting to note or special areas set aside and designated as dinosaur parks because we found a bunch of shit bearers are required to first obtain a dinosaur hunting license whatever destination these establishment finest origin is hard daily intelligence said it seemed they found incredible numbers of fossils and tiny areas in one of the largest dinosaur excavation sites called the Ruth Mason quarry over 2,000 fossils were allegedly discovered stop sinks alleged militant son of a build from these bones are currently on display in over 60 museums worldwide yeah because it's a fantastic site no head of paleontology at La Plata Museum is amazingly responsible for 6,000 fossil species supposedly discovered throughout his career all in Argentina oh oh really really hey guess what Eric I ran a lab that we had three and a half million specimens from the Ice Age that goes back ninety thousand years so the La Brea Tar Pits the largest Ice Age mammal collection on the fucking planet and this stuff isn't mineralized it's actually subsumed with asphalt keeping the all of the calcium and everything intact these are actual bones when we find a saber-toothed cat tooth it's the physical tooth of the animal ooh which is kind of freaky to think about but but but saying that it's like yeah we find a lot of shit in places the river of death in Alberta when they're digging the pipeline I don't know Mammoth Hot Springs there are things called death traps and predator traps and sinkholes and natural trap Cades and I don't know entire sand dunes falling on things while they're fighting the dueling dinosaurs it's a Protoceratops versus a velociraptor that was found in Mongolia because a fucking sand dune fell on them while they were tussling around because the V Raptor wanted to eat the thing it that that's a rad specimen by the way you know what's interesting about this guy is that he knows so much is that his his on is knowledge of the history of paleontology and of researching dinosaur bones he knows so much I call bullshit on that what I'm thinking is that he's reading from the script that he cobbled together on fucking Wikipedia I challenge him to go toe-to-toe with somebody in the business I don't know like me and go okay start throwing dates start throwing specimens I will fucking own you this video I'm saying I mean he's he's obviously he knows all these people he knows about the bone Wars he knows well who's in charge of all these different simple google search of largest dinosaur thing found okay I'm going to write these three things down on this manila in on this Manila fucking I understand I'm not saying that it's it's impressive and that it's conclusive evidence I'm saying it's it's impressive that this guy has done this much research but yet still has this ridiculous idea and he's used this yeah he's using all this data that's actually factual about how many different people found how many different things and he's decided this is proof and all he does when allegedly in front of it yeah it's like no sorry over 6,000 specimens were found their fucking deal with it hunter Earl Douglas sent 350 tons of excavated dinosaur bones to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History throughout his career all coming from the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah why do you think it's called the Dinosaur National Monument now dr. Louis Chafee and dr. Lowell it's kiawe actually governed thousands of dinosaur eggs at a site of only a few hundred square yard it was called the tiniest Giants exhibition and has such finds of huge quantities of fossils in one area by just a few highly invested individuals goes against the laws of natural probability what the most readin's to the likelihood of forgeries or concentrate planting efforts wrong if you find a fire planting yeah well they plant what were the things that they planted oh there's dinosaur bones that they planted that that's that's not what the dinosaur bones made out of it like resins so that is actually an argument with these jackasses it's like okay so big paleo the big paleontologist people like me the Paleo Haley a Big Pharma yeah like Big Pharma and big VAE and you know all the podcast Jamie death ergo we're big podcast for an industry so they say they not in the black man you know black helicopter day but they as in the detractors state the paleontologists like me will create a fossil whether it's like a cast or we'll just make one up and on these expeditions we go out and we actually bury it and uncover it and make the news and all that well if that was true Erik why is it that when we find something say in I don't know 2008 it's not usually written about until say 2012 and that's just a symbol a single note in the Journal of vertebrate paleontology which I guarantee you've never read or it's done as a poster at the Society of vertebrate paleontology which I will absolutely guarantee you've never been to and then the fossils still in prep at that point we haven't done all the research on it it's still undiscovered fossil found if we are going out and investing all of this money in order to make these fakes and bury them and pay all of these people to shut them up and huge excavations like that we would kind of want to recoup that money as fast as possible and immediately dump it to the news and get paid for spokesmen ships and all of that but we don't we suffer Natural History Museum's are some of the lowest donated to institutions on the planet art museums are generally number one there are people that get laid off all the time for museums museums close if we were making all this money in making all this fame why are there paleontologists out of a job why do I know a dozen monitors that don't have work right now why are there museums that have problem actually getting a budget to get an excavation going that they have to use private donors that they have to use their board of directors that they have to go from a County Museum to a foundation nonprofit non-profit this is such a line of fucking bullshit that I that that pisses me off because his simple statements are looping in thousands and tens of thousands of employees and museums and all of that worldwide this would be one of the largest conspiracies ever other than I don't know moon hoaxes in a flat earth flat earth and shit like the other one he does yeah that is a good one keep going Oh dinosaur bones sell for a lot of money at auctions it is a profitable business there is pressure for academics to publish papers museums are in the business of producing displays that are popular and appealing what the nonprofit business via need to produce material to sell to stay in business the mainstream media loves to hype alleged dinosaur finds must be gained by converting a bland non dinosaur discovery of a bone of modern origin into an impressive dinosaur find and letting artists interpretations and imaginations take the spotlight okay Eric the basic boring real find if that's true then why do dinosaurs become passé why does somebody like me who has been on I don't know 13 14 different television shows talking about paleontology geology and all that I have pitched dinosaur like live dig stuff to BBC and all of that I'm consulting on a couple projects right now unfortunately can't name them but dinosaurs become pass a very very quickly because people are like oh cool new dinosaur was found yeah big deal or oh well brontosaurus is back yeah whatever but the mainstream media as he said is just like they love a dinosaur story but that's bullshit that's absolute bullshit when the last like dinosaur document yeah there was um what was it called autopsy the t-rex with my friend Tori and that that okay that was a speculative science show there's like what happens if we found a t-rex and cut it open and do an autopsy that was a hit and then paleontology TV died again two years ago I had an a to our National Geographic documentary about digging up woolly mammoths in that it aired a night there was a little bit of press fuckin done the production company that did the the the thing with Nat Geo is out of business now just done it's like really we're pressured and to get this money then why aren't we making fuckin more why Eric am i a bartender in addition to a paleontologist in addition to somebody that's on TV if I'm making all this Big Pharma are sorry big paleo fucking money if I'm such a shill okay yeah is that why I'm a month behind on my car payment right now is that why I'm trying to scrape together rent fuck you get aggressive oh I'm very aggressive hire these guys prestige fame and attention there is the bandwagon effect and crowd behavior and then there are people and then to wait but wait wait wait wait live it wait the bandwagon effect and the crit and crowd behavior like Flat Earth bullshit okay we're only seven minutes and 53 seconds into a twenty nine minute video oh fuck off we don't have to keep going I don't want you to get too mad I think you kind of made your point yeah you just pull the plug any time you want but now it's like one of those Twitter arguments man now I'm getting invested control me all the time because we follow each other we do um each other and all of a sudden in my thing it's like I have you on note because we're both verified it pops up and it's just like Joe Rogan is tweeting about flatter fuck and then just go for it it's like you're I mean like you know the podcast and like flight commentary and UFC stuff and like with your with like trigger coming and all that that's one thing when you rile up the cranks man you're just like you're the same level just actually you have like how many followers do you have like 2 million right isn't like on Twitter TDT take that Darwin like 10 maybe 15,000 I get the same level of riled from both of you fuck man so we need to fly him out and have him on the show this guy this he would be red no fuck Eric Dubay if he's ever on the show I want to be outside waiting with a fucking baseball bat oh no really don't be violent with him almost almost don't you want to talk to him what you loved mean I think you could gain a lot from sitting down with a guy like this and just sort of picking him apart because you would realize what he was wrong about and instead of him being able to just spout off on a YouTube video he would be checked at every step of the way whenever he said something incorrect yes but the problem is the only reason why I would do that he will never change his mind well he's probably crazy well duh he's absolutely crazy but think about it right now you have 4 million subscribers that now know this video exists that no Eric do base named that know that paleontologists it can get riled up by this guy they're now gonna go look if any one of your listeners is on the fence about dinosaurs why would you be but you could have some those are the people that I would have to try and convince I will never convince him I will mock the living shit out of him until he wants to put himself into a chipper shredder but I will never convince him it's the and that's that's the thing so all you sicom people out there we don't do it to try and convince the big mouthpieces for these movements we're trying to go for the people that aren't quite sure if we embarrass the living fuck out of these people those people will go wow those guys are idiots why did I even consider that the world is flat er the dinosaurs didn't exist or creationism exists or chemtrails or Nibiru fucking rogue planets and shit like that [Music]
