the gyro can experience but there's no way of getting in New York City unless you're paying somebody if you want to take those bridges from Staten Island you get a pay me bitch you're coming in from Jersey pay me you gotta pay to get in here dog it's like an amusement doesn't cost anything to leave doesn't live in New York twice and deleted all of my funds and both times when I moved out of New York I as I crossed that free bridge I thought doesn't cost anything to leave isn't that fascinating it's it is it to regulate how many people come in is it to mitigate traffic and to make it like problematic cause it cost so much money maybe a carpool story sure anyone it is a big story actually and I was reminded but you're talking about the George Washington Bridge and when I was 20 years old I lived in Washington Heights for a year worst year of my life why just the worst year in my life I wasn't ready as a comedian uh how old me 20 oh yeah you know I'd only been doing it like three years I you know I didn't have been doing it three years when I started at 17 B where'd you start Orlando powerful and Lando produced a couple of good things and anyway so I always swore if I ever had any money I would live in New York with style so when my sitcom was finished 98 99 I moved in New York City and I got a rock star apartment in the Wall Street area oh you did not you considered one of the first skyscrapers ever built 20 storeys tall it's at the entrance of where Wall Street the entrance of Wall Street it's Trinity churches right there right only on the 18th floor were there marble balconies I had 3 marble balconies I was on this corner unit just pimp spot Oh three blocks from the World Trade Center oh my goodness 16-foot tall ceilings I could lie in my bed look up at the World Trade Center must have been insane it was it was fantastic but it was a time in my life you know the sitcom attended I felt I was angry I I was angry and I was I was I was searching for for meaning and uh what was important in life and what was making her angry I just you know that I had the sitcom and it didn't work out and then I just you know I wanted to just go focus on being a comedian where and live in New York so the Dalai Lama was gonna give a speech for free in Central Park unhappiness for six months I had the flier on my refrigerator nothing in the world was gonna make me miss the Dalai Lama's speech on happiness so the night before I'm headlining at Caroline's on Broadway and there were these two Puerto Rican lesbian strippers and they loved me and they stuck around after the show and they wanted to talk to me and we're we're talking and then they they invited me out with them and you know what there was the queen bee and the other girl the other girl was off-limits cuz she had a boyfriend I ain't give a fuck about the other girl it was all about the queen bee and the other girl was in love with the queen bee because she was making all the did all the decisions and make and everything happen Wow so she the queen bee had a car were driving down to the village somewhere they said they had ecstasy do I want to do ecstasy and I'm like hell yeah we go to some lounge and we're drinking Pinot Grigio on ice and I had never had Pinot Grigio in my night to this day I love Pinot Grigio because it reminds me of this evening it's a perfect you know like red wine is it no you know autumn/winter thing but but a dry white wine like Pinot Grigios great and summer so weird and you know we're drinking and we're having a great time and you know after about an hour you know this ecstasy starts thumping and this girl the queen bee wanted to go to some dance club we go to some dance club in Soho it's packed I didn't want to be in a packed dance club I want to be with these girls she knew the DJ we did all up these steps we're in this private area behind the DJ no one can see us the DJ's like 1015 feet in front is just like jamming and the place is packed downstairs but you can't see them and we got this horseshoe leather couch and we're just rocking and she's got more bottles of Pinot Grigio on ice and just fuckin dancing and grinding on each other and we go back to my apartment at about five o'clock in the morning something like that and you know we dance on my furniture and play music and stuff and we got in my bed and honestly there was no sex we had our bottoms underwear on and it was so tender and just caressing and kissing and tasting of flesh and and touching of private areas and at one point the queen bee got up on her knees and she starts french kissing this other girl and she's rubbing her mound what she's just kissing her and I got behind this behind the queen bee and I just started kissing this big beautiful brown bulbous acid I got my hands up on the top curvature of it and I pulled her panties aside no stuck my nose and her honeypot no just tasting these delicious flesh rose petals and I overslept and I missed the dali lama's you win why would you why would you even think that that would be a bad thing the Dali Lama with the Dom it's a true story the Dali Lama represents an interesting point of view and that's it you know the idea that this guy's right you leave this guy for to find out what happiness is there's there's yeah it's it the idea of a 1 a 1 figurehead like that is kind of preposterous to the idea of enlightenment the idea especially if you're dealing with a guy who dresses like a wizard and doesn't fuck
