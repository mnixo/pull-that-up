morning why fuck around Jamie cue the music the Joe Rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast by night trying to get the old brain fired up in the a.m. it's very unusual bit well I usually get up around this time so do a podcast around this time Randall Carlson ladies and gentleman I first met Randall quite a few years back in Atlanta he and he blew my brain open with a bunch of crazy talk about asteroids and just all kinds of crazy shit sacred geometry and you're a very interesting cat and you you got a lot of cool stuff to talk about so I'm glad we finally got you here on the podcast you're a much requested guest on my online forum so folks know about you they know about your work all these years of in on anonymity and now I'm suddenly uh I don't know if I'm ready for this job I think you ready dude I feel it from you it's this is your time to shine all right Joe I'm coming from you that's all all it requires well we had a great conversation when we first met and we did ever since then I've been trying to figure out a way to repeat it online there's videos of us actually having parts of the conversation but it's there's music in the background we're at the comedy club and yeah so um you you you first I don't remember what we first started talking about but you blew my mind when you started talking about the Holocene crater and that this pretty distinct evidence that you know there's been more than one events on this earth besides the one that everybody knows about the 65 million year ago one where the big chunk of rock hit the Yucatan and killed the dinosaurs but there's been a series of those and that these things may very well be responsible for a lot of the cataclysmic stories that are in epic of gilgamesh the Noah's Ark story all these different fables and tales of ancient traditions maybe based on these cataclysmic disasters and now since we've spoken science has started to validate a lot of your theories and ideas even more substantially the discovery this nuclear glass that they find all through a Europe and Asia tell me about all this stuff well I did you catch the thing about a month ago I think was into New York Times most of the major newspapers a group of former NASA astronauts and scientists came out said we were new evidence was showing it we're probably somewhere between three and ten times more likely to encounter things than anybody had previously been estimating even five to ten years ago it was a pretty major article in most of the mainstream media you mean by encounter things by getting hit by something yes of course you remember what happened on February 15th of 2013 right what happened on February 15th was that Russian yeah in what was really interesting about that is because everybody was at least people who are interested in this sort of thing we're kind of looking to the sky anyway because this was the closest pass of an asteroid coming within 17,000 miles of the earth at the same time this object totally out of the blue came in and exploded over Chelyabinsk Siberia so it was very interesting and coincidental if there are such things as coincidences that here when we're expecting this very close flyby of an asteroid in your earth asteroid coming actually within our geosynchronous satellites within the orbits of those satellites Wow at the same time that this object is coming within 17,000 miles of the earth suddenly unexpectedly here comes the second object and explodes with the force of about a I believe it was about a 50 kilo ton nuclear weapon and of course it had exploded quite high about 20 I believe about 18 to 20 miles in the atmosphere and so it didn't kill anybody however the thing to bear in mind is if that object had been just a little bit bigger or it had been a little bit denser or the angle of approach had been a little steeper instead of 1,600 injuries that probably could have been 1600 or more casualties at that point I think the world would have really sat up and taken notice but it was basically just a warning shot it seems to me that our knowledge of asteroids and meteors in packs and things of that nature the art our actual experience on it is based on this short window that we call human history which is for the earth such a brief tiny blink of an eye it is although I like to point out there you know when you say human history we're talking you know 4,500 to 5,000 years ago generally I think most historians of ancient history will usually say that the emergence of keenya form writing in the Middle East marks the beginning of official recorded history but you got to bear in mind that we modern humans have been around a lot longer than that right now the as far as the hard evidence goes is which which is what I like to refer to which means skeletal remains skeletal remains of humans that as far as we know are basically no different than than modern humans if you put flesh on them and dress them up in modern clothes and they walk down the street you wouldn't think they were anything unusual modern skeletal skeletal remains of modern humans are now dating between a hundred and fifty and a hundred and eighty thousand years so when you think about that you know compared to what we actually have over our record of history a record of history is one 20th 125th one thirtieth of the actual time that we humans have been here now now it could be that modern humans have actually been here much longer than than 180 thousand years we have no way of knowing at what point we moderns first appeared on this planet but when you think of a hundred and eighty thousand years compared to let's say in round numbers five thousand years it means that there's a lot of the human story missing and the thing that's always intrigued me is that given the assumption that they would have had the same intelligence as us the same big they've got the same brain case size the same cranial capacity so one would assume that with brains as big as our modern brain they were able to think they had forethought they were able to plan ahead presumably have a you know have some kind of a tradition that could be passed on from generation to generation and accumulated learning but what we see is that there's basically no record to speak of of what people were doing culturally and and that has led a lot of scientists to assume that for all those tens of thousands of years and hundreds and hundreds of generations that people were essentially living nothing more than a subsistence kind of hunter-gatherer existence right but what they haven't taken into account is the extremity of some of the global changes that have occurred in in the interval that we humans have been here and as we go through our discussion today and I'll we'll pull up some images I think you'll begin to get an idea of how extreme and how sweeping some of these changes have been and why in the aftermath of those changes we wouldn't shouldn't expect to find a whole lot of hard at cultural evidence because what you'll hopefully begin to appreciate is that were some of these events of the scale and magnitude that have happened probably a dozen or more times in the hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand years that we've been here were those events to occur today ten thousand years from now archaeologists would be sifting through the through the rubble looking for any kind of evidence that we had ever been here and that's the thing we have to get into our consciousness you know I guess if there's any any implication to the work that I've been doing is that we certainly can't take our present position for granted it seems very difficult for us to put into perspective numbers like ten thousand or a hundred thousand or a million we know that the universe has been around allegedly for fourteen billion yes so the earth is 4.6 billion those numbers are so weird to it they don't register they're just like I know four billion is more than 400,000 but both of them are alien you know what I mean it's like huh I don't think we could really wrap our head around the idea that 10,000 years is such an incredible length of time that if you left a car out for 10,000 years within you know three or four thousand it would be absorbed completely by the earth Joe within three or four centuries really oh yeah I mean if you look at I mean steel body cars I remember very well as a kid not far from where we lived there was a auto junk auto graveyard and all the teenagers around there who were racing cars back in the 50s and crashing them up and everything they seemed to end up there and as a kid I used to like to go and kind of hang around there and play in some of the old cars but they were already after sitting out there for ten years I mean already well underway - rusting away I mean once that process of oxidation begins to take place it accelerates mm-hmm not far from where I live in Atlanta there was an old iron bridge that had been built around the 1890s and it's no longer there but by the eighteen by the 1980s it had almost rusted to nothing and within a century it almost rusted to nothing yeah metal does not last long when exposed to the elements there was an interesting series of shows a few years ago I think was it had to do with the idea of if what if humans just suddenly departed and what if we took humans out of the equation what would happen to all of the infrastructure left behind just under normal kind of gradual istic change that we're used to within you know the last few centuries the upshot of it was is the 10,000 years from now it's pretty much gone you know I mean if you look at the the the great buildings that make up all the metropolis metropolitan areas now of the world most of them are steel frame structures and they're you know clothed in in a skin that that will keep the elements out maybe for a half a century but without maintenance I mean you know that the the Golden Gate Bridge up in San Francisco is constantly ongoing undergoing maintenance because if you stop maintaining it the media it starts decaying immediately it starts rusting and interesting if you think about if if we suddenly if humans left the planet ten thousand years from now you know some some interstellar anthropologists arrived what would they see that would indicate that we had been here what do you think would still be left after ten thousand years there's actually two things that they named in this particular program I bet you can guess one of them out Rushmore Mount Rushmore good good guess yes that's one of them and of course the Great Pyramid right the other one and that's it you know everything else is gone Wow now when you when you now begin to factor in the thing that I've been basically working with is the idea that we have these intermittent I call them nonlinearities discontinuities within the normal orderly progression of things the catastrophes if you will superimpose a few of those in the process and basically five thousand ten thousand years from now you're not going to find much to show that we had been here that's incredible and when you see structures like gobekli tepe which is within the last couple decades been on earth in in Turkey which is really thrown giant monkey wrench into the timeline of the hunter-gatherer transition into the modern agricultural city we're we're in a weird state because people are starting to dig up these things and gobekli tepe was a completely unknown structure until this one farmer or herder had found a stone and started unearthing it and then realized it was these huge stone pillars of an unknown civilization carved with three-dimensional shapes of these animals some of them were aren't even native to the area so it's incredibly confusing and purposely covered up 14 to twelve to fourteen thousand years ago which means that who knows how long it was there before it could have been several thousand years old when they decided to cover it up but it was purposely filled in an enormous area purposely filled in somewhere around twelve thousand years could it have been purposely covered up in order to protect it and preserve it could be right that we were hoping what they were hoping rather that someone like us would come along not honestly definitely not me maybe you but we come along and uncover it and then go whoa what's what's this all about like maybe they knew that there were going to be moments in time where these things happen these impacts these asteroid impacts and that there needed to be some sort of a way of keeping track or some sort of a way of preserving well that that would probably be one way of preserving it for sure and the other thing would be is just like you mentioned you mentioned we the two things Mount Rushmore and the Great Pyramid of course are both built of stone which is obviously much more durable than steel or you know the fabricated materials that we're making today even plastics even plastics are going to degrade over a few millennium but if you want to preserve something for millennia make it out of stone and make it monumental and you know we're looking at it's something like you just made an interesting point about it could have how much pre vyas to the to the burial had it actually been there and you know it's difficult to date stone the way you would dates known is you know you can use various some Oh Cosmo genic ways where when you expose stone to atmosphere it's going to accumulate cosmic rays which cause changes within the stone that can actually be measured but if it's buried it's not going to be subject to cosmic rays so that you can't date it that way which you'd probably have to do is date find some organic material within the soil matrix or matrix of material around it and date that material but even there see that's not going to tell that's only going to give you a minimum date so in other words the structure is there for who knows how long they decide to bury it and they bring in the material and bury it and if some organic material is in that soil it's not necessarily going to be indicative of the age of the stone structure itself it's going to be indicative of the time at which it was buried and how did they determine that it was buried at 12,000 years ago was it the uniformity of the depth of I would assume now I I haven't made a study of gobekli tepe yet I'm hoping that when I get a chance to hang out with Graham Hancock I'm gonna get filled in on all the details of that mm I don't know specifically about that other you know Manya I do suspect that you know ganang Padang is probably very old it's in Indonesia a lot of the monumental stonework that we find like it bailed back where you have these monstrous megaliths probably go back to Pleistocene times and when I say Pleistocene I'm talking about the period from like ten thousand years back to about two and a half million years ago the time during which there has been this succession of glacial ages and interglacial ages hmm and you know you mentioned the term Holocene we talked about that Holocene is essentially the modern geological epoch we've been in this policy epoch for generally they say ten thousand years in rough numbers although it's becoming much more precisely dated now you'll find a lot of references in the scientific literature that says gives the date eleven point six or eleven thousand six hundred years as being the onset of the Holocene which is an interesting date for me because I know if you have ever read Plato and his accounts of Atlantis there's two of his dialogues courteous and Timaeus in which he describes Atlantis and he gives the dating in there at least on three separate occasions and he always places that you know there's this whole success the whole lineage of the story goes back to soul on who was a historical character an authenticated historical character who lived at about 600 BC and he was a lawgiver and poet in Athens and due to political pressures and stuff he went into a 10-year exile and during that ten-year exile he went to Egypt and it was there that he presumably would heard the tale of Atlantis from elderly Egyptian priests and he was told and came back and then told the story to his grants who told it again to to several individuals before it actually got to Socrates and then Plato who presumably wrote it down but what it's interesting is that in in Plato's account he gives the dating for the demise of Atlantis as 9,000 years prior to so longe exile to Egypt well given that that took place in give or take a decade or two 600 BC we go back that's 2600 years ago okay add that to the 9,000 years and we've got eleven thousand six hundred years ago now according to Plato's account he says that it was shortly after this great war between the Atlanteans and the proto Athenians that there was this tremendous cataclysm and Atlantis sunk beneath the waves so he's giving that date at eleven thousand six hundred years ago we now know from the scientific record that at eleven thousand six hundred years ago there was a major climate transition and there was a catastrophic warming spike that was associated with a mega scale meltdown event of the great ice sheets that were covering North America it was this event at eleven thousand six hundred essentially jerked the planet out of the the depths of this Ice Age that it had been in for thousands and thousands of years with that melting you had a rapid rise of sea level so it's very interesting that the date that he gives is precisely now the date that that the scientists are giving for this transition from what's called the Younger Dryas I think Graham has mentioned that in in some of your interviews with him that the younger driest which was this climate spasm that ended the last ice age so if we look at the chronology of events around 26,000 years ago we were in the latter phases of a what appears to have been an interglacial period not too much different from what we're in now around 26,000 years ago the climate rapidly degenerated and these massive glaciers had expanded during this what they called the final phase or the late Wisconsin they refer to it because initially they were looking for this evidence in the state of Wisconsin so they they named that this last final phase the latest onsen so around 26,000 years ago we see the the launching of this final phase of the Ice Age the late was concen then at around 13,000 years ago as the dates are now giving it there was this enormous spasm of warming and this seemed to be associated with rapid melting and the first real rapid sea level rise okay what happened is after a very short interval of time the climate snapped back into the full depths of glacial cold now what had happened was if you go back 18,000 years ago this was the coldest part of the ice age I mean this was bitterly cold period of time where I live in in Georgia was the forests that grew there were like the forests you find in Canada now you had tundra up in Northern Kentucky in southern Idaho tundra in southern southern Ohio excuse me so it was a really really different climate and once you got to northern Ohio in the northern United States where New York City is Chicago the Great Lakes the Dakotas all of that was under this massive ice sheet thousands of feet thick when you go up into Canada over Canada the ice sheet was up to two miles thick I mean think about that two miles thick of ice and it reached from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and from the northern United States as far south as the 45th parallel all the way up to the Arctic Circle now that is a drastically different world bear in mind to that with that much ice piled up on the surface of the land sea levels which contributed the water that formed that ice had to go down and it's now well-documented that sea levels during the depth of the ice age were at least 400 feet lower than now which which means that the continental shelves of the planet were basic we exposed now where I live in Georgia if you go out and stand right now on the beach like a Cumberland Island which is beautiful wilderness preserve you stand there on the beach if you were suddenly transported back to the depths of the Ice Age you'd be in the middle of a boreal forest meaning a northern forest with spruce trees large trees alder trees the kind of trees you find now in the northern United States Canada of that area and the beach wouldn't have been anywhere anywhere close it would've been another fifty seventy five hundred miles further to the east because as the sea level drops what happens it recedes right and so when this final phase of the Ice Age came on sea levels begin to drop and so what it did was it exposed all of these shallow marine ecology that that rimmed all of the continents to the atmosphere and basically would have caused enormous ecological havoc well then within a millennia or so the forests had had expanded and had now grown out so now off the eastern seaboard of the United States they constantly will find the remains of tree stumps and forests that had been growing there fourteen fifteen sixteen thousand years ago now the ice begins to melt sea level begins to rise now it's important to realize that if we look at the way modern civilization has evolved what do we see is where did the first city show up don't aren't they mostly trading cities that show up their port cities they show up along the confluence of rivers they show up where rivers meet the oceans they show up on on the coastlines okay so if you had major cities during the Ice Age and as Graham has pointed out there are now four hundred feet underwater Wow so you begin to appreciate when you begin to really look at the history of our planet what you realize is that it's been just almost unimaginably dynamic this an alteration from a from a interglacial to a glacial age is an extreme process and so I guess the upshot of it is is that you know when we look now at the the climate record that we have in hand now which has been pretty much reconstructed with a fair amount of accuracy back to about 400,000 years and these are primarily based on ice cores extracted from Greenland extracted from Antarctica extracted from mountain glaciers and and most mostly mostly Antarctic and Greenland know when you pull out that ice core it's layered you think think of cutting down a tree and looking at the annual layers where you can actually count the number of layers in a in a cross section of a tree log and you'll know how old it is right well it's very similar in in an ice core you've got layers annual layers because each year there's snow that falls it gets compressed into fern f ir n which is the transitional phase between snow and glacial ice and it eventually gets compressed into glacial ice and when you look at a cross-section of the ice core you'll see these fine layers in there right so they can go back and they can look at these layers they can count the layers and there's a lot of things going on in these layers oxygen isotopes are a critical one for ascertaining climate changes because oxygen isotopes are a function of temperature and we have a graph here we'll pull up in a minute we can actually look at that but what we see is that the climate is constantly isolated back and forth and when we look at the Holocene going back 10,000 years and then we take that comparatively and we go back 250 to 400 thousand years we can now begin to reconstruct these intervals of glacial periods interglacial and here's the thing that should be sobering to everybody on the planet today as we think about climate change and all of this because obviously it's constantly in the news and all the longest interglacial period now on record for at least the last quarter million years the longest one the longest unbroken period of interglacial warmth is the Holocene the one we're in now we've already exceeded by several millennia the longest previous period of interglacial warmth I don't hear them talking about that I don't hear al gore talking about that I don't hear anybody talking about that in mainstream media but it's hard scientific fact yeah we would be shitting our pants way more if it was a global cooling than if it was a global warming let me tell Rhonda we're gonna pull up another graph we'll pull up a graph in a minute which shows you that even within the last couple of thousand years periods of global cooling have not been pleasant times periods of global warming is when we see human population expanding when we see cultural advancement when we see lifespans increasing when we see infant mortality decreasing periods of global cooling are when we see populations going into decline when we see lifespans diminishing you know we had a period of global cooling that began between 536 and 540 ad it was this period of global cooling that launched what we know of the dark ages and this has now been well documented by dendrochronologist Mike Bailey is one of the the leaders of this who's been looking at the climate changes of the last couple thousand years as preserved in the tree-ring record between 536 in about 544 ad we find that forest growth in the northern hemisphere almost came to a stop and one of the consequences of that was this it was associated with a global cooling and for multiple years running there were agricultural collapses where because of the cold and the damp that came on with this you know the historical record it's interesting because you read some of these accounts that were preserved from that period they talk about weeks at a time where they couldn't see the Sun they talk about when it did show up it was just a feeble imitation of itself they talk about you know years with no summer basically so what you had was succession of crop failures that led to people becoming malnourished once they became malnourished their immune systems became weakened and in 542 ad about six years after this well documented transition occurred we had the onset to the Justinian plague which wiped out 1/3 the population of Europe and it took 300 years to recover from that and it didn't we didn't recover from it until the climate shifted again and we went into what's known as the Medieval Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period was the time when the Scandinavians were farming on the west coast of Greenland were now it's perennial e frozen and for about the next couple of hundred years the climate was according to some researchers and some scientists as much as two degrees warmer than now and you think it had to have been warmer if if they were farming in Greenland where it is now frozen ground it had to have been warmer and one of the things that happened with was with this warming you had an expansion of the the growing season and you also had the the latitude belt at which viable farming agriculture could be practice shifted three to four hundred miles north of where it had been which meant that for the first time England actually had a flourishing wine industry which didn't exist previously and it has only existed until recent times because of genetically modified crops is now allowing them to grow grapes where they haven't been able to grow wine grapes until we go back to the Medieval Warm Period so what happened was now there was a lot of food for people to eat right people got healthier human population began to increase right we've been to accumulate wealth we begin to to carry on commerce and trade after this 300 years of dark ages we're learning receded into the into the monasteries and life was very unpleasant very short very brutal very unpleasant now we had this warming period okay with the growth with the expansion of agriculture and the abundant food supply and the the prolific harvests people were getting strong healthy again statured and it's been well documented that during this two or three hundred years of the medieval warming period humans stature actually increased by inches average human size okay by 1150 this accumulated wealth that had ensued from the the benign climate of the Medieval Warm Period is what allowed the the great Cathedral building era to ensue which began between 11:30 and 1150 ad and what we see is these magnificent cathedrals have you been to Europe and visit in any other cthey put that on your to-do list yeah get there and look at some of these extraordinary works of art that were built during the high gothic or high middle ages between like I said about 1150 and the early 1300s they built 80 about 80 of these gigantic magnificent cathedrals that required the the organizing of thousands of highly highly skilled craftsmen armies of workers and craftsmen um you had stonemasons and carpenters and glaciers and astronomers and geometrician Xand and all of these people brought together to create these incredible cathedrals and it was made possible by the fact that European society had become relatively wealthy and this wealth was brought on by this global warmth right now what we see go ahead to the to the beginning to the end of this magnificent Gothic building boom and and by the way there's about 500 smaller Abbey's that were constructed during this interval this was a very prolific time for a number of reasons this was the time that you had the Templar knights forming you've probably heard of that the Templar knights I'm sure you had schools of Kabbalah being founded in Spain and and you had the rise of Cather ISM you had the troubadours you had these amazing spiritual things going on amazing culturally it was a very extraordinary time those high Middle Ages well a lot of those Gothic cathedrals were never finished and what we see is that some of them have the appearance you know I'm a builder by profession and you know it's it's I've looked at some of these and but it's very much like as they're going along building and then all of a sudden one day nobody shows up to work and there's still tools laying around there's still materials that are often a pile that we're waiting to be incorporated into the structure and what happened was that the climate began to cool again between 13 15 and 13 20% of this tremendous Gothic building boom is when the climate began to cool and it cool for the next several decades and what we then see as a repeat of what happened between 536 and 542 ad agricultural collapses crops rotting in the fields people going hungry between I think was around between 1340 and 1345 the onset of the Black Plague and once again the population of Europe was decimated and it took a hundred and fifty years basically to recover from that and what we see is that what what what was happening is the planet was shifting into what's called the Little Ice Age well you've probably heard that term the Little Ice Age right there was two phases to the Little Ice Age and the first phase began like I said around 1320 lat said about a hundred and fifty years and then there was a break and it was during that break that warm period that basically the Renaissance kicked in and we began to really move forward the second phase of the Little Ice Age came in during the 1600s and it was actually even colder than the first phase and worldwide glaciers expanded to the largest they had been in 10,000 to 12,000 years since the end of the big Ice Age throughout the whole Holocene glaciers had been smaller now during the big ice the Little Ice Age they grew and they grew to the biggest that they've been in 10,000 years it's important to have that context of understanding when we talk about glacier recession because the glaciers begin to recede around the middle of the 19th century worldwide as the Little Ice Age begin to wane and glow warmth warmth begin to return to the planet this happened in the mid 1800s around 1840 to 1860 we see the Little Ice Age coming to an end and at that point the glaciers worldwide began to recede they began to contract they've been pretty much contracting uniformly since then so when we're talking about glacier recession it's important to understand that the glacier recession really began a century and a half ago or more and has basically consider continued more or less uniformly since then with no real change with the advent of human fossil fuel to the atmosphere human carbon dioxide which began really in earnest during the Second World War is when when we begin to add significant amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere it's important to realize that the glaciers had been receding almost a full century before that point so when you see all this modern hysteria about global warming and the human created global warming that we keep hearing about in the news and that our influence on the atmosphere does it drive you crazy I mean do you think it's silly we obviously human beings are contributing to the carbon footprint right obviously obviously yes and obviously that has an effect on global warming yes yes but you gotta bear in mind the carbon dioxide it's only one variable in a very complex equation right there are many factors influencing climate of which carbon dioxide is only one my problem with so much of the the stuff that's coming out in mainstream media which is coming through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is simply that when when they were instituted back in the early 90s by the United Nations the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change basically gave them a mandate which is demonstrate that humans are causing climate change right so they focused exclusively on carbon dioxide but there's all kinds of other things going on for example cosmic rays are constantly bombarding the earth right cosmic rays produce clouds the more of the cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere the more low altitude cloud cover there is low altitude clouds reflect heat back into space now the amount of cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere is a function of a couple of things you've got the heliosphere which is the whole essentially the the the the energy envelope of the Sun which encompasses the whole solar system the Sun actually is fairly variable and what that means is that when the solar wind is in more intense phase like when when the sunspots for example are very active the solar wind is is much stronger what that does is it serves as a buffer that prevents cosmic rays from penetrating the atmosphere of the earth as as strongly as they did previously also the geomagnetic field of the earth acts as a buffer so here's two things that are completely not included in the scenarios of the IPCC but probably have a very profound effect on global climate the Earth's geomagnetic field is you know probably know that the geomagnetic field has periodically throughout Earth history disappeared completely sometimes it's it's disappeared and come back with reverse polarity well that geomagnetic field acts as a buffer which helps to reduce the amount of cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere as it disappeared completely I don't know and I don't know if really anybody knows I haven't kept up with all of the most recent research what's geomagnetism but you know when you've gotten you hold a little compass in your hand and it points to North right right okay that's the geomagnetic field that's being measured by the compass it's moving it's fluctuating and for whatever reason throughout the history of the earth it has completely disappeared at some points and his reverse polarity it's it was the the reversing of the polarity of the geomagnetic field that helped prove the reality of continental drift because as the the mid-atlantic ridge separates and and and lava flows out it crystallizes and locked into the crystalline structure of the of the lava is the direction of the magnetic field and the polarity of the magnetic field is imprinted in there if you look at the research going back to the 1950s they realized that you had stripes affect effectively as you moved away from the mid-atlantic ridge as the as the lava flowed out and crystallized locked in the geomagnetic field they looked at it and they could see that there were times when it had completely reversed itself and so this was like very powerful evidence that the theory of continental drift was right that the Atlantic Ocean had been spreading and in getting back to this whole atlantis thing which is interesting to me is because when you look at at REE Plato's account he describes Atlantis as being west of the pillars of Herakles which of course is the Straits of Gibraltar the mouth of the Mediterranean he describes how if you go you come to some islands then you come to some more islands and that was the the island complex of Atlantis and beyond that was another cold continent he describes that right if you look in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean you've got the Azores Plateau which is now a couple of thousand feet under the sea the Azore islands are the tops of mountains that that emerge from the surface of the ocean right and they sit right on the Atlantic the mid-atlantic ridge now the mid-atlantic ridge some of the thinnest crusts on the planet right and it's it's like a giant suture or a giant crack that runs up halfway around the planet well when you have an ice age and you start piling ice up onto like the North American continent what happens is the weight of that ice begins to crush the the crust of the earth down in to the mantel it's called isostasy which is a vertical movement you know continental drift is horizontal isostasy is vertical now it's just like right now you're sitting on that soft chair right and your ass is creating a depression in the cushion of the chair right that's isostatic depression you didn't realize that did you know that your ass is creating isostatic depression right and when you get up and you walk away then you will have isostatic compensation you'll have isostatic rebound because the cushion will now rise because the weight has been removed it's the same thing with the ice mass on the continent the ice mass was hundreds of billions of trillions of tons of ice it pressed the center of the North American continent or the center of at least Canada down perhaps as much as several thousand feet into the mantle with the removal of that ice the land begins to rebound Hudson Bay is the depression left over from the thickest part of the ice right now our photographs we could probably even pull some up here in a minute there are photographs taken where you can see the elevated shoreline surrounding Hudson Bay because it's still rising right what's interesting too is if you look at the the the distance between these shorelines you'll see that early on there's a greater distance because the land was rising faster as the millennia have have gone on the distance separating each shoreline has diminished but now you have to think that all of that weight is being transferred back into the ocean basins a lot of it was dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean either via like the st. Lawrence River up there the Hudson River up in the New York area or via the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico now you've got all this water dumping back into the ocean like I said ocean levels are coming up hundreds of feet right so now you're adding all of this weight to the ocean basin and now you've got the mid-atlantic ridge which is some of the thinnest crust on the earth right this is what it's doing it's like a hinge line right so now you picture during a glacial age when the weight is taken out it does this lifts up lifts up listening not watching yeah when the ice melts the water goes in sea level rises it subsides right now you look at the Azores Plateau is a chunk of the African plate that got left over when the continents separated around 70 to 80 million years ago right if we you've seen the maps in the showing how you can fit the contents together yeah if you fit these back together if you if you reverse continental drift go back about 70 or 80 million years and it's all fits together like a piece of the puzzle but when it's separated a piece of the of the African plate got left behind and this is what is the Azores Plateau and it sits right there astride the mid-atlantic ridge it's maybe a little bit smaller than the Maya then Iceland which is considered to be an island but of a pretty good sized island right now if you're doing this and you have as much as two or three thousand feet or maybe more of this vertical movement right and you add to that to four hundred feet of sea level rise now you can I think begin to get a scientific rationale for how you may have had a large island in the mid-atlantic back during the Ice Age also additional evidence have suggested that the Gulf Stream which now basically brings subtropical warmth up to northwestern Europe I mean if you were to terminate the Gulf Stream England would would have some pretty pretty malignant times so in northwestern Europe because the warmth is being brought up by that Gulf Stream right well during the Ice Age of the Gulf Stream diverted to the south at about 45 to 46 degrees which was hundreds of miles farther south than it now goes so essentially if you look at the Azores plateau a big chunk of that Azores Plateau would have been above sea level during the Ice Age and that Gulf Stream with its warmth would have just basically embraced at sea if you suddenly Joe found yourself transported mysteriously back to the Ice Age that's probably where you might want to go is the Azores Plateau it might have been of one of the most benign places on earth to live during the Ice Age and if there was a place where civilization could evolve that would be a very logical place for it to occur there's nothing really pseudo-scientific now about assuming that there could have been some type of historic reality behind these stories of Atlantis of course the problem is is the woowoo factor that has gotten so grafted on to these stories but you know crystals and aliens and flying ships and I mean we don't know but you know we don't have any hard evidence but the hard evidence does suggest that there could have been some very benign habitable islands large islands in the Mid Atlantic during the Ice Age wow so that's intense that's so incredible it so it's it's it's so crazy to think how how much things have changed while human beings have been here the idea that during gobekli tepe which is 12,000 years ago that north america was covered with ice and they this was when these people in Turkey had created this incredible structure so when you see this the the modern hysteria about global warming which has really essentially been like a wrestling match between the left and the right it's this weird thing where the right wants to support like burning coal and they don't want to diminish the economy by putting all these environmental regulations on Natural Resources and then the the left which is screaming at the top of their lungs that the sky is following the oceans are gonna rise and people are gonna drown when you when you know so much about what has happened over the course of the earth when you've studied this for a great deal of time like you have what is your take on all this stuff well I guess my take is is is fairly simple I I tend to think that you know if you know if you look at the the the whole process of if you look at the carbon cycle for example what what you see there is interesting we have to I can talk to this into this as much as possible yeah have as little variation in the tone as possible thank you you know putting this into context we have to say right now we're approaching 400 parts per million of the ambient amount of co2 in the atmosphere at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution it was about a hundred parts per million less it's you could say basically that over the last century we have increased the amount of co2 measurable co2 into the atmosphere assuming that it's all from us now I mean there's questions about that too because if there are other factors inducing global warming such as changes in solar irradiance the amount of insulation penetrating the atmosphere and so on it means that the oceans are warming as a result of that okay oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide sink when they're warm they exude carbon dioxide when they're cold they absorb it right so if you have a natural warming it's going to expel some carbon dioxide so it's not even clear necessarily that that 100 parts per million is totally the result of fossil fuel burning but for the sake of argument let's say that it is okay a hundred parts per million that's minuscule trace of this very important constituents of our atmosphere you know that carbon dioxide is what fuels photosynthesis right and if you start reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and you start once you start dropping below 200 parts per million and you get down to about 150 to 100 photosynthesis plant food of synthesis starts shutting down I mean it's kind of like the amount of co2 in the atmosphere right now is at the very bottom of the scale you know if we look at history going back when you mentioned the cretaceous-tertiary when the dinosaurs ruled there have been many times more the the amount of co2 up to well in excess of a thousand parts per million several thousand parts per million in the atmosphere but if we have increased the amount of co2 by 100 parts per million in a hundred years it means we've for every million molecules of air up there we add one molecule of co2 every year or two maybe try to make it a little bit more comprehensible if for every hundred thousand molecules of air up there every 10 years we add one molecule of co2 I'm not convinced that that's going to lead to global catastrophe I mean think of it this way you got a huge tank with a hundred thousand fish in it every 10 years you're throwing one more fish are you even going to notice that you know I think that what's happened is that co2 like I said is one variable in a very complex equation but all of the other variables as far as the the government-funded research goes have been excluded from the debate and what does Bayes me is that we're told that all scientists agree on this no all scientists don't agree when you have though a major government funded program like climate change research which is funded to the tune of about two billion dollars per year you're gonna have a large vested interest in basically I mean if these guys came out and said nah co2 is really not a big deal it's perhaps fueling plant growth and this is an interesting aside you know if you look at the the projections of forests and inventory back in the 50s and 60s based upon deforestation as a result of timber as a result of agriculture the projections that at how quickly forest inventories were going to rebound if you look at those projections back in the 50s and 60s and then you realize that in the ensuing period of time we've now got exhaustive highly accurate satellite surveys that can actually count the number of hectares of forests what's interesting is in the 90s when they really started looking at this date of just how much forest there was compared to what the Texans were there was like 25 to 40% more forests worldwide than anybody had predicted what fueled this prolific forest growth well it's very likely that at least part of it was because of the slight increase in co2 there's a result as a result of our fossil fuel burning now we put in every year we burn about introduced into the atmosphere about 6 billion tons of co2 well there's about 750 or 760 billion tons of co2 in the atmosphere naturally and at least a third of that is cycling through from from atmosphere into the biosphere into the oceans and so on so our contribution isn't really that significant but another part of the the argument is that and this has been admitted right in the IPCC reports is that based on the amount of fossil fuel that we're burning there should be twice as much co2 into the atmosphere in the atmosphere as we're now measuring so what they have been talking about for about 15 years now is where is the missing carbon what's this missing carbon sink well probably some of what's going into the ocean but most likely a lot of it is going into fueling plant growth and forest growth worldwide and there's a lot of studies that are beginning to come out now that shows that perhaps some of the desert areas of the planet rather than expanding are actually contracting so you know at this point there's a lot of things we still have to learn when it comes down to understanding the climate we're in the infancy you you can't talk to a single climatologist and come up with a one single coherent answer or agreement on what has actually provoked the planet to go into a full ice age or what has caused it to come out of an ice age if you don't have if you don't know that we still have a hell of a lot to learn about how the climate works so I get really frustrated when I hear this claim that the debate is over the debate is over because the debate hasn't really even begun yet you see we need to really look at all of these other factors as well I mean when you look at wind currents and ocean currents you have the the El Nino Southern Oscillation you have the the the Indian Ocean dipole you have the Pacific decadal oscillation all of these things have a very profound influence on the climate but they're essentially being ignored within the within the government funded science to a large extent and you have a lot of scientists who have objected to some of the claims of certainty made by the IPCC scientists and for the most part the left likes to demonize them this is people like oh I think probably the the leading demon of climate deniers is Fred singer because he once was given an a ten thousand dollar unsolicited donation from Exxon years and years ago but you've got guys like Roy Spencer and Craig and Sherwood did so and Robert balling and Timothy ball and and and the list goes on and on these are distinguished climate scientists that have devoted their lives to understanding climate science who say well there's a lot of flaws in the methodology of the IPCC but by saying that now they have entered the the spawn of hell hmm according to the left now in your right see what happened it's turned into a political football it's an idol on ideological debate it's an ideological debate a political debate and it's just too bad that the science of the thing has into suffering the consequence it is it is fascinating because even hearing you say this I'm thinking like it starts popping triggers like I'm not the type of person that worries too much about being labeled because I've been labeled a million times already as an idiot it does it doesn't bother me to start contemplating the possibilities of controversial ideas but when I'm listening to you saying this all I'm hearing is the knee-jerk reaction of climate denier climate to always a climate denier this guy's a climate denier and seeing these fucking things that we've grown to be accustomed to on television where you have a guy on the left who has one point of view and a guy on the right who says something wacky and then everybody fights about it and you know and then the YouTube clips you look at the comments and it's filled with this guy's a faggot and that guy's this this guy eat shit I hope your house goes underwater you fucking climate denied it says and when I'm listening to you and I mean this podcast has been over an hour already and it's incredibly complex we have barely scratched the surface and you're never going to hear anything like this on any television show because most people feel that the general public does not have the attention span to absorb all of this information is really complex explanation of the known science of the changing of the atmosphere of the earth so when people start talking about climate denying and you know what what is going on with climate change what they're really doing is establishing their position on what side I am the side of I'm a rational person who believes in science and education but how much of this have you actually explored how much of it has anybody actually looked at well I'm a person who supports industry and I'm a person who believes the United States needs to recover from our economic disaster and you know if we got a frack a few wells you know so be it you know there's these two very distinct and oftentimes shallow ideological perspectives and when I say shallow I mean shallow from the point of the general public person like me who's not a scientist observing it and just picking aside with very little information really and you talk to I would like to grab the average person the average lefty and the average righty that thinks that they're you know they have an opinion on global change and just just do me a favor and just write down what you know just write down I don't want you looking online do you have an opinion write down what you know do you know dogshit most people know dogshit it's true it's true Joe it's so fascinating it's so fascinating to me because it becomes another one of those things ideology is that I mean I I don't remember who said it but it's it's the enemy of free thinking mm-hmm you you get in these ideological clusters and then anything outside of this thing these predetermined patterns of behavior that you've to subscribe to anything becomes forbidden it becomes you can't even entertain it you can't even approach the idea you see it with everything you see with atheism you see it with you see it with any isms with feminism with the men's rights you see it with with people who subscribe to the right people subscribe to the left any variables that don't fit into their equation that they've already subscribed to they don't want to be labeled as that other side and any time they don't want to be labeled they start ignoring any evidence or any ideas that don't fit within this really rigid description that's exactly right I mean that is you hit the nail on the head just weird exactly right people where people get locked into these ideological paradigms and then from that point on basically their perspective is modified more by emotion and rationality more by you know their feelings rather than real information and and it's too bad I mean I know what to blame it on maybe the fact that the government runs all the schools I don't know you know the government monopolizes the education system so they're not teaching people critical thinking skills they're not teaching people how to actually become how to be scientifically literate which is really sad but you know we it's it's like you know you you keep hearing the term climate change denier right well there's no such thing I don't think you're gonna find a single climate scientist of any persuasion that denies that the climate is changing and you got to realize that the the terminology has shifted it was global warming originally when when James Hansen gave his testimony before Congress in the summer of 1988 you know and proposed these potential tipping points and catastrophic outcomes of our burning of fossil fuel we've gone from there to the United Nations getting involved in the United Nations setting up the whole the IPCC and channeling all of this funding to it and I think the consequence is is that you know when you say again excuse me we went from global warming to climate change why did they not really use global warming as a term anymore it's mainly because for 15 years the average global temperature is flatlined and this is based upon you know the most accurate like satellite surveys the IPCC generally focuses only on ground-based sensors which are subjected to a perhaps some considerable bias because you know you picture a ground-based sensors most of them are sitting at airports when these things were being put in post-world War two the bulk of them 40s and 50s into the 60s many of these airports were rural they were you know adjacent to small towns they were surrounded by fields and farms for us what's happened is the urban area has encroached you know every when you when you create streets pavement buildings all of this absorbs heat right and and no one has really done an exhaustive study of the potential bias that's introduced into the ground-based sensors that part at least part of the warming of these ground-based sensors may have nothing to do with carbon dioxide at all it may just have to do with the fact that they're sitting next to a huge parking lot you see and I mean you know yourself if you walk out you know if you're walking in a field and then you walk onto a asphalt parking lot immediately it's it's much much hotter mmm you see Anthony watts was another one of the dissenters that was demonized is the only one who has really attempted to exhaustively document the accuracy of the ground-based sensors and what he's come up with is that perhaps as much as as 30 to 50 percent of the perceived warming of the last century which is about eight tenths a degree centigrade is probably as a result of that bias that sintra been introduced by what's called the urban heat island effect and all of the majors say la has a urban heat island mitigation program underway all the major metropolitan cities are now trying to mitigate the effects of this heat because of all of the cement and the buildings and the pavement and parking lots they're always hotter than the surrounding rural areas so the question has been legitimately raised how much of a bias has been introduced into the into the ground-based sensors well when we turn to the balloon sensors the radiosonde balloon sensors in the satellite sensors basically what they're showing is that the average global temperature has been flat for 15 years well because of that and in many of the key scientists like Phil Jones of the IPCC has basically publicly admitted yeah the when you look at the the every temperature from that perspective it hasn't warmed in 15 yeah now there are regional pockets of warming and you know records being set all the time because local conditions will affect change enormous ly just like I was talking about the urban heat island effect is is a local or regional condition but because of the fact that the climate hasn't warmed statistically significantly in 15 years now we don't talk about global warming we talked about climate change but those two terms are not interchangeable global warming is a very specific model of climate change which is that you've got this 15 micron wavelength of co2 in the atmosphere that's trapping infrared radiation emanating from the earth right okay but if you're talking about climate change now suddenly you know our umbrella goes much much huger and it now encompasses all of these other things that I was talking about and and to question the consensus ideas to consent to question that co2 is the primary or sole driver of climate is not to be a climate change denier Essie because no I would challenge anybody he even uses that term well show me an example of any climate scientists no matter where they fall in the argument that is denying that the climate is changing I mean anybody who has studied the climate all knows that it has changed dramatically and dynamically on any scale you can look at whether it's the decadal scale the Centennial or millennial or beyond it changes on every level and that's the thing we have to recognize that if we stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow we didn't drive another car we didn't we shut down all the coal plants I'm going to tell you this the climate would not stop changing when you see a story like here's one it's in the news about US Senator Marco Rubio's denial of manmade climate change should play well with his tea party base whose support he'll need if he indeed runs for president in 2016 but in taking this position Florida's junior Republican senator ignores the vast majority of the world's climate scientists who say human activity is contributing to climate change and rising sea levels human activity is contributing to climate change no doubt there's no doubt that human activity contributes to climate change human activity again is one variable in a very complex equation I wish Mark Marco Rubio would keep his mouth shut until he goes and spends about six months or a year really doing the homework because then he could talk a little bit more intelligently about it but that is the problem right it really does take that long it does like he I know you I've wanted I meet you at six seven years ago something like that yeah and you had already spent decades observing the effects of climate change and of asteroid Olymp acts and the history of these things I mean the amount of time just absorbing the information so you can rattle it off like this in a podcast I mean what the fuck got you into this like the how did you get down this rabbit hole well this is an odd rabbit hole right it's an odd rabbit hole it's a fascinating rabbit hole I'm so thankful not only that you've gone down but that you're willing to exchange this information with us or imparted on us because it's it's a very different perspective because I know you're not a right-wing lunatic you're a very science-based guy but you're you're looking at this and the way you're explaining it is incredibly rational and incredibly frustrating to me that there's not that many people that are that are that are saying this well the upside I think of the whole global warming issue or the climate change issue is this that if you know the thing is is I made the point that even if we stopped all fossil fuel consumption tomorrow the climate is still going to change and it's going to change dramatically it's going to change sometimes even catastrophic ly what we need to do from here on out is basically think about strategies of adaptability if as a result of this whole issue even even though I think it's miss based miss you know miss applied if part of it that comes out of this is that we begin to develop strategies of adaptability that would be a good thing if however we focus so exclusively on carbon dioxide to the exclusion of everything else that could be a bad thing because the climate is going to change no matter what we do or where we go with it the climate is going to change so you can put up solar panels until the cows come home the houses that are on the beach in Malibu are still gonna be underwater in a hundred years well not necessarily know I'm Sarah Lee so buy real estate in Malibu well see the thing is if you look at the I mentioned earlier that there was a break in the in the Little Ice Age of about 150 years that basically led to the Renaissance right well we've been in a recession of the Little Ice Age an interruption of the Little Ice Age for about 150 years and right now you know and again the IPC one of the things that frustrates me is that they basically exclude solar physicists and solar scientists are essentially saying that insulation levels insulation the amount of solar energy penetrating the atmosphere is that one of the lowest levels in in thousands of years and I mean there are our solar physicists that are saying you know what we could be at the beginning of another phase of the Little Ice Age now if our co2 is helping to ameliorate somewhat a return to little little ice age that would be a good thing so muscle cars are green yeah that's what I'm getting out of this coal and muscle cars are good for the forest well the property the problem with coal is not so much the co2 is to me it's just the particulate matter right you know that's a different question altogether the pollution the pollution which is horrific in China when they have coal plants is you see these people that are essentially walking it looks like they're in the middle of a forest fire they're walking those yeah it's just dark everywhere that's a different issue right no and and and I'm I consider myself a conservationist in the respect that we we basically need examples of un-- pristine nature because ultimately nature is the most powerful teacher and we need examples we need places where nature is just left alone to do its thing without interference of human beings we need clean air nobody has the right to dump shit in the air that other people have to breathe nobody has the right to dump shit in the water that other people have to drink to me those are different questions and really where the more of our focus should be rather than these abstractions I have found of course I've gotten some flak over the last few years by saying some of the things I've been saying here you know that I've had people stand up and accuse me of you know you just you say we can just do anything we want we can just destroy the earth which of course is not the case and not saying that at all not saying that at all and when we begin to look at the bigger context of this thing and we begin to understand that the extraordinary changes that this planet has been through and even to some of the lesser things in recent years Mount st. Helens you remember when that erupted in 1980 tens of thousands of acres were turned into a lunar landscape right well if you read the accounts of the scientists the biologists the zoologists the ecologists that have been studying what happened to that decimated landscape in the aftermath what you find out is they're surprised and almost shocked at how quickly nature recovered from that and how quickly you know colonizer plants moved in and was followed by a whole the whole succession ecological succession of reclaiming that land if you look at the the Exxon Valdez disaster up in Alaska in Alaska in that was over the short term devastating to the local ecology and yet what's interesting again there have been several books written by some of the lead scientists involved in that talking about how remarkably quick nature begin to reclaim and recover from that and here's some irony where the government forced Exxon to go in and do its cleanup has actually suffered more than the areas that were just left alone for nature to reclaim that's fascinating so the chemicals that they used in order to break up yeah that was what the issue with the Gulf as yeah right with those dispersants that they were spraying over the area they probably should have just left the Gulf alone because you know when you have submarine earthquakes they can expel huge amounts of hydrocarbons into the ocean Nature has been dealing with the massive expulsion of hydrocarbon into the oceans and into the marine ecology for for millions and millions of years you know it was bad but I think you know what we'll see is that the recovery time has been consider than most people believed possible you see I think what's what's really gonna turn out in the end looking at all this is that nature is robust and when we begin to look at the number of times that nature has been disrupted by we've been talking about asked and comets and here's here's a perspective for you you know at the peak of the Cold War when US and the Soviet Union were eyeball to eyeball with our nuclear weapons on on high alert and we had we had 10,000 weapons on our side they had 10,000 weapons on their side the total nuclear arsenal at the Times had about 18,000 megatons of of energy capable of being delivered 18,000 megatons now that means 18 million tons of TNT the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was about 10,000 tons of TNT so a hundred times a hundred Hiroshima bombs would be one Megaton right now there was about say 15 to 18,000 megatons total in the arsenal of the superpowers during the height of the Cold War had we unleashed an all-out nuclear war and fired every warhead that we had in our Arsenal's at each other 15,000 warheads you know I mean 20,000 warheads 15,000 megatons it would have been an environmental disaster unprecedented in history you remember the scenarios about nuclear winter right because of all of the fires and the suit and the particulate matter thrown into the atmosphere it could literally bring on a mini ice age right and and probably cause without even the radiation caused major collapse of the human population right get this number in your head 15,000 megatons okay now even a small asteroid impact or let's say let's say the asteroid impact that that struck the Yucatan there's a simple formula that you can use when you look at the crater size you take the size of the crater and raise it expressed in kilometers raise it to the power of three point four and multiply the result by 2.4 and what it's going to give you is the energy yield in megatons of that object strike if I put in a hundred and eighty kilometers into this calculator here which is the diameter of the Yucatan crater and I raise it to the three point four power and then I multiply that by the two point four power I get the the Megaton yield all right that number comes up to be 111 million megatons I divide that by 15,000 and basically what we have there is about equivalent to the entire nuclear arsenal of the superpowers eight thousand times over eight thousand times over now what kind of an environmental consequence would there be to that well we saw that global fire storms you know that this the studies of the amount of soot at that boundary layer shows that the amount of biomass that went up in fire storms that the KT boundary was about equivalent to every plant on earth today going up in fire right you had tsunamis that were perhaps a thousand feet in height you had global earthquakes probably measured 10 to 11 on the Richter scale and you know how the Richter scale works it's logarithmic so that an 8.0 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a 7.0 9.0 is 10 times more powerful in 8.0 an 11 point Oh earthquake is going to be unimaginable the whole framework of the globe would have shaken you probably would have massive failures on every fault line on the planet now the KT event was the middle of the five great extinction events right there was Ordovician Silurian there was the Permian Triassic there was a couple more two of them were more extreme than that now even even much smaller than that right you know that when they talk about a tipping point you know are we talking about a tipping point that could trigger a climate change a disastrous catastrophic climate change as being a few parts million more of co2 or is a tipping point really a mile-wide asteroid slamming into the earth at a hundred times the speed of a rifle bullet that could be a tipping point my friend and that has happened thousands of times and hundreds of times since we humans have been here hundreds of times hundreds of - hundreds of times and when was the most recent one that was the Holocene crater well probably it's there's evidence emerging now that the collapse of the Late Bronze Age civilizations around four thousand two hundred years ago may have been precipitated by a series of impacts there's evidence emerging that the climate downturn that occurred between 536 and 540 ad that I talked about earlier may have been triggered by a series of multiple impacts one that looks like it occurred off the coast of Norway and another one that looks like it occurred off the coast of New Zealand like tandem impacts right around 536 ad and and we're basically faced with the idea now that literally impacts from things from space maybe hundreds of times more likely than anybody was even imagining you know a generation ago so we're essentially this civilization that is banking on the knowledge that we've accumulated over a very small amount of time and as we're uncovering more and more evidence more and more information we're starting to realize our Eggman's we're starting to realize how little we know about our own history the history of this particular species and how it's interacted in this crazy volatile environment of Earth and how many times we've been hit by rocks yeah and see you know a hundred years ago the assumption was one of these these images of these craters or impacts ah yeah that's that's actually ten years old but it shows now all the identified impacts and this is ten years old so since then some new ones have oh does a dozens more yeah and since then has been discovery of this new clear glass that they've found all over Europe and all over Asia I think are you referring to the possibly the the thing that Graham was talking about the the 13,000 year ago event I think I think that's what it is what I'm referring to is there was a mainstream report about all these these pieces of this very similar material to what they find at nuclear blast yes and that it was all over the place at when they did the core samples around 12,000 years ago yes then that's exactly what Graham's talking about yeah and and yes the evidence is getting stronger and stronger each year that there have there may have been a multiple impact event that terminated the ice age and this still a very controversial idea because the gradualists just don't want to go there and this is probably what killed off mass extinction of the woolly mammoth mass extinction of the saber-tooth Tiger yes and a series of animals that they really have not figured out why like there's there's been all sorts of theories about why the woolly mammoth went extinct and some of them are ridiculous like that people did it you know I'm glad to hear you say that that's ridiculous idea well it's ridiculous when you think about what kind of people were around 12,000 years ago and what kind of weapons they had and what a fucking mammoth looks like like Jesus Christ how many of them more and the other thing that's ridiculous about obviously when I say ridiculous I'm ridiculous I shouldn't even be making that statement I don't have done very little research but the research that I've read and the the people that have questioned it have talked about the mass graves where they've found these animals that have died instantaneously thousands of them and not consumed either they don't show signs of predation or of butchering they're there they've died in full form full body yes and they've massive massive massive graveyards and you know for centuries pristine mammoth tusks ivory have been hauled out of the permafrost of Siberia in trainload Lots you know and this has gone into the global ivory market literally for three or four hundred years some estimates are that there may have been as many as four to ten million woolly mammoths worldwide well most people don't realize that right here in North America there were three species of Provo city and or three species of elephants during the Ice Age Africa has one species Indian India has another species we had three species during the time what gobekli tepe was being yes during the time elephants in hey hi elephant here's another perspective is that one that they found what is that this is the berestov commandment that was found in 1901 quick-frozen yeah with flesh now at the time this photograph was taken wolves had eaten the flesh off of the skull that's why it's it's it's bear but what you see there immediately dirty wolves yeah eating some million year old meat it's gusting households probably 13,000 Olli tell me so that's a little not quite as bad as Miller also but you can see the the the mammoth left forelimb just in front of his face there you see how it's and if in if Jamie toggles back and forth between this image and the next one you'll be able to see yeah this was how the woolly mammoth was found and so they took photos of it when it was found like this and then they left it alone and the wolf's came and got it this is not this is a reconstruction guys I believe in the Leningrad Museum so what they did was they took the remains of the woolly mammoth and in taxidermists came in and reconstructed but this shows the position in which he was found sitting on his haunches like that and at the time that the woolly mammoth met his demise he was eating flowering plants right now it's important to keep that in mind his stomach was full of about two dozen different varieties of plants and sedges and things that he had been munching on up in Siberia at the time that he that he met his death number of interesting things the contents of his stomach had not putrified right now that's mysterious and the fact that his his flesh was still edible at least by wolves you know that the stories about you know the scientists eating mammoth burgers is probably made up but the wolves definitely were able to eat the flesh right it was described as still being marbled almost as if it had just been frozen you know a week ago but since the time that the wooly mammoth died it had its whole carcass and that was a 6-ton wooly mammoth so it had been frozen for how many thousands and thousands of years and so thoroughly frozen that the contents of the stomach could not putrified now a woolly mammoth of 6 tonnes has a lot of internal heat right Clarence Birdseye that the founder of Birdseye foods and the inventor of the fast-freezing of foods for preservation got involved in examining and in speculating about this wooly mammoth his conclusion basically led to something like this in order to prevent the contents of the stomach from putrifying the entire carcass of the woolly mammoth would have had to been frozen through and through in 10 hours or less now bear in mind that this woolly mammoth was eating flowering plants right now how cold would it have to be to freeze a 6-ton woolly mammoth in ten hours or less his estimate was probably somewhere around 150 degrees below zero so from flowering plants to a hundred and fifty degrees below zero in 10 hours in 10 hours how what what causes something like that well there's been some speculation the speculation that I found most interesting was possibly volcanic gases that had been ejected up into the stratosphere approached absolute zero and because of the cold fell back earth I think you could get the same effect perhaps with gases released from a disintegrating comet nucleus it's still a mystery I mean anything that anybody says at this point is purely speculative however it's clear that whatever this mammoth underwent was disastrous in the extreme you saw him sitting there on his haunches right both of his hip bones were broken which means that he was slammed back onto his haunches very violently he was also found with an erect penis which means that he died by suffocation which meant that he was entombed virtually instantly by the material that later became the permafrost we were talking about the Little Ice Age earlier and I was talking about how the Little Ice Age ended around 1850 well this guy was found about 1901 after the climate and Siberia had been warming somewhat see and what happened was a part of a clip a cliff that had been next to the veresov career the Berezovsky River had shifted its channel and eroded some of the cliff face back and then one year one warm spring there was a collapse of the cliff face that exposed this mammoth to the atmosphere Wow and at that point is when the Wolves came in and began to devour the flesh on the of the Scala see so clearly this Morley mammoth is an example of or indicative of some type of a catastrophe whether it was a global catastrophe or a local catastrophe nobody knows but clearly it was catastrophic but that woolly mammoth there's only one of dozens of examples of flash-frozen Late Pleistocene mammals that died under similar circumstances and these large graveyards of mass extinctions of thousands and thousands of animals what are the best examples of them because I know that I've seen some of them online but I can't pull them up like I'm sure you can I've got some right here if I can get my laptop there pull Jamie pull up look towards the bottom of the list list you'll see Pleistocene the lost world of the Pleistocene do you see that no it's a it's a PowerPoint it's in that list of the powerpoints that I gave you I have some photographs you're freaking me out I just want to tell you right now you're freaking me out well I get freaked out pretty easy but freaking me out well I actually Rosen mammoth I have to confess that one of my objectives in coming here was to try to freak you out well you did it congratulations you're successful I've been terrified of Yellowstone for four years now I watched some late-night documentary was a huge mistake one of the things I was about to go to bed and I just flipping through the channels and they were going over this thing about a caldera volcano and Yellowstone I was like what the fuck's a caldera and then they started talking about how it's what was it something like 600 kilometers wide or something crazy like that which is something like 300 miles and they were saying that they didn't even discover it until they started doing satellite imagery of of Earth and then they realized that oh this was a giant volcano that was so violent in its eruption that it blew the mountain off of it and it became this massive crater and that it happens every six to eight hundred thousand years ago and that the last time it happened was six thousand years ago yeah yeah so hopefully keeping our fingers crossed we got another hundred thousand years if we're lucky yeah but see that's another aspect of this component of the dynamic history of planet Earth is these gigantic volcanic eruptions there's been some interesting work linking asteroid impacts with giant volcanic eruptions as well and it would it would make sense that um that that the energy injected into the earth by a major impact could trigger volcanic eruptions we know that during the great meltdown event of eleven to thirteen thousand years ago that there were enormous massive volcanic eruptions and mount st. Helens for example was was massively erupting at that time and I have photographed I have felt some photographs right here I don't know how much time we have to look at some of this but where I have gone out and I've found thick layers of white volcanic ash from Mount st. Helens sandwiched in between these flood layers and and it it shows that and it undoubtedly had have been a response to the fact that you had this enormous mass transfer of weight that we were talking about earlier from the continents back to the ocean and when we go through I mean maybe it's time to go through a few of these images that I brought so you can begin to see some of the consequences of this melting and you begin to appreciate that yeah there were these just enormous mass transfers of weight unloading in certain areas loading in other areas this would clearly have a profound effect on the subterranean stability and could easily lead to major eruptions and there was a spasm of major volcanic eruptions globally at the time of the the transition out of the Ice Age which would only have added to the havoc of that transition and why you know half of the great species of megafauna disappeared a megaphone is basically defined as any any animal in this case mostly mammals over 44 kilograms in body weight which is about a hundred pounds right so that would include us and if you started thinking about all of the animals globally worldwide there are more than a hundred pounds depending on how you divide up the species there might be a hundred to twenty a hundred and thirty different species and I'm talking about the you know lions and tigers and bears and elephants and rhinos and hippos and moose and caribou and dr. dot right down the line right okay let's go back to the Ice Age the extinction the loss of species at the end of the last ice age was about equivalent in number the loss of species of mega mammals was about equivalent in number to the number of species of mega mammals that still exist so in other words these events that terminated the Ice Age basically decimated half of the species of mega mammals on earth half of the species disappeared so if you are going to try to effect an equivalent mass extinction of species today you'd basically have to eliminate every animal on earth over a hundred pounds in body weight in order to to get the equivalent of that mass extinction episode of 12,000 13,000 years ago thats insane it's insane but it's absolutely the truth I what is the official like or mainstream explanation for this it doesn't exist okay you brought up the idea of it's called an overkill which has been - domino theory for four decades which is that human hunters exterminated the woolly mammoth and in some vague way the extermination of the woolly Ameth being at the top of the food chain somehow had a ripple effect down you know through the ranks of species and somehow perhaps in an unaddressed way resulted in the loss of all these other species but they just don't address that and the more you said that theory is ridiculous and that's an understatement I mean you're talking about you know perhaps bands of few hundred or maybe even a thousand individuals migrant bands human hunters coming in and somehow able see you got to bear in mind that the estimates of human population during this time globally is less than the estimates of the population of woolly mammoths but somehow our ancestors were able to wipe out 4 million to 10 million wooly mammoths so fast that they couldn't even reproduce so there was only like 10 million people back then that's well see that's based upon more or less the conventional interpretation now of course what we've been talking about implies opens the door to their possibility of there being a lot more people and the mass extinction also including a massive amount of human beings as well yeah and there is some interesting evidence emerging now that there perhaps was a population collapse between what is called the Clovis culture and the Folsom culture the Clovis culture appears in North America to be what is believed to have been the earliest culture and the there's a site in New Mexico that was the first discovery of the the association of human artifacts meaning spear points and arrowheads and things like that along with extinct mammals right this is Clovis New Mexico it's a very interesting site I visited there about six or seven years ago in order because I was looking for this so-called black math layer which has now been documented at dozens of Clovis sites around North American the black mat layer is this unique layer that essentially separates the Pleistocene from the Holocene and it's full of soot it's full of iridium nano diamonds microsphere olds and all of these signature things that are indicative of kind of a cosmic event is this an image indicative of that is that what this is yeah that's kind of a blurry image but right there you can see it up here too so you can face the microphone yeah okay yeah the white strip in the middle shows the black matte layer that's exactly it and what you see below it are the bones of extinct mammals and what you see a couple of thousand years later is bones of extant mammals and nowhere above that black matte layer do you find the bones of the extinct mammals what is extant it means dead that's no still it still exists okay you know yeah bears are extend I say you know that slowly mammoths are extinct so there's a very distinct line that can be attributed to some sort of an event yes some sort of interface something before that they're all alive something after that they're all dead they're all dead and a massive amount of the larger mammals gone got wiped off the face of planet wiped off the face of the planet North America lost about 75% of its species of megamum holy shit and three-quarters yeah there we there we go there's some of them I love that thing below that thing below what is that fucking thing that giant ground sloth that fucking thing is the Megatherium Americana mitts the giant ground sloth it was the size of an elephant oh my god these are the glyptodont these are all 10,000 years ago not this guy these is a dinosaurs obviously diagnosed Maximus is the giant MOA this guy threw him in here for raucous because he's just such an awesome creature the terror bird right hits the terror bird yeah I'm gonna scroll back up stop scrolling Jim look at that fucking bird that's a seven-foot-tall lot bigger than that was 8 9 foot tall yeah a bird that doesn't fly so essentially a murderous ostrich yeah this was the top of the food chain during the Miocene really yeah this was it this was the the baddest ass predator on the planet for a while really yeah more so than a saber-toothed tiger these guys existed before the saber-tooth Tiger Wow but they succumbed to one of these global events you got a baron mind if you take a census of all the species that ever existed compared to the species now it's conservative to say that 99.99% of all species have become extinct Wow and in the ones that and of course most of those had went extinct without any help from humans at all it stops growing what is that fucking thing that's a last mo theory America Jesus Christ I mean he you begin to appreciate it's like a bulls that fucked a rhino yes wow that's insane how big that is oh it was huge I mean it was elephant size basically a woolly rhinoceros the size of an elephant and this is Cielo dontoh which is the classic woolly rhinoceros and there have been quite a few species of these guys found that we're flash-frozen and this is 12,000 years ago this thing existed yeah woolly rhinoceros yes and where North America Jesus Christ that's incredible and what is what's the mainstream explanation for these things going away good luck I'm trying to find one I have looked there is none there there is nothing they don't there's nothing so is this something that they just haven't formed any theories about or they don't try to or it's been ignored because it's not enough information it's been ignored and here's why at the dawn of earth science geological science in the early 19th century to a man every one of the founding fathers of geology whether it was you know William Buckland or Cuvier or Sir James Hall or or Rodney Murchison a dozen Sedgwick he could go right down the line all of these guys from 1820 up to about 1860 every one of them was a catastrophist to a man every one because these were guys basically who had not been indoctrinated into any particular interpretation of world history they went out and they looked at evidence in the landscape and their conclusion was is you know something really catastrophic has happened and then what happened was you had Charles Lyell play fair and Hutt James Hutton these three came along and basically established the doctrine of uniformitarianism as it's called a mouthful right and basically the idea of uniformitarianism was this is that we look at modern processes to explain ancient processes so if we see a river eroding its bank moving sediment creating a sandbar with that if we see like during the the you know early 19th century we were in the last phase of the Little Ice Age so glaciers were receding and these guys could essentially go up there and look on a year-to-year basis and see what was happening as the glaciers were receding right so basically what they then did was extrapolated for modern processes to try to explain all the ancient processes this is the doctrine of uniformitarianism okay it's a very powerful model for understanding ancient change however it became ensconced as Dogma so that by the turn of the century as we come right up to the to the threshold of the 20th century it was now considered unscientific to try to explain anything in the past that we couldn't see happening today right so as we go into the 20th century this gradualist Dogma became ensconced in academia in every geologist from about 1900 up to about 1980 was thoroughly indoctrinated into this idea of the gradualism that all of the earth changed that we see going on on the planet today has occurred one grain of sand one drop of water at a time and it was considered to be very unscientific to begin to evolve the founding fathers of geology where a lot of them interesting were theologians who often that's a number of like Adam Sedgwick is a good example of somebody who was a travelling theologian a traveling minister right he was traveling around England and he was seeing things like the Thames River Valley and he was saying that the Thames flowed in this gigantic channel that was completely outsized relative to the river that was flowing in it and he says that must have been from a he huge flood well he was a theologian right so he said Noah's Flood right well as it turns out there are enormous geomorphic effects of gigantic floods all over the planet right we know that now right in the 1800s they assumed that if you saw effects of gigantic floods it had to have been Noah's Flood well at the same time that you had geological gradualism on the ascent Geale a biological gradualism came along in the form of Darwinism and the two sort of complemented each other and mutually supported each other well if we've got infinite time you know millions and millions of years of gradual geological change now that allows us millions and millions of years for gradual biological change and these two paradigms were mutually reinforcing so now we come to the 20th century and for the first three quarters of the 20th century that was the dogma that was indoctrinated into the minds of every earth scientists right and to vary from that was to be pseudo scientific and you're trying to revert back to biblical fundamentalism if you start talking about giant floods right well what happened was and then it was left to people like Immanuel Velikovsky it was not an earth scientist he was a psychoanalyst and he wrote several books in the mid-1950s where he had gathered together in one place all of this anomalous evidence from the earth history that did not fit the uniformitarian paradigm now his books were popular successes but mainstream science just slammed him slammed him and said this guy is a nutcase right well he did make some serious missteps in trying to explain this anomalous geological evidence for catastrophe and it was those missteps that they were able to focus on to try to discredit him however the amassing of evidence for catastrophes in Earth history has held this the the test of time and and what we see is what 1980 was a pivotal year that was a year that three separate teams published evidence showing that the cretaceous-tertiary boundary the dinosaur boundary was profoundly catastrophic and that opened the door to begin a reconsideration of Earth history now at the same time with the advent of the space program we are beginning to realize that near-earth space is not a completely empty place it's actually densely populated by all kinds of things see prior to the Apollo moon program it was believed that most of the craters on the moon if not all of the craters on the moon were volcanic right post Apollo the realization was is no they're not volcanic their impacts of things from space see now you look at the surface of the Moon and I think the last image on the Joe Rogan images there is going to be a picture of the moon and you'll see that it's littered littered thousands and thousands and thousands of craters and because it doesn't have an atmosphere and because it doesn't have plants we can actually see we think it's happened and the point Joe is this if we weren't able to strip away the biosphere the the thick layers of sedimentary rocks the oceans the earth would look like the moon god damn it would look like fucking moon so it's simply a matter of time and perspective that we we really well thank thankfully there's people like you that are paying attention to us but we with the amount of time that people have been videotaping things and writing books this tiny little window there just hasn't been enough time to really get a real account of how often this takes place because that that amount of time although it's a grand amount of time compared to our lives the life of an individual for the life of the planet it's nothing it's a perspective issue it's a perspective exactly exactly and and this is one reason why I'm an advocate for moving forward and essentially becoming a cosmic civilization you see I came of age during the the heyday of the mercury and Gemini Gemini and Apollo programs and you know that the one thing when I look back and I go we own what one of the last times that it was really proud of my country was when we put those men on the moon you know when we planted our American flag on the moon and I really believe back in 1969 1970 that we were America's destiny was to move the human species into this grander cosmic environment and then of course you know the Vietnam War came along and other priorities and money got shifted in a Nixon administration shifted huge amounts of money away from the space program the timetable that was set out that we were going to have a permanent lunar base by the end of the 70s first manned mission to Mars before the 80s was over perhaps independently self-supporting colonies in space by the year 2000 Mara was a junior in high school when Kubrick's 2001 a Space Odyssey came out have you ever seen it sure yeah 1968 nobody had any it was no stretch of the imagination to assume that by 2001 yeah there were going to be orbiting hotels in space right that could have happened but we lost our vision we lost our will and we just got sidetracked you know I remember in the 70s talking to people about the potential of colonizing space using the materials and resources found in space and the the knee-jerk response I always got was well we've got too many problems here on earth we got to solve those problems first well my response to that was well good luck because you're basically talking about altering human nature right and it's gonna take something more than just some policy to alter human nature what it's going to take is some serious consciousness excursions perhaps people going to space you know here we had these astronauts I met Edgar Mitchell years ago he's a Mason he came to my lodge years ago Edgar Mitchell who was one of the astronauts he was one of the many astronauts that went into space and like his in Freemason as in Freemasons everybody freaks out and he say freemason I know loominatee more nonsense and we should have a whole session just to do with that ridiculous nonsense next time freak me out about that okay Edgar Mitchell when you met him does it was he talking about aliens no no billions no he was talking about going into space and seeing God whoa crazier than aliens yeah crazier than aliens he's God made aliens perhaps so he saw God in the sense that he got a sense I mean without even saying God he got a sense of the the the grandness great universe yes and and yes and and you know the potential role of humans in that have you ever been to the Keck Observatory in Hawaii no I haven't the Keck Observatory in Hawaii is a very unique place because it's on the Big Island of Hawaii and it's very high up in altitude and when you get up there you actually drive through the clouds I took my family there several years ago and we were bummed out because I got so cloudy we're not gonna be able to see anything but then you pop through the clouds as you continue to drive and the view is magnificent and it is to this day one of the most intense experiences consciousness expanding experiences I've ever had I believe it without drugs yeah you know I mean it was like a psychedelic experience it really was because the the amount of that's the Keck Observatory you see how it's above the clouds when you that's a daytime shot I've see Jamie see if you could pull up a knife nighttime shot because you know they set the camera aperture to capture the I didn't I had a regular camera I couldn't I couldn't really capture the the actual stars themselves but you see the Milky Way like not like that it's way more intense than that that you see the Milky Way in its full form you see all right yeah and there's so many stars it's so shocking you you're immediately forced to accept the reality that we're in space whereas it's so easy to deny when all you see is the moon and a couple little dots like whatever man I'm in Hollywood I gotta go to work and you drive you get on the hop that's what it's like yeah and it's so it's it's and that's just a photograph and that's you know obviously there's some doctoring going on because I don't know what those lines are but it's insane how intense it is it's insane and it's it's it's right above you yes right above us all the time that's what I love about the high desert plateaus you've got this dry atmosphere and it's like literally you can almost reach out and touch the Stars you know we were talking about you've never been to LA before this is your first trip to LA because when you're in California you just go to the Mojave and stare at space well I stare at space and I stare at the rocks yeah the rocks below my feet and the Stars over my head yeah how did you get involved in the exploration of all this stuff well you know I guess I better time to come out of the closet I think I did a little too many drugs back in the 60s and I think he did the right amount yeah I think you're being hard on you actually actually in 1969 so of course I was I was raised in rural Minnesota and where we grew up we lived on the shores of a puddle a meltwater puddle left over from the receding of the glaciers yeah call it a puddle it's I call it a puddle it was three-quarters of a mile long it was just you know Minnesota Wisconsin's got about twenty five thousand lakes and every one of them has leftover meltwater puddles from the recession of the glacier so I can still remember being like 6 or 7 years old and my dad telling me you know once upon a time this was thousands of feet under the ice and that's how this we had land on the edge of this lake and as a kid I used to sit in my backyard and fish for you know sunfish and crappies and Bowl heads that's what I don't understand it interrupts your story for just one second how the fuck does that happen where 10,000 years ago it's a glacier 10,000 years later there's fish in there uh-huh where the fuck of the fish coming from I don't know but they were there but how where's the largemouth bass come from how what's the all this with the lake trout in the Great Lakes where the fuck do they come from if 10,000 years ago that was frozen solid yes frozen solid where the fuck the lake trout come from I'll have to get to work on that Joe cuz I don't know the answer I need to know man I'm freaking out how about northern pike I mean northern pike you go to Saskatchewan PA fly in from all over the world to go fishing up there because they have this massive population of beautiful northern yeah hike these big that was frozen yes cess kanpai a mile of ice what the fuck man I'm freaking out that doesn't even make sense yeah so you saw this so you were a kid I was a kid growing up with that landscape so I got fascinated by it but in 1969 I went to a rock an outdoor rock concert that was at an airport called Eden Prairie that's in the just outside of the Twin Cities Minneapolis and it's on a series of Bluffs that overlooks the Minnesota River Valley right of course I'm stoned out of my gourd and I was taking a break from the music and the ladies and everything and I went over and was standing on this Bluff and and Jamie if you would pull up I think it's near though the end of the pictures I brought for Joe I have a beautiful example of scale invariance and this is going to be similar to what I saw and and when you see it that's that's like the 25 images that's labeled for Joe it'll be towards the end it's a picture of the Snake River find it Wow the Snake River wait'll you see this Joe now this is an example of scale invariance now what that means is that you know you know yeah here we go now look at this what you see here where can folks they're just listening to this go and see these images is there are they on your website I think this one is on my website okay yeah I think this one's not so the Snake River you see the Snake River scale and variance meaning that the the river at the bottom obviously you see the lines all around it where it indicates that there was a much much larger body of water at one point much bigger this the modern Snake River is about 50,000 cubic feet per second right at the end of the last ice age the river here was about 30 to 40 million cubic feet per second so was that because of the melting glaciers the force of the vessel this particular was not directly fed by the melting glaciers it was the result of the catastrophic overflow of Lake Bonneville which was the result of massive prolonged torrential rainfall that just drowned all the deserts of the southern of the Western and southwestern United States and there was an overflow a spillway out of the Lake Bonneville basin in northern Utah and it spilled over into the Snake River plain of Idaho 30 to 40 million cubic feet per second cut this channel now you'll notice that the modern Snake River occupies a small channel within the big channel that's scale invariance the big river would have been about equivalent to six to seven hundred of the modern Snake rivers and what you're seeing here is an example of scale invariance see the the little is superimposed up on this big see now in 1969 I was standing on a bluff overlooking the Minnesota River Valley similar to this right looking down at the little Minnesota ribbon of the Minnesota River and seeing it in this huge channel and I had an aha moment I had an aha moment and I realized I saw then that this channel that this bluff I was standing on had once been the bank of a gigantic river thousands of times bigger than the modern Minnesota River but I I didn't know it rationally in the sense that it took me another ten or fifteen years of study and research before I could go back and say yeah what my initial instinct looking out and seeing this matching set of Bluffs for five miles on the other side and seeing this small version of it in the modern river that I was right that I remember one time in the 80s I was giving a talk on that and I there was a geologist in the audience and he got up and no no no no no no that that big channel that was millions of years millions of years it took for that channel to form and I said no I don't think so and what happened was is by him challenging me it really you know I said okay you know like an EM you know an MMA fighter getting challenged says okay I'm gonna take you on you know I rose to the occasion and I spent literally years doing research on Glacial geomorphology on Paley hydrology and of course at the end of the thing I knew that I was my instincts were absolutely correct that yes now there is solid scientific documental verifiable evidence that this whole channel of the Minnesota River Valley was filled brim full with water at the end of the last night so when he was saying it was millions of years he's saying that same exact channel of water had never varied and that it had just cut through over millions of years very slowly yes but does that sort of that doesn't seem rational because of the width no it doesn't you'd have to and it doesn't it doesn't makes so this goes along with what you were talking about earlier that the idea the the ideas of science were that everything had taken place much like evolution on a very gradual pace exactly is this the Grand Canyon as well no I would here's what I would say about the Grand Canyon I think that the Grand Canyon is presently we can observe it that we can observe the Colorado River eroding the Grand Canyon however I think that the erosion of the Grand Canyon is not uniform it's episode ik which means that the Grand Canyon has probably been there between two and five million years because for one thing the Grand Canyon wouldn't start eroding until the Colorado Plateau had lifted up and 10 to 12 million years ago the rim rock of color of the Colorado Plateau was lime stones which implies a shallow marine environment right now when it's down at marine at sea level it's not going to Road it's not until the whole plateau lifts up between five and ten million years ago that the down cutting can start so my take on the Grand Canyon would be that what happens is as we have you have to understand us now this is this is I think now is the is the the merging emerging paradigm there are two modes of change the gradualist mode that we've seen dominating through you know the last few hundred years at least since the advent of modern science and then the if you want to call it the catastrophic mode where as much change it's compressed into a few years or months or sometimes even days or weeks as normally would take thousands and thousands of years when I look at the Grand Canyon what I'm seeing there is episodes of catastrophic erosion probably stretching back over two and a half million years remember I said the Pleistocene was about two and a half million years what characterizes the Pleistocene from the previous Pliocene is this alternating succession of glacial and interglacial ages this swinging back and forth between these two extremes those episodes of transition appear to be profoundly catastrophic and they are associated with things like massive storms massive rainfalls rising and falling of sea levels on an extreme basis and I think it's that that has created the Grand Canyon predominant in fact the inner Channel I know if you've ever seen Grand Canyon yes yeah okay there's an inner gorge I could guess that that inner gorge is probably less than a hundred thousand years old and probably a lot of it was cut 13,000 years ago Wow and so that's when the Pleistocene ended somewhere around ten thousand years ago yeah ten to thirteen thousand years ago Wow yeah and that's a that's not a real picture is it no it seems like an artist's rendition yeah I have pictures somewhere in there we're still where you get a sense yeah now the the accumulation of the sedimentary rocks yeah took hundreds of millions of years but that's one process the down cutting the erosion of the Canyon is a different process so again it comes to a matter of perspective that we're almost incapable of let me I think you know academically and you you could sort of explain how all this takes place and explain what's happening but in our minds our our perspective of living a hundred years looking back it's very difficult to go back 20 years ago and I remember when that happened while barely but this is that ain't shit compared to the earth the earth the earth is just constantly changing and our knowledge of human history we have this sort of static view and occasionally we have that meteor that flew over Russia recently and blew up in the sky and everybody's like whoa what's with that and then it stops and then nothing go back to work right go back to work go back to sleep yeah and that thing that blew up over Russia that was that was a spec and there's nothing and then nurse Tunguska which blew up in the early 1900's 1908 June 30th 1908 which just flattened thousands and thousands of acres oh well let's see it was eight hundred square miles and there 640 acres per square mile so it flattened half a million acres oh my god million acres and that was the energy of that was about equivalent to a 15 Megaton bomb Paula yeah there's an image of Tunguska just all the trees completely flat and completely flat up a few look at that gangster tree just still stand-in there how's that happen I know it's just like every now and then it's one bad motherfucker tree that's how people stay alive right yeah because just like everybody else died or most things died and most of the species died a few people figured out a way to make it and then they decided to have babies what a bunch of crazy fuck could you imagine giant asteroid hits kills everybody rotten people and wooly mammoths all over the place and you're still horny you're still horny and you make a baby like Wow and you raise it and that baby makes more place what does it say in the book of Genesis you know be fruitful and multiply now get this the word replenish the earth replenish the earth and subdue it I think clearly that's a clear hint that saying this is not the primordial creation it's a subsequent creation to something a previous order of things why use the word replenish be fruitful and multiply it would make sense if if the human population crashes in the wake of a global catastrophe and we're down hovering at the threshold of viability where you know we could become extinct if just anything else happens and we want to we want to preserve our species well the probably the thing we need to be doing is having lots of sex mmm does I'm talking about yeah I know I mean we need to do lots of screwing and we need to screw and make scientists that figure out how to get us off this rock yeah well see be fruitful and multiply and make spacious replenish the earth and subdue it what the hell is that does this say subdue it subdue it that's in Genesis oh yeah it's in Genesis what the hell are they talking about they're choked the earth well I see that's the way it's been interpreted I think it's in being interpreted to say look you guys are the only rational species down there you've got these big brains you know you got to be born before you you know it takes you years and years to actually get where you can survive on your own because you've got these big fucking brains see so we're kind of like nature's answer to all of this you know only one species right now has the ability to intercede and prevent the next global catastrophe and that's us do we rise to that challenge or do we say well we're gonna let nature run its course and if 50% of the species disappear civilization is over we go back to the Stone Age struggling for existence well so be it that's what's in the cards or do we say you know what we could but in one generation be harvesting the resources of asteroids which we could be if we had the will and the vision and the thing is is that the most dangerous asteroids that our are out there it's the closer they get to the earth the more accessible they are and and you see we already could be harvesting the resources laughter I mean asteroids are loaded with precious metals and ores and hydrocarbons there's virtually nothing that we are now mining from the earth that we couldn't mined from asteroids Wow what does that suggest to you well and and think about this if if I like to kind of imagine a scenario suppose we had discovered remember shoemaker-levy 9 yes okay discovered in March of 1996 within about eight weeks of observations the astronomers were able to predict that these fragmenting pieces were going to orbit the Sun and come back and be crossing the orbit of Jupiter at exactly the time that Jupiter was there right there was gonna be a t-bone collision it was like two vehicles coming to the intersection at the same time and they were able to predict that right down to the almost to the minute to the hemisphere what if we discovered that there's an asteroid orbiting the Sun out there that's got our number on it and it was in a strike the earth in three years or ten years or twenty years or whatever what would be our response to it what would we do I think globally it would be there would have to be some sort of a collective X effort yeah the scientists from China and Russia and all these different various countries that have vast technological capabilities would probably get together and have some sort of an agreement I would think that that would have to happen and it would fact it would probably make our petty human conflicts pale into insignificance if we were faced with the demise of our civilization or even possibly our species but suppose we discovered it and it's coming in a couple of years and there's no time to respond what could we do well perhaps if we had a long enough lead time we could actually die Fleck all we need to do is as an asteroid that's on a collision course with the earth all it has to do is be nudged a little bit in a direct hit can be a wide miss see that's all we would have to do is just nudge it a little and there's various potential technologies whereby we could do that but what if we didn't have enough lead time and we knew that that it was gonna slam into the earth and for a thousand years gonna be havoc what would we do well perhaps we could go build a base on the moon or build a something in space that would allow humans to survive at least until the dust settled enough that we could return and begin to replenish the earth you know what a bummer it would be if he had a base on the moon and everyone was living there and you've watched the earth blow up total bummer but it would be even bigger bummer if you didn't have it and you were sitting on the earth oh and that that's it man that's all she wrote how many different times do you think this has happened while human beings are alive and what how the great speculation has always been when they see the pyramids or when they see any incredible structures that we really haven't totally explained how they built what like Baalbek in Lebanon you know is what how advanced were they how advanced were they before the shit hit the fan well it seems to me that in order to you know you gotta go why would primitive cultures move rocks that way two hundred to a thousand tons apparently with impunity they were doing it all over the planet right well why would why would somebody be motivated I mean you know like again I'm a builder so I know how much work it takes to move even a you know without a crane without modern technology to move a beam into place that weighs a ton right well you know we've got stones in some of these ancient temples that weigh hundreds of tons and again all over the world it seems to me difficult to imagine that they didn't have some kind of a technology that we've forgotten what that technology is I couldn't say but it would sure seem to me that there would be no motive for moving you know five hundred tons stones unless you had some convenient way of doing it or if not a convenient way of doing it just explain how an inconvenient way they could have done it when you get to something like the Acropolis or the Parthenon that's on the Acropolis right is that what is the part that crop list is the stone and the Parthenon is about song propolis is the heel with the complex on it and the apartment on is one of those in impulse the Acropolis is a man-made construction that has massive massive stones that they just don't explain yeah yeah I mean they're there they're in there in Cuzco in South America you know they're in Egypt yeah there it is the baalbek one is actually probably even more impressive shame you see if you could pull that up the stones of Baal how do I spell it be double al be ek and there there's these stones are just unbelievably big yeah and no explanation for how they move them cut them quarried them got them into place and what year it was all done right that's a one vision of it or a picture of it but if you search for others he is actually a close-up of the actual stones themselves and they show people standing next to stone so you get a perspective of it much much taller than a human being in fact like I think 10 or 11 feet tall in some places like there's one rock just like fuck remove that but some of the stones see that's not a good one Jamie there's there some where you can see the massive amount of stone that was in each individual one some of them are literally building sized and it's just an individual stone and yeah there's one like what the fuck man what the fuck is that that is so big yeah it's they moved that they cut that quarried it and moved it yeah I mean I don't know how many people they had to do that but boy that doesn't seem like something that a society which is really concerned with feeding itself is is going to get done right what so when you see like the constructions of the great pyramids which is one of the great wonders of the world and to this day they're always trying to come up with ways that they did it but the sheer size and to put it into perspective if you cut and I think the number is 10 stones a day 2 6 2 million three hundred thousand-plus stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza and if you cut and place ten a day it would take you six hundred sixty-four years yeah I you know yeah having seen the Great Pyramid and many of the temples in Egypt I'm convinced that they had to have some means that we've forgotten for transporting these stones you know they may have used fairly primitive methods to quarry the stones but when it comes to transporting the stones you know I mean we could imagine that they're putting them on rollers and dragging them over you know Hill and Dale but again you got to go really all over the whole planet it's just it's one of those things it's like the demise of the frozen William amis there's just no real explanation and and we can invoke explanations that are basically designed to avoid the implications of admitting that there may have been advanced knowledge scientific knowledge in prehistory hmm and that somehow or another that knowledge was lost whether it was because of the burning of the Library of Alexandria or whether it was just a cataclysmic event that wiped out a massive amount of the population and what was remaining was buildings like that yeah those things survived and then people tried to recreate them people eventually figured out some of the techniques and made similar structures but not over a period of a thousand years or 2,000 years but maybe twenty thirty thousand years mm-hmm that's always been the work of Graham Hancock the the the ideas they bounced around and I remember there was that Charlton Heston narrated documentary on the Sphinx where they had gone into great detail about the erosion they brought on the geologist Robert Schoch from Boston University I know Robert yeah I want to get him on the podcast too he's a fascinating cat yes and he concluded that the temple the Sphinx the enclosure where it was cut out of shows thousands of years of erosion by rainfall which there wasn't rainfall in the Nile Valley before 9,000 years ago so this predates the pyramid construction the average or the the conventional dating of the pyramid there it is right there the some of his explanations it predates the what the conventional date of the is by more than 5,000 years oh I'm convinced and I've had conversations with Robert where he will basically say he's got one number for public consumption but he's perfectly willing to admit that perhaps this makes is much much older than that and I what's the dark number what's the crazy number oh I think the crazy number is tens of thousands of years if you pull up it's not that crazy though now it was kind of crazy when that Charlton Heston document and documentary was around but now that they found gobekli tepe and they know that fourteen thousand twelve thousand years ago whatever it was they were absolutely building these enormous immense structures that would be what eight thousand years seven thousand years earlier than the pyramids mm-hmm mm-hmm not that not that big a deal not that big of a deal they the conventional dating of the Great Pyramid Giza is 2,500 BC which may be correct but it still doesn't mean that the Sphinx wasn't way way old and way older than that exactly and you know I'm convinced having seen it firsthand that that erosion is water induced I've looked at a lot of erosion over the years and you know it's got the classic parabolic profile that you would expect if you started out with an initially square Jamie open up the PowerPoint show entitled Cataclysm os-- global super flood cataclysmic global super fraud that's my new band it's gonna be my new band go for it man cataclysmic radical is most was the Greek term for the destruction of the world by water oh wow it's from where we get our term Cataclysm whoa and their term C you know the Greeks believed that there were alternating destructions of the world by water and fire right heterosis was the term Greek term for the destruction of the world by fire Wow and cataclysmic of water on this stuff is so unbelievably fascinating because there's no way that you can attribute all of this stuff I mean these all of these ancient structures there's no way you can attribute it to what we know about their culture we don't know enough there's just not enough evidence there's not enough we don't know enough about ancient Egypt or you know or their construction methods there's so much there's so much thinking like there's so much guesswork it's so much you know when you look at these giant structures and you wonder like what what were they doing how did they do this who were they like it's so fascinating I would just I would love to be able to go back in time it's a giant bulletproof bubble I know I'm just hover over ancient Egypt yeah what's going on back then I know why did you guys know Jamie go to you've got a global super flood what is this image go to slide 58 a slide the infamous slide 58 hangar 18 slide 58 oh wow that's beautiful okay that's amazing now what you can see there is you got to get it in that's a microphone get on the microphone there the valley temple look up there oh yeah okay the valley temple with stones quarried from the ditch around the sphinx you got to remember what the Sphinx is that originally it was a yardang which is a which is a limestone outcrop that sticks above the surrounding landscape the yardang was the head of the Sphinx everything else was below now go to the next slide Jamie okay there you can really see the ditch surrounding the Sphinx and the layers forming the Sphinx body correspond to the layers in the surrounding ditch now wanted to me you'll notice the scaffolding next to the Sphinx they're there they're undertaking these campaigns of rests quote/unquote restoration gross but what they're actually doing is they're covering up the real message of the Sphinx yeah why are they doing now why are they bothering to try to rebuild the phone I don't know it's so stupid like wait you're not rebuilding it you're building new shit yeah you're just refacing it yeah with new stealth so gross but at least nobody is messing with the quarry walls where you can see the water erosion so effectively displayed go to the next slide Jamie now what we see here is an abandoned quarry it's hard to tell the scale here because that opening is like 40 feet high but if you look at you see the striations in the rock wall mm-hmm okay this is where they quarried the blocks right and remove the blocks go to the next slide Jamie okay this kind of shows the methodology that they use they would create these separation trenches they would usually go by the the natural bed bedding layers of the rock go to the next slide and you'll see here here's the presumed process where they're cutting a separation trench and there's a block about to be quarried there and then you can see there would have a stack of four blocks there and these blocks are enormous several tons oh yeah that block there would be looks like it's probably about four by eight by probably ten so like 320 cubic feet at 160 per so or 180 so you're looking at about fifty seven thousand pounds divided by two thousand so yeah but - yeah bout 30 tons see it's about 30 tons for that rock right there now go to the next slide 30 tons mmm okay now the reason I'm showing you this is because this is the process they would have used to quarry the blocks away from the the surrounding the Sphinx and exposed a quarry wall well at the time that quarry wall was exposed it would have been essentially a flat surface with this slightly stepped profile like we saw in the photograph right now go to the next slide right so there's now would be a cross-section with all of the blocks removed okay go to the next slide and what we have here is stone pick marks in a limestone lets you go quarry from Rama seed x about twelve hundred BC so about 3200 years ago so here's a limestone face of a quarry that's been exposed for 3,200 years and seems like they used some sort of a chisel - yeah exactly the the pick marks are still visible go to the next slide okay here's stone pick marks in a quarry from the early New Kingdom circa 15 so 3500 years ago you can actually determine the type of tool that they used to quarry the rocks the picks are the chisels go to the next one based on the marks that are based on tomorrow's yeah and here you see that the chisel marks made or pick marks made by stone picks in an Old Kingdom limestone quarry 2,000 years BC so here's a 4,000 year old quarry that's been sitting exposed to the desert elements and the pit marks are still visible on the face now go to the next slide now here's the Sphinx go to the next slide and look at that quarry wall yeah that's crazy it's crazy yeah now supposedly this quarry wall is only a few centuries older than that last picture we just saw where we could see the pic marks does that make sense well the only way it would make sense as if there was a vastly different type of stone well it's not though it's it's the same it's it's a well indurated limestone Robert can tell you all about the composition of that stone the the composition does vary though oh yeah like some of its more dense than others and that's you're conceive of the changes yeah and you can see that that indented layer about halfway up is going to be a softer limestone absolutely it certainly looks to the layman and I'm clearly a layman but it certainly looks like like water fissures like Oh fissures that are even rainfall even to the trained eye it looks like water but some legit Egyptologists and even legit geologists have tried to attribute this to wind and sand well again you know Robert has shown pictures of the comparison of wind erosion to sand or water erosion they don't look the same so the only reason to attribute this to wind and sand it's not based on the scientific evidence of what it looks like when there's water erosion it's confirm or to conform with the known or established timeline of construction yes and that's why I showed you those examples of other core like that Old Kingdom quarry that's almost the same age as this so it's actually really not scientific to try to attribute it to wind and sand it's just your what you're doing is confirming to confirmation bias you have you have an idea in your head and you're trying to to make this really odd erosion fit into that but that doesn't look like wind and sand go to the next line literally Jamie Oh jam-band that's good okay so there's the depth of the of the of the ditch it's about 22 feet and air shows each of the layers like if you look at layer 11 that's gonna be a softer limestone its eroded deeper right now go to the next slide and you'll see what I've done is superimposed what the original profile would have looked like hmm and there's been an enormous amount of rock limestone rock removed and we know the profile would have looked like that because the stones that were quarried are what make up the Sphinx and Valley temples right but noes have been eroded as well but unfortunately they've covered that up with this reconstruction well most likely most likely and I think Robert would confirm this that the limestone blocks that formed those temples were sheathed in hard granite hmm whereas this quarry wall was not it was exposed and then there's also the issue of the Sphinx head itself which seems to have been altered and this this is a time line thing that folks may or may not know but there's been the Egypt changed quite a bit I mean Egypt ancient Egypt was around for thousands and thousands of years and at some point they were conquered by the Nubians and the the the more African what we think of as traditional African faith obviously Egypt as part of Africa but the more traditional looking African faces is what you see in the current face in the temple the Sphinx so probably what had happened is a later date Pharaoh said you don't want to fuck this lion I want my face up there so they put the face of this probably Katherine mm-hmm and I think both Jana Anthony West and Robert Schoch would concur with that's why there's so little erosion on that face right because that face is only a few thousand years old and why it would be disproportionately small compared to the rest of the body Wow so fascinating I just I would give so much to know what they knew then I any point in time to go back in human history and just to be able to observe that would be the time that the just the middle of Egypt I would love to see what it looked like before they raided it and took off for folks I don't know it was covered in smooth limestone and they they cut it all up to build Cairo they raided it yeah there was an earthquake that flattened Cairo and you know they had attempted to penetrate the Great Pyramid prior to that without success but apparently the earthquake which I think happened I think it happened in the 12th century loosened a few rocks from near the top of the pyramid that allowed them to get some levers in there and begin to pry them loose so I've read a bunch of fucking assholes talk about vandalism that get this whether this is true or not we have no way of knowing but there are many many Arabic accounts and counts of early travelers and pretty much they all unanimously declare that the entire outside of the pyramid was inscribed now think about that what in the hell would that have been telling what kind of message was that that was being sent to the future that must have been amazing yeah I get I get my my hair stands up on my legs just thinking about inscribed yeah hey listen there's rocks in space and occasionally they land and when they do you're fucked build one of these get inside wait for further instruction it's amazing that they're there I mean if that thing existed Robert Schoch is corrected and that thing existed before the the Holocene events mm-hmm those are the only types of structures that would still be here yeah kind of fuck did people make it through there I wonder what the number was well I'm gonna tell you Adam and Eve story here's my theory on it you know all over the world we have traditions about caddis catastrophes and cataclysms and giant floods all over the world they've come down to us and there's a lot of deviation but there's also a lot of similarity in them um the idea that a small group had some kind of foreknowledge you know whether it was knowing the Bible or Deucalion in the Greek myths or eating a piston in the Sumerian myths or is this a thrissoor manu I mean the the the culture heroes had survived these great cataclysmic floods are in the dozens and dozens right American Indians had prolific traditions about giant floods when when George Caitlin the famous Indian artist spent decades of his life going around living with various Indian tribes like 40 years painting and in writing about him very interesting quote in one of his books he says that they're widely divergent with traditions and language and customs and so on but of a hundred and twenty tribes that he visited they all had one thing in common that they were descended from survivors of some gigantic cataclysmic event that's American Indians you find it in North America you find it in South America you find it in two Polynesian islands you find it in Australia Japan I mean it's around the entire planet this idea and now modern science is confirming what we assumed was merely some kind of superstitious nonsense of you know pre-scientific illiterate barbarians and we're realizing that those myths and those stories and epic tales that are handed down for centuries and centuries actually contain hard scientific truth from surviving eyewitnesses well if these craters actually do exist and they do right although seeing craters undeniable the nuclear glass throughout Asia and Europe undeniable human beings were alive then yes and if human beings were alive then they got fucked up there's no doubt about it yeah they did they would have suffered normally and just like you know if if you know if 3/4 of the species of animals in North America went extinct do you think that the 25% surviving came through completely unscathed no it simply means that there's a threshold above which a species is viable it can survive there's there and in below which you know there may have been survivors but there just weren't enough of them they were too widely scattered serious habitat loss which would have diminished food supply and they just died out but either directly or indirectly as a result of these catastrophic environmental changes that accompanied the ending of the Ice Age humans had to have been affected by this and all of the myths and the stories would totally concur with that idea you know that that there were humans and they're all consistent with this one detailed that there were some humans that had foreknowledge and so they built arks Deucalion built an ark just like Noah did looting a piston built an ark disatrous built an ark manu built an ark were these stories coming from you know are they just completely concerned up independently of one another and that detail is just thrown in or is there some kind of a reality behind this that there were people who had foreknowledge well if there were people that had foreknowledge it suggested suggests to me that there were two groups of survivors those who survived because they intentionally planned to survive they had foreknowledge they took steps to secure their survival in Freemasonry there was the account of of Lamech or the account of Enoch there's variants of on it but Enoch the story of Enoch in in in Masonic tradition says that Enoch had you know he was in the into the patriarchs before Noah had this foreknowledge that the world was going to be destroyed either by fire or flood so he created this underground vault it was deep underground and it was preserved within nine layers of stone it was nine layered vault and you only unless you had the key to accessing to how to access the vault which was now like a time capsule that preserved the science and the knowledge and the wisdom of the pre diluvian world or pre-flood world he then set up two pillars a pillar of brass and a pillar of marble the pillar of brass designed to withstand the effects of the Cataclysm the watery destruction the pillar of marble if I'm remembering it right was to withstand the the destruction by fire so there were these two pillars that basically informed any survivors that there was this nine chambered underground vault that contained the secrets of the previous world age that is what's coming to a pass and that's an intrinsic part of Masonic tradition in fact the whole Masonic symbolism is based around that idea and and it has parallels throughout other traditions as well well what I'm getting at here is if if there was some people who had foreknowledge of it and took steps to survive they were the ones who preserve the knowledge of the pre the the previous the antediluvian World Order the other survivors just survived by the luck of the draw like that tree standing there right they just happened to be in the right place at the right time they survived but now they are going to be the ones who are going to be wholly preoccupied simply with the task of surviving finding enough food to eat and shelter because clearly the planetary environment was going through all kinds of changes whereas the other group had taken actual steps to survive and preserve knowledge now when we look at the beginning of recorded history 4000 to 5000 years ago we're basically halfway back through the Holocene right okay let's for purposes of conjecture assume that at the end of the Holocene human population crashed right well if you want to build a pyramid or a great temple you've got to have a labor force right well if you've got scattered bands of survivors you basically aren't going to be able to accomplish that now let's assume that you've got two groups of humanity one that's sitting there with all of this knowledge at their disposal just like imagine if our modern society was wiped off the face of the earth but somebody somewhere in some deep cave underground was able to preserve our knowledge of physics and chemistry and in the various Sciences well obviously in order to run this computer that we're running here to do this broadcast requires an intact huge intact infrastructure right well we could know how to build a computer we could know how to do how to broadcast but if we don't have the infrastructure we're just sitting on information right well let's assume that you have a group that survived right and they've got they're the custodians of this body of knowledge right now it takes 3,000 4,000 5,000 years for the human population to reconstitute itself and now you've got a labor force and let's suppose that there's going to be another Cataclysm impending you know such as the one that perhaps caused the the Noah's Flood which you know there's evidence now that around 5,000 years ago there was an asteroid impact into the Indian Ocean right that plunged through 2 miles of ocean water and blasted a 12 mile wide hole on the floor of the Indian Ocean and what year was this this would have been about 5000 years ago now how much of an impact would that have had oh it would have created tsunamis well on the island of Madagascar on the southern island of Madagascar and it should be in this in this program that we've got open right here Jamie if you go to slide number yeah go to slide number 111 it's so ironic that today our focus is closer and closer to the cloud closer and closer to chips to solid-state hard drives all these different things that are just not gonna last right no paper no but no-one's carving anything in stone you know all the knowledge that we have is like how much of what what everybody has is on hard drives I mean how much of what everybody has is in the cloud on a you know a server somewhere yeah and who the fuck is going to be able to figure out how to read that shit a thousand years from now yeah just lightning happen to us yeah just like we're trying to figure out how to read a Gyptian hi laughs okay look at look at slide number hundred eleven now I wish I had my pointer here go to the next slide so you can see we okay right there you see you see those Wiggly things it's like dragon scales yeah what that is is it's water ocean water that washed on land and washed up and you see it kind of comes to a point and then it washed back out this is this is a tsunami deposit and those features that you're looking at they kind of look like this they're called Chevron's right that's what happens when the water washes in makes deposits of giant ripples and then washes back out what kind of time frame are you talking about when this happens I want this to do that Oh hours so that all happened in hours in hours yeah I mean you could still see it today oh yeah go to the next slide Jaime we're getting a closer up look here now you see how see how they're shaped almost V like mm-hmm that's the Chevron like a sergeant stripe almost right okay go to the next slide okay here's a cross section of one of those v-shaped Hills it's 600 feet and Heights wow that's incredible now what so what you're seeing in the back then up one more Jaime so those images right there what we're seeing there it looks like the effects of a river or water or something it is water yeah but then when you go back you see it from the ground it looks like hills yeah 600 feet high so you're talking about a massive amount of water we're talking about a tsunami who's minimum run-up height is the height the thickness of these hills 600 feet minimum minimum minimum and that's of course massive amount of weight and devastation and this was all five thousand years ago yeah go to the next slide Jaime yeah there's Madagascar location of the Chevron's on the southern edge of Madagascar let's see go to slides up and over on the other side at the same age if we look at the southwestern coast of Australia I think the next slide we'll get a closer in view there we go you see that splooge mm-hmm that's that's the technical scientific term is it really blue JH no I just made that you bet you see they see the stuff that's been washed over you can see it it's very clear there okay that's the other side of the ocean so the other side of the ocean directly opposite of where this thing impacted yeah goes against massive impact in the middle yeah ancient crash epic wood let's go back to that slide where from the where it says ancient crash epic wave next slide keep going right there right there can we read that yeah the southern end of Madagascar live for enormous wedge-shaped deposits called Chevron's that are composed of material from the ocean floor each covers twice the area of Manhattan with sediment as deep as the Chrysler Building is high on close inspection the Chevron deposits contain deep ocean micro fossils that are fused with medley of metals typically formed by cosmic impacts holy shit yeah yeah holy shit and so that if that happened four thousand eight hundred years ago mm-hmm what kind of an impact would that have had on human civilization oh well it was pretty much would have wiped out anything adjacent to the Indian Ocean anything close to it but what about on the other side of the planet I mean there'd have to be some massive effects oh there would be most likely what we would see on the other side of the planet is extreme weather events hurricanes torrential rain falls things like that when kill a huge amount of people worldwide could kill a human mount of people worldwide yes Wow and so that is probably the most recent one that's probably the most recent ah and no record of it because people really didn't have many records well I think the record of it is probably when we see these stories like Noah's Flood and the rest so that's probably about this one so it's not even about the Holocene one it's about one 5,000 years after the house yes see that's what we're beginning to realize now is that these events have happened with a much greater degree of frequency than anybody had imagined well congratulations you freak me the fuck out I just want to say you know you had an objective and you pulled it off five stars a plus freaked out wow this is this has been an intense three hours it just flew by three hours yeah we just did three hours Wow it's over yeah then amazing yeah we got to do this again I bet you could talk for another 16 hours yeah I mean we barely scratched the surface here oh please let's do it again let's take a couple months off regroup and come back in again oh I'd love to do some more please thank you very much for doing this I really really appreciate it is incredibly enjoyable incredibly enlightening for me I really really appreciate it I knew who's going to be like this just the brief conversation that we had a chance to have in Atlanta you know many years ago I've been looking forward to talking to you again thank you very much for doing this oh it's been awesome I really really have enjoyed if people want to research more of your work read more of your stuff where can they go what can they or can they find go to sacred geometry international.com and there are links there I've got another website that it's linked from there so I can sacred geometry international I deal with a bunch of different stuff not directly connected necessarily with what we're talking about here but there will be links to another website that I've got where I'm really exploring like the catastrophic stuff or I've got lots of images of things yeah because I've done lots and lots of field exploration they have thousands of images of just awesome stuff does the sacred geometry have anything to do with this stuff or is that a totally different sacred geometry put it this way as we've inherited this corpus of ancient knowledge sacred geometry is one of the keys for deciphering these ancient traditions because all of these ancient temple structures which are the textbooks in stone if you will have several components in in common astronomical and geometrical being the two predominant and if you understand the geometry you realize the geometry is like a universal code by where whereby you can preserve certain types of information because geometry is universal doesn't matter what your spoken language is the principles of geometry are what they are you know the relationship of a of a radius to a circle is the same and it doesn't matter what culture you come from you see and so geometry is a critical means of deciphering the the knowledge that and I think that the that the predominant way of preserving ancient knowledge is in the temple structures and they have to be looked at as textbooks in stone and once we begin to realize that then we can go it's like when you go to Egypt it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a part of it but it's also the geometry and the astronomy that's encoded there and we can see the same astronomy at work whether we're looking in Egypt whether in geometry or whether we're looking at megalithic structures in ancient England or whether we're looking at mega monumental earthworks up in the Ohio Valley or we're looking at the the mine you've been to Chichen itzá right okay that whole complex there is laid out according to principles of sacred geometry and astronomy and it's exactly the same principles underlying that as we find in Egypt that will be our next conversation so I'd be a great combo I can't wait I can't wait thank you so much really appreciate it Randall Carlson ladies and gentlemen you can follow him on Twitter it's sacred geo int for sacred geometry International mm-hmm so yeah so sacred geo int on on Twitter and sacred geometry international.com mm-hmm is the website thank you so much man really amazing and I can't wait to talk to you again I'm gonna start going over your material on your website and and gear up too for our next conversation man just amazing amazing stuff thanks to our sponsors thanks to on it com go to
