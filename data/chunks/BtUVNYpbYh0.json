[Laughter] reality sandwich work I was criticizing the felt stone date theory and it was only based on like one point the visual acuity point they were arguing about rollin Fisher's work on visual acuity being generally improved maybe that's wrong but it's still like to chart harp on one fairly insignificant portion of the theory the theory never made sense to me in that regard the the visual acuity thing because that's in low doses that's what you're saying or they're not eating low doses they're eating a lot of that shit well I've had low doses that they could find it you know they're they're eating probably tons of it well we talked to let me talk to a primatologist about it and he said that the time period that McKenna's using doesn't work for the way he understands climate the growth of the neocortex and predominance apparently so his theory about the massive expansion of our brain was did happen way before McKenna says the Stone Age figure was happening but then he might have been confused about that time period because they I believe Makenna Makenna know McKenna says the early Pleistocene era I think in like sorry I don't know well the theory for the folks who don't know what the fuck it is the theory is that at one point time monkeys climbed down from the trees and they were experimenting with new food sources and they started eating psilocybin mushrooms because there was great Kurds of ungulate cattle that were you know hooked cattle they were wandering around the fields dropping shits and that these mushrooms grow from these shits and these these monkeys and baboons have been then they've demonstrated them lifting up cow patties and looking for bugs and stuff yeah everything was all moister and that eating these mushrooms that grew on these these cows it's made them more more evolved and made like doubled the size the human brain me Adam you develop language religion yeah yeah look something happened sure look at us and look at them it's pretty fucking clear it's a big goddamn gap what what is this gap I I don't really think it's that crazy a crazy an idea and you know most people I talk to you there were the main responses scientists gave was like you know you need a time machine to really prove that very soon yeah don't get drunk one of the greatest worry about you can go to Trent I worked out with Steve Maxwell in Toronto and I would Indian Club bells there's this big fucking iron baseball path you know just wrong you know barely do it ten pounds now it's crazy it's a crazy exercise Seiler these 15 pounders and I'm gonna build up

reoccurring thing where I would pop out of his head so what I decided to do is just work out a lot I've been doing a lot of cardio a lot of get in the bag stuff actually about leaner and less less rolling and more like high rep kettlebell stuff and a lot of a lot of like different strength to conditioning shit because I this injury kept happening and kept it happened over the course of a few

done yours twice I did meirin's I did Ahri's did you like to in Marin's I did like doing there I did it really early I did it like probably when he I don't think he would ask me to do it now I did it when he was still like he's got a bunch of scrubs on that show [Laughter] way more advanced you're on actual show but it's I enjoy doing them I don't really know I don't know it's like I like I like hanging out with my friends it's an awesome tool for pumping up shows though man it really is nothing like as I like it people say to me you got did your workers podcast yeah I want to do Benson still yeah this is great too but I mean as far as like for promoting gigs it makes a huge difference man if you had your own you would really devote you of euralia serious website I not really now get the message board no you should get those yeah I said yeah yeah you develop a little community man I got a message board that there's almost four million posts on it more than 4 million right 4 million posts on it all these members and you can communicate back and forth these people so easy you could promote gigs so easy I mean it's like not like anything in the past your access to your fans it's like directed I answer tweets and I ants like the intelligent one that was it and and Facebook messages and stuff and then some stuff on my website but yeah I don't know maybe I've never been good at the marketing side yeah but this is the best way because it's fun yeah everything else we've done it's like wow I got a fucking promote on MySpace I do this you got to do that everything else has been like work but this does not seem like work at all this is like fun stop yeah you should do it man see Rousey's you could do it with Brian Brian Redman that's Ryan has producer extraordinaire that's Network dude he could immediately get you seen by hundreds of thousands of people do you have to have an angle you have to have an angle just go what we did today we didn't talk about what we're gonna do and I don't ever talk about what I'm gonna do I mean every now and then someone will be talking about some shit in the kitchen I like saying it here we are live in sunny California with the movie super high me star like is it like wandering around this life known everywhere you go as not just a STONER but a superstone it's pretty great fun you know most people leave me alone but you know the people that know there are usually pretty friendly about it you get you get it I'm yeah you're another notch above me as far as light as far as pot goes hot girl come up to me and start talking about fear factor or UFC yeah it's all pot weed yeah you know lots of podcast listeners and you know my podcasts all about movies so you know people want to talk to you out little beasts that's a nice kind of change of pace could you live anywhere that didn't have weed like California has now it's not like a prerequisite look if you thought about moving to some other part of the country like when I moved to Colorado one of the first things I thought I was like everything Colorado's got medical pot let's see what it's like there oh it's just like LA perfect yeah well that's the thing is all the places that I gravitate towards on the road are either places where the whole state has medical or a particular city is cooler than other cities you know so like it's more decriminalizing some places than others and those tend to be the same cities I enjoy performing in your like Austin Texas is a great example of like some places around there I'd being pretty you know I'd have to be pretty paranoid about my behavior yeah Austin you can sort of get away with I know you're doing an arbor michigan right oh yeah yeah I love that place fuck yeah that place is awesome that's a place where you wouldn't realize you wouldn't know but that's a place that had like a mash mash for years before Michigan passed the medical and I think also in ours probably reason why Medical got over the hump in Michigan because there's so into it that one city yeah have you ever seen the 4:20 day in Boulder mm-hmm fucking incredible they go on the collar on the University of Colorado they go on the campus and everyone smokes out like the whole campus like there's clouds of smoke like you've never seen anything but I get thousands of people passing joints around it's fuckin nuts yeah I'm always off somewhere doing a show when I get a good crowd on 4/20 we need you and I do a fucking show their next 4/20 ha ha April 20th in Boulder don't you do a thing don't don't commit me on camera every equal twentieth don't you do a thing where you record a new CD yes that's what I try to do yeah this in Sacramento that such a great weed town yeah it was fun to do it like yeah record a record standing in front of the Capitol building that they have drawn there on the wall at the punch line in Sacramento so it was pretty fun so you already have I'm out later this year but that's what I do is every year like you know there's a few cities I'm considering for uh you know for next year but it's just like it's a great night for me to record an album it's a great way for me to always know you know right people say 420 to me so much that it's always top of mind so like I know that like right now I know I've got like eleven months to get then you know the next material ready to go for another album right and so I'll start ditching the stuff from this album and replacing it with newer stuff but you know it's a whole cycle that if I go through that seems to be working so no boulders show bitches know but I definitely want a boulder event I'm definitely working on I think I'm gonna go do a show in Boulder in September yeah it is a great place to go and I've never done standing up there live or but I never performed there I think when I was living there was like I don't think I should be doing stand-up where I live so little town yeah yeah they got a couple they got a couple little theaters nice sized theaters awesome awesome town one of those rare towns a guy that said it best to work for the local paper said it's a working utopia it's one of a few it's like it's like a weird crazy Whoville town you know yeah yeah yeah it's got the nicest Whole Foods I've ever been involved in all the foods are usually pretty awesome so this one's yeah sonorus has a restaurant inside of it yeah
