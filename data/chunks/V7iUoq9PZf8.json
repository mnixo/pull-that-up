five four three two one Mike Baker ladies and gentlemen and we're live ladies and gentlemen what's going on buddy yeah the usual from wolves over here yeah that's right it's right I left the state of Idaho because because we're overrun with Wolf's wolves and and and that's it yeah that's all we got well I was just listening to a podcast where these guys were talking about wolves and about how they were hiking and they found four dead mature bull elk inside of like a couple mile stretch that had been torn apart by wolves and they started to freak out well I mean I had two things we got this time of year we got a lot of wolves and we got a lot of rattlesnakes the rattlesnakes are starting to you know pop up make their appearance warm yeah exactly and there are some seasons where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a rattlesnake and aggressive you swing at that cat a wolf will fill up and so that's not a good idea in case anybody's wondering I've never been I'm going June 30th to Boise I just announced the tickets today and it's fantastic I'm excited to be there but I keep hearing about wolves is that a real issue up there not at the CenturyLink arena it won't be a problem so you should be safe from that but yeah bring your gear and you know it's it's Idaho's an interesting place because you know it's a part time legislature right so which is the way I think all states should operate which means everybody goes home to their jobs well if you just look at the top of the state the governor butch Otter great guy Brad little lieutenant governor terrific guy they're both ranchers right so full time full time well yeah basically and they they look at it from a different problem yeah perspective right sorry you know here in California you know if you say you got a wolf problem I mean that that race is you know one perspective and one issue and there we have a people problem so we have a beautiful the wolves are amazing those wolves are so special and in a place like Idaho or you know you get a place like Montana or somewhere else I suppose they look at it differently right it's a working issue that you got it you got to sort out particularly if you're a rancher or you living off the land whatever so but I what boys he's gonna go crazy when they find out that you're coming up because you got it's a huge fanbase they love you up there it's all people stop me and want to talk about right I keep thinking you know something I'm sorry for interrupting and I think okay they can ask maybe something about North Korea right about Iran or some big it's not that you're not a big issue but then they'll say what's Jo like and well that's kind of what I say fuckin kids today damn it did you know Jo's North Korean you didn't know yeah I'm on the Senate by oh by the way before before I disappear down rabbit holes I need I need to say your biggest supporter your biggest fan probably in the entire UK is a young fella named Jack Burton I have known his family forever I've known this kid since he was a baby basically and going to school with my my my daughter and he is an enormous fan highly respects what you do he's getting his master's in physics and I promised him I give him a shout out so I've just done that Jack Burton Jack Burton staff standing by wolves yeah yeah they don't have that problem in London although that would make some kind of movie I think that's the werewolf out front oh that's right yeah a great space by the way thank you yeah I haven't been here since you give me the full tour I didn't give you the the gym side did you go to the other side I have not not yet no the gym and the indoor pool you've got a lot of stuff here yeah it's a great how big is that it looks like about 200,000 square feet it's 14 okay but compared to the last studio it's a lot bigger yeah I got bored with that other place that's too little that expand yeah way to get your rollerblades out you can go do laps or something I don't so we got a lot of shit to talk about some acre it was a lot going on in the world what are you scared about should I be scared about well I mean people are losing their minds right now over the past 24 hours because of Iran I really what you're hearing is you're hearing a lot of the the the critics of the current president and apparently there are some that are saying oh he's you know he's inching us closer to a military conflict with Iran well these are the same brainiacs that said he was inching us closer to a war with North Korea and they everybody was completely on that I'm not saying that rouhani and the others in the Iranian regime might not you know decide to become more bellicose but I think they're I think they're looking at it wrong I mean the this idea that cuz there's a couple of parts part one is that they're saying oh look it you know he doesn't have a plan P implying that it's either this deal which even our European allies say is inadequate right or it's a military conflict and that's kind of what the previous president was was all about we either get this dealer we're having a military conflict no there's other things in the works there's other options in that in that decision tree and so I think that's that's a false premise and the other thing when they talk about it over the past 24 hours anyways is that well look at this is gonna make it harder to get a deal with with Kim internal nuttin from North Korea's cuz he's gonna think that we don't we don't support our deals well I look at a different way I think that Kim jong-un's gonna look at this and think okay they're not gonna put up with an inadequate deal right so he's gonna look at it and say well yeah that because nobody disagrees with the Iranian deal they want to talk about they want to talk about how look the Iranians are complying with it well the Iranians are complying with what they agreed to allow in the deal right which is none of their military sites the number of times inspectors have have actually gotten on and inspected a military site including Parchin the most important military facility in Iran since that deal was signed in 2015 was zero haven't been there because the Iranians didn't agree to allow any of those sites in this deal so that's like that's like saying that's like saying if you're a serial killer you'll allow the police to come in and search your home but you can't go in the basement right not that also a cult is put their bodies in the basement put I have you know I suspect that's the case so anyway that's it's an interesting thing and I guess I wanted to throw that out there right off the bat because I think Iran right now is consuming so much of the oxygen for people out there so people thinking that the reason why we're backing out of the deal is because the president's being unreasonable and we're forcing well you're saying it's a shit deal period yeah I think the idea that we have to stay in it because it's better than the alternative and the alternative you know being war is is not framing it properly I don't think that doesn't make any sense to me but I think that the fact that the UK the the the French the Germans have all agreed publicly that it's an inadequate deal it needs to be fixed that tells you something but it also tells you that they have real strong financial incentives for continuing to do business in Iran they as to Russia and China frankly the other signatories so you know and also here's the other part I mean Trump you know what is it now or 16 or 17 months into Trump's administration so it's not like he got into the White House and the next day he you know he can the deal he's been talking but nobody listens to anything I'm not a supporter of Trump necessarily I mean I want the government to work so it's not that I'm supporting Trump I support the guy I want the government to work just like the previous administration I wasn't a supporter of Obama but hey I want it to work I want good things to happen and in also he you know he went out there and and there was some talk about let's see if we can't find some way to get rid of the sunset clause some way to rein in their ballistic missile development program something way although it's not going to happen to rein in all the the shenanigans if you want to call it that that they're engaged in the Middle East and that didn't happen so I think he you know took a step that is not as god-awful as his critics would like us to believe well that isn't that that's a real problem and it your phone's going off over there little fella oh yeah I'm gonna check your watch to I guess a world we're living in I know look okay I know this is gone you gotta check your watch my wife got me this this this Apple wha no flow now we're gonna it does it's waterproof I think to a certain time but it's it it does all such things I don't have a clue what it does she got it for me so I could check my heart rate and just you know for health reasons just you know if I'm out running or working out and she said yeah you should have something like that cuz i refuse to wear a Fitbit or whatever they call man different Sheena Fitbit in that well this I it's like Dick Tracy I could if I knew how to do it I could talk on my phone okay I could answer it it rings I have no clue and then it can't be too hard I don't think it's that Alright yeah okay call me somebody give me a shout it seems like a great thing but honestly God the only thing I'm used to so far is to glance at the time and then to check my heart rate all the other crap on there and everything happens on it right so if I'm using it my phone for directions I get directions on my watch right I mean it's a little bit overwhelming so I'm gonna go back to a normal watch I think and and if my heart keeps out it keeps out yeah I got this g-shock it does all kinds of shit never use it once hmm I use the time part altimeter and it works as a compass and all kinds of shit I've never compass is good yes we use it have we spent we spent a long time and this is this is how old I'm getting I guess but in our early training we spent a long time working maps and compass right you know shooting azmuth and figuring out where you're at and trying to fit and shooting azmuth yeah you know well figuring out yeah you're basically I don't know you know sounds oversimplify this but you're basically triangulating and figuring out where you are at any given point in time right I called azmuth yeah yeah it's that is a very good question and not one that I asked when I was in the outfit that was one of those people that would just accept things as they were told to me and that's why I got along so well I never questioned anything which is an interesting point I don't want to I don't want to roam all over this place but today was confirmation hearings for Gina Haspel mm-hmm and I I'll copy out this by saying I'm a big supporter of hers I think she's an outstanding choice for this she's the new right the new director designate for the CIA and so today she went up on Capitol Hill I had open and then subsequently a closed-door session with the the senators and some of the senators the reason I bring this up is because a handful of the Senators we're asking her and seemed focused on saying well you know how but with this rendition program the rendition and interrogation program how did you feel about it well you know morally what you know did you many quandary what you know we know that you you you you you know the agency was doing what was allowed within the Department of Justice because the Office of Legal Counsel was too correcting that from the Department of Justice for that program all those years ago and laws have subsequently changed but at the time they didn't want to necessarily talk about that cuz I don't think they wanted to highlight the fact that the DOJ had said this is you know what is able to be done so instead they focused on how did you feel and I I guess the reason I bring it up is because when I was in the outfit I'm not a deep thinker right so I never stood around and thought to myself how do I feel about this on any given moment right I mean no matter what we were doing it never occurred to me to sit there and question it you know as long as it we knew what we were doing was proper and legal and was pursuit of you know tasking from from national security concerns then yeah and I don't think you want your military or your Intel service I don't think you want everybody out there at the pointy edge of the spear you know saying well I'm gonna do things based on how I feel about it in the moment and it just seemed like a strange line of questioning who was responsible for that mm let me think they were actually they were there were three or four yeah Senator Reid and and so trying to understand well so what they did then was different than what is legal today is that the case yes exactly so the DOJ in after in the wake of 9/11 I mean there's so much here I mean in the wake of 9/11 you think about the context most people have you know young people don't even know what it feels like right I mean they do know that they've and and other people have forgotten or they just tired of it all they don't want to think about it but in the wake of 9/11 there was a there was a feeling there was a sense right that it was gonna happen again and there certainly was evidence and there was there was a very large effort here to try to make sure that we protected American lives so the DOJ was issuing very clear guidance on what could and could not be done for the rendition and interrogation program and that guidance was in you know provided to the general counsel at the agency that was then you know disseminated to personnel out in the field and tell tell people so the fidgets listeners for the first time what you used to do for the CIA so they understand you're coming from a position of you you actually understand this now yeah I was I did in the Operations Directorate so there the agency is made up of essentially a sage the name sometimes but four directorates so you have operations you have intelligence which is all the smart people reports are officers who are sorry the analysts you have science and technology which is where they develop all the amazing gear that comes out of the agency a lot of which then ends up in the commercial sector so if anybody is walking around with a defibrillator that battery technology came out of S&T research drones satellite technology the you to stealth program you to you know plane was was developed out of and run out of the agency so incredible things that come out of there and then admin but I was in the Operations Directorate and worked on everything from counter-narcotics operations to counterinsurgency operations and and and then obviously counterterrorism operations so I guess the point is that I mean there's something I'm not quite sure how to explain it but there's an interesting point that I think I've been pondering which is that listening to the hearing today and listening to the way that the Senators the Democratic senators who were looking to kind of make this the key issue there's there's a sense of we're not putting it in context of the time and in the national mood and that's a dangerous thing because the laws were different than they are now and they were different and what that means is that because in the wake of 9/11 and I don't want to say that that values change but I think that they do in the sense of what people are willing to to do and whether you're talking about okay we're willing to have a rendition interrogation program in the wake of 9/11 now we're not of course and so I think it's anyway I think there's a there's a danger to that line of questioning where they kept talking about how how did it how did you feel about it it's not you you're they're mixing this and I'm not eloquent enough to explain it but I found it fascinating that that was a question they wanted to focus on I think there's a real danger to people or fur people that don't have any experience in actual war or really understand combat or really understand what can happen and what can go wrong in talking about it with the same sort of language that you would use to describe office politics yes yes I they got to see that's what I damnit that's what I was trying to say you know how do you feel how do you feel about this we don't want a bad work environment should we torture no we want to save lives but we don't want this kind of feel bad we don't want him to feel bad and I mean look there was actually this this is some people we're entertaining the idea that you know Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would come out and you know talk to the Senators you know as you're going through this confirmation process about what feelings what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was a mastermind of 9/11 and he actually requested yeah to talk about her right and about about his guess I just wanted to reflect on yeah the whole the yeah you know from his perspective and isn't he still locked up yeah he's you want anima BAE yeah you know god forbid he should rot in jail but you know I think it's it's kind of where we've it's sort of where we've come to and I think in part again because there's distance right there's too much and so anyway she should again she should be confirmed the the whole rendition interrogation program was reviewed at nauseam thousands of pages written and interestingly enough a lot of the people up there on the hill right now in this confirmation process the senators who are saying that they need to know more but the same ones who were there before so theoretically either they didn't read all the material that was given to them about this where they'd forgotten it or their you know this or in reality this is more about Trump than it is about her hmm which you know I don't want to be shocking anyone by saying that perhaps there's political grandstanding going on but she is eminently qualified never happened no I wouldn't happen up there not in America maybe somewhere else not here yeah so anyway you you you support her you think she's an excellent choice and look 707 operational tours several management positions and I guess at the end of the day it comes down to I would rather have somebody who's gone through that experience she played a small role she was not a senior person by the way John Brennan was far more senior in the organization at the time of that program being Ron and he was confirmed as President Obama's director so maybe the Senators have a different standard for a female candidate I don't know but do you think it's down everything it's maybe more time since 9/11 you know obviously Obama came into office it was not that long after 9/11 there was still you know seven years later still thoughts in people's mind about it well interesting enough I mean that was in 2013 when he was confirmed but in 2009 he was they wanted to confirm it or they wanted to bring him up as the appointee for the director of the CIA for again it would been President Obama's first term but they decided not to because they for the reason that they thought well maybe it's too close to after thee and they didn't want to go through the the heartburn of having this process so instead they brought him into the White House he became assistant to the President and deputy national security dude for counterterrorism and then four years later they brought him in as a you know then confirmed him as the director for the CIA so I guess and and he has now come out in support of Gina Haspel a new director designate so I think she will get there as she should the focus should be going forward she's been very clear about we are not revisiting the old days of rendition interrogation it's not going to happen and she's been very clear about that and including today during the hearing so hopefully hopefully it'll it'll get done because it's it would be nice to think the senators would do their job and choose somebody who's appropriate for the job well it's just it's strange who gets to choose and who doesn't get to choose who runs an organization like the CIA and whether or not they have an actual understanding of what goes on behind the scenes yeah that's a really good it's a good point because some of the questions today from some of the Senators made you believe that perhaps they don't really do that I don't I don't be glib you know look they all sit on the committees they theoretically are privy to all this information there is a very well worn path that goes from Langley where the agency headquarters is based up to Capitol Hill but from briefer is going back and forth and back and forth and discussing programs and that you know the classified material but these people a gang of eight the people that are the minority majority leaders the heads of the committee's the Intel committees they're all privy to this information and they were all privy to the information about the rendition program in the interrogation program and they all knew about it there were no objections raised at that time 2002-2003 so these people all knew about it so maybe those senators are asking her how she feels about it now maybe they should turn around look in the mirror and ask themselves how they feel about it but they're not gonna do that so anyway that an enough said she's eminently qualified should happen because we got big issues we got it Rob got North Korea we got the you know dealings with China in the south or in the South Pacific we got issues with Russia we had a lot of things you know what I really wanted to ask you about so we've been discussing this and I don't really understand it um it was about Huawei that Chinese company electronics company they make these kick-ass phones and the State Department has said please do not buy them yes yeah along with CTE another quote if you start from the premise that the China is the number one perpetrator of economic espionage and theft of intellectual property and also by the way the number one perpetrator out there of cyber shenanigans you know our activity in cyberspace because it's so bad with that theft of intellectual property they have fake Apple stores over in China with all fake Apple stuff yes fake Apple laptops fake Apple phones everything fake the labels look identical none of it is actually Apple product and it all works frankly as well yeah I mean it's all good stuff you know midcity it yeah it's astounding and so the reason why they're they're raising the alarm with Huawei and ZTE is because of the voracious appetite of the Chinese government and their commercial sector for information and it's a little bit like shutting the door after the horse is headed down the hill because we're late to the game they've been doing this for years and years and years they've been oddly enough you know a lot of our military gear have parts in the manufacturing in China and so you know if we should have been raising the concern about this and talking with and trying to come to terms with this issue years ago but we're trying to have that conversation with them now and up on Capitol Hill you know the Congress is trying to enact legislation kind of like the squaw way thing they're doing it in a clumsy fashion but the overriding principle is correct in that China made some decisions years ago that they were going to become a major power in the world in a certain timeframe and to do that by definition you got to compress your research and development time right and there's one way to do that and essentially that's to steal information to acquire information if I want to be diplomatic about it and that's what they've done Japan came out of World War two and their idea was we're gonna become a major power through manufacturing so they did they built up their manufacturing base and created this this this amazing result China decided we're gonna skip the R&D for the most part and all of that entails the cost and time involved and they've they're very adept at it they they throw an enormous amount of resource out there into hoovering up everything not just from us but from everybody and using that to advance their goals they have no firewall between their Intel service and PLA military intelligence and others and their commercial sector so you know not only are they there to protect national security they're there to promote the commercial side of China and that's why it's so important and so that's why they're talking about Huawei because of the potential for them to use their their reach to further their desire for information whatever it may be they'll Hoover it up and then decide whether it's useful or not but they have the resource to do that as opposed to you know a smaller country that maybe doesn't have the resource and it's much more targeted and focused on their Intel collection or their efforts to gather information so that's that's sort of yeah that was a wordy explanation no but it makes sense and it's when I read it I read a bunch of tech articles where people were questioning whether or not it's even possible for a while way to be using those phones to spy on people but then there was some other articles where Huawei was being charged with what was it again they were using there was they were selling illegal technology to Iran there was something they were there breaking the sanctions I think yeah they were there was no no that couldn't yeah they were but is what so they were they were selling things to Iran and this was a big part of it that they were what the tech people were saying they were incredulous here Huawei under is that you again you said Jesus Christ I've turned this thing off you don't have to do I would I would put it on airplane mode but I don't have a clue okay get your phone watches your watch out and now it's I feel like Dick Tracy it really does feel like Dick Tracy are your kids the idea of talking on your phone be so ridiculous like what that's never take it off the password comes on immediately oh really no no that's a dial tone that's a that's yeah Laurie okay right now people are thinking really it's hilarious because you're talking about technology and then this happens so we're talking about whether or not we should be worried about Huawei and you can't even figure out how to use your fucker yeah that's that's perfectly understand anybody that knows me knows that that's the case because I mean and and beckon to be fair back in the old days that's again we had compasses and maps yes you know but even when we started developing new technology and keira quite frankly if you got to go out do anything the first thing you do is throw everything away that's got a battery on them right yeah and so we weren't necessarily you dumb it down because you assume something's gonna go wrong and usually it does and usually it's based on on kit on gear and so yeah I never really became very adept at it we've got a we've got a I got a this three little boys scooter Sluggo and Mugsy and and I got hilarious names and their dere hilarious there's great kids but we we got a gaming system I'm trying to remember what the hell xbox or playstation xbox and say hey Xbox and because my youngest Mugsy he's he's only six and so he still says trill to pronounce his words right so it's Xbox I can't do it does it sound stupid what I do when he does it's normally cute so we got this thing and I'll sit there with him and try to play like NBA 2k or something and it just doesn't work it's not intuitive to me right there's nothing that's intuitive about its know how to angle shit and press the right button I know they're not they just assume they're gonna get it you can unlock hidden characters by moving the joystick a funny way yeah and Mugsy talks there LeBron James directly apparently then communicated through Xbox now so yeah so the detect people that are skeptical what they're saying is that if Huawei really did have something in their phones that allowed them to spy on people you'd be able to find it and the tech guys would find it do you buy that here here's what I would say about that is that I'm sure there's obviously a lot of very smart tech guys and within diligence for all your information and security needs we have some very smart tech people but when you're talking about the Chinese state and the resources and capabilities that that entails yes if you're if you're saying that NSA could possibly detect this but if you're talking about just dispersing you know kid out into the marketplace and the way that that thing gets spread and disseminated and inserted into companies and and then potentially allows points of access into these businesses and again it doesn't matter it's not like they just have to go after IBM or rate the honors I mean they're going after everything because it potentially is all of interest to them so their idea is to just steal as much technology and as much intellectual property as they can and recreate it over in China that has been the plan I don't want to keep you know I don't want to you know demonize an entire nation right exactly but they have proven themselves enormous ly adept at doing this and they've they and not that others don't Russia does the same thing all variety of others you know they even you know a lot of our hours everybody if to the degree that they have the resources and the motivation and they consider it an issue related national security whatever it might be they're willing to do it they're willing to try so it is it is interesting but yeah the hallway thing in the ZTE again I I think the the rollout of that concern in there the rollout of sort of trying to provide guidance has been a little clumsy mmm so one one thing that was speculation was that people didn't have to worry about the phones but what essentially they're trying to do is cripple the company financially and not allow them to get a foothold in America because they're the third largest cellphone manufacturer in the world number one Apple number two Samsung they're number three but in America no one knows who they are and so the idea is what they're trying to do is make sure that the Chinese government doesn't get a foothold in this company in this country where those companies or Huawei the company Huawei becomes a popular brand for people to buy and that would allow them even if they didn't have any spy device on this phone it would allow them to get other devices into people's homes that could potentially spy on them and then more importantly get into companies right and spy on the companies and this is one of the pieces of speculations that I read about was that they had certain servers that were sending an exorbitant amount of information out and they were trying to figure out what was going on with them and that there was like an excessive amount of information that was leaked data that was leaving the servers versus coming in and they're like this really seems like some fucked up shit going on this right Huawei first of all Huawei is already present here in the country they manufacture a lot of things besides phones and so they've already got of a pretty big footprint in this country and and with our allies as well so I mean I think it's smart to consider the the nature of a particular regime or government you know when you're talking about the potential for their products to enter into the commercial sector where they may have access because if if they've shown a pattern of activity for a hiring intellectual property which is again a very delicate way to put it then I don't think it's a stretch to say we should be concerned by their efforts to put communications gear even if it seems pedestrian at the outset into the marketplace so I I'm not sure that I'm buying the idea that it's some nefarious plan to shut out Huawei so that they don't get a foothold in the phone business no and I say that because I've been you know thirty years I've been you know dealing with the Chinese in terms of their efforts to acquire information both in the government and commercial side of things so I come at it from a very cynical point of view much like I do with the Iranian issue and and the likelihood that they have not been living up to you know their their part of the bargain and people will say well again I go back to the same thing we've been inspecting and they've been complying with all of that well yeah you know this limited amount of inspection that we have to their civilian sites there's no it's it's it's not a secret you know at this point it shouldn't be a secret that again we have no access to their military facilities so I tend to look at things in that view and I and I if I see a pattern of activity I'm very reluctant to think there's somehow going to stop that pattern of activity for whatever reason so again North Korea same thing the problem with all of this North Korea Iran Syria and chemical weapons the problem with all of that I realize I'm kind of jumping around I've just hallways over here but is the verification issue it's always the the weak link in any type of agreement related to containing a weapons program its verification and we know that we you know it's it's something we should know anyway we keep we seem to keep forgetting it so unless we can lock that down with the North Koreans then you know a deal with them or a deal with the Iranians or a deal with the Syrians over their chemical weapons efforts and it's it's it's not worth anything so that's that's where you the focus has to be and for whatever reason the previous administration was keen to get this deal done and they were willing to set aside this issue of all the military sites set aside the issue of ballistic missiles and by the way the deal president has just scuttled did nothing to impact or effect or tamp down or moderate their behavior they've got more influence in the Middle East and they've had ever before they're engaged more activity related to you know the countries in the Middle East against our interests than they have been in in in decades so that that all by itself should tell us well you know I'm not saying that they're using all the money we gave them to support you know actions against our interests by Hezbollah or by Revolutionary Guard or others but they are and so you know I I get I don't have a lot of angst over the idea that we we step away from the deal for a period of time maybe we can come up with something better and we should we should always keep the mock diplomacy open always have a channel of communications that's important keep doing that but be pragmatic and realistic about what you've gotten right now we don't we don't have that much and don't buy huawei phones and don't well I would you know what that actually care I know they make a great frog but that came open that in the CI a confirmation hearing oh really yeah they literally said I forget which senator it was asked Gina Haspel about Huawei and ZTE and I don't know where they were going with it but then it devolved into just trying to get us all those send the confirmation questions do it just comes at you know the senator saying I just want a yes or no answer you know like wait a bit I don't know why don't you want some detail but so they say yes or no what you by hallway in cheetah Haspel was like well no I wouldn't buy alcohol wait fault okay yeah there's your answer so but I'm sure it left a lot of people wondering and scratching their heads thinking what are they talking about Chinese phones for that's a weird thing to ask someone yes or no it seems like it was a pretty complex situation yeah are you uh are we gonna take care of North Korea yes or no yes I mean well I you know it becomes a bit of a sideshow and it's a format as well any confirmation hearing is you know five minutes for each senator and yeah you can't you know they spend three minutes making a statement right you know that they can then you know send back in sound clips to their their constituents maybe they get a question in and and it kind of goes from there so it's you don't really learn much which is fine you know they learn a lot in the closed-door sessions and we rely on the Senators to make decisions when it's classified information on behalf of the people they represent so that's how it's supposed to work yeah I always like to finish my sentences what do I know I my wife always says what do you do that what do you leave me impression that you don't know anything good wise you have to hook a little bit I guess let me get out of here I know see ya it is what it is running up the flagpole salutes what are you most concerned with if you look at all the international stuff that's going on yeah that's a really good question is there one thing that you don't think people are looking at well I you know I give people you know a lot of credit I think people are a lot more engaged than sometimes I think the media gives them credit for I mean list of conversations I have when people want to talk about something other than Joe Rogan I get the impression that they're paying attention to what's happening out there you know I run yeah is it a big deal well it is a big deal but it's it's a regional issue and I think there is a way we're going to get some success here I think it actually is going to work out to our benefit I'm not buying the doomsayers you say it's it's all heading to a conflict so I'm not looking at that one you know nothing really stands out I guess if you said what's what's the biggest concern from a security perspective to the to the country it would be the same thing it's been last year in the year before and for a number of years which is the frailty of our infrastructure and its susceptibility to either cyber attack or physical attack and that's select the power grid power Internet yeah all of that banking system and water Russian submarines camped out over the internet lines in the ocean yeah which sounds like a cold war movie right yeah but it happens I mean the Russian side look the Russians never thought there was a peace dividend from the end of the Cold War they never thought the Cold War ended you know and we we all like surprised that Putin engaged in meddling in the 2016 election of course he was they've been doing that forever so and we have to them as well right oh I don't know about that maybe from a defensive sure we're just looking after our own yes yeah here's what I would say about that is and again everybody speaks from their own experience people have their own you know perspective my perspective is based on what I've seen in in a lot of places around this planet we better hope we do it and we better hope we do it well because it's a very aggressive world out there and so when people kind of roll their eyes and go oh well we do it as well you know so we kind of like dismissing the whole activity I guess my point is yeah I get what you're saying you know okay we know I'm not saying it from a self-righteous point that the Chinese are very good at you know acquiring an electric property or I'm not saying from self-righteous points the Russians have been meddling in our elections I'm just saying that's the way it is you better hope we do it very very well that's my argument for people that are super progressive and really liberal when that when it comes to these conversations I always say all right if the world is the way it's described if China really is constantly meddling if Russia is really actively trying to sabotage our elections if Iran is really doing what they're what should we do you don't think that we should be involved in in meddling you know I think you should be involved in manipulating or monitoring or making sure that our interests are safe or that we're not gonna get attacked the idea that we're never gonna get attacked you know no one's gonna get attacked that doesn't even well you look at human history that is completely preposterous yeah yes I do attacks and all war is gonna somehow another stop because you eat vegan right that's fucking crazy I mean that's that's a crazy way to look at the world and that leaves you incredibly vulnerable to attack no it's nice it does it but that but you're right I hadn't thought about but but that is this notion that if we if we just we have to speak to our better angels you know Jesus well that's great because nobody else is going to write every other nation action its own best interest and we're the ones who seem to always apologize for it but we better hope that we do because it is a chaotic messy aggressive place out there and you may want it to be different but it's not and it's kind of like that that questioning today and the CIA designate confirmation hearing how do you feel about it well at the end of the day it doesn't matter how you feel about it what are the laws on the books follow those laws you know protect the American interests and in national security and if you don't feel good about it then leave and go do something else but this idea that you know somehow we're all gonna do imagine you know a combat get out there and have them decide well I mean I don't really feel good about this particular action you know maybe we should stay back it's not how the world works so you know I don't know hey it'd be great if we all could be better people isn't it again we're talking and you know this is coming from a person that hasn't experienced combat but we're talking about a bunch of people that really don't understand and really haven't seen things that you've seen or seen it's things that the military seen and they're talking about the world in this sort of idealized rose-colored glasses view of things that's not accurate and so they're their version of what America should do is based on it's based on ignorance in this idea that we don't need intelligence we don't need a military we don't need a presence in all these other countries I yeah I just don't I don't buy that I don't think that makes sense when you look at all the different conflicts that are going on in the world yeah I agree I think that there is a there's an element out there that says if we just take Iran as an example and I've spoken with people who who honestly seem to believe that in part because the previous administration I mean now former secretary Kerry's out there publicly and President Obama is out to really they're all saying well but the Iranians have been complying so it's you know they're implying that it's our fault it's our fault for backing out of this it's our fault that somehow that the Iranians have been cheating on the missile sanction so this the the the UN even agreed in at the end of 2014 that in just in October of that year the Iranians had been busting agreements related to their ballistic missiles and their development and we signed that agreement a few months later three months later right it happens you know no matter what you may want to think it is it's it's a messy place I would love it to be different I would love everybody to get along and it would be great think what we could do if we didn't have a defense budget and we can all be lonely happy yeah be wonderful but flowers everywhere oh my god and unicorns but maybe not utilize I guess that physically now that's right I could probably have one pop out of my watch I'm impressed I know the passcode I was about to actually do the passcode and say it out loud I haven't find yourself doing that like was you typing a number I was about to do that here while I was putting in my passcode anyway well people are always gonna have an idealized version in the world especially especially where they don't experience it themselves but I think that for the most part when people think of intelligence communities if they think about the CIA or the FBI generally for whatever reason in America you get a negative response people don't think about it in terms of something that's necessary and beneficial and really a cornerstone of the protection of the people in this country they don't think of it that way right no I think that's been a tradition you could go back to we'll work to the end of World War two OSS which was the the founding organization that then became later on the CIA amazing people involved in OSS and basically they what they did during the war was incredible so anyway but they do this and while bill Donald Donovan was the head of OSS so imagine all these dedicated people dropping in behind enemy lines both in the European and Japanese theater and engaged in all this activity for for the years that it took to win that war and we got out of the war finished and I'm assuming most people listening know how that ended and Truman literally just kind of writes a little note to Bill Donovan I've seen the note and it says you know bill you know hey great job thanks so much wrapping it up you know all the best good luck in the future and they shut down OSS right they don't need it anymore they didn't need the Intel service because we won the war and things are gonna be looking pretty good well about a year later you know they they got the band back together because what was happening and the Soviets were running you know all over the place and and it was the Cold War and the Soviets had no intention of being benign and living in a community of nations and so suddenly they got the band back and said let's okay so that's when the CIA was created 1947 at the end of the Cold War not that long ago although it seems like ancient history now there were a lot of serious people in Washington DC at when the Wall fell who basically said let's wrap up the agency we don't need the CIA anymore so there's this pattern of you know people want and that's good people want to think the best and that's a good thing I mean Americans tend to be whether it's ideological or naive or just optimistic whatever it is that's a good thing right but it butts up against the reality of how the world actually works well because in America things are pretty good I mean yeah they're about as good as it gets in the world when you wander around America for a large a nation as this is things are pretty goddamn good for the most part yeah and I think that's part of the problem is that these people they're not traveling to these war zones they're not experiencing and I've talked to so many people that have been overseas and been to these places of conflict and they come out with a dark view of what is possible if you're in the wrong place on the planet yeah what people can do to each other is is a yeah it can get messy but I think there would be value if somehow we could enact some program where everybody had to spend a couple of years in service of some sort military service or overseas service I know we had the Peace Corps and all of that but you know and and in high school kids say well I went to Bermuda and I built a house for a week so I got my international experience oh that's better it's better than nothing but I mean I think something that would would mean people would have a little more skin in the game and and but you're right I mean you go to some of these places fourth and fifth world countries and and you do realize and I'm people roll their eyes but I damn it this is the best country in the world and I say that repeatedly and I believe it firmly we make mistakes there's no doubt about it but we tend to course-correct we try sometimes it takes a little bit longer we no matter what administrations there we try to do the right thing and so when people talk about you know us just stepping off and and and not worrying about our place in the world you know someone's going to try to take that position on the ladder and it's not going to be as benign as we tend to be not always again again I realize we make mistakes I find ok flying I'm not gonna sell flagellate over it but you know still we do a pretty damn good job we tried to be the moral authority of the world or the moral compass at least I mean that's the the thought process behind it for the most right that's the thought process yeah yeah and and you know sometimes again yeah it's a human endeavor so it's not gonna work all the time don't you think the people are more open to this idea that it's necessary now because of the the Russian situation and because of understanding the the amount of power the Putin wheels in the way he has just really ultimate control over that part of the world and he really does yeah you you could drone on all you want about democratic elections but we all know that's horseshit I mean he fucking kills everybody over there that's a legitimate threat kills anybody over there that's a journalist over there I mean look they just they try the bag sir gets crippled and his daughter Yulia she was she was collateral damage but I put some shit on a doorknob yeah that they touched with their hands a nerve agent them in and put them in the hospital and who knows if they're even gonna recover from that I mean think about she's out of the hospital now she's doing good he's doing a little bit better but I mean think about what that entails as an operation right not that they haven't they've been doing this since they killed what's-his-name Trotsky in Mexico right I mean they this is what they do but you know Markov Litvinenko Alexander Litvinenko they killed him with the polonium now a handful of years ago so they go after Sergey he's living in a small relatively small quiet you know British town Salisbury and so that requires him to surveil Sergey they got to get out you know because you always have to do that you can do some operation like this you got to know what you're getting into you got to figure out how you're going to do it and so there's a lot of you got to front-load all that work right and so they're doing all this surveillance they're figuring out what their operational game plan is going to be you know this is in the UK right and their whole point of the exercise is to teach other people don't don't you know betray us right and and so you know then they they put this on the doorknob they didn't care who else touch that now it wasn't like they could they could guarantee that the most men and a variety of visitors weren't gonna come through the door so they really they really don't care yeah he is he is definitely he's a he's a old-school KGB very easy cat to understand you know and we've always kind of acted like you know we don't get it or somehow he's gonna change his stripes he's never gonna change his stripes and he's gonna always act in what he believes to be the best interest of what he would like to believe is to still the former Soviet Union yeah and Garry Kasparov was talking about him and he's a vocal critic of Putin and he was saying that if you look into all the different companies that they've confiscated and acquired and you know the this is what they do like if they have a political enemy they essentially just take over their company and charge them with some sort of a crime and throw him in jail did they do this to billionaires right in the quartic offski yeah he spent years in jail and and his mistake was his mistake was he started getting political aspirations and so the deal has always been with Putin as far as the oligarchs concerned you keep your nose in business right you focus on your business you know there's gonna be a cut going towards the government and you're good you know and because it furthers my agenda right and you're building up these businesses and you know we're making some money on the side but as soon as any of them start to veer off that path and maybe get some political aspiration then it's done and that's and that's when he turns on them so and he's been very effective at doing it yeah I mean terrifyingly so and does it open publicly yeah yeah and it could again it it's we look at it from a different perspective we look at it go like how could people with a straight face you know stand by while he gets a fourth term and it's just like you know president for life right well look over China she has spent the past few years locking that down right yeah building up the security apparatus you know kind of stepping on this idea that somehow there's a rule of law he's now built back up this this this cult of personality that we haven't really seen since you know den Xiaoping or certainly Mao and he's there for good and so that gives them a strategic advantage right because they can look at problems in the long haul whereas here we're looking at it in an election cycle so when we've got a major issue to deal with with China she's not looking at it and thinking okay well I sort this out in the next short period of time he's looking and thinking Trump's got maybe two years left right right maybe maybe he gets reelected maybe he doesn't you know no idea but that's how he's that's how he's processing this and it's gonna be a transitionary time in between the two candidates or the two presidents where things get real sloppy and they might be able to slip in something right I mean and you talk about that I mean the Chinese really do play the long game right they really play the long game they'll they'll put an asset here in the country to go to school right and they'll their only job is to get excellent grades and then they'll go to grad school no get excellent grades and then they'll go get a job somewhere and it doesn't really matter who necessarily where they get a job but they'll get a job and then they'll get another job and eventually they are working at a rate the honor they're working at Corning or they're working at some company that's got some relevance from their perspective in terms of what they do and that's a 25 30 year commitment right and they and they do that all the time and you know we tend to look at things in the shorter timeframe right I mean even from an Intel service yeah you know I mean well you know our officers will get out there and they'll think okay we got to make some recruitments you know and I got maybe two years here and on the ground if it's that sort of deployment or that sort of tour and it's not that 30-year commitment Brian because if I'm the officer I'm getting promoted based on how many recruitments I get I'm not going to necessarily promoted based on how well I handle assets that have already been promoted and that was the plot of that young Americans show right the the show about Russian yeah pies that have pretended to be just normal American citizens moved in did the whole thing talk with the normal accent mm-hmm that's right that came out of that New Jersey incident with Anna Chapman yeah and that was those those individuals were just basically there to exist right their whole point of being was just to see whether they bump in somebody of interest and they wouldn't gonna be responsible for them developing that potential target that would be somebody else's responsibility and that person who was had the responsibility develop that target it wouldn't be their responsibility to maybe you know task them or make some sort of like pitch that would be somebody else's responsibility so there's people up that food chain and then taking on more and more responsibility if they fought happened to find a targets of interest that's there and that's just the resources devoted to one part of the country so it's a cautious well-thought-out long-term plan yeah I mean it's it's and it's I mean sometimes the Russians are just like a shotgun approach right they'll pitch everybody and see what happens right they're not quite as as patient and as long-term as the Chinese are I've caught Chinese spies doing this as well oh sure yeah we just bagged one who was working on behalf of the Chinese government against interests of the agency how long ago was this and it's just past I mean it's it's become public over the past week in particular but it's been bubbling away for a while what's this dude's name and yeah I'm gonna leave it at that it's only because I'm not sure if I've seen it in print but Chinese American and you know obviously part of the attraction for bringing that person into the agency was their Chinese language right right well part of the attraction from the Chinese Intel perspective is the Chinese ethnic background first generation second generation third generation doesn't matter they tend to play off that very well so anyway this individual worked for the agency for a period of time and then left and then set up shop overseas and then his actions became suspect and so that's that's when we ended up getting him but that happens and when you catch somebody who's been engaged in that first thought is you know thank God we caught him and the second is how did someone how does someone do that how does somebody know you know I say that again not to be self righteous because we're always out there looking for targets you know to recruit to turn on their country so you know if we could find ourselves in Iranian scientists it's not like we would be coy and say well we don't want to put them in under that stress of recruiting them of course we don't for a national security interest but I mean just from a cycle respective you think about that you know it's our idea is that we're doing that stuff for good writing that they're doing that stuff for bad which is very convenient that we think that way but right right but I guess you're absolutely right and and you know I understand the people out there who say well that's you know you can't make that equivalence I don't know but I had never had any problem I never had any problem determining the good people from the bad people you know and that's like today one of the senators in the confirmation hearing hey I'm sorry to keep going back to the CIA director designate confirmation hearings up on the hill but one of the senators it almost sound like you just want to make some moral equivalency between terrorists and agency officers who were doing what they were allowed to do underneath the laws of that time and the DOJ Department of Justice regulations and legal readings and and this point was well if you waterboarded somebody well then what happens if one of your people got picked up by terrorists and they were waterboarded would you think that that was justified and I'm thinking okay wait wait it's a very odd constructor if we requested and you know I big frankly if Isis are al-qaeda or Boko Haram picked up one of our people and all they did would waterboard them you know that would be a happy day right because yeah they don't operate under any laws and which is what Gina Haspel said she handled the question very well and kind of shut it down but this idea that sometimes you'll bump into that where people I don't know what it is I'd the they're apologists they wanted to act as if we're the bad guys and and anyway yeah yeah what am I know that's exactly what it is right I was about to say what do I know but that is exactly what it is it's like there's apologists and they're also trying to frame a narrative instead of trying to understand the situation objectively instead of really asking someone who was there asking a bunch of people who were there getting a sense of what was the climate what was going on what actually happened instead they're trying to frame it in a like wouldn't it be justified if someone got a hold of one of our troops and did that to them would that be justified they're scouring Brown points yeah yeah no I think that's true I think this there's so little and it's obviously much worse right now with it with the current administration the president Trump it just seems like nobody I mean it's like World War one right everybody's in their trenches throwing hand grenades each other nobody's in the middle ground nobody's even trying to get up and go into the middle ground and so nobody's having those conversations like you said where they they even make a lame attempt to try to understand what the other perspective might be you know and in particular it's exhausting in the sense that not everything that this administration again you know the caveat be I didn't vote for Trump I didn't vote for Clinton you know we got 300 and what 20 million people in this country you think we could have come up with two other candidates yeah but who did you vote for you know what I just sounds really lame but I just sat it out I couldn't get myself to go vote for I just thought I mean I was gonna vote for Ronald Reagan's ashes or something but I you know that I defecate I'd be the only person so I didn't I didn't vote I couldn't I couldn't figure out how we got to that point hmm and yeah the one person who should really be pissed off was Bernie Sanders I mean the only collusion we've really proven up to this point yeah is that the ID C colluding to keep Bernie down and people sweep that under the rug so quick it's so adorable it's adorable how people just make it like that's not a big deal that the deleting of 30,000 emails not a big deal collusion with the DNC to rig the primaries not a big deal yeah and Bernie god blessed me played the good soldier and you know fell on the sword and has it really well he hasn't made much of an issue of it I think it's because he has aspirations to move forward and he knows they own one now and he knows that Hillary Clinton is essentially done that's interesting what if they try to bring her back in 2020 people go fucking crazy she might actually be thinking that well I'm sure she what yeah they probably got on a vitamin IV drip right now and given her hormone replacement therapy and I decided to do yoga I I don't think she'll I don't I just don't see her being resurrected but maybe I'll try maybe so I do think Joe Biden's you think so yeah I think he's viewing this I think he's very up with himself not upset with others but I think he he probably thinks at this stage of the game of times were definite was tough when regarding his family but I think he probably regrets not going in the last time hmm and I think we're gonna see him throw his hat in the ring because he's gonna look around he's gonna think what am i up against I'm up against Harrison Booker and you know who else I mean I think he's got some baggage though oh he don't forget about when I was in Boston we used to have Joe Biden night at stitches comedy club where we would plagiarize each other's jokes Joe Biden people don't remember this but in the 1980s he got busted plagiarizing Kennedy speeches yeah yeah people forgot about that he ran for president in 88 yeah yeah and that's a good point you know we everybody loves the guy that's sitting on the bench right yeah so there were a lot of Democrats I think after the fact that I think oh my god if Joe had just run but he's run a couple of times hasn't worked out yeah and so I'll put him up yeah yeah it would have been true so I you know anyway but what I it's it's the politics of it all are fascinating but did you see the crazy shit when Trump was saying he beat him up he's like crazy Joe Biden so that he could beat me and beat me up and he would go down fast and hard just gone with that I think they should have done some sort of celebrity match that's when I was young and like let me let me be the commentator can you see what that I mean the president definitely Peters that both of them would die yeah oh no no they get in the cage and it would be all over I'm thinking five minutes a hair pull Amy pull whatever little hair they have left the old schools the old school wrestling Trump yeah that sure thing with the boots we got to get this going yeah anyway it was just so ridiculous to see Trump tweeting that he would beat up Joe Biden if they ever fought yeah like what who the fuck have you ever fought ever if you were you thrown a punch this is the world we live in I mean if I mean you think about all that you think you think about the things we should be talking about on a daily basis right right and yet because of the self-inflicted wounds that they constantly have coming out the White House because of his tweeting for the most part people aren't focusing on you know look we should all be able to agree Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree that yeah if you can get your way to peace on the Korean Peninsula that's pretty damn good yeah they just released the three North Korean prisoner well American citizen prisoners who were held in North Korea so secretary Pompeo is flying back right now from Pyongyang right and he's bringing those three back that's a good thing that's a very good thing but we can't but it's the way they got there that freaks people out I am saying his nuclear buttons bigger than the other guys and it's like but I got to tell you I was really happy watching the video of kim jeong-hoon shaking hands with the president of South Korea and the meeting and the DMZ I was happy that that to me was like wow like that made me think this might they're both smiling I know Kim Jong Un's a fucking murderer and he killed his own uncle yeah his nephews and all these different people that he thought might go against him but seeing him shake hands with the president of South Korea made me think like wow they might settle this they could I mean look that's a very first time his granddad Kim il-sung and then his dad Kim jong-il neither of them ever stepped foot on the southern side of that DMZ on the south side of peace village never happened so that in itself you're absolutely right was that's that's a major development now maybe nothing comes of it right it's a low-percentage shot you have to agree there's so many moving parts so maybe nothing comes of it and I think the administration is making that case saying look we have to be realistic but you know this is a good thing that it's moving in that direction it's something right it's something and in fact now this guy's a young guy who actually likes Dennis Rodman Christ I mean well in his playing days yeah I like Dennis Rodman a lot right I just didn't know somebody now yeah I didn't anticipate he would develop in today the character that he is now right but he also seems to be like some sort of a spokesman yeah Butler America talking to Korea it's weird do you remember Robin as a player man yeah ah defense he was out of rebounding that guy could and I could rebound if you talk to people that know him that we're partying with him that guy would be up all night drinking and partying and then show up and play fucking phenomenal the next day on zero sleep like here comes another title oh yeah Billy Corgan was friends with Rodman and Billy Corgan from the stage on the podcast was talking about how they were mad at him because Rodman was taking Billy Corgan partying and then showing up the next day with zero sleep and playing and they were blaming Billy Kourtney's like motherfucker I went to sleep he's like that guy was still still up that's fantastic pop kids are coming out to Boise Oh everybody pigs coming out the boys I like boys hey listen man the way you talk about it I'm thinking about getting a fucking house out there Wall Street Journal just had now you know some of my friends said you got stopped talking about Boise but the of their The Wall Street Journal has had an

it and he's raising this baby badger and he says that you can given the option to fight or flight there were often fight but if they're bottle-fed handled constantly and extremely well socialized they can be kept in captivity for for easily or easily and make fun pets how crazy is that guys got a pet badger God don't piss that thing off no I said nothing to do with a badger although it's a booster talking about small animals somebody sent me a clip of an incident where a police officer was driving down the road and he stopped traffic on both sides because a groundhog was trying to come across the street and so he was trying to it was about a quarter of the way across this two-lane road and he was trying to back it off the street okay that was a nice humanitarian thing right he's trying to help this animal get officer dozen get hit by cars and this he keeps trying to keeps trying it's not working you know the groundhog won't leave and eventually the groundhog I guess something snapped in his mind and he decided you know fuck this something go after this police officer right alright so he kind of waddles up to the police officer but this is it yeah that's it now watch what happens this is insane so the cop is then oh he didn't shoot it he did he got on his knees and shot the fucking groundhog I like how they blur it out yeah the identity see that yeah the identity of the groundhog yeah so let's move now watch now it's still moving does he show it again yes but watch it comes that form again well that seems inappropriate a groundhog Oh police said was blocking traffic was fatally shot Sunday eclair was in the was this Maryland oh boy he realized it was not responding as expected for an animal that was not being cornered or trapped believing the groundhog to be either sick or injured he shot it and I loved it I love this response I am sure the officer did the best thing in this situation it's not for me to judge yeah if you can't kick a groundhogs ass you shouldn't be coming after you sidestep yeah and also you can't take it down with one shot what the hell's wrong with that Wow how slow is it moving - it was just it was like they're not the fastest animals no yeah so it was not in a full sprint towards this officer I'm just saying who knows none of us can put ourselves in that officers shoes let's just put it that way he's got an irrational fear of mammals yeah none of us have been in in combat against a small animal woodland creature yeah what I mean what a fucking groundhog I don't what do you gotta do it seems like you just get out of the way you have to shoot a groundhog yeah just get back in your cruiser and assume people are gonna drive around it yeah anyway I thought that was interesting and someone thought I was interesting enough to send along so I was crazy I did that I think sometimes you give people a gun they're just looking to shoot some fucking with society that's right it's like that old far side cartoon with the vultures sitting up there and saying I'm just gonna kill so you know that expression if you only have a hammer everything seems like a man yeah exactly yeah I mean if you gave that cop a can of bear spray that's a good point less than deadly force right yeah it could have tased it probably probably killed it and killed it right would have made for a more interesting video just give him a tennis racket slap it in the ass just pull the tennis racket off your utility belt it stopped traffic that sounds like a dumb ground squirrel - he's about to get it fucked up by a dumb ground squirrel yeah it was suicide by cop maybe it was one of those deals you think it was just squirrel I've had enough like crazy person that rushes the cop cuz he wants to die we get that night oh you get that there that just like don't want to end it all right it didn't they just like come out of nowhere and and you know they've been sitting in the bushes waiting for you to drive by so yeah I get super confused during September October November during the rut in particular like when they get horny there's a video a hilarious video this deer that's so fucked up from the rut this guy walks up to it and taps it on the head with an arrow it's my severe even catches wind that you're at 200 yards away they fucking bound out of there like the hills are on fire how did you do out in Hawaii got to I got to access deer that look great yeah there it is so this this deer is just amazing from rutting paralyzed and confuse with his own hormones and this guy walks up to it and just taps it okay this is crazy like this thing is just so baffled hey buddy there there I mean that is crazy deer hi yeah yeah when they get rutted up like when they're like I've never seen anything like this before but sometimes they just blow a fuse this is he's tapping the antlers hey fella it's just too much to the process for that deer yeah look at this yeah it's going as I could leave but know what to do but it doesn't seem like it understands life anymore probably thought if he just stands really still he won't be spotted nothing is that there and now he takes off what in the fuck man that just that's his hormones that's men yeah yeah so guys get their kidney stolen from Russian you know those gals that take your kidney you wake up in a bathtub p'lice and your wallets gonna heard that before yeah oh yeah organs missing yeah yeah it used to happen out in Southeast Asia there were occasionally reports of that oh yeah I was out there for quite a while and occasionally you'd hear you had some reports some dude getting screwed up and you know next thing you know he wakes up and he's missing a kidney or real yeah probably did have it did happen you think about what that means so not only this to do get knocked out but then you got to get the doctor in right you know the girls probably aren't doing on themselves rubber gloves on wait right just yeah yeah it sounds like a bad movie well it could be a good movie actually very good yeah so it does it does happen and and all the more reason to always know where your pants are that's a good move yeah I don't know you should definitely know your pants are no way your parents are I know what you're drinking kids just I'm just telling you kids yeah I used to tell my dad my daughter's falling off you know how I keep bashing China and their intellectual property Asians my daughter is now in China well no working in Beijing working for the government no no no she's working thank you and she's a great kid but she always says you know dad could you just could you just not maybe bash them as often as you do if I'm flying back over there to you know to work yeah ask her questions hmm although I will say I was giving a speech one time about about national security issues and and I got off on the subject of the intellectual property theft that's perpetrated by a lot of different countries and it was a large conference and so I'm talking about the Chinese and their their tendency to do this and I look down there I see a guy that I know who's with one of the companies that brought me in for this speech and and he's got this little funny look on his face like oh my god I can't believe you talked about this and he kind of like motions over there and they're in like the third row of this this area is this contingent of Chinese business folks sitting there and they just look and I've just been spending ten minutes just just railing and talking about you know how awful they can be sometimes in this whole although good I praised them because they're good at it they look to it they were just horrified about this whole thing and what am I gonna do I can't walk that back you know so yeah anyway look it is what it is if you don't want me to talk about it don't do it don't do it yeah yeah so that's uh that's another issue I'm just ticking off all the issues that we've solved here so far we get that we're gonna fix the world here Mike Baker yeah with that North Korean release of those prisoners that's a good thing it's a good thing and I think both Trump and pence I think are going out to Andrews Air Force Base to meet them as they come in Wow and you know but it will be it'll be interesting to see look it wasn't it I think was an easy give for Kim jong-un to do and what were they over there imprisoned for mmm well one of them one of them was a businessman and he was serving 10 years hard labor imagine hard labor camp in North Korea for supposedly for espionage he's a business guy and they don't care I mean they've done this numerous times in the past it really doesn't matter if you show up and you're in business the other two were also interesting they were academics they were at the Pyongyang University for science and technology both of them were teaching there which is enough where I got my degree and my undergrad degree Pyongyang University I went there for the sports and and I worked during the years as the man it's the Pyongyang missiles like a guy dressed as a missile I just got a carry remember where I always go with this story and so I just like rambling until I get my head straight I'm like that deer in that video so those two were were again the same thing supposedly engaged in espionage and so they got chucked in so we'll see I mean I you know whether whether we're able to get anything from this who knows but that's a good sign the fact that he met with as you pointed out president moon from South Korea a very good sign the Chinese have they sent their foreign minister over to gongyang a couple weeks ago first time for ministers been over there and maybe 11 years 12 years Wow so they understand the importance of this and I think everybody's the dynamic is shifted because I think you know we've kicked the can down the road for so long that they're basically at the point where their programs or you don't close to being fully developed and I think that you know the Chinese understand that that means that all those other options perhaps of kicking the can down the road aren't on the decision tree anymore and so you know we they don't want chaos on the peninsula they don't want military conflict nobody does and so I think the Chinese for basically the first time have been aggressively assisting with the sanctions that were put in place mmm that had a very quick response on Kim jong-un he's not suicidal he just wants to survive in position of leadership right so he's looking at it thinking okay the calculus has changed so I gotta do something different and again you know being pragmatic maybe it doesn't work but at least we're trying and I think that's a good thing no unquestionably it's a good thing and also the video that North Korean soldier fleeing and getting shot shot at as he escapes North Korea I mean that had to get to North Korea too and they realized like Jesus Christ is a second guy and how many months that was fleeing like that and and got away and they're finding parasites in their body and yeah extreme malnourished and this is a soldier so you got to think everybody over there is probably in an entire straight right and I've talked about this in terms of just just a simple if not simple but the idea that you know the population in terms of its physical stature compared to the South Koreans is you know they're shorter they're there and that's a malnutrition issue I think also I think they've realized that there's only so much they can do going forward to lock the place down right and technology at some point even though it's North Korea and there's not a lot there there's enough and I think there's a sense that they you know how long thinking they can control the population the way they have so again he's not the Kim is not suicidal he wants to maintain power when you think about every country action its own best interest or every leader acts in their own best interest that's his thought process and and how do I do that well okay you know maybe so I think that you know it could happen we could get something really good out of this we'll see you know but the Iranians are watching it and North Koreans are watching what we did over there Ron I disagree that's that whole notion that North Koreans are gonna look at it and go that means we can't trust him look if President Obama was so enamored with that that deal that he made with the Iranians well then take it to the Senate right yeah get it make it a treaty you made an agreement an executive order basically and so you know they're not looking I don't think the North Koreans are looking at this and going Trump is going back on his word I think they're looking at going Trump's okay he means that he's not gonna put up with a bad deal mm and this wasn't that good a deal so I think that's the way that they would process it and and we'll see but you know who knows where the Iranians gonna go with what they're doing and people right now listening for ever thinking okay I'm tired of listen about the Iranians well that seems to be something you're really concerned about well I think only because you know if it's if it's not handled properly and there's a lot of moving parts meeting our allies meaning the wild card of what rouhani and the regime is going to do but look make no mistake there's no there's no this idea that somehow they this was in a moderate Iranian regime all you gotta do is look at what they're engaged in doing in in the Lebanon in Yemen in a proxy war with with the Saudis and others in Iraq and Syria in in the work that they're doing and all the soldiers a US soldiers they killed in Iraq you know through the provision of weapons the training that they gave to to the Iraqis that were fighting against us look at all of that you think you know at what point you know did somebody make some decision that the Iranians were you know somehow moderate because they're not that regime isn't you know the people themselves I think we keep hoping one day I mean I go all the way back to the default of the Shah and you know people hoping that the people will rise up and overthrow the clerics do you think it's the same attitude that causes people to be apologists like the same attitude that's causing people to ask how do you feel about those people being tortured is it the same sort of mentality that allows people to want those Iranians to be the wants of people that are in power to be moderate yeah I think so I think it's it's I think there's an element of that I think it's it's it's a desire to again sort of think well of POD that part of it I don't really understand again because you would think that you would base that on people's performance and I got to do is look at past performance of the clerics and the regime there and around there runs things and I don't know how you come away from it thinking well yeah they're being actually pretty pretty Maude to being pretty conciliatory I you know and that's what we got the previous administration did they just stretched themselves then trying to sell this deal I mean they did everything they could to try to you know race to it make sure it was gonna happen they set things aside and you know we've caught the Iranians in the past cheating and there's this business with Netanyahu and he came out with this information that they pulled out of this warehouse where was being stored yes that was you know historical covered the period in 1999 to 2003 it was that again well that worked Mossad had an operation that they engaged in there was a warehouse in Tehran where the Iranian regime rather than destroy all their research and all the work they were doing on nuclear weapons up until that time you know during that time they stored it and so they put it in a warehouse facility Mossad and some others liaison service found out that that the location and then they mounted an operation which is a very labor intensive to try to you guys do a lot of surveillance you get a recruit assets who can provide you with you know key information about this and then eventually they hiked out a bunch of these documents they didn't page of documents and almost 200 cedis and that information covers 1999 to 2003 and one of the things that it shows definitively is that see one of the things the Iranians were doing were they were designing and looking to build a minimum of five nuclear warheads right for their ballistic missiles that they're also developing a building which puts a nail in that whole idea that it was nothing but a peaceful program but people looking at it their apologist in the same I it's it's old history it's old news it doesn't tell us anything new well it tells us and confirms to us what we've been saying all along which is they you know they were lying about it and they were lying about the extent of their centrifuge operations the extent of the stored materials that they had and so you know I'm not I just don't know how you make that leap to then say okay now they're fine you know now though now we can believe them why because I don't I don't get that part so I'm not willing to see it until they want to give us a hundred percent access to all their sites they want to say come on in and look at Parchin come on and look at the military facilities that we used to where we used for weapons development in the past great now you got something and now I'll back off and say okay you know maybe that's a good deal actually give us access to all those sites and let us go in and look around the IAEA which is the International Organization for inspection of these nuclear sites they spent 12 years trying to figure out what the hell was going on at Parchin which is a military site near Tehran and never never were able to get the access they needed never were able to solve the you know the question and they went on and on with that investigation well guess what as a result of the drive by the administration to get a deal signed part of the the conditions from the Iranian regime was that they stopped this investigation just draw a line under it they had no they had no answers but they just said well now what I gotta start a deal unless you stop that investigation so so we did we stopped the investigation and then like I said they also say well you can't visit our sites our military sites oh okay fine we won't you know by the way we know this doesn't affect our ballistic missile technology developments or weapons program okay fine who made these decisions well this was this was two years as former secretary Kerry would like to say you know I was true here as a diplomatic work and hard negotiation hard negotiations come on you know so you know we worked reportedly in concert with the Brits and the French and the Germans and the Russians and the Chinese although it's mostly you know from our side and you know it is what it is so are they complying with what they've got in the terms of the agreement yeah fine but I like I said I I just think and it kind of goes to that point about there's the truth is always kind of in the middle right I mean the truth is somewhere there it's not like it's not it's not me throwing you know grenades at the progressives are left or the Democrats saying you know it's a terrible deal it sucks I said no look I deal could be good and I'm glad that we've been able to inspect those sites that have been available that's a good thing but don't couch it as something that's not and you know if the Brits and the French and the Germans are now willing to say it's an inadequate deal but we still want to stay in you know that should that should tell people something and and you know but anyway you know it's that's not where we're at we're at everybody stands around screaming at the sky because they're upset about one side of the other and yeah the crap doesn't get done how much time do you spend thinking about this cuz you're you're you're in civilian life now yeah yeah you know wha or are you ever really in civilian life oh you're in civilian life yeah no we are of course we are yeah and and thank God for that because it's a young person's game but I spent I probably spend more time I don't have a lot of friends so so I invite you go fishing come on Joe be my friend go fishing with me well just sit around say like it was good fishing but I only wanted to do was talk about it Ron fucking boring so yeah you know I'd probably spend a little more time but I will tell you what's fun is it is it some of it does rub off right like my three little guys you know or even my daughter she loves International Fair she loves international you know relations and and what's going on in the world she travels a lot and I think that's good right so maybe some of that rubbed off you know sitting around the dinner table and talking about these things or me banging on about it and I thought every now and then I think I'm being boring but maybe they picked up on something and sometimes my kids will will say something you know and they'll like like scooter the oldest one he's on me it should he's only ten years old the governor came in or a governor candidate coming cuz we're coming up on an election cycle a governor candidate came in and good guy we don't you know a nice guy and he came in and to talk to hit Ben's class right fifth grade class and you know been raised his hand during the question period and said so what would you do differently because Idaho was ranked 43rd in education and I know he said this because this guy they called me says your kid asked this question more homework but you know the point being is you know my wife the world's greatest person and is in politics and focused and you know strategy and campaign problems and all sorts of things so she talks about as well so maybe the kids absorb something like that and maybe if you talk about these things at home this is not rocket science right but have you talked about these things at home maybe the kids do pick up on some of it or they they start to imagine that there's something else other than just you know what happens on the schoolyard you know I don't know I know so I guess there's an upside to it I don't know where I'm going with that feeling like oh my god there's certainly an upside to talking about things yeah and the more kids know now the better it is but we don't teach civics right we don't teach civics in school that the workings of government how the government is supposed to work yeah most people get out of high school and they barely understand what's the difference between the Congress and the Senate right and so then then you get what we get which is people reading crap on Twitter and thinking that it's it's it's always true or that's how they form their opinion or it's all this or it's all that the world is not that the world exists somewhere in the in the middle ground but we don't we I don't think we you know we're failing our kids by a desire to make life easier for them maybe I don't know I think there's definitely some truth to that I mean I think there's a shocking lack of adversary or adversity rather that a lot of people have to go through in this life and you go through too much soft living you start to develop these lazy habits and this distorted perception of reality and a lack of understanding of what what really hard work is and how difficult it is to get by in this life if you don't live in this cushy place that we live in did you work when you were a kid did you work summer jobs yeah yeah yeah a lot of construction jobs yes Lee yeah I mean the same thing we you know I blacktop parking lots there's a job right yeah it's a good it's it's but you know what you made some money yeah you felt good about at the end of the day you were exhausted but I tell my kids I mean I get you thinking I have to start you know that the oldest ones gonna be 11 soon it's time for him to do something get a paper route you know mow lawns so he's making mow lawns at 11 sure yeah I could have mowed lawns this year but yeah and they seems early that's not that's not I didn't have a lawnmower job when I was eleven that seems really no I don't think so I think it's you know you tell them where not to put their feet in their hands in there good let the little fella have a life time involved in sports yeah they don't play they'll play a lot of lacrosse to play a lot of basketball they know yes women team yeah they shovel snow they get out there the tenure on the a low-level snow during a winter six year olds like hmm yeah mugs he's not doing a lot of he's gonna be management I think that's what he's gonna do he's gonna be management somehow but yeah you know the work ethic I think you're absolutely right I mean we every every generation right like my parents wanted it to be easier for me and my brothers right yeah and their parents yeah I'm sure wanted to be easier for them right nobody and so you do that but eventually you get to diminishing returns because it becomes so easy and you know the kids forget what it is like to actually have to work for something and to compete and to compete and you know we can all it's it's like that's I saw some story now that I troll the social media but there was a story that popped up that some community they had a cheer squad tryout and one of the girls didn't make it on cheer squad I don't know what's your school I guess it's cheerleaders and the mom was upset and so she went and complained and so the school decision was that everybody who tried out gets to be on the squad yeah you imagine what that looks like yeah you gotta teach kids the opposite that if you didn't do good enough you need to figure out what you did wrong and go back and improve and work on it and then if you do get in next year you'll get an amazing feeling of accomplishment rather than an amazing feeling of entitlement right huge you belong in everything you try out for yeah that's gonna be a big fat wake-up call when you go out to compete in the workforce right nobody's get a job oh my god nobody nobody's gonna cut you any slack theoretically yeah but no that's that that's right the idea that you know you've got a you know I mean it's like my two old boys are you know people say local mics now talking about kids all the time my two little boys I've gotten to the point now where the sports thing they play and if they don't play well they sit right because earlier than that you know everybody plays so that's equal playing time you know that's what you typically get the coaches you know and that's a good thing that little kids are learning how to play the game of where to stand and all the rest of it so but then they get to a certain point it becomes merit-based ours should anyway which is how it works in Idaho basically at least where the teams at work we were associated with instead if you're if you don't play that well then maybe don't make the team and if you make the team and you're not playing as well as the other kids and you're sitting on the bench and so you know my kids you know whether it first started happening you know they were just they were complaining you know like that you know screw it I'm not getting any playing time and I'm thinking well okay what's the next part of that thought process that you need to work your way through if you're not getting enough playing time it's because you're not what playing as well as you should be compared to the other kids therefore what do you need to do so you have to walk them through this process and that's okay because kids don't know this stuff inherently maybe right and so you teach them that it but you don't teach them that well yeah you're right you why don't you try a different sport or you know or you're right we should talk to the coach about you or worse they're making it too difficult for the children and they're not having a good time and it should be about companionship and it shouldn't be about competition well you're setting your kid up for failure yeah because it can be about both it could be about companionship but also about competition and I look the world's competition it's filled with it if you're not competing if you're if you just decide you don't want to have anything to do with competition that's your choice but if you engage in something that does require competition you want special access right right right yeah if you if you don't if you got that nature if you don't have that competitive side of you and okay fine but then don't go through the rest of life thinking well just because life is a competition you know which you know may upset you when you find that out that you don't get special dispensation just because you're not a competitive person it does it yes so I agree with the participation trophies ah nonsense it's going on today well I was I was I was walking one of my boys they always went off to off the lacrosse field not too go and he said how'd I do and I said well uh you could have done better you could have played harder he just wasn't into it right he was tired I or whatever so he kind of looked at me and I didn't realize I was walking there were some parents around me and as we were walking across the field and so he kind of looks at me and I like I knew what he was thinking which is dad that's not right and so I looked I said do you want me to be honest with you do you want me to just you know stand here and blow smoke up your ass and I found out afterwards did a couple of parents were upset about the fact that I would say that but he knew exactly what I meant he said now you should be honest and I said well ditch the parents you upset at you for being honest yeah yeah exactly and and you know to be fair Mugsy the youngest one got called in for this he got called for using the word douche bag one time but funnier a funnier one was when he and two of his buddies who shall not be named were out in the playground not too long ago and they were sitting down in there playing some game right there was recess and all the kids all the different grades are out there running around and everybody knows my little kid you know Mugsy he's like the mayor of the town he's just a jolly happy guy he's he's gonna be the guy that takes ten years to get out of college right and so he and his two old buddies are sitting there playing some game where they gotta count with their fingers so at one point jack has the number one he puts up a finger and one of the other kids starts laughing and because he's got an older brother who told him what it means so he tells him what he means so they start shouting this out and this word they start shot and well a couple of the older kids walk by they hear these three kids say Oh signal yelling this way and laughing uproariously because I think it's a funniest strucken thing they've ever heard and so they get called into the principal well what happens next I have to find out about this right so now they notify the parents and admittedly the principal is laughing when they they're telling this story but now I have to have a conversation with Mugsy when I come home so I come home and I said much anything happened today he goes no I haven't happened he walked right by me and I said wait wait wait come back here I said you get called into the principal's he goes oh yeah he said we were let me see we were playing on the playground and I went like this and you know what this means no I don't need to know and I look at the corner of my eye see his two older brother like around the corner just waiting because they know he's gonna get his ass kicked right further for this and they're just like they can't wait and so I said oh I don't need to know what it is just don't do it again whatever you do don't do it again and he goes no no no no you got to know what this means he's really intent on it and so I said and he's two other boys currently he's gonna get stuff and I said all right what does it mean and I had no idea what he was gonna say but what he did say was motherfucker that's what they were yelling on the playground that's a door and I started laughing the tube other boys walked away disgusted that I was laughing and that's the end of my story so they're great kids so how do you take that genie and put it back in the bottle you know yeah you just say don't use it you know start screaming motherfucker and they're yeah okay there's not much you can do bewdley throwing their finger up in the air it's hard to do I mean I find myself having to constantly catch myself I'll say you know things like hey you know you quit jackass and around and then I think okay I probably shouldn't say that you know but I ended but that's fine yeah I can't get you know my dad was the greatest guy I've ever known in my life and he swore and it didn't scar me in any way I don't have a problem with it it's part of what I do for a living but when I was when I what I was we were in we're skiing with my youngest daughter who was three and we're packing up the stuff and she forgot to pack her helmet and her helmet wasn't packed in the thing and she looks down at her luggage she looks down the helmet she goes shit this is something adorable she was three at the time about a three year old let's see if she could get together with Mugsy then she could have said shit you could have said what happened she could said I forgot my motherfucking helmet then she's got a completely sentence there's something really cute about kids wearing yes it's just adorable we try to tell them you know don't don't yeah we try to teach them the basics don't swear the problem is that they're gonna it seems so attractive yeah to do because they're not supposed to do it and when noise around like you know what I heard I remember I found a new word starts with the sea yeah oh you know they're doing it you know that yeah what's that one we learned everything we learned from older brothers right or some friends who had older brothers you know but it was it was a slower process right because we didn't on the internet and all that crap and so I think what you you learn to look it took a little bit longer you know to learn like I don't think I've really rolled out douchebag till I was probably 12 maybe 13 yeah but we were talking yesterday about access to the Internet where kids see so much more and hear so much more today like they're especially like violent images and their access to terrible things and there's just so much that if you leave a kid alone with a computer or a phone that's online oh yeah yeah they're just gonna find out everything about the world before their little brains are ready no you can't do it you got it you've got to be you got to lock it down right I mean it's a good thing they got to learn the technology unlike what i fairly what i apparently did i'm gonna leave my my my watch here for you since i don't know how to use it but you're gonna let them get online well they can do that they can do school research right if they need to they can like the the middle one loves basketball he loves basketball so he can look up you know Steph Curry videos things like that Smurfs they've got supervision right they have to have supervision you have to know what they're doing but if you're rikes if you let them have free rein as it's a freak zone out there yeah and they'll find it just by accident and you're right I think their minds can I mean ya can't ask kids to process all the crap that's out there on the Internet add that at that early age it's not fair it's not right and it you can't tell me that there's not some correlation between access to all that imaging and violent images in everything else and some of the problems that we have in the world today when we ask how does that kid how does he go so far off the rails of the stills a gun or takes a gun out of the house and shoots up a place how does that happen and I keep I don't know I mean you again I'm not a I'm not a psychiatrist so people don't listen to me and take that as medical advice but I know what you're saying I mean there's there's a reality of the world that we live and these these images the I mean you're you're not gonna stop you're not gonna change the world that we live in by limiting the access these kids have to these things but it is strange how much access we have to disturbing images violence violent videos and there's just like your brain knows that that's out there and that there's just so many more examples of it to watch let me think if you were 12 years old or whatever and you know in the old days yeah maybe you found out where your dad stored the playboys Yeah right that was it yeah in this case a cardboard box in the back hall closet then that was you know that was it but that was what you I mean that's how you learned yeah I never saw I mean I saw a few altercations in my neighborhood when I was growing up but like like a real violent encounter I never saw anything no no shoot-'em-up games now that we've got so we use that that Xbox I talked about it's all sports games you can't the whole Gears of War and Call of Duty and all the rest of it they don't allow that no you can't you can't do that but then again you know your kid will go out to his friend's house yup the next thing you know they're exploding and so you know what do you do you kid you're right you can't protect them but you got it you got to do your best but the world's changing and it's just but it's changing faster than we realize The Improv in regard to the impact that it has on kids I just think it's changing for the people that are adults like wow the world is changing yeah it's changing for that four-year-old that's growing up in that world right now and they're gonna have the moment they get online they're gonna it's gonna go from I'm just a little kid live my little kid that's what Mommy that's my daddy too woof that I dig world all in one big smash and I don't think anybody's a little I don't think in adults brain is designed to handle most this shit that we have access to long gone now I forget about a growing mind and what what influence that has on society is really yet to be determined what are they doing to that donkey and why yeah I know that was a career you can engage in now it's it is I've got it like I said I got a daughter there's an interesting age difference right so what is it that's about 1213 years age difference right and so I feel like I've there's a social thing that we is you can study this is a case study what my daughter went through growing up in access to information which was uniquely different than now even though you know she started there was really no internet or anything but then it exploded by the time she was essentially a tween I guess well the difference in you and I who grew up with nothing mmm right no internet and then it became the Internet when we're fully formed and as an adult and then you got a chance to see it and even then screwed it up and made mistakes and got online with thing got viruses on your computer and saw some stuff you really didn't want to see had that dial tone and then the picture would kind of come in in little little blips oh yeah realize when you didn't really want to see it anymore when was it when did you get first get a cell phone I got one real early I got a cell phone in the 80s Wow yeah well I was a comedian and like 89 I think I had a cell phone I had a cell phone in my car it was like permanently bolted down to my cross yeah yeah yeah I got it so I could get the thing about it was I could get gigs with it so like some people get a hold of you yeah okay like Bill blumen right who was the owner of the Wilbur theater in Boston who was owner of the comedy connection back then always jokes around about it was like you got a lot of work because you were the only comedian with a cell phone like so he could call me up and say hey you know this guy just got a flat tire on his way to New Hampshire can you do the gig I'm like fuck yeah I'm in I'm there I'm already at my carcass that's where my phone is how much do you have to pay for that phone I don't remember it's I could have been cheap no I couldn't afford I remember not being able to pay for it after a while yeah it was just I was a dummy I always spent more money than I had I mean it's yeah I've never been good with finances I've never been frugal but he's one of those things where I realized I could get it so I got it but you remember those times you have to drive around a few before that before you had that vet phone in your car you have to drive when I'm looking for a public pay phone oh yeah and you're getting your quarters right or you had to have a calling card remember those things yeah I've never card you I would get I would get fake cards too you could buy them off people they were like like counterfeit cards and they were good for a couple days and they'd go under and you could buy other ones and then there was other things you could do you could take a sound device and put it up to the phone and you could get a get along with that like you would put up this thing to the voice box area and it would make noises like yeah yeah and it would somehow or another open up the yeah yeah the line yeah no I I remember we stood before the you know before the cell phone technology hit and this is the early days of being with the agency when you were overseas if you were in an urban setting you spent half your time looking for operating payphones right you know some third or fourth world country you're trying to find a payphone that actually works he's got to make some sort of you know call related to whatever operation you're engaged in and you know the kids the kids the kids today and the agency don't understand that you know because they've all got you know great technology and and mobile communications but yeah in the old days it didn't didn't work that way those people even know what a phone booth is no I yeah exactly they'd say like about fights that's like a common expression these two could have fought in a phone booth they could have fought I can't even say it could have fought you know a phone booth but today you say fought in a phone booth and people go why don't just say they could have fought on a fucking you know something else that doesn't exist anymore a wine barrel this well it London go to London now and you know there's those iconic red phone booth yeah I'm not a phony now just get him up yeah I think they kept him update you could probably find one occasionally that's got a phone in it but it wasn't that long ago I remember they actually had functioning phones you would go outside any 7-eleven or whatever and they were dead a bank of payphones I actually stopped and took a picture I was having forget where I was on nowhere pulled into a gas station I was pulling out after oddly enough getting gas and I looked over the side and there was a payphone against the wall I another the receiver was just dangling on the ground but I literally stopped got out took a picture of it so I could show my kids you know we used to make calls on these things this is how it worked I remember when there was no answering machines remember that yeah yeah and the first answering machine and you whoever your buddy wasn't got the answering machine first you thought man that's the deal that's so posh and I remember we got a answering machine where you could call it and then when the dial tone went on you would punch in like a code yes and you could listen to your messages and you weren't even home you could retrieve those messages crazy you could call for your car yeah to your head sir she figured there's a there's a funny yeah okay maybe I should I guess I what do I know but you should never start a story out by saying there's a funny story there's a story that when Lyndon Johnson was was president not not president I take that back he was in the Senate and there was another guy Dirksen was a famous senator and so Johnson was one day was he was driving Dirksen gets this call I think I got that guy right gets a call from Johnson and they're talking and Johnson said well I I got to talk to you about this thing he says oh hold on hold on a second he says I got ya you know we're just pulling up outside the building I got to get out I'll call you when I get to my office Dirksen says what do you wear he call me now and he goes well I got a phone in my car and so Dirksen hangs up and meet it says I gotta get one of those so as the story goes pulled some strings there in the Senate got somebody to put a phone in his car right and so then he calls Johnson and he says Lyndon I'm just calling you from from my car and Johnson says oh that's that's great hold on a second I got a call coming in on the other line whether it's true or not it's an apocryphal story phones in their car back then yeah well you know if you're a senator what year did they invent car phones probably the year you got one no I have no idea when they invented car phones but you know Jamie we should look in 1946 1946 what yeah what yeah wait a minute 19:46 imagine what kind of pimp you had to be in 1969 to pull up in like a 69 Corvette with a fucking phone in your car or a Lincoln Town Car whoa this look at that like Carbone is a mobile phone device specifically designed to be fitted in automobile that's what was to call him back then car phones yeah yeah service originated with the Bell System and was first used in st. Louis June 17 1946 before the fucking end of the war right y-yeah no no that was after the other end there's war in 45 okay yeah so a year World War two that's incredible phone in their car and more importantly why why st. Louis what the hell was going on and st. Louis said that's the site of the first car phone Wow it was a radio enthusiast who had the foresight to invent the annoying how the car basically worked on the radio and it would somehow or another connect to a regular phone lines that would have worked ah Jesus Christ yeah this is way beyond my Apple so our presidents had this look Johnson had it when he's in the Senate yeah yeah yeah so and that would have been yeah what's that that's that would have been like 15 years after this happened 14 years after after they invented it in st. Louis but but yeah I remember when they you know that the the mobile phone then was that big case to you that we carry around you get out of your car set it out on your car and then it started getting there yeah big fuckin yeah thing you throw over your shoulder a big handle I got a big box at home full of all the old phones that I've had over the years and it's like if I could ever get myself organized I would turn it into some sort of wall art installation because it's cell phones through the years at least covering the past three decades you know well it's it's certainly interesting what do you got there Jun developed 1920 mobile wireless transmission devices and didn't receive messages in the 1920s phone like in 1920 Jesus that guy behind him is the boss you can tell he's listening he's the guy in charge man Wow yeah I think that would be a great idea to show kids today oh yeah that old brick phone from Wall Street fantastic to the member thus was it called the star tech StarTAC those guys I saw somebody still using one of those the other day yeah the little flipster little flip phone with the little antenna would come out yeah yeah it to be very dead he had a dork knob and appeared StarTAC that was a sweet phone I had one of those I was like oh baby it was like Star Trek right you were like Captain Kirk with that thing you flip it open and you're talking I remember you can get an extra fat battery Fearon yeah although that didn't set so well in your suit coat no batteries if you didn't have a fat battery you can make a call for four minutes Patrick technology was terrible back then that Huawei phone by the way has an excellent battery it's got a great for every thousand you know amp battery yeah you know what that batteries doing it's sucking all the information out of your system as you got it yeah but a sweet sweet signal that you get back so long while it does that it is true it is true go out there kids get yourself a quad way bad phone amazing amorous they have a 40 megapixel camera in one they make all sorts of white goods - you know like washers and dryers and refrigerators no yeah they're putting all that stuff in our homes it's all yes it is yes yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't engage in any shenanigans in my kitchen not well my fridge is watching but I don't have a I don't have a hallway fridge I got a I don't know I have no idea what I have I have no idea what I've got we're about ready to start a and this is what actually what the viewers are the viewers and listeners have been waiting for is is to hear about my kitchen renovation what are you gonna do oh we're gonna renovate the kitchen put a pizza oven in crazy we're gonna put a big wine cooler I know that yeah that was that was the only thing I was actually concerned about with this kitchen renovation I have no losses yeah well you know every now and then it mostly martinis but a nice glass of wine is nice a glass of wine yeah and and so what could we do this thing and I I don't know they came over the other day and my wife who's definitely I'll punted my coverage she is a lot smarter than I am and much more organized and efficient but she wasn't there so the guys with the plans whatever they call them they came over to show me the drawings as if I care right or as if I could actually read these drawings right there the blueprints for what they're gonna do with the kitchen so I do to flea kind of page through them and I made a little notation on one I actually really did I just and so the guy says what do you think it I said yeah let's go for it let's let's do it I saw I approved it just by have no idea what what I've engaged in at this point but it's gonna take about three months and we're gonna have ourselves one hell of a kitchen so it won't be done by the time you show up but so then you'll be eaten off of one of those fucking yeah we had we our kitchen get renovated and we had a hot plate we're cooking off a haha appreciate the kitchen yeah okay well kind of funny we were laughing about it we thought it's funny yeah we're getting with our three yeah we're probably just gonna go up we got this little place a little cabin up and up in that great town of McCall would just go go dad hang out for the summer well you got a cabin up there - yeah yeah so we'll just we'll stay up there and let them spend their days fishing and solving man's dreams and a cabin somewhere just get away yeah I suppose every man who works too hard just give me a cabin somewhere I could just go just getting in the car no one pointing the car towards the cab yeah you could be sitting in traffic for two hours but I'm going to the cabin right I'm gonna get there especially a cabin by the lake yeah it's a dream it's a beautiful Lake and friends who have a house on Coeur d'Alene oh yeah they took me they took a picture and they're in a boat and you could see the ground like 80 foot deep with a photograph of the you can see the bottom of the lake it's crazy it's like how is that possible that water's clear then that's like Fiji water yeah you got a whole lake full of Fiji water you should go up there well that's what we do get an Idaho you know we got a lot of money to burn a fucking crazy I mean it was so beautiful it's a it's a that is a that Coeur d'Alene area up its northern part of the other country Kootenai County and it's a great people up there look at that yes right Tiger Woods has a place up there I paid bangs chicks up there yep some men not anymore it's focused on golf now oh yeah I think so I think it's everything except golf I think that's why that's how you have to do yeah remember back when you were young and ugly now you're rich exactly back when you were you were wealthy weren't doing as much of that they were winning pictures are amazing yeah that might be one of the most beautiful spots in the country yeah they've got and it's and it's it's just a great it's a it's a great spite it takes about well it's a hell of a drive to go up there from Boise but you can fly to Spokane Washington great town and it's only about a 30-minute drive from Spokane is it really yeah yeah Wow yeah are you going up to Spokane to do a show or no you should move yeah what else you going are you going is this a one and done or well I just did a Netflix special that I filmed but it's not gonna come out until September and so now I'm just gonna do a bunch of gigs and get ready to put together another hour okay also how long does that take it takes a while yeah I might have to do some illegal substances don't tell anybody now some ideas I won't say hold on director designate trying to tell all these folks to make mushrooms illegal it's not hurting anybody and it's giving a lot of folks from real good ideas oh hey before I forget and I probably should have told you this offline but Newt Gingrich thinks it would be excellent to sit down and talk to you get the fuck out of here it's the truth Newt Gingrich Newt Gingrich and I'll tell you how I know this how do you know this I know the person who runs his admin and operations as media stuff and the things that he does and he does a lot and she's a great person and she told me you know that's what he brought it up there yeah she brought it for me the podcast right that's when I know I fucked up and I got too big it's time to quit Jamie we got to move to quarter lane go good pike fishing they got some awesome pike fishing out there they do yeah they do yeah and good hunting up there too Wow but it's so that's a great part of the country they yeah oh yes houses on a that's a precarious situation tank situation as well hooked up the city water what a fucking weird spot to get a house he greedy bitch can you find it event on the rock pay it like McCall I mean now since work since today's travel log we're we're taking you to Idaho today how do you say it yeah hey PA ye tte so that's where you got a cabin yeah I know right how many people out there not many it's a small T it's much smaller than Ketchum give me a number oh geez already seventeen it's white nationalist one of the other states you're not thinking about nationally that's what they say I've never met one but well they wouldn't look at you I know they keep that from me it's like this guy knows too many people I know that's really that late yeah yeah try it I'm telling you holy shit ik that makes me right now I'm getting anxiety I want to push a boat out there and start fishing I can see the water like look how flat it is I could see like the trout breaking the surface and during the summer you just go out there and you know in the high season you know when you're not fishing you just float around you know Dillo waterskiing if you want to but mostly just kind of hang out that looks yeah fucking amazing and ten minutes from there is the ski area and the ski resort it's a great little scheme place no one man I think I'm done with skiing yeah every time I ski this is what I'm doing don't get hurt don't get hurt don't get hurt right don't get hurt didn't get hurt right yeah no I know I know another one of my friends just blew out her ACL oh I know three friends have blew out their ACL in a year overall skiing all skiing three in a year yeah you got you got to adjust right it's like everything else you got it yeah but you're right if once you have that thought and I know exactly what you're thinking I'm doing the same thing I'm heading down the slope thinking I cannot afford to hurt myself I got too much work to don't get hurt don't get hurt don't get hurt didn't get hurt I was snowboarding one time and I just I just completely lost it cracked some ribs couldn't catch my breath when I was laying on my back and it was towards the end of the day and we that's when it happens right you're exhausted but you think I'd do one more run because it sounds like a good idea and so I'm laying down there and it was nobody else out I mean it was it was getting Twilight and I'm looking up at the sky I hear this sound great thought I hear this noise behind me and these two guys he couldn't Bend both of them are probably like 19 maybe they come they come screeching to a stop and I'm looking up and I'm trying to catch my breath and I can't really wood and so all I can see is when their faces come into the frame above my head and they both look down at me and they go oh dude and then they take off he's left you left me there they didn't even I could say cuz I didn't say I just I didn't say anything weak so I was trying to catch my breath and they just take off I'm thinking that sucks yeah small windows say help ya pride it doesn t go right right yeah I don't want to tell these little fucks that I'm hurt ya know exactly little punks I dropped into a tree well a couple seasons ago and I was we were out a tree well a tree well I said what's a tree well you know you have a tree or lots of snow falling powder and so what will happen sometimes is you get the the appearance of solid snow but around the tree the base of the tree you'll get these these little caves almost like it there's nothing around the bottom of the tree so the tendency is for the snow will if you get too close to the tree well you'll collapse into it and you're the bottom of this hole right and you're trying to get out and usually it happens you know when this beautiful snow it's all powder and you can't get out so anyway my wife and I were on the back side of this mountain and so there's nobody around she got out ahead of me and I fell into this thing and that's the time when I thought to myself after about 35 minutes trying to haul my ass out of there I thought I could actually die here but the snow was falling lightly you know and there was still a little bit of Sun coming through and it was a beautiful thing and I literally thought I had to lay down for a minute to catch my breath and think I'd give this another try I thought his worst places to die you know what if you got to go hear something at at some point my heart's gonna explode because I was I was working like I saw how we try and do it you just try that first at first you think okay I get my you know get my skis back on get out of here or maybe I won't get my skis I'll try to just you know step out of here and get but it's just salt it's like being in a quick Sam that's like been in quicksand I guess is a good analogy yeah and so it's just you can't get a good grip on anything can't get a hold of anything and you're trying to pull yourself back up and even if you do get a little ways out you're on you're on powder right in this pin it was a beautiful powder day right blues honey this is this powder well you sink into it up to your thighs and and beyond and so when you're doing that think about it you're trying to you're trying to get you because there's a certain point you got to get your skis back on right and then you're you're you're about you're about done by the time you get out of a tree well and now you're trying to get your skis back on and you're in powder and you're trying to do that and it's a it turned into a real go go but I I guess my point three because it was a beautiful day and I thought not that I was going to lay down and die but I thought if you had to if you happen to go it's not that's a great attitude but it's also I think indicative of how much shit you see in your life yeah come here I was worried about the walls the walls combine and not my bones yeah they would like that guys coyote oh it was a horrible story about in Africa where a toddler got stolen by a leopard I put it on my Twitter geez I put that stuff on my Twitter all the time people go why do you put this up why do you post this because I want people to know I want you got a delusional sense of wildlife you fucks you dummies out there taking selfies with bears well I just I was in Connecticut just a couple days ago and I was talking to some folks there that I know because we used to live out there a while back before we moved to Idaho and and they would tell me a story that they've got this alert out this Bobcat it's on the loose in Connecticut right now it's a pretty rural state people don't realize that yeah it is it's a rural state but anyway this this lady was walking her two little dogs right I know what kind of dog they were but this I don't know where this Bobcat just like swooped and grabbed and one of them took off right and she's chasing the cat trying to save her dog that dog is done right yeah and so she's trying to chase it anyway so they had sightings of this thing but now everybody's freaking out because it's a danger to their their shih-tzu or whatever they found a mountain lion in Connecticut a few years back and I think he got killed on the highway I think and they found was it driving one of the things they found out in this sort of humor mount lion that was that it had traveled from I feel want to say North Dakota its way all the way across the country that's fantastic they can roam yeah it's like weird you said coyotes come across our front yard in Connecticut oh yeah I mean they're so adaptable they're in New York City now really yep that is not where I would go as a coyote what is this a lynx in someone's kitchen oh that's not good Wow noise it's making like a few oh Jesus Christ I tell you what the noises this thing is making I think that's a person taking the video don't you know I guess so I would punt that thing I'm doing another tangent yeah no fuck uestion I will get at the omelet pan out yeah this is going down it's going down right now and I'm gonna choose yeah that thing was crazy you know they made that noise back this way I guess one that was the lady taking the video let me hear that again give me some volume [Music] I think that is the lady no that's not how is it that's the cat yeah you're right fuck you cat that thing is there's something wrong with that kid that cats got an issue it's got a problem yeah that's on meds yeah that's that's opioids right there there's something going on holy smokes well thank you for bringing that up but you're right the notion about what wildlife is like yeah you know I mean if you're you know it's just and it's that difference right it's a difference if you're live in New York City you've got this perspective about about it and it's all that's why I'm here now the Coyotes have made their way into New York City gonna start snatching dogs and people are gonna go hey they're not our friends they're not that's they're not like well coyote we just need to we need to understand why they're upset yeah yeah we've encroached on their land nope nope this is what they do it was the best hunting trip you ever told I'm curious my favorite to hunt is elk elk okay yeah because first of all because you get one elk and you get hundreds of pounds of meat I love that yeah it's delicious the only thing that's as delicious is this access deer axis deer is pretty damn delicious the thing about access deer too is it's one of the most ethical trips because you have to kill them because they don't have any natural predators at all and there's 20,000 of them on Lanai alone then there's there on Molokai they have a m-- on Maui and there's no predators so they literally have a responsibility to kill them otherwise they're gonna face starvation and disease and overpopulation decimation of plant life I mean they just eat everything in sight do you have to get a separate license for each Island or not no I think you get a hawaii state license but the way it works in lanai you can you could shoot 12 of them 12 12 that's how many they have which is crazy for deer yeah I mean the mostly ever here is like 2 bucks in some states and you know they really have a lot of deers what do you end up with once you um I would say each one you're getting around 50 plus pounds of meat they're about 200 pounds on the hoof okay yeah they look they they look more delicate than that but you know they're heavy yeah they're fast as fuck to and yeah when they run you're like whoa they mean they've run like a it's it's like again it's like an African animal that's a deer yeah it's much faster than a regular deer yeah because it's like that whitetail that took off in that video wait wait that guy was not exactly the you saying both yeah the deer okay I wouldn't use him as the bar to set this by yeah he was like a light bulb that you have to slap a couple of times he got to go on yeah so how I had a follow-up question to the deer damn it this is what happens you get older I know Holy Smoke the mole a night to go pee but you're you're out in this island this is as gorgeous island on the Pacific Ocean with just beautiful views I mean it's just unbelievable stunning and it's filled with these deer I mean they are everywhere on that island that's the best thing about when it comes down to it the hunting the fishing it's just being out there yeah all right and you sometimes you have to remember you have to stop and I mean like if you want fly-fishing sometimes you get you get caught up and in unison you have to stop you step back and you kind of look around you think oh yeah this makes sense I don't do enough fishing I've fucking loved fishing I've done fishing a few times recently with my kids but it's ocean fishing where you're out there trolling you know you're in a boat and you're pulling the line it's not as fun casting like on a lake is the best like top water bait or something like that yeah yeah that's great for kids kids love oh man and I've started taking I've been lucky enough to be part of a Laskin fishing trip that happens every year what do you guys go for halibut salmon that's the and I've actually got a picture of a couple of the halibut that my boy cuz now I hold him if I can bring him with me and and so we go every year when there's a group of guys you know this is maybe 20 guys and he hauls up this halibut this was his first time going right he's up in Alaska this beautiful place and it just it was just you could just tell it just snapped him right he was just like oh my god the expanse of it all yeah the size of this place and then you get out on the water and he starts hauling up this thing it's and it's this massive halibut and he just say he couldn't even put two words together and then you have to tell him it's got to go back in the water because it's it's not big enough right so halibuts got to be either below or above a certain size that the middle range is you know maximum for breeding yeah I get them too big they have to let them go right if you get if you get them not I mean the big enough well I'm talking I'll bring this photo up I don't know why I'm not oh my phone's dead never mind really technology fails me again but yeah the the prime space in between I forget what the cutoff is I think they have to be over 80 80 something inches I'm sure somebody can dial in and tell me he ages yeah and if it's not it's not over that and it's it's it's a little bit over that then you got to toss it back in because they're still in prime fucking time and they produce more babies yeah I've heard that yeah the really big ones a buddy of mine got a huge one and they cut the line on him yeah they were saying it's too big we got to let it go there's like what in the fuck ya know if it's big enough then they can but it you look at them and you think that's got to be big enough it's 90 yeah yeah if I if this damn thing was working I'd show this photo of scooter with this is his halibut well I know it's like yeah I didn't know whether you had electricity here I need to we do you had some of the lights are on yeah oh yeah that's right I don't know but if in 80 look at the size of that fucking 310 pounds that's a beautiful yeah there you go just pretend I just pretend my yeah yeah yeah one of those kids is my kid yeah they're enormous but if they're bigger than that they probably have to let them go I mean if you get a fish like see what happens there's no but if you if you catch one that say is about I don't know eight inches smaller than that then you got to toss it back in so the point being is you'll look at something you'll think wow this is definitely big enough to catch then you got to measure it and if it's not over that 80 some odd threshold you got chuck it back in but when you talk about a fish it's that big you think there's no way I gotta toss this back in but you do it's just it's state law that's all right yeah how many what is 80 inches that six foot what six and Athena she raises yeah that's absolutely great fuckin fish man and you just haul this and you can imagine what it's like wine you have for an effete down maybe right right because you're down towards the bottom you're just kind of banging the you know the bass down there on the bottom and you bring it up a door to a castle yeah look at this Wow and I mean halibut are delish it's really good and so we end up with kinda like what you're talking about when you you know you think about what we end up with well I end up with an entire freezer just from one this one trip well I have freezer full of salmon and halibut it's pretty it's pretty taste and you get to do it in Alaska which is what favorite places to go to Alaska is just crazy that we stole that from the Russians for like 15 bucks how much did we get it for cheaper than Manhattan I think yeah I think it was but yeah Alaska and Yellowstone two places I tell people all the time you gotta go yeah that's it was in 1867 so oh so okay in current dollars that would be like at 7.2 million dollars but Manhattan was like 15 bucks right how much did they give the Native Americans and then people people getting crazy right now they stolen okay but apparently we paid the Russians pretty well but we stole we stole it from me in $24 24 yeah but you have to remember it was a it was undeveloped at the time must be they sold that to us for seven million it is so big I mean least Manhattan is fairly small well think about the Louisiana Purchase right I don't think why Jefferson getting that from Napoleon yeah and I mean what that was like and it is crazy when you think how this nation was cobbled together yeah and the foresight that took and the sort of the just the balls of saying yeah we're gonna take that thank you okay 15 million approximately four cents an acre it seems like a fair price it was purchased in purchase treaty by the Senate and October 20th 1803 double the size of the United States and opened up the continent to its westward expansion yeah holy shit first thing they did was encourage people move out there yeah populate that place right that was the whole plan well one of the things that we saw when we were in Montana for the first time on the Missouri was you would saw these homesteads where people tried to make it out there and they realize you can't grow anything out there cuz you know that mud is just yeah it's not you can't till it you're not gonna grow anything in it whatever's growing there is what grows there and you're not gonna grow anything extra you can't have a farm there and people tried forever because they just thought let me just find some ground and all you do is live there for a certain amount of time that it would be yours but there's these really old broken-down houses from you know the 1800s 1700s whenever people were out there and you could still go there and touch the wood it's really weird you can still see yeah this homesteads like that out in in Idaho and yeah it is crazy when you think about people making their way across right we talked about how people are getting softer right oh yeah well that's why when people you know you see photos of people from those days they look hard yeah yeah and just they you know they don't often look happy but it's you know they would they were living a hard life and and they're making their way across the country and sometimes you imagine they just thinking ah fuck it this is as far as I can go and they just put up stakes there right they said fine we'll just build here and maybe it was good land maybe it wasn't but can you imagine when you get to that point where you you're suddenly staring at the Rockies and you think really I got across this in those days I mean the expansion that the Western movement of people there was a series called misogynistic but it was called the men who built America right or the men who the frontiersman or something yeah I know women didn't build anything you ask did some cookin and yeah many babies mending but now if that series was really good there was the first one was a men who built America and then they did another series about the front here's Minh and that was the one I'm thinking I was I think there's like I don't five or six episodes to it I think it's on Netflix but it talks about I mean goes it covers the whole failure but it covers Davy Crockett Daniel Boone all the characters that you remember hearing about right but it goes into real historical detail about it and it's it's fascinating when you when you look at how this place was cobbled together and quickly and quickly yeah you think about just a couple hundred years time in relation to the rest of the world a couple hundred years things didn't change that much at all no exactly it's remarkable story but but yeah it's it's also you get an appreciation for kind of how we how we might have treated the Native Americans yeah sure yeah yeah seven year old came home the other day with a pale look in her face and I go what's going on which is like I learned about the Donner Party today teaching kids about the Donner Party oh she's like where they died like the mountains they tried to make it across then during the winter and they didn't make it and she's like like they ate each other like they ate each other like they're teaching my fucking seven-year-old the people eat people plan Oregon Trail back then which is I'm it's a video game that's the video game violence yeah you know just something about learning that that could happen I mean and did just a couple hundred years ago yes not that long well you look at Lewis and Clark look at what they did and and what they were wandering out into which they had no idea what they were didn't know what the fuck was out there in terms of predators in terms of natives didn't know what was going on I had a call one time from a production company well I know whether I wanted to take part in it and they wouldn't do a serious but it was on the Donner Party they were gonna recreate that whole expedition right and I mean right down to the last thing everything was supposed to be historically accurate I listened to the what they were doing and I and I thought to myself you know thank you very much I just I couldn't get myself excited about it I guess you know I thought it would be interesting but probably only interesting for the first couple of days and then you're thinking why am I here why am I here right yeah I mean for the sake of a show but you know I think they pulled it together I think I'd have to look and see they probably faked a bunch of shit anyway yeah well they do with those shows things don't go well like time to fake it yeah yeah cuz the crews always right their rights like bear grylls yes like yeah will I survive am i eaten hopefully your cameraman does do so yeah Bear Grylls it was a direct response to survivor man refusing to fake things because he did it on the same network Oh Les Stroud is a friend of mine he was telling me what happened they were trying to get him to fake things and he was like no I'm gonna go by myself with just cameras yeah and I'm gonna film myself actually surviving and if you watch less he'll do a show where you know he's out there for five six days by the end those five days his cheeks are sunken in he looks like shit he's barely sleeping he's just eating anything he can find some time for days [Laughter] since the care was like cut give me that Twinkie I don't remember what where he came out of I can't remember what where he was in the British military trying to remember I don't think it was with SPSS or SAS or thought it was said maybe it was maybe but anyway yeah but yeah if you're doing it for real and you think about the amount of calories you burn and what you need to replace you know and then you realize that's what it was all about people spent every day I'm waking hour collecting food and water keep themselves going yeah that was it until you know whenever well yes that when you go on hunting trips like if you had to just hunt for survival a hunting trip you could easily go five six days and not even see an animal yeah if you're in the wrong spot you got to try to find them I mean there's many days where you go and you don't see anything like what if you're hungry that day well tough shit yeah oh shit yeah and those people did that with muskets and bows and arrows and tried to make it across the country without any idea what the fuck was in front of them I mean listen Clarke burned or powell going down the Colorado the amount of food they needed to consume as an expedition it was astounding yeah and the the time that you had to spend haunting and and and ensuring that you could keep everybody fed and Lewis and Clark David ran out of food at a certain point they were eating their leftover candles basically yeah I made out of what beef tallow so yeah that was they were down that that was it handles yeah that's all they're hungry you have to be to eat a candle yeah who gets the wick it's Joey delicious anything to fill your stomach I'm sure yeah but it yeah anyway so that's I you know you but the interesting thing is if you live in a place like if you live out west you you're surrounded by this all the time you think about it for some reason I have no idea why but it's it's again I've lived all over hell and back I'm never moving I'm never moving again yeah it's a it's obviously a gorgeous place where you live I get it and fuck Connecticut I did yeah you went from one of the places that I would never live to one of the places that I would definitely live one of the worlds one of the country's worst managed States you know it's just incredible that New Jersey obviously you know they just underfunded pensions or unfunded pensions and a shitload of Lyme disease - yeah oh yeah have you ever had Lyme just say no I had it it's not I got it yeah some people get it and they keep it yeah yeah it's like dysentery or malaria it just kind of sits within yeah I came down with us it was like flu-like conditions people are fascinated i hope mike tells us about his Lyme to see his story and you just feel like absolute shit it feels like a bad flu and so I would go and I talked to a couple of doctors there in Connecticut and they were like I think it's a flow right and they couldn't they didn't diagnose it so then we go out we're out in Idaho we hadn't moved out there yet but we went skiing and and we were in catch him and I go into a clinic because I said just not feeling any better and just give this thing as it's lingering so I go into a clinic there and I talked to the guy and and it's a young doctor not too long a out of medical school and he says where you know where do you live I said Connecticut and he goes you got Lyme disease well yeah I mean I know and it diagnosed Lyme disease turns out he went to this medical school and Yale in Connecticut and he figured out and and so yeah it's I know to get a good doctor that's what I'm saying yeah we're 43rd in education but we are tops in health care so there you go yeah it's uh yeah but but six C's it's gonna be a bad sixth season out west too because we didn't get really a big freeze in parts of it not not all over there are creepy little animals yeah yeah fact that they carry such debilitating diseases if you ever heard about the Lone Star tick the Lone Star tick that turns people they there's a certain derivative of one of those diseases that comes with this lone Star tick that it attacks something called the alpha-gal which is short for out of something else but it essentially makes you allergic to red meat no yes yeah there's a tick that if it bites you if they give you a disease it will make you allergic to red meat and it's spreading all throughout Texas Texas has a great bunch of cases of it there it is ticks me the size of a poppy seed can you spot all five ticks in this photo and they are they were all grouped right there in the center yeah fuck what kind of nonsense is that that's the CDC prevent tick bites you got grossed out yeah I don't eat a muffler yeah if you avoid muffins you won't get texts on the muffins you asshole you did it on purpose for a picture you're ruining food yeah they scare the shit out of me those little creepy bugs yeah we you know we got a big old English Golden Retriever so we're always you know during this time of year always pulling ticks off the mark he'll come inside and sit down next you know once crawling off of and I yeah yeah it's not it's not good but where'd you get you so you got Lyme in Connecticut yeah a lot of people in the East Coast to get in it yeah it's super common it's all over Connecticut's covered in ticks I mean I had no idea when we moved there but we had a nice no property and we had a big pond out there and then a little stream running through it was very picturesque but it was also just covered in ticks that what can you do about that nothing right yeah you know they'll go through and spray but then you gotta probably can't let the kids out yeah killing besides the tech exactly yeah yeah so we don't we don't we don't do anything like that out there and it's not it's not so bad out west but they still have it they don't have they don't have the the same type so they certainly don't have this red meat tick I'd never heard it's a new one that's that's it that's a creep show right there it's one last they discovered it within the last five years yeah that wouldn't be good I mean I've given up a lot of red meat but now I'm not gonna give up don't know you know what I mean I eat less than I do see it all now monster yeah I try to I try to cut back to some degree Wow you know just for you know you get a little bit older and I'm trying to watch I got a family history of heart disease massive problem with heart disease my parents went both that way one of my brothers has a defibrillator and others got several stents the others on heart medication I mean it's just like it's part so it's a family thing so you're trying to do what you can but I'm not giving it up just like I'm not giving up my martini are you kidding me I really don't believe the red meat has any effect on that I think it's processed carbohydrates and sugar I think that's what it's all about and this comes from conversations with real scientists nutritionists and people understand the actual studies and data though there is an issue combining carbohydrates and simple refined carbohydrates with red meat saturated fats by themselves not an issue saturated fats with high levels of carbohydrates definitely an issue why I just say interaction yeah yeah the interaction between the two of them the way dr. Rhonda Patrick talked about it I could get ahold of her and try to get her to do it again and explain it to me but it's the interaction between saturated fats and carbohydrates it's not saturated fats on themselves on their own saturated fat like red meat and and organ meat in particular extremely healthy for you very good for you but we're so it's so you people are so used to consuming sugar and simple carbohydrates and processed foods for fuel that your your body just gets accustomed to it when you add saturated fat to processed carbohydrates and sugar that's when you become just when you get issues that's why a lot of these studies that show that you know red meat increases heart disease if people eat red meat over four or five times a week have higher instances of heart disease but they're not asking what are they eating with the red with it yeah are they eating it in a burger are they eating it with fries and shakes and because that's different than getting a grass-fed steak with avocado and maybe a salad that's not bad for you yeah at all yeah it's a look if cancer if red meat really gave people heart disease and cancer and all these things that people say there'd be no people okay because people been eating red meat from the beginning of time and literally 97% of the population needs me the people processes stuff differently exactly so I try it's processing all the different preservatives that people put on in in red meat and processed foods that's it's fucking people up that and refined sugars and carbohydrates do you pay attention to cholesterol issues I mean like is that something not dietary cholesterol but neither does American Heart Association you know they even Weight Watchers now says that dietary cholesterol has no impact on your actual like your actual blood cholesterol that Weight Watchers lets you eat as many eggs as you want eggs have a zero point system in Weight Watchers now eggs are zero points yeah I've been doing that egg white thing everybody their whole life egg whites are not good but the good part is the yolk yeah you want the egg and the yolk to proteins in the white right no no protein in the yolk too all right they both have protein this is nonsense but the cholesterol is in the in the yolk in the yolk oh but it's not bad for you cholesterol is the building block for hormones yeah I mean it's just we get lied to from the beginning of time when it comes to well first of all there's a lack of understanding and then there's also these studies that come out that are fucking funded by the sugar industry you know about that or the sugar industry paid scientist to take the blame off of sugar and and put it on to saturated fat there was a whole New York Times about it the sugar industry bribed scientists to lie about the dangers of sugar is what's the difference between I don't know what you'll call it refined sugar and beet sugar is there a Sarah there's difference in there's different sugars have a different effect on like they have a lower glycemic index and it really usually is dependent upon whether or not they're connected to fiber like sugar in the form of fruit is not bad for you like if you eat an apple it's connected to fiber that you know you're eating the whole fruit that's what it's supposed to be like that's how it's nice to be consumed the real issue comes when you take that sugar out of that fruit you know whether it's high fructose corn syrup or whatever the fuck y'all else you're getting sugar from and then consume that sugar because then it's sugar free of all the natural things that contain it yeah yeah fiber and in the actual you know the tissue that you know the actual fruit itself the tissue of the fruit we try to keep processed foods out of house for the most part right so we try to keep that you know kids eating healthy and all the things that we're supposed to do but at this interesting the sense that you know from an economic standpoint right eating healthy there's a you know you're advantaged if you're you know middle-class or upper-class right if you're if you don't have the financial wherewithal I think that's I don't know maybe I'm just blowing smoke around but but I think that there is something to be said for that I mean because if you're going and you're thinking I'm gonna eat all organic I'm gonna it's like an expensive it's expensive yeah yeah and so you know okay well so you've got a group of people that are disadvantaged in the nutrition side of things because they end up defaulting to the processed foods you know the fast foods yeah but I'm happy to hear about the red meat now you know I'm gonna walk out here I'm gonna say I can eat a steak whenever I want and then I'm gonna get bit by this tick so well salmon is fantastic that's a hundred percent true yeah and the the essential fatty acids in salmon omega fatty acids salmon is just one of the best things you can eat wild salmon oh my god I'm gonna fall and then we got it freeze it for you haul in some king salmon beautiful it's fantastic it's so good and then and yeah that's the best meal you know this is that and some some basic vegetables exactly and boom and you're done and luckily I you know we're lucky our kids like fish they really like fish and you know there are a lot of their friends oh you know they'll come over for dinner whatever I don't want fish little folks yeah you know and they want a burger okay fine but yeah yeah we we had a ton of fish because you catch a lot of fish sure so yeah it's really good kids get really addicted to bread they get really addicted to hamburgers and sandwiches and things with the carbs it's it's about carbs with kids and you know you need a certain amount of carbs for sure but we weigh too much yeah in general and that is most likely what's responsible for heart disease most likely what's responsible for the overweight epidemic in America its carbs yeah I can believe that I'd III do think that the people people react differently so you know I should have two people we got the same diet I'm gonna process it one way and I'm gonna end up with very high cholesterol that's a problem but yeah so anyway but yeah bottom line is you know you get to a certain point you start thinking I'm gonna pay a little more attention so that's where I am in life I'm paying a little more attention to what I'm eating I'm pay a little more attention to my regimen as far as do what I do for you know I'm gonna send you some podcast to listen to give you a real understanding of the the actual science behind food versus the misconceptions and versus the misinformation because there's so much of it out there and then there's so much you know we've talked about this before this is probably a good thing to talk about this now and I need to know what's true and what's not true remember when we talked about how the guy who started the Atkins diet died and he was 258 pounds and all that yeah well apparently when he fell and hit his head he had he had serious problems in the hospital and gained somewhere around 50 pounds while he was in the hospital even more than 50 pounds I believe he was 195 pounds they're saying when he was checked into the hospital and his heart disease had nothing to do with his diet it was a viral illness that caused his heart to to fail and this was all related to organ failure he had massive organ failure and massive water retention what because his body was falling apart while he was in the hospital so what's the I mean most people think he died how well most people think he died falling and hitting his head which is true but the vegan propaganda was that he actually died of a heart attack and he had he was 258 pounds when he died so is his diet didn't work and but they're saying that no when he was checked into the hospital after he hit his head he was only 195 pounds okay so all this weight gain that they're attributing to his diet they're being disingenuous and untruthful first thing you do when you check into a hospital you got to check yourself out as quickly as possible yeah I mean when you checked into the hospital he was fucked apparently I mean fell and cracked his head open on the ice and you know he wasn't a good scene and he was an older gentleman when it happened I believe he was in his 70s okay and yeah but he died he had massive organ failure and it was so somebody sent me something yesterday about it so that whatever his heart disease was it was not from like hardening of the arteries and Wester all from eating all that food yeah it's it's so hard to understand what's right what's wrong - because people get so ideological about it right especially vegans yeah you know and you know and even some meat-eaters get ideological about it and they just people aren't looking at the real relationship between food and health I've got a few people in my family who are vegan and yeah it's a little religion right I mean they're wonderful people that great people but but when it comes to this it's it's a little bit of a religious thing for them and I'm definitely ideological yeah yeah and they they want to think there's only one way and that's to be plant-based it cures all diseases it right fix it well I know I've had people that have gone vegan and they got sick and they they had bad blood work and Sam Harris is one of them he tried it for a little while tried it for quite a while he did it the right way and he just got ill from it yeah I I'm a big fan of moderation you know just moderation and everything right I mean just yeah that seems to be a reasonable attitude I think in terms of when it comes to your diet right and just or yeah yeah and it's I try not to overthink anything in in life and we just you know we're in that point in society where maybe because it things are easy and we have made it easy because of Technology and everything else that we were able to just analyze everything to a fucking fairly will right so I'm just thinking maybe it's not that complicated you know just just you know you work out you burn more than you take in you know you try to eat healthy you stick to the basics you know grains and fruits and vegetables and even great fucking terrible for you really see I didn't know that I always said grains somebody told grains grains are not good for you most grains are bullshit you just it's just carbohydrates all right nuts and seeds how about nuts vegetables that's a great seeds vegetables almonds yeah almonds are fantastic ci8 almonds no calories - yeah they are good calories healthy fats we stood there were times when if you're traveling or whatever you were sitting in some safe house somewhere and just waiting for something to happen or you just happened to be holed up for whatever reason and it was like nothing in there I mean I remember times when I would eat oatmeal that was all I would eat that's all that was available and you need old meal for like three weeks in a row just you know because you were waiting to get on the road and move and you did access to other foods oh you think wow that's a lot of oatmeal or something right and so I developed when I was younger I developed sort of this attitude it's just fuel just you know keep moving forward so you got to eat something and so for a long time I didn't really put my stock and it tastes great or it's you know it's it's really good it was just more you know got to consume something to keep moving and you know and so it's only it hasn't been it's been recent when I really got I got focused on it you know what do you have to do - yeah when you got little kids you know it's like you want to stick around right yeah yeah so I'm gonna send you some podcast yeah do you cook I do I Akali enough I like to cook you know well you know okay most people assume if I can't operate my watch that I can't sort of stove on but I can do that and and it I find it actually a lot of fun you know it is and it's stress relieving it's very satisfying to sit down to a meal that you prepared yourself especially if you grow your own veg Bulls and pull them out of the garden which we do my wife has a great little vegetable garden and so we do that we have a few fruit trees and so that's nice yeah that's good it's good but it's the whole process is nice and I'm very I'm one of those people I think it's two types of people you're cooking you got a big mess all around you or you're cooking you clean up as you're cooking right yeah and so we've cast one of you I'm the one that guy like things to be the way they're supposed to be I like to clean up or while I'm doing things yeah yeah so it's it's I'm that the rest uh yeah my and my kids are actually the two older boys they they taking part in it now they like to grill you know what's grilling is grilling bad for you good for girls good okay all right I was afraid you gonna tell me you shouldn't grill me I like grilling yeah all right okay good eyes because that's what we do basically it's we got a big hundred thousand BTUs outside and we just fire that up but yeah it's you know hey there's nothing more sad when you pull a fish out whether it's the ocean or the river you know and then you that's what you're eating that night it's just it's the best it is especially if you can do it that day yeah campfire like if you get it right by the bring a skillet and cook a trout right there on the beach Oh trout for breakfast it's amazing up legs you know hungry yeah I know well it's a but that there's something about it you know really fish in the morning that sounds odd but you're up there early you know the sun's coming up you catch a fish a Jake you cook oh if people sell what you eat in the morning yeah like just like what you should always have cereal in the morning well always food it's food you should have food whenever you want the food if you want to have a steak in the Morning Sun wrong with that I remember when I was when I was a kid that was that was back in the days when you know box cereals you know yeah that's what you ate right the sugar pops away they didn't even make they didn't hide it right it was like this sugar puff super super sugar crisp Sugar Smacks yeah that sorry time of air yeah is fantastic and as a kid you could go go through an entire box in one morning before you went out and played baseball listen to me I said cracked up on sugar Mike Baker is a pleasure talking listen thank you very much now just flew by that's why your phone's dead I'll see you on Boise man that sounds good bro thank you thank you [Laughter] [Music]
