one hello Joe I am negative I know your positive person I'm a positive person life is good but the test is negative which that's always what you want to hear after a medical test yeah basically the test is now I'm trying to think is there anyone where you want to hear the results were positive I think you always want to hear yeah this one came up negative yeah how come no diseases ever make us better yeah how come I can't get hit with gamma radiation right and spider-man every time I get mad at somebody just Hulk out but you know they never sure like everyday things with the Hulk like suppose he's in a car right now your car the Hulk just grew tore up your car in a Hello state farm yeah you're not gonna believe what just happened to my car the concept of the hawk that's on all the time annoys the shit out of me you know that he's the Hulk now constantly 24 hours yeah yeah and then he's smart hope come on he's so he's Bruce Banner all the time he's Bruce Banner but he's also the Hulk I am I'm fuck we were talking about reading which is what I'm doing that and I got this book it's like 10 years of the Hulk it's like a thousand pages of Hulk armies a 10-year run and the story is it's great it's the grey Hulk who was smart but not like the movie one but he was smarter than a regular one are you feeling he would only change at night like a vamp like a werewolf yeah so it's hooked like hey this is how much free time I have Joe they probably missed Mark Ruffalo's acting he's such a good actor yeah they didn't have enough room for him to just I mean there's so many people in that movie right you got Captain America you got all these fucking people you got Iron Man he probably probably like Mark Ruffalo's I'm just not talking enough yes most the time we need him as the Hulk so I got an idea right yes honey Mark Ruffalo the Hulk all the time the Hulk has glasses now he has fucking laugh it's so ridiculous no the whole idea is supposed to be that he's a really smart guy and he's basically a model monster with a limited strength like unlimited power talks like Hulk smash right he's that smart right like in the Thor movie where he's working as a fighter and he has like a room and he's he's taking baths and stuff like that was that movie Ragnarok and he didn't see that one you didn't see that one yeah where the Hulk is a fighter he's like a gladiator but he's treated like a hero and he has all the gladiator stuff you know and it's like and Hulk wouldn't be doing that like the Hulk would just be smashing and destroying yeah I need to watch that one but that's see I didn't see this movie damn loz dope oh it's fun yeah that's no this is one of the funny ones man you got to see that one so the Hulk goes to battle spoiler alert with Thor yeah he looks like a gladiator and Thor ends up on the island and Thor ends up in the ring with him but it's dumb Hulk right dumb hopes good home you know nah he's not fully done he's not as he's not scientist hope but he's smart enough to hold conversations what a mismatch that would be if it was real fucking kidding me Thor just well axe I don't how much did you how much Marvel were you into growing up like DC that much but those giant Marvel guy cuz I was a big Marvel guy and I tell people one of the big things and they brought it up in the First Avenger movie and this was a storyline I remember this the Hulk could never fight Thor because they were both so strong they would destroy the planet cuz like the Hulk's the Hulk's strength was unlimited cuz the matter he got the stronger he got right and Thor is a God which is something they never play in the movies but in the comic books every now and then Thor would remind him like I'm a god yeah I could destroy the whole planet like that's but my dad is the guy and that's the problem if he's a god then what the fuck is Captain Marvel cuz that chick Trump's at right yeah she comes down and everybody's gonna sit the fuck down yeah Captain Marvel is the number one so yeah she's the most powerful although gonna save the world you call her in that last one like when the hope when I mean when Thor went to where he got the new axe made yes that was like he was like controlling a son right when like powerful you know it's really and and this is what I love and this is what what why women laugh at us because we're having this discussion it's also what makes what is the the the really pretty girls named Black Widow but she's just kicks ass right she's asleep our ship chenko hanging out with Iron Man Valentin Shevchenko's UFC strawweight champion uh-huh that's what it's like and the other thing is she shoot like she has a gun but no one they fight can be killed with bullets I'm sorry she's a flyweight champion sister only yeah no one can be killed bullets and how about the dude Jeremy Renner's character right Hawkeye he's got a bow and arrow yeah that is ridiculous he has a lot of special arrows like you fighting aliens with and you got a bow and arrow it's like man you've skipped generations of weapons technology it's amazed at that that's the super power imbalance the super power is so crazy you can have a guy with a bow and arrow or the fucking Hulk right rock guy has no superhuman powers with the exception of the period when using primm particles to become Goliath okay whatever dorks hey he's the very peak of human conditioning sure is he's an exceptional fencer Acrobat and a grand master marksman having been trained from childhood in a circus by the criminals trick shot and oh boy well I'm a big jeremy renner fan I like that guy a lot however we have to be realistic about superpowers you got the Hulk on one hand you got Captain Marvel on another hand and a dude who's like an acrobat yeah Hawkeye good at shootin shit I think Hawkeyes limit is fighting crime right like criminals Hawkeye could take down but when superpowers and aliens and stuff come in that's when you gotta gotta make some phone calls but I just can't by aliens coming at you and you're shooting them with a bow and arrow I just know they came here from the planet to show a bow and arrow yeah who else well well Captain America like he's just really strong yeah but we're human yes superhuman strength part of an experiment right but he's like bulletproof isn't he no no no he feels really quick or something now he can be hurt heal real quick No what what's his name well our own Wolverine heals instantly Captain America had one of them jammies too not like I don't think like Wolverine he probably heals quicker or could take more pain or something than most Captain America okay has agility strength agility strength speed endurance and reaction time superior to any Olympic athlete athlete who ever competed lol the super-soldier formula that he has metabolizes enhance all his bodily functions to the peak of human efficiency oh he ain't shit no Iron Man could fuck peak right bodily functions but that's it right you can't fuck with Iron Man with that bullshit ass set of skills yeah you're just a really strong the movies not in that movie he's way stronger than any person who's arrived and he leader like it's the military strategy guy I guess the most sculpted yeah that face Ironman tells you who he is yeah yeah billionaire playboy philanthropist but I want the yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go Frank I'm gonna go hole cook Thor those would be my two in a fight mmm interesting Captain Marvel comes down fucks them all up she's badass they gave her too many powers she almost has she gave her everything except a good movie that's true they keep fucking her in the movie Department yeah her movie was her movie was it like it filled the story so you know who she was but it wasn't that great you know and it didn't match up with someone who has the powers that she has like she look if you're playing a game and the game's good guys versus the bad guys on your good guy side you want to have like you'd be like real pumped if one person had way more power than anybody who's ever lived that's her right or you would just you'd wait to play that card yeah you know you'd like let people know like hey don't let me have to pull Marvel ecto me they'll ever have to wake her up right cuz if she comes down here everybody but here's the thing like they they can't figure out a way to make a good movie with that I don't know I mean again the movie was was alright but it wasn't it wasn't great it didn't show she tapped out boy she is that's why she'd have to have a boy like remember when Wonder Woman Wonder Woman had a boyfriend yeah people liked it better there's a regular soldier got the fuck Wonder Woman right remember and you know what no one would believe you yeah you'd have to shut up about that fucking Wonder Woman looking up Captain Marvel's powers and a little question popped up who is the strongest Marvel hero yeah do you know the strongest I would eat beef Captain Marvel or so cool I thought I would be a thora Hulk it says also in the destroyer which I've never heard of but it says Hercules and I didn't know like a few comic books but he's not Hercules Hercules ain't considered part of the Marvel Universe right Stanley didn't create Hercules exactly like by the way why would you have Hercules in a comic book that's a I do I do lately remember Hercules being in some Marvel comics but but now he didn't I don't think he counts they didn't create him he got lucky with Thor leave it at that yeah stole one god you can't steal any other mythical character right and and it was cool with Thor because in the comic books he was human too right he had like a human form and then he would turn into Thor did he yeah in the comic books he had a human form I don't remember that but but you know you would think that someone else could make a Thor movie like why can't they make a Thor movie like an origin movie about Thor that God couldn't be mine they might they have one's ever done that isn't having done it yet but who knows they had some movies where people pretend they're in the clouds and they pretend they're yeah don't they pretend they're that that you know they're gods there's been some God movies right right was it Brad it one wasn't what's there wasn't there Brad Pitt when there were the guards like Achilles or something like that wasn't there some imagining this I believe there was a movie where a bunch of people Troy Troy yeah and then they had those um what would they call Titans or something there was like some they did a couple of movies where these guys were where they were gods I think Liam Neeson was in it and they were like playing with humans humans were like their entertainment yes yes yeah yeah yeah Titans yeah maybe it was that Clash of the Titans was uh they did a couple of those right they didn't want yeah the one that's from you know like way way back in the days hilarious to watch now Oh anything with special effects from back in the day except you know you know what still holds up though Godzilla it does let me find old Godzilla movies like Godzilla was like he's still badass you know there was just something about Godzilla that it was that yeah he holds up his old movies are good and the new Godzilla is good well they figured out how to make those Godzilla movies like when we were doing stop-motion animation they were like hmm why don't you just have a dude in the Godzilla suit and then they just and then make everything else smaller yeah they just had to like a little New York or a little Tokyo and this dude and the Godzilla suit running around it's actually for the time like really good special effect oh yeah yeah that yeah Godzilla movies were great like that and he fought Lin they they would just come up with all these different monsters but in the fight yes giant moth dama remember gamma camera that was a woman spun around I was like the turtle that spun around yeah a spinning turtle that shot rays out of his legs you know what those were those were good drugs Joe you can't get those drugs now where you just sit around and say man what if we had a spinning turtle Saturday afternoon every week they would what was there was like destroy all monsters it was some kind of monster Liam yeah oh this is this the old one No yeah wow that looks great yeah look at the special effects actually pretty fucking good special effects especially I mean if you want to see a movie today that was like that you'd be mad oh you can't believe how fake they made it look but back then this was awesome what else buildings what are you laughing Jamie I think they're miniatures and silly like that but it's zooms in on this face and it looks awesome it's like looking at the first Star Wars now like when you look at the first Star Wars now you're like oh come on but back then it was like man this is bad I know it's terrible yeah the first Star Wars is terrible like the special effects at least right it just looks so fake like even the cantina scene where they went in there and all the guys wearing a mask face is frozen open yeah man they did what they could back then yeah they I mean its technology right yeah that like the other day they were doing all the Jurassic Park movies and we were talking about when the first Jurassic Park like when the first dinosaur came out that was badass like it was like wow that looks like a dinosaur late you know and then they had like expressions yeah and all of that you know that that was yeah the first Jurassic Park when those kids were in that truck yeah and the t-rex comes over the top holy shit was that awesome there's one of the greatest scenes in any when he looks in the truck and he blinks yes you know yeah yeah well when when they realized that the goat is missing that they had that goat tied up and they realized the goat is missing and then they hear that you hear that although and you know I hate to be this guy but but we did it like you ever watch movies and just be like you you pull out the holes in the logic yes what's the logic the two kids would not be with the lawyer yeah one the little boy loved dinosaurs and he knew who the dinosaur scientist was he'd have been in that van true he would no way that two kids would have been with the Lord at least one of them would have been with the scientists yeah for sure were their parents in that movie no they were with their grandfather and was the grandfather the main scientist dude no the grandfather was the old guy who owned the thoracic cart right the old guy who lived like Colonel Sanders right right yeah yeah so it's like if your grandfather created this park and he hired this scientist you're like I'm hanging out with the side even though he didn't like kids it'd be like my grandfather said that I can ride with you Jeff Goldblum was the sexy scientist yeah Goldblum was great in all of them he was just that great character that yeah you bought it yeah especially the first one yeah I love that drive faster no no let's drive faster yeah the first one when yeah he had some great points you know about why'd you do this it was just like you bought him right you bought his science his science made sense well he's you could tell he's fucking smart as shit yeah you know so when he's playing a guy who's smart shit all right although that is one situation when a t-rex is chasing you that is one of those situations where I don't have to be faster than a t-rex I just got to be faster than you yeah there's the goat leg falls down yeah thoroughly on the dinosaurs only have a total of 14 minutes of screen time of it perfect well that's like an American Werewolf in London one of the reasons why that movie's so good is you barely see the werewolf yeah when you do see it it's amazing but you barely see where lashes you're terrified of it I had a Rick Baker in here he's the guy who did American where alone he actually did Star Wars too and he's saying that that Catina scene that Cantina scene they did they they threw that together on a like a shoestring budget you just put a bunch of mass he had laying around his studio and put him on people and dress people up and shit but they when he did an American Werewolf in London like they this was like crazy operation where they had hands they had fake hands stretched out they had like they would put like stop-motion of like skin where hey yes the would extend there was that scene where his like his jaw yeah would ya you I guess they had to do that I forget how he said he did the hair I forget how he said they did the hair that they do it in Reverse they pull it through or something only like that one quick scene where you see it right I think that was the ones he needs to do I forget he explained how they did the hair where the hair was coming out of his skin his back and shit I think it took a long last time though yeah but you only see the whole transition is pretty quick and then you only see the werewolf for like split seconds you don't see it very often that's great cuz you know when they're doing it they're like we don't know how like in our mind yeah we see it but we don't know how this is gonna work and then you have to like you were talking about the the artist who did it he has to make that happen so the director is like this is what I want and then you have to figure out how to make that happen yeah so that when he sees it on film he's like yeah but when you knew if you nail it then it's amazing yeah but if you do it wrong then it's like I look at this cheesy or you got to do it over again but there's something about things you don't only see in the dark there it makes it better than like seeing it like CGI obviously CGI really bright like that doesn't scare you like alien the movie alien yeah scared the fuck out of you barely saw it you bet like most of the motion is your imagination yeah and and you're the and that's the thing with the script and everything else the anticipation of it or the awareness of it but where is it yeah versus a slasher movie where it's just I'm just coming through and chopping up people and we're versus like Godzilla which although might be fun it's like it's so clearly CGI you don't have like a visceral react like if you see a werewolf in an alleyway if a guy drops his briefcase and looks up and he sees a werewolf in the alleyway for like a split second like Jesus and then it's over like there's a scene in the American Werewolf in London where you literally see the werewolf for fractions of a second it's one of the best scenes in the movie where there's a guy in the subway this businessman and he sees it and you look at it you're looking at it like the werewolf yeah he sees like oh my he starts running and you see this guy running away and he's freaking the fuck out he can't he's almost having a heart attack and he gets on the escalator and he drops his briefcase and and he's looks down and just for a split second you see the werewolves body move into frame and then it shuts off and that's the whole scene it's one of the best things Gary it's one the best scenes in the movie everything's dark and mysterious it's when you when you get real clear and it's obviously CGI it doesn't scare you right we're also so jaded yeah you know that we're so jaded now that it's like after this how many movies that are gonna be about us quarantined some happened in the quarantine that is for that you know and it's yeah it's it takes more to scare people now exactly you gotta be creative it's a kind of it's a transitionary point for us and it's kind of interesting that the thing that caught on the quickest when it all went down was tiger king oh yeah this is the show for a fucked-up quarantined world I have two theories about tiger king it's like either you watch tiger king and you feel better about yourself you're just like man this guy that's fucked up I'm not you know thangka or you watching tiger king you're like yeah that's about where we are that's about where we are totally hate him you don't totally hate Joe exotic you get it I get it yeah you know you you I mean what he did like he was he was PT Barnum yes he was PT but like he could have been PT Barnum if he if he could have grown his idea but but that that idea of just I'm just gonna keep bullshitting people and just reinventing myself and showing them this and and people went for it yeah you know we just wants attention so bad yeah that but that whole thing yeah definitely a phenomenon I would I would love to see like what people cuz it was worldwide what people in other countries I would like to get their opinion from us of tiger cuz they've never seen you know a lot of countries they've never seen anything like that you know I mean like in the United States like especially if you've traveled the Midwest area or if you've been to one of those you ever go to like the low-budget circuses you know that not the not the big ones but the ones that last set up in carnivals carnival lot yeah like we've seen that but people who have no idea of that be I wonder what their opinion would be there was one that was near my house and I took a picture of one of the one of the rollercoaster rides they had set up yeah and I put it on my Instagram page because it was this janky ass fucked up roller coaster that was on stacks of two by fours right stacks operating it like he built it I'm here with my friends and everybody look at that look at that shit yeah look at those stacks that's to level it off right so that thing spins around in a circle while it's on these moveable stacks of wood oh yeah for a bit of fucking earthquake hits or something that thing's gonna go flipping sideways and flying off I mean the fact that let them do that in a park that is crazy look at that and you just take your kid and you just throw them on there yeah a go ahead kid you'll be fine what could go wrong nothing right now and look at that one that one's over they did it come on yeah and then you well you know it's like people will go in there to the tiger King thing and like yeah I want my picture taken with a tiger you know trust you how quickly people got tired of Tiger king right now even that we're talking about it people are like still ya know it out like that but that's that's about how something goes yeah right and and if the thing about it is when they were doing it even when Netflix threw it out there cuz I saw it like the first weekend because in my newsfeed it came up and I was like what the hell is this and I started five minutes into it I'm like I gotta see this right so I just watched the whole thing but now that they had no idea it was gonna be that big a hit and now they're like okay what next you know I mean like it's one of those things you couldn't predict Tiger king would be a hit oh yeah no way so so you'd be weird the marketing or whatever people are like what else what can you do though those are the ones you can't create that no they caught lightning in the bottle is your perfect time cuz it was they just happened to be there with the bottle right when the pandemic hit and it was like what and then people just send text to their friends you gotta fuckin watch this yeah cuz everybody's at home right at home and it was like it wasn't a series it wasn't part of something else it was like it stood alone as absolute insanity and and fascinating yeah you know it wasn't like a big marketing push no did math mad because again once you once you watched it I mean it you know the guy with no legs was the most reasonable guy on the show me the most sense he seemed like a regular guy yeah that poor guy yeah caught up in the middle all that shit right whereas in any other circumstance you'd be like how'd you lose your legs on that show didn't even come up like now we're good you're fine when the one dude is sitting there the guy that wants to be the campaign manager he's sitting there talking to exotic Joe's boyfriend when exacto boyfriend blows his brains out right like what in the fuck is this oh my god like in the moment that'd be like you and me talking and one of us is playing with a gun and just sitting close yourself and blows your brains out it's damn yeah goddamn people crazy but but again what else you gonna do so Tiger king killed some time and in the aftermath of Tiger king killed some more time but then we still got like six more weeks so what do we do now I think we're supposed to be May 15th right May 15 s can actually yeah I think that's the latest projected date but the governor just stopped people from going to parks and beaches well there was a new thing today yeah I think you know you know what it is this is my theory or like you we can't have nice things you know whenever they give us something nice we don't not you know like a little kid fuck you so nice and they break so it's like okay we're gonna let you go to the beach it's like no you're not supposed to be playing volleyball and lately like it like just you're supposed to keep moving right you're supposed to like walk or ride a bike or go surf or this in it but you weren't supposed to just mingle gathering groups and of course we're gathering groups were partying they're like all right no you can't you know specific rules like you weren't allowed to stay put you couldn't lean on things couldn't sit down right cuz you go walk around I was riding I wrote I rode my motorcycle along PCH and you would see people they parked their car along PCH right and they'd sit on the car and kind of like look at the beach and stuff like that and so I guess you each one of them had a cars distance between them because you're sitting on your car the next person sitting on their car but then I pass this Neptune's net which is like a big motorcycle hangout and there were maybe 20 bikes in a row parked and the guys were all just kind of hanging out and it was like no man like that you can't do that you know I mean like like a motorcycle is the ultimate social distancing vehicle right you're you by yourself you weren't a jacket gloves a helmet you're not breathing on me but but when you stop you can't just all hang like normal you know and that that was the part that uh that I think that that's where they're like no we're not gonna do it cuz I think you know this Georgia and Florida whatever it's like they're like the experiment man they're like all right yeah let's let them get out and then let's wait two weeks and see what happens yeah exactly you know that's exactly what it's like it's uh it's a weird disease man you know I was just having a conversation about it earlier today it's like it seems like it's more than one different thing it seems like for some people it's nothing they shake it off some people even a lot of people more than half apparently asymptomatic yeah I don't feel it at all that's the scariest part right because you're asymptomatic and you're carrying it and then for some people it's a death sentence and then and I was most recently I was reading about strokes yes about people having strokes like it's causing blood clots and yeah and this was something that they just realized like whoa you know one doctor was apparently operating on this one guy who was a fairly young guy what a stroke and he said you could see on the machine I read that yeah the new new clots were forming sequel time while he's doing crazy yeah yeah it's an fucking creepy disease and you know what and we were talking about this earlier that's the doctor I want to listen to yeah you know I mean like yeah give me a guy who's so smart that he's working on blood clots and watching them perform and explaining because they had part a problem the advice we get there's so many it's such a wide range and in like so if you're talking to me I want to see doctor in front of your name and I want to know you do sit like like oh I work on the brains of people who have strokes like yeah tell me more you stop doing that stop you kind of practice that's great people like going to chiropractor that's great you're not a doctor yeah stop saying you're actor I have a friend he's an emergency room doctor and like I'll listen to him like yes yeah okay neurologist you tell me what's going on because cuz he knows that he's getting all kind of information and he's on literally on the front line yes listen he was funny he said man they better not send me anyone who shot up bleach like don't even waste much someone must funny the way he said cuz cuz he really is that guy he's like the I'll save lives like he's a doctor he cares what's that but are Nixon he's like man you better just don't even waste my time when you heard about that you had to think this has got to be like a fucking movie this has got it this is almost like a movie it's if it if it wasn't real it would be hilarious you know right and then the other thing is that the fact that like Lysol had to put out a thing like not for internal use like the idea that that they know there are people so dumb that they're like we better tell him not to do this there was a thing that I tweeted I pulled it down when someone Tim Poole one of my guests told me it was fake they were saying that they got way more calls because of poisoning from Lysol and disinfectants after Trump said that but apparently the truth is there's way more people using that stuff around the house because they're scared and they're cleaning everything up and they've been coming in for a long time it's not like it happened right after Trump said that it was actually happening right after the lockdown yeah what is rare it wasn't more people doing it but they were calling to see like hey what would happen if you know they were caught but but this one is weird and I was just reading about this there has been an increase in kids drinking hand sanitizer and it's told the hand sanitizer people stop making it smell good because kids you know it's like this sweet smelling and my only question is where the hell are the kids getting it cuz I can't find any I can't where are you getting this hand sanitizer you're drinking but they said all kidding aside they said because it's alcohol it's like poisoning them someone was saying that but if you get a hand someone saying they went to a supermarket and they got hand sanitizer and smelled like tequila yeah it has a sweet smell to it but it never gets to that stuff like it's probably mostly just alcohol right yeah it's it's 70 percent alcohol one of my sponsors is making hands and Buffalo Trace whiskey they're there they're donating cases cases of hand sanitizer yes cuz they they can easily switch over to make it yeah yeah just it's just alcohol it tastes like shit right but kids are drinking it and that's just okay watch your kids don't drink that shit will fuck it's wrong what our kids they're eating Tide Pods not a drinking hand sanitizer come on man definitely kids we went school with kids do dumb shit yeah that's part of you know any better but now it's like they do dumb shit but it becomes a viral challenge you know that's the difference like when we did it like there was one neighborhood kid you know well let's make Joe you had a television show based on that one neighborhood [Laughter] based on the neighborhood kid who would ya feed him miss what the hell PhD in those people yeah we were growing up there was always a kid would eat worms or I read a story about a kid who ate a slug on a dare and I think it was Australia and you want to being paralyzed he had some sort of a viral infection because of this snail that paralyzed him then a couple couple years later he died see if you can find that damn that's crazy like but kids need to know this you can't just go eat a fuckin slug right like they're real bad right you can't yeah you you don't eat something something wild ass bug some snail or something even bring up this specific story there's something called rat lungworm disease no but bring up the specific story because it's pretty crazy a kid on a dare ate a slug man I didn't say kid oh this is a kid on a dare they're now paralyzed this is in New York though Oh poop eating man who eating slugs are giving you brain parasites jesus fucking christ there it is Australian man who dared to swallow a slug has died after ray our eight-year illness I think he was a man when he died but I think he was a kid when he pulled it off on a dare in 2010 Jesus Christ yeah he ate a slug yeah I did who was a kid that looks like a kid he was in a coma for 420 days he emerged from the ordeal with significant brain injuries but continued to live for another eight years holy fuck he consumed a garden creature on a dare in 2010 my god contracted encephalitis rat lungworm an infection usually found in rodents that can also be transmitted to snails and slugs if they eat rat feces containing the parasites larvae see this is how again this is how we get these crazy diseases for which we have no immune system defense like because you supposed to be eating slugs that eat rat feces you know that's nature trying to say like what is wrong with this right has eaten slugs don't ya yeah there's things that gross you out for a reason you seem like bug roaches or rats they carry but they carry diseases you see me like I was instinctive I don't know if this is true I was in Jamaica we were doing some tour and the guy said that if you like got lost or whatever you're on he said humans can eat what goats eat he said watch the goats and if a goat eats it a human can he like if you know you're in the jungle and it's just can I eat that plant and I was like all right that's south I don't know if that's true but it sounded like good advice sounds great but I think goats can eat anything don't eat like cans they shown but they don't they don't actually eat them I think that's I think that's a myth well if it's true that humans can either if that's true that'd be amazing just bring goats with you whatever they right you're good yeah which which means get a goat now cuz I don't know which way society's going to get a goat just in case yeah shit goes wrong you're like what do you doing I'm following my goat you don't want to fully grown adult goat you know you wouldn't wanna baby go baby go a kid well yeah actually our kid literally yeah to get a battery out for eating tin cans they're actually chewing on the metal to get the label in the glue on the label they're not actually eating the metal what all right okay so they're getting high on gloop they're in the glue so can we eat what goats eat humans eat what goats oh you're like if you get a baby goat he'll know you're cool you bring in some you know you treat him well from the time they're a baby like a dog like you if you have a dog and you've had him since he's a puppy he knows you're cool like Oh his wife you've been cool but that's also like that tiger king thing right like you raise a tiger from when it's a baby yeah but then one day it just realizes like I'm a tiger you look delicious like you know I mean like this 'never Yolanda you're a huge dude you fucker goat up I would think so and grab ahold of those horns we're going back yeah I think I could take it snap that thing's neck like a Steven Seagal not one of those big not one in big mountain ghosts it Rams you with the horns though those can get like 300 pounds yeah you don't want one of them well you made me want a domestic goat what's the biggest wonder if I'm exaggerating what's the biggest mountain goat what's uh like a mountain goat or yeah with those white haired ones enormous white before Alaskans that can walk on like cliffs like they walk like how do you live and they live their whole life that's why cuz they live their whole life doing it how big it how big of those oh that must mean it's a hunting page did you ask how much they weigh just ask how much how much of the biggest how much does a full-grown mountain goat way adult females about 180 males average 280 yes I'm up to 300 or just 385 385 and they're walking like a ballerina on the side of a cliff yeah cuz dangling a little been rammed about 385 pounds that's gotta be like getting hit by a car like just there dude look at the size of that fucker god dammit huge they look so cool it looks like a horse fucked a goat doesn't it look look at its face it doesn't really a goat man you know you know what that's like that's like getting hit by an NFL lineman right like getting blindsided maybe even by NFL not even they might even even more power than that cuz they're on four letters four animals right they're doing this all day long you know wow there's a video of RAM slamming heads with a cow the RAM starts walking towards these cows and this female cow gets pissed off and comes maybe a bull I don't know there's a bull or a female cow but this cow comes forward watch this watch this oh it is a bull so watch this Sabu seems like it right watch this boom you're out bitch Wow so the go or the the the RAM headbutts that cow the cow do that one more time is it a bull it seems like a bull doesn't it Jamie think it had horns yeah okay so it is a ball so that's why he's doing it - yeah look at his balls - and you see his nuts his huge balls how could I not see those but he gets K the fuck out he's probably dead you think it's dead one more time well you know if he lived watch this one more time see just look at the RAM there I was like bitch I'm not scared of you oh yeah so if he lived like that bull gets no respect for the rest of his life like yeah so your bitch-ass get knocked out by a ram around probably 1/8 your size you ain't scaring nobody yeah they just know the to do that move I bet a cow I bet a Bulls never experienced something getting in between its horns and hitting it flat never or it's probably never experienced something stronger than it you know that seems like a scene in the movie I did up doesn't seem right that a stick can just stop it stopping well that's a little one and it's also probably a certain way it's getting hit well I think it hits objects so that's what it is it's dumb so as he puts a stick in front of it in headbutts the stick which means that like is it like if you're punching something right and there's a guy behind this thing but you're trying to punch this thing here and this thing moves if you get to the guy behind it you won't have any power the power will be all in this one spot and then it misses you just kind of like and also the animal doesn't know like this is something unusual to him right why someone holding a stick out right so it just hits the stick with its head that actually makes sense that's a good move maybe like like a bowl with a cape right they make the Cape look way bigger than the person so the bull just goes towards the massive object right yeah I was in South Africa and you know we did this Safari it wouldn't like the real Safari because we didn't have time but they were like yeah by far the most dangerous ham was a hippo oh yeah that's that would that was the one day because when we went by the water you saw the backs of the hippos and they were like yeah you don't want them to come out of there yeah fuck that hippos are terrifying yeah and they're mean they're huge - they're mean it's like basically it's like a tank and they're vegetarians which is weird they're vegetarians but if they feel a threat yeah they grab you add a drag they drown you they pull you under water because they can hold their breath for like five or six minutes or something like that and they just hold you to your dead well Jesus Christ but they say but they're like very territorial very me and they're fast I think they run like 20 miles an hour or something like that like yeah it's basically an armored living vehicle okay I mean a living thing that did you crazy video of a hippo chasing these people on a boat I've ever seen oh yeah boy did you ever see like the lion that jumped on the hippo and then the hippo just stood there and then the lion jumped off he was basically like I can't fuck with this thing where the Lions trying to eat the hippo and it's biting into the hippos back I think was taking a little pieces out of its back I just couldn't figure out how to get rid of the lion they're so big yeah but I guess like if you want to survive in Africa around crocodiles you have to be so big the crocodiles like I'm not even trying right you know right yeah there's so many things that can kill you that this is something that's like nap you know what kills elephants sometimes in Africa ants yeah they climb up in their ear right they just keep eating they just climb oh yeah oh that's a hell of a way to go that's got to be the worst and there's nothing you can do about it what the fuck is your brain that's a slow horrible death nature cruel bitch yeah but that's nature you know nature's not to be fucked with there's a great video that I saw yesterday of a cat trying to get a squirrel there's a squirrel and the squirrels on the tree and the cats on the tree and the that's going right the squirrels going left and the cats going left the squirrels going right the squirrels successfully evading the cat for the most part well cats I think of domestic animals like they they have the most instincts of when they were wild like a cat can hunt you know you have see them hunt hunt a bird oh yeah it's like if a Birds dumb enough to land on the ground cats got him cats got Oh cats gotta they move so fast too and they know you're gonna fly up so they jump yeah and then they swat you as you're trying to fly away yeah cats kind of don't even bother eating them nah they just kill it just to stay in practice these dumb motherfuckers just leave it out for me like cats have trained humans perfectly cats are like listening I could but I have a human it will feed me and I can totally ignore it like dogs earn their food you know I mean dogs like I protect the house or I fetch or I play with the kids or this or that cats are like no I will totally ignore this human and they will feed me it's just such a weird and what's weird is when people go deep but like I get when people have attack dogs it makes sense but I don't get they like serve walls and shit right people of those weird like half yeah like like that you don't want a cat that could kill you because it's sort of those serve all your herd of those things where they're trying to feed them like chicken bones yeah that's in your house while you sleep do you have a dog yes yeah but it's a golden retriever Oh sweetest dog of all time there's so nice everybody that comes over the house like if you came over my house keep like everybody's a long-lost friend that has been something since since I've been just locked down that thoughts crossed my mind like man should get a dog I secure dogs are great only you go on the road at rest you do once I go back to work I won't be able to take care of it so but but dogs are really quitting I have a neighbor who has a dog it's called a Dogo Argentino yeah yeah but it's a fan plastic dog light and and she said she's a dog trainer she said yeah some people have used these for fighting in this and that she said but if you get she's like I know a breeder I'll get you a good one you can do it and it's really a great dog and it's tempting but I know like once I go back on the road then it becomes the B it's either at the kennel all the time where I gotta get the dog sitter so it's not gonna work but dogs are just they're just cool me I love dogs yeah it would be sad for the dog right it's not fair to the dog to just leave it Eliza's got it nailed she gets some little dogs she puts them in sure take someone takes him everywhere she's figured it out we were at the improv once and she's about to go on and she just handed me her dog that was an adorable dog yeah dogs very if you met tofu now I haven't met Oh super hot dog Jeremy hots has won - he's got a Shaq Shaq is his long-haired Chihuahua that he brings yeah if you're a road person a chihuahuas really like that kind of size dog that's your move yeah you just take him with you yeah oh man doesn't it make you not want to do the road again like when you I'm worried about that man I'm worried about being home too I haven't been it I haven't gone this long without getting on a plane in 20 years and and the idea like I'm afraid of of not wanting to go back to work the other thing is you know I've done a couple of live streams at the Laugh Factory right I'm doing next week I'm doing a digital comedy club thing right like man what if I get used to working without an audience well what if what if the VR thing happens and they can make it set up so that like you could be on a stage you put the VR on and the people put their VR on and they're sitting in an audience I did one of those it it was weird for now yeah the thing about it is what you really lose there is an energy that comes from laughter in the like you you can do it I think of it as kind of like this or like doing radio where people can be listening and they might be laughing like like when you do morning radio yes they're laughing in their car but you don't really know that right yeah the people in the studio have to kind of laugh along with you like everybody know right so I mean it works for now and and it is kind of fun and just odd doing it you know so I don't mind do like I hear some comics say that they wouldn't do it or they hate it to me it's just like okay this is what we're doing now and it's it's weird but it's fun that would be the question to ask those comics what would you do if there was no more comedy ever again live what if this is just the tip of the diseased iceberg right keeps getting worse and worse you you willing to accept no more comedy ever probably not no no I would be you'd wind up doing those digital comedy clubs yeah I mean I you know I just hope it doesn't come to that I don't think it's gonna come to that another thing is I was talking to a Vegas guy who's a promoter and does shows and he said he thinks comedies gonna come back first because it's the easiest thing to produce so he said like you could do a comedy show outdoors with people sitting six feet apart from each other and just one comic with a microphone onstage he said versus a band where now you got the the band members onstage and all the technical stuff he's like comedies just this is where it's easy like we're a microphone and a speaker that's a good so we could do it I mean you couldn't draw as many people what did you just test everybody yeah well I think that that's gonna be part of it too that's I was reading about as Europe reopens that's what they're doing there they're scanning people like I guess texting you for fevers and I don't buy this thing that they wanted I mean I don't want to do the tracking thing when they talk about that I think that's a real slippery slope if they let you track people on their cell phones whether or not they're sick or healthy and you know exactly where they go and who they're in contact with I think that's a slippery slope because the problem with that is one they get that kind of power to track people they're never gonna get rid of it they're never gonna get rid of it they're gonna find another reason to you you write the user for the flu they use it for something else and it's also so it's such a faulty thing to do you know you know I mean like it's like if you know you're being tracked well I'm gonna give my phone to whoever like what what do they always do in a movie they they put the tracker on an animal or a car or something and they send them to wrong play well now they don't know who had not oh they make it a felony to do that Alonso you can't give your phone to your friend yeah we were trying to be deceptive yeah okay I think you know slippery slope I think absolutely is I don't think we can I don't think you can trust them trust any authorities or medical or whatever with that it's like that said well it's gonna say you can have a driver's license right well why can't you have a license it shows you've been tested yeah you don't need your face on it it's a public you know like just like a driver often like once a year or something like that yeah like a whole bunch next to the date and the fish a whole bunch like you know you get a bunch of them then you get a new card yeah why can't we do that get a new card every 90 days until they come up with a vaccine I think science science will come up with a vaccine you know a combination of human immunity and science will come up with I mean it this is like polio you know was when when you were a kid and polio was a definite threat like you had to worry about you know and then they came up with a vaccine right this is another thing I mean disease I have a friend who works in this and she said yet you know viruses and diseases and stuff like they they change they adapt so we havin to adapt yeah we we have to stay ahead of it this one just caught everyone off guard there was no yeah they've been warning us about this kind of thing the possibility of this kind of thing for a long time Bill Gates did a TED talk in 2015 where he talked about it yeah yeah and you know they they show they I don't know they looked at it you know Obama talked about this something we gotta spend money on and get ready for and it's one of those thing people didn't want to believe it he's a guy who's it's almost funny how smart he was like he just you know he's like yeah we should prepare for infectious disease at now that's like now like oh shit you probably should have prepared for infectious diseases yeah and you know the United States but this is just another example of our medical system and we got to get it together where medicine isn't just for the rich yes for sure dude I hate to say this but I have to piss so bad I drank way too much coffee before the show can we pause yeah one of life's great giggling I fucked up sorry folks I had a big thing of bone broth earlier and I had two double espressos then I had to at least two large bottles of water yeah so it was a it was a real strike goddamn it I fucked up I pissed before the show too I thought I was gonna be okay so good that's one of life's great feeling when you when you got a pee and it's just right there and then you get that yeah exactly it's the simple things Joe it's the simple things in the simple pleasures that's what we can enjoy out of this pandemic some of the simple pleasures you know what I do appreciate I appreciate talking to people because I'm you know when you're locked up in your house most of the time you're til I'm here I'm locked up in the house right so I'm sitting around or I'm in the yard or I'm going out we go on trails in my neighborhood still but at a certain point in time you know you want to talk to somebody so I come here I appreciate talking to people like even more than before what what I like is the absolute silence at night like you know it's I'll turn off everything you know no like no TV no music nothing and just it's perfectly silent it's so odd because so few people are out so you just you don't get the car then like where I live you ain't get a lot of cars or anything but you just get nothing it's perfectly silent and it's a strange meditative situation like these are the kind of things that once we get back to once we find out whatever the new normal is that's gonna be the kind of thing that that doesn't like yeah we don't have you realize like my life isn't quiet yeah you know there's a lot of noise in life and and travel you know we were talking about it I don't know what that's gonna be what if what is travel gonna be like it's gonna be weird you know who's gonna be paranoid we're all gonna be paranoid masked up yeah are we gonna be trying to maintain distance what are the airlines gonna do how are they gonna keep distance apart from each other and people already like oddly not connected when they travel right yeah you sit next to a person you usually don't even talk to them you know you get up everybody gets in line you don't even really know very little small talk what we're hurting it's hurting yeah you know so now are you still gonna be able to hurt people are people gonna appreciate you know are we gonna be nicer to each other you know and and you would hope so but human nature always shows like now we like wow it seems whenever we're given the choice of okay can we be better or worse why do we always go to worse well this this is why in this situation you got to be worried because people really don't have any experience with this kind of adversity so this is a new thing so yeah adversity test character there's a lot of people that haven't had a develop character they've been living these weak-ass fucking useless silly lives right and then all of a sudden adversity comes and shines its ugly head and these morons are all sudden dealt the weirdest hand of cards everywhere everybody's kind of fucked and then when things go back to work again when you're asked to deal with adversity and you don't have any character right like you like you're you're a guy with character I think you'll be fine I think you probably will be nicer after this I know I'm gonna be nice yeah I think most people are gonna be like I don't even mean like nicer I mean like a little more appreciative I'm always nice appreciate every should have and aware yeah aware of you know one of the problem people are not aware of the existence of other people yes right you know so you have like if you if you're whole the sign give me liberty or give me death in front of a baskin-robbins ice cream you're like you're not really aware what that means are you like you're probably gonna be okayed this is Baskin Robbins behind you your liberties probably not a life-and-death issue right now the where awareness thing is a it's a real problem with people but there's people that are they're barely keeping it together with the most amazing society ever through no fault of their own for the most part most people were fucked up they grew up in a fucked up house and then fucked up family in a fucked up neighborhood and people did them wrong every step of the way and then here they are all fucked up at 35 years old but that doesn't take away from the fact that they are fucked up at 35 years old and if they are really overweight and they eat sugar all day and they can't keep a job and they're always making excuses and now there's a pandemic don't expect them to rise the occasion right and war you know that that's when the other ones are too we're so insulated from reality yeah you know like I briefly lived in suburbia right I had a house I was up in Valencia that's a nice area it's nice but it's too nice you know what I mean it and it was like it was this perfect suburbia and and all I could think was man the majority these people they had their life goes from the cubicle to the cul-de-sac yep that's her day yeah I mean cubicle at the office and come home to the cul-de-sac yep and it's such a it's you know I was always like I hope there's something in your life that makes this good because this would be the most boring existence but that is what it's almost like that's what we aspire to like that's what they build every time they build one of these new communities right now they even the latest construction of malls I used to always laugh about this so they tear down all the mom-and-pop stores and build a mall which is a fake town of mom-and-pop stores you know I mean like everything is this perfect controlled environment like you said now that's all out the window so what do you do you know and and what do people do yeah malls are well they're already hurting the outdoor malls Oh like REI that kind of shit no these like like oh I'll do or like outside mom's right those might still work but but even now they showed like still like Neiman Marcus about to go bankrupt because people like like with me you know what I don't need clothes well right so people buying shit online people are buying stuff online but but a lot of stuff if you're like a like Macy's you don't sell anything that people need right now no not of people hurting right yeah isn't so so is it makes you critical to stay in business when you don't sell when everything you sell is basically a luxury or a pleasure thing you know like like diamonds right and nobody buy a diamond I haven't seen a cage you lose commercial right you don't see any those engagement commercials now right there's nothing you know it's so it's it is gonna be interesting because those companies have to survive this or don't then get us out like the blockbusters gone bro yeah you know things change was everywhere there's we left date night you know now these kids with their Netflix and chill back in the day we go to the blockbuster store and usually how to go with your girlfriend right you can you couldn't just pick no no that they ran out that's right they ran out of the movies this empty box like we wouldn't see you wouldn't see Tiger King until it was your turn because your blockbuster would have eight Tiger Kings and they'd always be rented when you went there you know a lot of versions and you had to rewind it that's main to only go to home movies came from o made he made a ton of money on those he made then and I'm not talking porn I'm talking regular movies he said what he would do is he would get the seniors in film school right and he would give them what did he say he gave him something like ten thousand dollars in the camera and said go make a movie and then he they it was either ten grand or 50 grand or something like that but he give him that in the camera go make a movie and they come back and he said and it always would be a slasher movie but they were the easiest to make and he said it's amazing how many women will take their top off if you point a camera at him so it was all like titty slasher movies and he would sell them overseas you know it was you know it was like bikers crazy kill or supp metamorph you know though the the the mall monster would and it was all these but but he made a he made a ton of money off of that it was the straight-to-video movies with no budget and the kids would make them and to the kid you know if you're a senior in film school that's a great thing when somebody says here's some cash and a camera go make a movie feels to me the same way to feel about like NCAA athletes not getting paid to play right what's going you know not quite as bad but it's a great thing for the kids too so you're a kid and you're going to film school and some guy comes along goes not only I'm gonna give you the equipment I'm gonna give you fifty thousand dollars to make a movie right movie then he's gonna sell it for a couple of hundred grand or 50 or whatever in the international video market but but salerio and you talk about bad I mean these movies were just but that's what made it fun is the movies were so bad you know that it was it was like great like they we don't really have an editing budget right you know no special effects No yeah is that guy holding a microphone in this shot well you know what's funny though occasionally someone will make a movie for 15 bucks and it works like you remember Blair Witch Project which yeah that was a fucking legitimately scary move the scary movie and then they try to do it big budget and they couldn't make it work not they fucked it had to be that you know they fucked it up the found-footage like what is this let's watch it like that those videos there was a hole shut there wasn't a series of movie calls VHF wasn't there or VHS VHS VHS that's right Jeff was right but VHS was a movie about people finding VHS footage of like people getting attacked by demons and it was one that the lady they they made a movie afterwards about her I think was called siren where she was one of the characters in the VHS or VH yeah VHS she was one of the characters in that in one of the it was a girl that was really pretty but really weird and these guys took her back to the house and she wanted to fuck them and she's like I love you I like you I like you and she turns into a diamond tears everybody apart it was really wild yeah wild shit but yeah but do you employ marketing for Blair Witch that they had a bunch of online stuff that made it seem real when it came out right there was like news and Willys stories about people disappearing those are those people right now that are talking about five G fuckin five g's this is it is coronaviruses a ho it's all five G and it was created but yeah though when people say that like and and now have you got this I'm sure you've gotten this people who were otherwise reasonable send you something and you're like holy shit do you believe this like now I got to rethink my relationship with you yeah like I got the one about don't take the vaccine because the vaccine is the sickness and they're they're experimenting on you and they want to you know it's like man you you gotta like you believe this I got one from a smart dude that I know where there were this doctor was talked to straight to the camera and the doctor saying this is not a disease this is radiation sickness doctor yeah a doctor yeah well appointment but where's a doctor's outfit I'm like it's a friend radiation is easy know exactly what it is they've got it they know the genome they've nothing it came from the bats that came from the very area that the Wuhan lab was studying yeah this is really well documented shit but people will absolutely ignore that that that's what's frustrating to the scientists and the doctors right when they're standing there and and their list and they're like we know this shit you know like like a friend of mine who's a doctor he hates WebMD because patients come in and they're diagnosed I read on on the internet and here he'll be like yeah cuz I went to school he's really funny cuz he's like yeah I went to school and I've been practicing medicine for 20 years so I probably know more than your website but if you want some people but there's some doctors suck though yeah they're a bad that's the thing but it's bad everything again being home I've watched some Network TV and I never really watched network TV but now I'll just be watching whatever every commercial is either some drug right some drug for whatever condition you think you have or this or that or it's a thank you to the people giving care during this time it seems like that those are the only two commercial that's why I say like if you watch too much TV yeah you're gonna start being scared to death and believe in conspiracies because you're constantly pounded with this shit like you're just pounded with the the negativity the fear to take a drug for whatever you might feel or think you feel or whatever and then the drugs the side effects of the drugs and then there's now there's a drug for the side effect of the drug that you took for something else you know I mean like like you you have to take a break you can't I don't think you can watch upper limit upper lip two hours of news a day any more than that even now just keep it that like I say that's that's the extreme upper limit I feel like I'm not watching much I am checking in on news stories on my phone every now and again when I read I read the news cuz if I read the news I can control the amount and I can also get different sources different like or I read a story and then google the story and see what other stories are about that so like like when we were talking before about the thing about people drinking Clorox and you're like are they really drinking Clorox and then you you google it and you're like oh no thank god they're not drinking Clorox like a Clorox and Lysol put out a warning don't do it well if they hadn't it's probably a couple of them will try this cuz and plus you know there was a lawyer somewhere like me I'm ready to sue Clorox yeah you know of course of course somebody's gonna get sued but now it's uh it's a fucking weird time man it's gonna be weird when everything starts back up how people behave I'm hopeful I'm hopeful for the best but again we're talking about there's gonna be the worst of us that are not gonna do well with this yes they're not prepared for any kind of adversity so when this adversity comes out we're all supposed to group up together some people are gonna act out that's unfortunate but I think it's gonna be less I think more people gonna rise they're gonna rise to the occasion hopefully hopefully and and hopefully and this is where you you honestly you need good information you can't you know that you can't have the crazy information and that you you need good information that has to be given to everybody like this this is what's real because there's always been crazy information right there's always been a National Enquirer and what was that other paper the national star the Stars that's all it's big news but that but they never like like now you have people reading that like no this is the real story and and you know the New York Times is fake it's like no I think you got that backwards now New York Times ain't perfect but I think they're a little closer than the weekly world news that's a real problem it's someone like Trump whenever he gets challenged just calls everything fake news your fake news your fixtures like they get something's wrong you're right but if you just keep calling everything fake news you crying wolf right and the problem is then we don't know who to trust so if someone just but you're talking about the dangers of blindly believing the president's drink bleach well blindly believing the president that the Washington Post is always wrong or that CNN is always wrong or the New York Times is full of shit that's not that's what but then who's not it's not because and yeah there is you know the news is politicized and there's left and rightness in that but papers like The Washington Post in New York Times the LA Times they do a pretty good job and they've been doing it for a long time and and if you if you read it they've attacked both sides when things you know when when someone makes a mistake they call them out on it and this and that and yeah you got it if you lose trust of that then who do you trust now now's when the crazy comes in when you when you start below again when you start believing the Weekly World News and doubting the New York Times what do you trust like that's your would you have a new source I have a few that The Times my newsfeed I've got the New York Times I got the LA Times I read some of the BBC I like I like the BBC because looking at the United States from the outside looking in is kind of a different point of view you know what out whether the feeds I get Daily Beast is is I like them once in a while I get Huffington Post articles popping up and and I read some some opinion pieces you know again again there are there are some I read this thing recently and it was really good it was about the world being disappointed and sad by the United States lack of leadership through this and the article talked about like this is the first time in the past hundred years where something happened to the world in the United States didn't take the lead and it went back to talking about how we defeated fascism and then democracy grew and and the Cold War and you know and and it said that and these were scientist from France the UK Germany where was this article it was in The Times it was in the New York Times and they talked like one of the the scientists was a climatologist from Germany that studied at Columbia and they said you know some of the best and brightest minds in the world they're in the United States but no one's listening to them and and they talked about how the United States again took the lead whenever something would happen today to the world the United States would take the lead and say hey we got this this is what we're gonna do what do you think they could have done different and it talked about it in the article first thing was take it seriously and listen to the scientists that was the first thing that the government could have done when a scientist spoke up and said hey this is real this is not some Chinese thing or this is real you listen to them and the second thing is give people real information say hey like you don't come out say this is a hoax and then say it's not a hoax you came out like they were because they were talking about Germany which I didn't notice that Markel is a physicist the Chancellor of Germany so she right away went to science because she's a scientist which I never knew but they said but they told the German people like okay this is real there's a threat this is we you know we don't know what to do but we're gonna do something and I think had we done that had the United States done that in January or in the latest February said this is a real threat we have to take action and we're studying it we're you know basically you want to hear the government say we're on it that that I think would have been a big difference because then just it was like 911 ranked when 9/11 happened the entire country came together we dropped our differences and said yo they attacked the United States of America right and and now the actions afterwards later the war and all of that you may or may not have agreed with but if you limit that for that first month man we were all America so you know what I mean like you you we were sitting around talking and it was like this is the United States so remember the flags on the cars yeah yeah I mean we came together in London used to sell them yeah I believe it I believe it I love Jay I love to love Jay he is he's a character but he's genuine and in the biggest heart in the world the first TV show I ever did I did with Jay London 1993 or some shit I'll tell you my favorite Jay London story from last comic in a minute because cuz you know we lived it together in the house pound reality show we were there for about four or five weeks but but had they come out and said this is real where we don't know what it is but scientists are working on it and right now we need everybody to pause that's what they need everybody needs to pause well you know and and then the other thing I think they needed to do from the beginning and this goes back to World War 2 I there's a name for it whatever the Defense Act is where you call you know General Motors and Boeing and I don't know 3m and whatever drug companies and say I drop what you're doing we need you on this mmm because the United States like that was world war two right when they said now we're not making records we're not making pantyhose we're not making cars like you're gonna make tanks and you're gonna make bullets I think that's the act he's using right now to try to force the meat companies Meatpacking companies to stay open yeah but it's it's it's piecemeal and it's too late like like if you do it I think if it was done from the beginning it forget about the you're a Democratic governor and you're a Republican governor and you're Republic fuck all that like this is America like this is in times like this like you said when adversity shows character right this is when the character or the nation and this is what this article was talking about where the United States didn't do that where you had the federal government fighting against governor's and they're arguing over who has constitutional power and stuff like this so you think that there was an adjusting period of people didn't think it was serious and then thought it was serious like how did you the person didn't you personally go through a period where you weren't worried about it and then you became more worried about it as time went on right yes definitely but that's because of information because we weren't given but you remember like inflammation what the information we were getting in January it wasn't that bad the World Health one World Health Organization tweeted that there's according to China there's no worry of it being carried from person to person that was in January yeah it all happened in a weird way where there was conflicting information right and people didn't but but once people knew that's why I said maybe by February right because in February people knew yeah once February came around there was enough warnings that but try convincing everybody else there's so many naysayers out there right but but again this is where but if you have a unified voice if you have one voice coming out saying hey this is what the scientists are saying you know because because and I tweeted this a long time ago look I'm gonna get my information from scientists not from politicians you know this is where the politicians need to step to the side on the podium like like what did I always do in the movie when the mayor stands up here and now I'm gonna give it to the chief of police who's gonna tell you like yes you needed you know a president who's gonna say okay this is a situation now here's the head of the you know infectious disease Bureau or whatever it was supposedly did we figure out what fuckin happened with that pandemic branch like remember they were said they said that he closed down that Trump closed down some a lot of the people that have been taken off the team have been spread around different jobs they all they ought they do respond to pandemic type things but but there's not one specific project they disbanded there was and that was lips when they show the Obama speech cuz that's what came after the Ebola thing was when he said yeah we need he said this is like What did he say he said it's an investment he said it's not an expense it's an investment or insurance or something like that but we need a department ready to deal with this because this is a real threat well now that they know now that there's I mean in our lifetime this never happened now that it has worldwide where the whole world is locked down everybody's got to step up with this right I mean this has to be as much of a priority as natural defense or immigration or healthcare or anything and because this can put all of them to and if there's a real like really deadly disease right this disease obviously not good it's terrible this is a warning this is a really a shot over the bow in comparison to a lot of diseases and I think the other thing is and again this is where you know when people talk about I don't know government power and government dissident like this is when the government is supposed to operate this is when the government's supposed to tell the medical world like alright this is what you do yeah we'll pay don't worry we're gonna fucking pay you but right now if someone walks in sick you lock them down and you you don't send them away because they don't have insurance and so cuz I mean we have you know let spreads more so much of that right our whole medical system based on what like it's always been frustrating to me when you go to a doctor their first question is what was your insurance card not how are you feeling not what's wrong and and it's the system but but this was a case where they needed to say alright I'll put all that shit aside you're gonna take care of patients we're gonna isolate cuz with the Ebola thing remember that son of bitch came like that one guy came from Africa or something and they like lock that bitch up they were like nah man you ain't going near anybody you're gonna be in an award sealed off nobody's coming near you who's not wearing full protect and they stopped they I don't know if stop there's a right where it's not nearly smart yeah that's not as contagious but but there was real work it's serious yeah and and the medical community has to like we need them now you know what I mean and we need them beyond the government is the one who has to say this is what you'll do we'll pay you for it you know and we'll pay later and listen that that's what we do and people talk about you know how much is it gonna cost and why well right now that we got to deal with this you know nobody worried about the cost of winning World War two they were like fuck let's win the war and then we'll figure it out and then we turned out to make even more money afterwards right and yeah there's a military-industrial complex that makes money in blah but yeah you can always find all of this negative shit there's gonna be people who ripoff contracts and stuff yeah yeah yeah but that's bad and it exists but the government needed to step up our government didn't step up on this they didn't give people real information and like you said we got different information from different people you didn't know if it was a real or a hoax you didn't know what to do well there's a bunch of things going on here but one thing it shows the need for something like what a lot of you like Bernie Sanders are calling for was have health care for everybody yes yeah we need to have health care should be a basic right just like Fire Department is just and in a lot of ways I compare it to fires because like if your house catches on fire no one does shit about it then it burns the house next door yeah and that's same with pandemics if someone gets sick and we don't you have a way to get them healthy quick and have a way to make sure that they they have health care like they don't have to worry like that you could just go somewhere and you're not gonna be spreading this just go somewhere and they'll treat you and then you won't have it right and your mom won't have it no one will have it like you and you won't go to erupt they're not there yet you won't you won't go bankrupt makes people up all these fucking guys who just want small government sometimes you need a lot of government this is when you need a big government with power yeah and this is this is what the government does example cuz unless you are in that category that you could afford a bunker in New Zealand those dudes there okay story about a Silicon Valley guy who had a bunker in New Zealand and he how to call the manufacturer in New Zealand money you're okay if you if you've got David Geffen's 200 million dollar yacht that's sailing you know you're probably alright but but most you got to worry about pirates you know if they know that you're locked in the ground in New Zealand they just wait outside the bunker hole all those New Zealand's kind of got this wrapped up do they have no deaths now there's like no new deaths but you're like a thousand miles from Australia like was New Zealand is definitely like hey you ain't getting it yeah anybody new zealand's amazing I've never been but from what I've learned from people that go there all the time and my friends had actually lived there it's fucking beautiful that's what I hear I have a friend who runs motorcycle tours in New Zealand and I keep saying like yeah one year I'm gonna go that's another thing that's gonna happen all the stuff we've been I'm gonna do one day when when went in the world opens up we're gonna start doing that yeah I think we're all gonna start doing that oh I was gonna do this one day we're gonna start doing my own so I hope a lot of people get out of dead-end jobs look when your job dissolves and you're forced to do something else you know there's a lot of people that got stuck in a situation in life and they were on momentum and now that momentum completely stopped you get all that time to yourself all that time to reassess oh well I had that thought like what would I do if there's no more stand-up I don't know I don't know a bummer it's a bummer of a thought but does that mean it's gotta mean there's no more restaurants - yeah I don't think it'll go away because you know I've had those interviews like what if the and comics tell the truth like we're the truth tellers we always do that in a podcast so we'll still be around I say we're gonna survive stand-ups gonna spy gonna take a while how long it'd be different I have no idea man but when when does the Comedy Store open up again summer yeah yeah I don't know if they wear mass or we just have to sit a certain distance from each other but I'm gonna I think again I think they're experimenting now I think these opening up you know places in Georgia yes I think it's too soon too soon yeah especially the other thing was because I was read about New Zealand and it's almost like they're doing the exact opposite like they said the places with personal contact the the hair nails massage whatever are gonna be the last places to open and I think that's wait that's what it should be I mean that that's a very close contact when someone's doing your hair nails someone sent me some shit from Germany where they have a line on the floor like a caution line these ladies are behind the line with like long sticks probably and maybe that'll work but you know like like in Georgia like they're opening the tattoo product like I don't think that that's an essential service you need right now well I think you don't want the tattoo business the question true that no I get that from Wendy who gets to decide I think you do it and well again they're experimenting but I think you do it in stages right so so before you open the tattoo parlours maybe we go to restaurants and sit at eat every other table hmm and I don't think it's a bad idea for the tattoo or to see them because you can decide to let someone in the business right and make them wear a mask and keep them away from you I mean if you can get people tested if you can go to the tattoo artists and say hey here's my test I got it yesterday here's a results why is that so hard like we won't get like some sort of a document that you can carry well no you're right this was another one of that you know best and brightest and come together right the the company's the science companies like the government should be like all right drop whatever you're doing like we don't need more viagra we need a test for four kovat you know I mean like develop something so we can because testing is a thing you you gotta test people are locked up and they're not gonna stop making viagra nine months from now there's gonna be overpopulation bump like the world's never seen before that's gonna be the big pandemic the Big Bend we're running out of doctors deal with all these people shitting out kids man that well good that would be that would be a positive positive me but but yeah well yeah and what you said is true listen it I'm not anti tattoo artist by any means I gotta my but I get it but I was just using that I guess won't be the most important thing to be open food stores obviously stayed open during this entire time they're the most important thing gas stations that's important but at a certain point in time we we have to figure out like what it what is the threshold should should we quarantine old people in sick people from here out and should we let regular people go free and should we make testing more readily available those are the things like maybe testing way more available and leave it up to people to make their own decisions at a certain point time you can't just keep people locked up no you can't keep them locked up because we're getting wicked and fever hearing now in LA right we were fine being locked up for those couple of weeks when it was sixty and raining yeah but when it hit 85 and the Sun is out and we don't have to go to work and you can't go to the beach yes like oh you now is when you can't keep people locked up and it's a late spring in a lot of the country but as as the weather gets warmer and people getting on each other's nerves in the house like that's when you gotta let you know so yet testing is a big thing and just what you said if there's some how you get tested and then you have proof like yeah I've been tested I'm okay then you're like okay now you can function you can you can like if you if you're running a business if you're running the nail salon or the tattoo place or whatever you know like George Wallace tweeted this thing about bowling he's like don't everybody share shoes essential in Georgia bowling Alex run list so you you know you got a before you get your bowling shoes you got to show them your test card I got that's that's gonna be it and and and and it is also a function of where you are right obviously New York where the population density is just unbelievable it spread more and you got to be more careful here eyelash and air pollution people who smoke there's a lot of factors be sitting along your actors we're in our cars in LA so much that we don't interact as much as you know New York and then if you're in you know Iowa or Oklahoma one of those place someplace where the population is more spread out then it is gonna be easier because you're just naturally you don't encounter people as much yeah like if you have a small town like there's this case going on with a small town in Northern California where they don't have any cases and they just want to open up and like can't we just keep going to the town can't we have restaurants if no one's sick like when like as long as new people don't come into this town this town's clean yeah but then how do you stop that you know how do you see if you have restaurants how do you stop the people from San Francisco dirty outside from driving up to your restaurant dirty outsiders there you go people find out that all that county's opened up and they've got restaurants back there well like the beaches right the LA Dodgers are closed but Orange County and Ventura beaches are open now the Governor's Cup well when they were open LA people just went to those I was so torn on that on one thing like yeah what if those people do get people sick but the other part is man if you're stuck in a fucking apartment like the only happiness you've gotten out of all this is when you got to go to the beach yeah now that's gone right you yeah it's a it's a tough line you got to let people out and when people go out they got to behave right so when what's the number president Alonso what should we do everyone we keep the lockdown until May 15th and then May 15th we leave the commodores is essential business May 15th we reassess we assess where are we at are there still an increased number of an of people getting infected has it stabilized right and what does it look like in Georgia and what in Texas long as we got them what does Florida let's see what they do you can't count Florida I got friends I love people in Florida but sorry Florida we're just gonna have to yes we can't count [Laughter] that's it as Florida third-world country it's just no it's a alternate reality that's an alternate reality even when you're in Florida this to Florida is right because there's coastal Florida but Florida they tell us about which is Miami Fort Lauderdale Orlando Tampa then there's that Pensacola then there's that middle of Florida they don't talk they made that Lynyrd Skynyrd music what that order from this the governor I was all going around last night it was an order that was sent as it was going around as a memo that was sent to sheriff's office as I'm reading right now it's not an official order so while all these sorts of recommendations yeah sites saying the governor said he's closing down all the beaches so what is it previous to the story up to previous reports say there were conversations that they were having maybe he panicked rehired previous reports for Newsom's orders indicated he planned to close all the state's beaches which drew widespread criticism from some state officials when asked what changed his mind on closing state bitch beaches bitches Newsom said that they never did and this is exactly the conversations we were having so they never did close all the beaches what witnesses some okay officials in other parts of California spoken out against a blanket beach ban in California sheriff William Han Solo oversees Humboldt County halle in the northern part of the state where they get high as Mark said he strongly opposes the order and indicated in a tweet that he would not enforce it if an order is issued I believe violates our constitutional rights I will not enforce it good for you Sheriff yeah only I wish he hadn't said it that way he's right he's right it doesn't your constitutional rights but then the proxy the problem with that is that that brings out the crazies right angry but he's responded look at Newsome's actually reacting this said is of office received regarding the beach closures but said that his decision is guided on what local health officials think is appropriate and what's not when you pull back too quickly you literally put people's lives at risk people are literally dying because I don't like when a governor uses literally twice like that I'm a stickler for some some sort of grammar because the decisions that were done without a real frame of focus on public health first Newsome said that's what ultimately guide our decisions that's good but you you've got to also give people freedom and you got to give them the opportunity they don't want to go to the beach like there should be a way you can avoid go if everybody's still everybody else is still locked down how much does it really spread if people go to the beach and then come home well this is the thing and this is where common sense like I get the constitutionality of it but when you say that that angers people that word angers people so you use common sense and and I get what the sheriff's saying like if you're in Humboldt County at a small beach that's not the same as opening Santa Monica right so you look at individually where are you at what's the population who's going to the beach and you that's why yeah you leave it up more it's more of a local decision because California the coastline is so big and so long there are some places where it's gonna be packed and other places where it's not and the places where it's not gonna be so packed let them open those places are where breakfast people run the place odd but let them let them open but you can't open you know Venice yes because that's just gonna be too dangerous and that's where and that's why when I say to constitutional work because once you say constitutional then you bring out these people that want to make it a protest I want to make it a thing and it's and these are people who don't even care about going to the beach they just want to make it a thing it's like don't don't fuel that fire don't don't throw logs the dudes who want a ranch on public land for free and robbed guns and try to keep the feds wigs a house light like the guns like that was the thing right when they first said guns are not essential right then they pulled back on that it was essential and then they decided to stop it from being essential cuz giant lie outside a gun store yeah people kind of tweaking and then people complained about that and then they stepped in and said it's not and everybody said fuck you and then they go here we're kidding you can have your guns so let me tell you cuz cuz I had I directly experienced this last week I bought a gun about it unless first time you've ever owned a gun no no I owned a gun back in the 80s I used to target shoot with some guys I worked with up in Oakland but I bought a gun right because it all of this went down and feel like why'd you buy a gun I said because the purge went from a movie to a documentary I don't want to be the only one you know but but the way I had to do it was you go online and you make an appointment with the gun store and then you show up and you wait outside like they come with I bought a Glock 45 Oh stepping up yeah so I checked with the gangbangers they were like yet it's the one-year old sideways but but anyway you had to wait outside you know six feet apart or whatever and they brought you in one at a time and and then I was able to do it I did the background check by the way the people who fight against the the test in the background check like how like you understand how have you done that do you know how easy these questions are very easy this questions are they're like are you a felon yes are you you know is there currently a restraining order out against you like well who who would check YES on that box right well you know I'm pretty confident that I'll pass and I'll get it and and the guy was cool this is this was one of my concerns was I was because I don't you know I don't know what guns store to go to right so I was so I said man don't let me walk into some place where there's a big confederate flag on the wall in LA County yeah you can find would listen listen Joe trust me on this trust me on this there are be but anyway no guy was really foreign country off the five yeah and the funny thing was the one of the big things was the size of my hands right so I big hands so he's kind of like yeah man you got a try he literally try it on and see how it fits and the Glock fit my hand really well and then I was asking about shotguns and he was like tell him because I've fired shotguns I've done that skeet shooting stuff and he was talking to me about tactical shotguns and so so he said yeah you want to get he said you probably won't win of these because you don't really have to aim too well when you got one of these he's just blast in the direction I was like all right that sounds good so I'm probably gonna get one of those too but yeah but it was cool and and you know I get it like I'm you know it's funny because people say that people have accused maybe an anti gun and I'm like no I'm not anti-gun I'm Pro common-sense I'm Pro common-sense but we thought some gun laws before this did you think that people don't need to have guns no I never thought people don't need what I think you did because I've talked about like we we don't need 50 round clips you know I had a joke I said listen I got a 50 round clip for self-defense I'm like if 50 people want to kill you at the same time maybe it's you perhaps there's some part of your personality you need to look at I'll tell you one thing I've always got about guns I'm a motorcycle guy I'm a car guy and I know some gun people and from the mechanical artistic point like this is you know what I mean yeah I get that like yeah yeah there are guns that are beautiful just from a mechanical standpoint like you look like this is a beautiful thing and and if you want to shoot it and shoot targets and this and that let great if you want to hunt like you hunt I called you you remember I texted you I said Joe if this shit goes down I'm coming to your bunker cuz I know you know how to kill animals like I got a friend who knows how to kill animals i'ma go hang out with him earlier today someone was asking me if would you be okay and I'm like you you probably would not be okay with no civilization because you'd break an ankle and you die you you get my infection and you die and good luck finding animals all the time and what if you run out of arrows or what if you run out of bullets you can't make your own bullets well if you get real weird real quick but but all of that aside but those are the people who I'm like those are the ones we need to watch the ones who's like I gotta have this whole yeah bunker full of ammo in this and add the government housing gun the government's coming to get me and all that like those are the ones so when I talk about gun laws and rid that's why I say common sense there's a common sense level to it you know that that I'm okay with but but no I'm not anti I'm not anti gun um but you can see the thing about people is they think it's a slippery slope so if you say I am for the Second Amendment but I don't think you should have 50 round clips or I don't think you should have didn't they're like whoa who gets the suicide comments you know you know who should decide should be the majority it should be people but but again this is where we're all one side or the other and common sense is in the middle if we had a government of Congress whatever that could debate and talk about and have input and say hey the hunters say that we need this and and you know now it all makes sense then you come up with it with a reasonable gun thing like for instance I think that cars are a good example like we've regulated guns way we regulate cars in a sense you have to have a license and when you sell it even privately if I sell my car to you I notify the government like hey I just sold my car to Joe VIN number blah blah blah he's now responsible for you know all right there for a second because if someone just I need to find out this is true someone just told me that in Georgia they're gonna let kids have driver's license down that's a hundred percent true that you don't have to go through a driver's test now like the print up the last step of the like going to the DMV we plot an article on that so I could read what the parameters are that is terrible yeah remember how bad you were a driver when you first started you know what again Joe when they do this I'm like yeah why the hell not why the hell not leaves road test requirement for driver's license during corner of iris Wow right cuz why would you need a road test to drive a car the state government will rely on the honor system with parents giving young drivers to ok to obtain a license in fucking Georgia Jesus Christ Joe once again once again common sense see now that you saw that and your common sense meter went oh hell Georgie's reckless they're lettin people go to barber shops to letting people get a license with no test you know George is right next to Florida oh just sayin but I would think of no no offense Florida but I would think of Georgia above floor I think Atlanta above any city that is in Florida no offense Florida but me to be Miami's a party city all the rest of them there's not there's not a city that has the kind of sophistication that Atlanta has right but Atlanta is an island within Georgia yes like an island I know so we look at Georgia we think oh yeah Atlanta I've watched that Real Housewives show the rest of Georgia the rest of Georgia you know there's a lot of well you know it's like California right everyone thinks of LA in San Francisco but there's a lot of California in between LA and San Francisco yes that is different like the guy that's gonna run through violating the constitutional rights and he's not gonna enforce it yeah it's um California on the way up to San Francisco when you take that five that's what I was talking about yeah that's farm country with anti-abortion billboards that's right yeah and the whole water thing they're fighting against the cities for the water exact water rights yeah this is a lot going on you know so so yeah I think that again if it worked if the system worked we'd have a system of common-sense unfortunately we just have one extreme of the other day the thing about no guns it's like what do you think this there's already millions of guns out there so that that's impossible like that's an unreasonable it is very misleading there's not a clean answer zone when people bring that up the walls true you dude it like okay first of all a there's only 20 million people in the whole fucking continent and it's a size the contiguous United States so there's more people in California than there is in Australia right so shut the fuck up yeah and they also did it over a period of time they did it and they did it at it they did it in a moment about rage they did it in a moment about rage and and unfortunately used us as an example yeah you can still get guns over there for hunting though yeah hunt with guns over there what kind of these people hunt in Canada you know in Canada had a mass shooting reason too long though yeah yeah but so uh uh you know yeah like you said it's one of those without an answer that's the problem like if you offend if you definitively think that this is the way and you don't see the other side of it then you're gonna always have this polarized argument right ankle wind would lose that if they'd lose the I have to win right and just like let's come up with a compromise that works but the gun people like particularly NRA people they don't think you should give up any ground because if you give up any ground from where we are right now it's just a slippery slope you're gonna keep taking and they do have a point with some people now a lot of those people that used to think like that now are buying guns buddy - wife was you're never having a gun you never have any gun this shit went down you need to get a gun like he said this it was a 180 switch and wrapping immediately when everything was shutting down you start thinking of people in their worst case possibility rather than ah we live in a nice area we're fine yeah and and again you're right either extreme is is impossible neither one wants to give up in it yeah and you both have to give up an inch you know neither one wants to give an inch but you both have to give an inch and you it you know and again it's what we're talking about earlier where the federal government the federal government does need to be involved in a sense where you have like Chicago that has a huge gun problem partly because you can just drive over to Indiana and buy anything you want and bring it to Chicago hmm is that what the problem is yeah who else is Indiana to Chicago Gary Indiana to Chicago and things like to three-hour drive oh and that's where guns come from when I grew up in I grew up in New York City right New York City has some of if not the strictest gun laws in the country I knew guys they you go down south you go to Virginia North Carolina South Carolina buy any gun you want drive up and sell them in New York because remember we are borders you know there's no border between France you drive I hope that stays the way it is I know that's a terrible thing that people were bringing guns from Virginia but I hope the border thing stays the same I want to drive across the country you can just go yeah I think the border should stay the same but I think there has to be some sort of federal oversight to this so what they're again what what you can buy what's required to buy it what's required if you had to provide ID to show who you are and where you live so now if you're in my gun you mean yeah you should have more than that you should definitely do that too though but that's what I'm saying so now if you're in one of the more lakh states like Virginia and I'm just using these example I don't know specific laws but a Virginia or Arizona or something like that you know you can't just go there you live in California live in New York and go there and buy one like you got to prove like yeah I live in Arizona hmm so I can buy it so I'm subject to Arizona's laws yeah how does that work if you're a citizen of the United States you drive to Arizona you just buy a gun like you live in Arizona I from what I understand and listen I'm far from an expert I know there's Robert sorry Google this but but the gun shows I think that's where they said you have a lot of lot of fuckery in the gun yeah because the gun shows is just one guy one person selling to another and that's where it gets really vague yeah that's what the rules people buy all kinds of illegal shit right so I think you you know I think in a gun store you need to provide ID and stuff like that but the gun shows yeah it gets really kind of a gray area didn't Bruno from didn't Sacha Baron Cohen this Bruno character go to a gun show yeah let super gay yeah guns are fun the problem is people are morons it's not the problem is not that guns aren't fun you know I get yeah I like guns I have friends who are really gun nuts you know our friends that have so many guns they don't know how many guns they have they love guns and they love them for the mechanical thing it's their hobby like some people are really into muscle cars some people I'm absolutely cool with that because most of the people I knew one guy who he was one like I'd be worried about you know he was one like I'm yeah this guy's waiting for a reason I've a friend who's a gun nut he got carjacked and he shot a guy and killed him but most of the gun guys I knew they collected him like you said it was like muscle cars or motorcycles yeah whatever it was just their thing and and they were good what and the other thing is the gun safety you know need these idiots like there's so many stories like yet a gun was in the backseat and the kid shot the other kid miss it's like come on there has to be some kind of safety and liability issue you know you like what's morons is not you you'd never do that I would never do that right it's the problem as you're taking something with godlike powers and you give it it tomorrow man so there has to be that you have to somehow you're too dumb for a gun regulate tomorrow yeah you know man we talked to a few people and yeah are you a felon it should be like a competency test you know I mean you need a competency test to drive a car because a car could be deadly well no you don't need no you don't you just need to go to George during the they're probably taking so much heat for that right now people are probably freaking out then again maybe not because it's Georgia yeah and again where where are you so if you're way out on a farm in Georgia and you want to drive the pickup truck then that's probably okay but but but if you're in downtown Atlanta right at 16 and your parents are like yeah you can have a license what the hell oh my god blinkers gonna be in a panic that's a limb but it's so it's such a poorly fucking thought-out idea yeah who decided that who decided that you know you know yes screw the screw to road-test what was the Governor of Alabama that we didn't want to shut down she goes we're not California yeah was that what it was yeah it's like no you're not we're not California craziest place in Alabama have you been to Huntsville in the Dosan Dothan Alabama I did the UFC there in 1997 first UFC ever did okay I've been to a couple different places in Alabama well here's the thing huntsville alabama rocket scientists it's where NASA is when I drove in there's a Saturn 5 rocket shed it is the last thing you're like this is Alabama literally they are rocket scientists must be some of the smartest people that's exactly it it's the last thing you would expect it blew my mind they blew I mean yeah the US Army these are literally some of the smartest people in the country in the world yeah in Huntsville Alabama I bet they have good food there though yeah they had all kind of good but no southern people know how to eat it was one of those things that you're like man this is this is insane it's just weird like you didn't think I didn't expect it there and that funny when you think about that that people have been cooking over fire forever but southern people well I hold on let's slow it down because they're not worried about it being healthy I want some chicken fried chicken with a cream sauce when it's done when it's done right man you know but that but then they take it too far right now we're deep-frying Twinkies you're like okay stop this is done so your heart just stops yeah but chicken fried steak when done right with that gravy and some mashed potatoes like I remember one time we did a show in Georgia at the club what was the club there was at the funny bone punchline punchline Atlanta we did we did that Club and then afterwards we went to this local diner that had chicken-fried steak and I was like oh my god yeah it was so they know how to make floor you know insane you get some sweet potatoes yesterday and then you know some cobbler for dessert and like it but nobody's counting calories nobodies downtown yeah well I think the people that probably earned the right to make that food back in the day we're probably working some crazy hours you do physical labor all day like who fucking did all those foods like who who was the first guy to look at a barrel and look at another better one I need a barrel where I cook on and then I want another one next to it so the smokes coming in on the side slowly cook this fucker somebody did it by accident and then everything man that was good or maybe they just like like cook something like they go oh I need to cook this like I don't have I don't want to cook it right now I'm gonna like just cab but a little bit me if I put a little bit of a fire and just let it sit for a while I don't have the time to pay attention to it I'll come back do it let it cook all day or or they tasted the smoke in something and they're like man that's good how do we how do we just get that flavor I don't know but thank God for him thank God for him cuz they they do know how not an American idea Tory kiln smoke house the first smoking device in smoking history and what did they cook there was that salmon people love smoked salmon just as meat just meat Scotland oh yeah because in Montreal smoked meat is like that's what they call like deli meats yeah yeah it's something like pastrami pastrami but it melts in your mouth so much yeah the place where you line up outside what is that place called uh I don't know how I'm forgetting the name cuz I've been about yeah you and now here's a place you talk about social distancing there is no you had you just had to sit at the bench next to whoever ya and eat your smoked meat and then as soon as you finish they were like alright get out for you see yeah that's not the name of the place yeah it was like a dude's name like Franks or something like that someone ranked me but it's a smoked meat it's the most don't don't below cup smokehouse look at a smoked meat yeah there you go see there it is smoked meats you see if there's a restaurant shows as much as we've done the festival look at that 12,000 reviews all five stars yes you waited long you to get your smoked meat you sit down next to whoever you eat it and you get the hell out oh shit they're open I guess there was the Rope doing to go a Montreal it's so cold up there that virus doesn't have a chance in Winnipeg I remember the first time you wish for a virus and Winnipeg yeah oh there's something like the Jews know how to make those goddamn meat sandwiches yeah pastrami pastrami Reuben from Cantor's yes I hope we don't lose too many restaurants ma'am we're gonna lose a lot of the private you know the ones that aren't smart of a chain or yeah whatever yeah we gotta support them yeah that whole thing was crazy we're like Ruth's Chris gets twenty million dollars and you know all of that well I guess they think of it from an economic perspective Ruth's Chris employees you know fifty thousand people whatever different locations you know what it was it was that they went by individual restaurants so like if you had I think if you had over six thousand employees or something you were considered a big business but each restaurant only has you know forty fifty people so that's how they got the money I had a small business right there yet it got smaller included in it right because has that stores on are less than fifty years right they count each one they don't count the whole nationwide corporation they count each one and that's why they got the money so individually area the money and likes you could own Alonzo Bodden Ruth's Chris you could have your own Ruth's Chris but what the theory was that this money would be divided amongst all of the restaurants but of course it wasn't gonna happen the money was just gonna go to corporate and then they basically they got shamed out of you know they were like they were shamed and they wouldn't gave it back I don't know if did Bruce Chris yet cuz cuz like steak shack and the other place that they were like now we're not gonna take the money okay good Bruce Chris take house returns a twenty million dollar federal loan in response to public demand I remember roost Chris back when people thought butter was bad for you they were putting butter on stage yeah that's back when they're like who gives a fuck about your health right like butter on the steak and then the one they realized that butter is actually good for you like you ever hear the story of how they got that name yeah I forgot it was Chris's Steakhouse and this woman bought it and in the contract they had to keep it Chris Steakhouse so that's why it's Ruth's Chris Steakhouse oh good for her yes I fucking didn't hurt her brilliant idea it was a great idea she said that I think it was originally like in Louisiana and Texas and she said these businessmen travel and everywhere they go they're gonna want to eat steak so she started opening up where the you know where these guys went in business so that they would recognize the restaurant woman very smart woman that's a franchise that's very accurate that's how she built the franchise if I'm with my friends we're gonna go eat somewhere we look for a steakhouse right and if you recognize one and you know it's good yeah then that's where you go yeah so good move that's a good move yeah the whole Steakhouse thing it's like that is a that's a very uniquely at least we look at it that way a very uniquely American thing I know they have steak houses other places but I know you know your numbers of steak houses we have I think we have the number but those Brazilian steak houses to Oscar is where they just walk around with the meat and you and now that that's a male thing right you know just you a woman to arrest around like look they've got unlimited meat laughs that's the man just like yeah just bring me more keep bringing me meat focus meat absolutely that place will wreck you yeah green at the green square you will flip the bitch over you will you will give up sometimes they just keep coming one after the other they just carve it off for you right there but but it's like that is such a yes that's like yeah I'm just gonna sit here and I'm a meat I'm not gonna eat again for three days but and and don't go they're not hungry don't you know means this is not a place to go worrying about what you're gonna eat like I have that little salad bar over there and like yeah whatever just keep bringing me different meat like the green is up yeah that's our bars bullshit yeah you know you want to lube up the shooter that's um so it kind of pushes pushes the shoot open a little bit gets everything ready for the barrage of carnage and I think this is that time where we're you know for me it's like I told you like you're doing great you're staying in shape and working out I'm trying to keep moving I'm riding a bicycle here and there Tory's starting to learn to jump the rope but I will eat something like my justification is like well listen is deadly virus I don't want to die and not have had pizza you know and I know it's bullshit but it's what I can tell myself is that's just what I tell myself to justify eating this shit at this Ty's like well listen you live by yourself though yeah if we go we have meals because I'm eating at home with the kids and the wife so we every every meal is like has to be healthy yes when you have kids you can't feed kids bullshit right like you have to have some healthy choices you're teaching them to eat healthy well no that's great you know you're not doing any working out at all no I do some the bicycle is actually ice core you go outside yeah bike yeah outside inside bike treadmill just so boring I get the discipline of it but it's boring but now I'll get on my bike but you know it's great you have a treadmill or an inside bike is movies yeah watch fucking movie you don't even know you're doing and you're an hour and a half in that's good it's over mmm there's an idea that's the move Oh a guy tall he was telling me he said get this NordicTrack I guess it's like the peloton and you know oh that's like horizon oh no the traffic scheme that was the old Nordic track but they make a bicycle now that's like okay and he was telling me out and I said man it's a lot of money to spend for something to hang my pants on gee when people have those bullshit ski machines they pretend your skin yeah nobody you used it you used it three times it has its cables these cables you move back and forth and your feet slid back you could tell if someone if you went over someone's house and they didn't have their shit together they either had one of those or they had a Bowflex yeah they had like one or the what was the one was the one where it was it was just rubber plates and you would pull them apart remember it wasn't a Bowflex it was like them no it was like that I don't remember I do remember the Bowflex and now they have a new Bowflex that's actually like a bow yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a bunch of bow exercise right with it nobody's using that no oh maybe I'll use it okay but you know why because the commercial they get somebody who goes to the gym who works out regularly to do the commercial and say yeah 20 minutes a day with this and I have this body and you're like no you don't cuz I know people with that body and their discipline is beyond belief like I used to I used to work with this trainer at Gold's and she was like amazing shape she had been a bodybuilder and then she shifted over to Fitness you know and she just just cut up and beautiful and this and that and and I used to tell her I was like you understand if you lived in like Oklahoma or Iowa like women would kill you like they just wouldn't allow you to exist because you have this perfect body you know cuz because when they had that whole thing about women's bodies and that the false what was it the false image of women's by I said the problem with that is when you're in LA that's not really false because those women the models who do those pictures are here yeah they're there you go to the unrealistic body expectation right yeah they're not unrealistic for guys though yeah if you if you if you see nobody ever says that about you will bodybuilders or bullshit because they're fat guys or need love too right you've given us unrealistic body expectation nobody says anything about that no but but because but it's all bad about men that look like shit right women walking around like a guy who looks like shit has a shot you know what I mean like women aren't as we don't care about that women aren't as picky about it as men are in our minds you know you know what I'm saying well it's also that men controlled the advertising and men objectified women in these ads but when men objectify men in the ads for women no one cares well you know why because if the guys too pretty he's gay yeah he's not but I mean that's the dismissal like in other words when women look at that woman and they sell that image they never say she's trying to achieve that image right but but when they show men that guy men are just like yeah but he's gay then they don't have to try to compete with him yeah you know I let me tell you something man I was hanging out with Tyson Beckford you know Tyson is a bit too handsome it was it was comical it was literally I laughed like the the way women would react when they saw him and the fact that you don't even exist in the world but but it wasn't it's not even trying to compete it's like it okay well I'm gonna play a pickup game with LeBron James you know what I mean it was like no no it is no well he's got two things going on you just look it was just fun to watch but he's also got two things going on he's famous too yeah so he's famous as fuck and he's beautiful yeah and he's tall and handsome he's got everything yeah yeah it was just that kind of thing so you know so yeah the unreal allistic expectation need you know my my unrealistic expectation went right out the window is like a I ain't competing with that girls do get mad though but I think some guys get mad too yes some do bitch dudes but girls will get really angry if they see like some some bitch that just showed up at the gym she's got a perfect bond right and then you're on your treadmill looking down yourself yeah yeah and then if they do the whole sexy out workout outfit and the whole thing you know yeah they get mad at their husbands - what the fuck you looking at oh yeah but you know it's but again here in LA or like Miami oh yeah Miami is Miami should be rated our first like when you get off the plane they're like listen you're too young to be here you're gonna gonna have to go up to Fort Lauderdale it's not even rated R because you can read it or you can go with your parents if your parents are assholes fourteen slasher movie the nc-17 like this kid in here the women walking around Miami it's so sexy it again it's just comical you know it this is the other thing that like getting older like being my age I'm in my 50s where I'm not chasing them anymore so it's just fun to watch right you know I mean because it's like watching nature documentaries yeah it's like this is amazing like this you see this was an exotic bird and he's just like she walks around like that every day all the time she just looks like that it's incredible well it's also such a superficial culture too is like there's people over there that are really rich there's a lot of floss in there's no wearing the latest shit and driving the fastest the whole thing because diamonds on your watch and yeah it's just fun to watch you know if you just caught up in it if you get caught up in trying to be that then you got problems but as long as you remember it's entertainment because that's what it is well it's a city that was sort of built on cocaine yeah exactly which and and that's why it's funny now with marijuana right with weed they're like we don't know what to do with the weed money and this in a sec well talk to the people who did Miami in the 80s because they managed to turn all that cocaine money into a city like they've managed to well that's already been going on with weed in places where it's illegal like in Vancouver for the longest time there's a documentary that was in way back in the day called the Union and it was all about how even though marijuana is illegal in Vancouver the city literally depends on it the industry is built on there's so much money in marijuana in Vancouver I mean people kind of forgot about it because California has it legal now and Oregon and Washington State as illegal now right but for the longest time we got a lot of our weed from from Vancouver a lot of British Columbia wheat and so this documentary was essentially showing how it's completely interconnected with the economy up there its enormous and if they pulled out somehow another if marijuana and all the merriment a lot of money just went away and it didn't exist anymore the economy would probably fall apart or need a huge readjustment and that's way Miami was yes yes I am II was like while the banks yeah real estate like that was building office buildings and condos and was yeah it was you know but what a city it's beautiful at a city it's a wild place it's also on like a very porous stone which will absolutely go under water soon and again I love I have Florida friends I love them God is continually trying to destroy Florida just throwing things just hurricanes and have tornadoes and just every just yeah just keep throwing this is California's California band pythons and alligators two two things are trying to kill all day long in Florida so you can't even buy Python skin things I mean literally there's like a market for their invasive it's a fucking giant snake that comes from another part of the war all that shit Eevee nothing can kill it Florida their kill they're paying people to kill them you can't even sell the skins in California and it but the thing with alligators it's like why would you go near any water in Florida you know I mean like if there's a puddle like yes stay away there's probably and I'll get I remember I played golf in Florida and they were like yeah when you hit your ball in the water like you don't like it's gone there was a huge one that just caused a traffic jam so see if you can find that it was out today in the news there was a huge alligator in Florida that was causing a traffic jam because it was walking across the road and people like what the fuck like 16 foot animals like since humans are locked away animals are coming out they're like going down into town looking for food really yeah yeah I hear my fucker I hear coyotes and owls oh yeah and and stuff you know at night like yeah they're close they're moving in if we it's as soon as we're gone if we if we got wiped out this place would be overrun with animals and weeks yeah nature would come back really quick maybe come back really find it is it two years old yeah it's is April 2018 there's no one that's new no there's not one that's new so it looks like another one and that's in Jackson Jacksonville is the town that there's a lot of crazy are you that's what the UFC is gonna be yeah there's a lot of that's where the beach thing was going there where the UH the spring break beaches were going and all right nothing new all right maybe it's an old one someone sent me yeah man found eaten by alligator actually died of meth overdose no you fuckin dude I've a meth overdose and the alligator comes along and eats you oh my god doing a podcast called fear not with a guy named Barry Glassner who wrote a book called the culture of fear and it's about you know what we fear it's decided and we had a segment to the podcast that was just called fear Florida because every week something would happen in Florida like Florida it just yeah city of Lakeland closes portion of part because of snake orgy of course of course look at the date look at the date Valentine's Day it's 11-foot alligator was found inside a Clearwater home last week of course you could you could you could do this with no end Florida it's just an amazing and again some good people Tampa I love the city of Tampa yeah I have great shows there I love Tampa yeah but man I've had great times in West Palm earth at the improv down there yeah but some of the stories you hear and some of the things that happen you're just like Florida you guys like Florida past Mississippi a long time ago used to be Mississippi even California we used to be the crazy state yeah California with used to now we can't come Florida it was Miami used to call it God's waiting room yes that's right the New York people they didn't want to deal with the winter anymore yeah now it's just chaos there's so many alligators there does he ever watch small people oh one of the guys that's one of those shows that when you see it you're like I have to watch this one of the guys it's a commercial killer of valuators he got a tag for 500 alligators you can kill five that's how many they have 500 alligators that's a there's not there's not shortage these five things my favorite thing about Swamp People is they're speaking English and they still have subtitles in English but they have subtitles there's that sort of Cajuns way of talk which is real interesting right because that's a really unique subset southern accent that is the hillbilly handfishin yeah I've seen that with a noodle yeah they catch the catfish by letting it clamp down their arm right what in the fuck yeah I guess if you get one of those fuckers that's like a hundred pounds yeah that's a lot of meat a lot of meat so I guess they grab the gills mm-hm let this thing bite their arm they put their hand in its mouth and let it bite their arm and then they grab the gills and told this fucker out remember we were talking about the guy who ate this slug yeah you know that was the first hillbilly handfishin guy was like hey watch this and he stuck his hand inside of a catfish and pulled it out and they were like I'll be damned that's we got a way to do it yeah how many guys lost their hands to snapping turtles doing that yeah they're not gonna they didn't they never give you the bad side snapping turtles scare the fuck out of me when I lived in Florida for a bit and when I was 11 years old I lived there I was 13 and we used to find these fucking Turtles I guess their tortoises right because they're on dry land I think it would be huge and they can bite through yeah they bite your crotch eleven-year-old kid one decides to bite your dick that's it they catch a finger I slice your finger right off clean off we would put sticks near them and they would bite the sticks yeah we're so stupid well you know you were 11 I was also around alligators all the time when I was 11 we used to go and throw marshmallows into the water and there was sign it's telling you to stop feeding the alligators marshmallows right awhile but the alligators back then were actually they were endangered and they were protected but then the population grew sky rocks so much it went from them being protected to them giving someone five hundred tags to kill them I know a lifetime in Orlando there was one of those alligator farms like you go and I said that's for like when Dad gets tired and after his third day at Disney World when he's tired of the kids it's like all right that's good see some alligator I don't give a shit okay well there's something about alligators that we want to see always because they're so primal it's such a dinosaur yeah yeah they're dinosaurs right they've been around forever right I've seen that video where the lady's throwing chickens off the balcony to these crocodiles and they're grabbing the meat and eating it and one of them reaches and doesn't get the meat and he just grabs his buddy's leg and spins and rips it off and swallows it and his buddy doesn't even it doesn't even budge did you just ate his foot and he literally just looks around like or other crocodile rather just ate his foot he doesn't even react well that was like like the one way what is it a deer or something's at the riverbank maybe crocodile jumps out of the river and bites the whole thing and pulls it watch this so she throws this meat right they all stumble for it and this one grabs ahold that one's foot and just watch does the death roll pops off the leg and then just swallows it boom thanks and look at the one he just ate is fucking on every academic did you just eat this foot just eat my fucking hand how have we let this thing survive they're so gross they have moss growing all over their back a creepy ass fucking monster I was Google just an alligator snapping turtle which is the cross of both things about an alligator snapping turtle yeah oh jeez oh I've seen those those are fucking enormous yeah they're nasty where do those live I didn't like this shows a map of it I think look at that thing Mexico and Central America what the fuck you know what I like that guy in the Hat that's how that guy always looks right Yeah right like he's always that guy he's hoping to be the next Crocodile Dundee he's a good environment shit no yeah he's the guy that does all the get standby stuff what is his name again Heidi Peters oh yeah he's he's a silly silly man but that's that's the or alligator one on the left and a regular world he's the guy let's he lets those bugs bite him and shit that have like crazy there's a new show talking about I watched a lot of it on the History Channel these two guys once an Australian dude once an American and they go and they get they like let themselves feel the pain and then explain it mmm Oh a little gnarly way then he does almost dude hold up while we're doing this back that up a little bit while we were just talking look at the fucking right there leave run there watch his fucking claws oh yeah so they go over his body here and you see the plates underneath them and then they show his claws look it's like a grizzly bear yeah and then they close in on his face mm-hmm look at the Yap on that thing that might as well be in the Lord of the Rings I might as well be an orc they might as well be riding a horse swing you thought the honey badger didn't give a shit yeah the alligator turtle what what threat does he have is there anything that probably there's a threat to him I saw a video of a sea turtle that had a whole bite taken out of it like a cookie from a shark yeah I saw a bull shark through a fucking sea turtle cut through his shell cut half the body out and it was swimming away with three legs and the entrails were hanging out I was like well that's the other thing that's been here since the beginning right sharks yeah look at that look at that bite marketer's metal naturist metal is a great Twitter Instagram page rather yeah yeah the one in the middle up left it looks like something took a bite out of it and it lived look at that it's healed up yeah Wow Jesus Christ it's hard out there for a pimp yeah yeah the oceans the cruelest bitch yeah cuz this shit down at it everything's eaten somebody right there like imagine if that was the outside world like everywhere you look as a fish trying to eat a fish something trying to kill you all the time all the time it's like Africa like this the Serengeti squared yeah you know there's always something and and we have no natural defenses yeah we got nothing we can't even move we got no fur we got no claws you got some scales we just we're delicious you know I mean like if you're a predator just an unarmed human being is so easy so easy and the fact that we're so stupid at least on the ground you feel like you might be able to like grab a rock and throw it at it or stab it with a knife but when you're in the ocean yes you know fuck you can't breathe you can't even scream you're moving - you're the slowest thing you're thrashing around how fast a shark moves and I'll fucking slow you are yeah and you're like oh just curious the Sharks like oh here they come again the buffet what would it take to get you to start hunting you know I don't know didn't have the patience for it mmm I'm not you know it if you were starving well yeah obviously then but but I think hunting it's there's a patience to it it's one of those things where you wait a long time for that moment of action I see what you're saying it was some hunting like tree stand hunting you have to have an incredible amount of patience sit in a tree and you stay still and you stay up there a long time but spot and stalk hunting it's not as much patience spot and stalk what you're doing is you're you're moving along slowly and then you pull your binoculars you glass the area sometimes you sit down you glass the air and then you find the animal and you slowly move towards them you try to play the wind so the wind is blowing at you so the animals you yeah that kind of hunting is actually very very exciting but it's also very rigorous exercise you're going up and down mountains it's like right you have to be in really good shape to be like if you're gonna hunt elk or mountain goats or some shit like that you got to be in a really good shape yeah I don't know did that be my thing you know there's a food charge if you get listen if there's a food shortage I'm a big guy there's gonna be a smaller guy who as food man I don't know I mean in in some kind of disaster situation you're talking about like earthquake type deal yeah then then I would go but otherwise I'm thought about leaving here you know I've got friends who've left because of the cost of living and they're living much higher standard living in other places but but I love LA at the end of the day I love this part you know the weather the the the roads I get to play with the motorcycles this and that so this is so my lifestyle I mean I'm mainly a road guy I could live anywhere and still do 90% of the work I do but I love living in LA so if I were somehow priced out of it that would be the only way left I mean obviously yeah if there's an earthquake or a disaster or something then then I'll head - I love living la the way la was okay yeah I don't know if that's gonna be the case anymore it said that I'm like one of those guys like if you play musical chairs I'm like this fucking music could shut off any second now yeah now your kids have always lived here right they grew up here so what would their what do you think their thought would be somewhere either adaptable man they adapt really quickly it's interesting because that's one of the things that I've noticed about them doing their schoolwork online they do this could work on computers and they're adapting they just dealing with it they have face time with their friends you know it's it's interesting it's and I'm really proud of them for their their ability to adapt and not freak out about it and just accept you know and we're spend a lot of time together we do a lot of movie nights I watch every fucking Adam Sandler movie that ever existed basically except Little Nicky I haven't seen that one yeah but uh I don't I don't think I think as long as the family's there and there's other kids to be friends with kids can do all right they'll adjust yeah well eat that I mean not even partly a big part of that is testament to you and your wife as parents to have kids who are like that you know versus some kind of spoiled la kid yeah couldn't have you know well sometimes moving is good yeah no listen if I had to I was just talking with a friend this summer is 40 years for me in LA I moved here in 1980 yeah so this summer is 40 because his 40 year was this month and we were talking about it like when we first came here we were kids you know 1819 right out of high school moved from New York to LA and just mind blown and I've been here long enough to see that's why I said when you talk about LA how it used to be I can think of a few versions of the LA I've lived in you know listen I got a buddy we talked about it we could have bought parking lots in downtown LA for 25,000 bucks you know I mean downtown LA used to be like what you see a Skid Row used to be the whole downtown was like nobody went downtown in that crazy you went downtown to the bankers and insurance people would air during the day and then at 5 o'clock it would just close how that happened and because there was nothing there there was no reason why they build those buildings down there because I don't because it was business and office buildings I guess felt they needed to be downtown but in that weird that they would just have this one spot where there's all these tall buildings the only part in all of LA and no one wanted to live there yeah yeah and that's the opposite of other cities right like if you go to downtown Minneapolis there's all these big buildings and a bunch of apartments and people live down there and it's totally normal they tried to develop I remember in it in the 80s they tried to develop downtown and nobody would move down there and in 90s they tried to develop downtown and people just wouldn't move there and then they finally when they got Staples Center and then they said the big difference was grocery stores they said when they open grocery stores because before if you live downtown you had to go to like Brentwood or some people Rock or Pasadena like you had to get on the freeway to go buy food so once they developed the grocery stores then people start and and it was also I think it was also a matter of everywhere else got crowded and expensive so initially downtown was cheap and then it became the the cool spot to be but it's so bomb infested oh yeah so crazy how many homeless people are shit on the streets out there but but again like if you know it's one of those if I knew then what I know now you know I mean like in the 80s man I could have just bought up just a parking lot maybe there's a spot right now there isn't we don't we don't know where it is you know Inglewood Inglewood five years ago because now Engel was getting a new football stadium the new basketball arena they're developing notes but now it's too late Frank so so who knows what that next area what are they called gentrification absolutely yeah yeah I wonder because I wonder how much of an effect this is gonna first of all I've talked to my friends in New York City and they said that a lot of the real estate people are preparing for a mass exodus they're saying first of all if New York City can't be New York City anymore like you can't be everybody's just coming there from everywhere else and filling the streets it's super crowded if that can't be the case then what is it and if it really is a place where the virus might kick back in again and have a second wave people are not gonna want to buy there well just look at look at the past right because if you look at New York in the 60s and 70s people didn't want to live in a city they lived in the suburbs right and then the gentrification was all the people in the suburbs their kids wanted to live in the city huh so it would be another movement out of the city to the suburbs and the cities would I don't know fall is the right word but the cities would know you know you know I mean because Commerce wise it's always gonna be in the city because business is done there but that's know but that's the other but that's changing now when with virtual should virtual stuff but there's there's especially New York New York's going to be a city because New York is a gateway into the United States and New York is banking you know Wall Street and all of that so to an extent New York's gonna be New York but as far as people living there yeah a lot of people they may go to their homes in the Hamptons or in whatever and say you know what I don't need to go to city about all those restaurants that have been there forever like Keens Steakhouse yeah some of those are already they're already saying some of those won't be back already saying some of those places won't be back like New York had so many restless has so many things but we don't who knows right no like in like fashion right who knows is fashion gonna be a thing or are we all gonna just wear sweatpants now people have been doing these things where they're wearing suit and tie yeah but we're in short shorts they get busted yeah shorts and underwear right yeah so you know yeah what's the new normal gonna be in so many levels cars right people now they're buying cars online so is it gonna go back to going down to the car dealership and arguing with this guy and and all that bullshit or is it just gonna be like hey man I'm going online this is what I'm paying and then I'm gonna go down there and pick up my car I don't know well a lot of people are still gonna want to kick the tires drive it a little bit see what it is you don't know there's so many cars that drive so differently you don't know what to expect unless there's a place where you get test drive a car you're gonna be more reluctant to make that well you can you can still test drive but the negotiation and the bullshit part our people still gonna want to do that they're gonna want to because it's gonna be a limited number of cars especially the cars that got that get overpriced like a new Corvette like there they sell them way above sticker right cuz there's not that many of them those kind of cars you're still gonna be able to make money yeah but the cars that are the most cars that sell the transportation car the Camrys Accords and stuff like that yeah do people really they're like I don't need to test drive it I know what it is well the real problem is it's a supply and demand thing right and then the other thing is like do we need to keep making cars like how many of these cars that we still have could we fix up right and get get on the road again and with at what point in time do we stop every year flooding the market with a million new cars or whatever the number is yeah but it's part of our economy it is and it's a tradition and and you got all these people in Georgia now who are gonna be driving our economy fixing cars yeah you know and there's there's there's something to be said for that more of that is going away because cars are so efficient and digital now you know that that mechanic that you used to go to down the street like he doesn't exist anymore because he's got to have all this equipment to plug the car in ya and find out you know I mean I Drive a BMW and I say like when you lift the hood of my car dish it should just say none of your business there's nothing under here for you to touch you don't know how unit you know what I mean like looking at you have to take this to the dealer and in so many cars are like that now yet Tesla the electric cars are all gonna be like that you have to you're gonna have to take it back it's gonna be like and where you bought it yeah you gonna have to look and if there's a an accident I don't even know like you can't take a Tesla to a body shop right you have to take it back to Tesla or what no I don't know bring it to a body shop okay yeah different body shops that serviced Tesla only right yeah yeah that's right you gotta have you gotta have a guy who knows because it's digital sensors as this and at the other it's not just putting a fender back on because that fender has a camera in it and a sensor and addition to that right depending upon what happened - right yeah yeah those that's the future - the future is a missional so what we're accustomed to we're seeing here over the last month where there's no fucking pollution this guy that's probably gonna be the future and people also have to adapt you know people from a technological standpoint in other words like if you've been fixing well I'll give you an exactly used to fix carburetors then you better learn to fix fuel injection cuz all cars are fuel-injected now there's a few classic cars with carburetors and there's a few guys that they need to fix them but other than that yeah if you want to work so so you're gonna if you're fixing cars either you're gonna have to adapt to this digital car or you're just gonna go out of business you know this are you gonna work on old cars yes always but it's not gonna be that many you know I mean it becomes more of a specialty because there are fewer of them yeah it's like 60s muscle cars right there they're great but there aren't enough to support all the mechanics that used to fix them that's true you know so you you you got to adapt you gotta adapt and as always those people shake these new ones ain't no it's like not a new ones good it's different used to yeah it's not my thing fucking spaceship yeah how's it not your thing it's amazing this guy told me he told me something and when he told me it hit he said you know why you don't like Tesla's he said because you like cars and the Tesla's and appliance and I was like yeah that's it it's so you know it doesn't make any noise it works but it doesn't have the visceral feel of you you drive a 911 right yeah one of those it's a different thing does not have that visceral feel of driving no but it's way better to drive efficiently yeah not just efficiently the way it moves I know just go with a round thing so quickly like you accelerate it's the instant torque it's an instant torque of electric motors but I still any you know maybe I'm that dinosaur whatever and I don't knock Tesla's like if you want a Tesla have a Tesla and have fun with I'm not saying you shouldn't I just know it's not for me now I prefer engines I like engines - I like shifting my own gears I like manual transmissions but I also like that Tesla okay it's fun as fuck that again I get it you know and and then and I also get the people who say hey if you're sitting in traffic on the 405 and the car can drive itself let it do it yeah you know oh it's Wayne blessed restful I'm also Joe I'm also out there on a motorcycle man and I see I'm scared of Tesla people that's a point they trust the automatic driving so much not paying attention right yeah and I'm out there like I'm their target ah I don't know that that test I don't know that your car sees me on a bike that's a good point my friend was saying that he answers his emails when he's driving I'm like oh my god no you know yeah he does he goes yeah I do I can answer my emails I go wide on the highway people do things behind the wheel that was scared a hell out of here like now that's what they're trusting the freeways are empty now people are driving so fast and it's people who don't know how to drive fast I don't mind someone driving fast who knows how to drive fast or they have a car I mind it may go fast yeah but you got pee I mean man I'm doing 80 and getting just rocketing past me like I know you're doing a hundred yeah I know you're doing a buck a car driver class 180 miles an hour on Michigan Highway during lockdown yeah what was he driving a 2016 Dodge probably yeah okay Wow 180 helicopter yeah they saw him in any jeez one saw him in and made they waited for him set it up Hellcat challenger that's what it is okay you know shit about son of a bitch yeah that but but there are people and there are a lot of cops out now you know yeah there's a lot of cops right in tickets good you know you don't want a hundred mile an hour ticket how about a hundred eighty you know they must just put you in jail think 180 here day I think any California I think you go to jail at a hundred or more really they can they don't necessarily do but 180 this is a real good one a be locked up he said my fault I was speeding that's another vehicle sorry according to the office well my fault sorry well sounds good the other car that that wasn't in Detroit not in Detroit I thought sorry ain't gonna work they had to be somewhere in outer Michigan somewhere and sorry sorry getting you off the hook you know Michigan's a good example of how things can change right because Michigan used to be Detroit used to be the most profitable or the richest state or the richest city rather let me get this out right Detroit used to be the richest tip it used to be a hugely rich city back when they were making cars there yeah I mean they still make some cars there but back when it was the place don't don't even get me started on the American car industry but crazy you talk about a group that took it for granted and didn't adapt to the times yeah and literally sat there and watch the Japanese take all of their business they they watched the camry become a chevy you know used to be just you know by Chevy versus Ford right you you remember your family you had Chevy families and Ford families it was but there was no talk of an end date they that market and they just sat back and let built crappy cars and blah blah blah and let that whole thing go it's ridiculous Wow things get weird when you ship stuff overseas to or ship jobs overseas things are cheaper to make in Mexico or they're cheaper to make a China yeah that exists but but as far as the cars they I mean American cars in the 70s and 80s were garbage garbage they were and and that was a choice the cook the factory could have made they could have made better cars and they just chose not to do you think people are gonna be more open to the idea of american-made businesses supporting american-made businesses after you realize how difficult it is to get things from China during a pandemic and how we're so relying on China for medicine and for electronics and so many different things one would hope I think there's two ways to do it either we do that support American businesses or and this is a worldwide thing open up to the idea of globalization where things where it's a global economy not an individual nations economy you know then who runs it China no the fuck out of here America no well the same people who run it now right the bankers right there I mean they don't give a shit I don't give a shit about where the money comes from they're running the money worldwide you know they're they're in in contact with each other you know I mean that and I'm not even talking from a conspiracy theory thing like that's just how it works money flows throughout the world and and so if you're financing I don't know if you're financing Apple computer and Apple computer is building their computers in China if you're to Bank on Wall Street you don't care you care about Apple paying their stock dividends or paying their bills you know what I mean so so the bankers who run this who are behind it they don't give a shit right I just want to make sure it stays profitable right they don't want to sacrifice that for some ideal of it's good to buy American right right but if you can show some if you can show a way to profitably make it and you'd have to get people from America to really find value and buying something that's America because it would cost more like how much would it cost to didn't we've done this before how much would it cost to make an American phone everything everything made over here isn't even possible I don't think so isn't that crazy when you think about how many people here have phones you know how many people are addicted to phones we can't even make our own but we gave that up but forever well can't we adjust own the only way to just is if other countries bring up their standard living to ours and their income level ours then the price of labour becomes the same because that's the big variable that's of course you make so much value in things be an American that you'll pay more for it the same way you pay more for labels right like you'll pay more for Nike than you do for some no-name sneaker but then then you have to make it a better product well Nikes a really good product but there's some sneakers that are not as well-known that are also really good products that they'll cost like half as much yeah because Nike has a lot of name-brand value I don't know why I'm using the word Nike but it could be anything you could have addy disease there's a lot of things that people will buy and they'll pay more for because it's a brand yeah branding makes a difference but it's what about the brand of American made you again make it better this was a thing right when an American car not necessarily better it's there's a pride and owning Nike you you've owned something that's got a great label what about a pride in owning something that's made in America but you also have faith in the label in other words when you buy a Nike shoe that's true you have faith that this is a good shoe it's a quality shoe right yeah so if if there was a time when made in America meant it was better right that cars are a perfect example so you automatically bought it so now you have to once again build that in and it takes a long time this is another thing about American economy versus world right American economy they're based on the profits in the next quarter you know where it's like Toyota was making plans in the 70s to run America took the world car market in the 90s like they plan long-term you have to look at it like that that it's not just a matter of quarterly dividends you you have to look at what are we doing with this company and it has to constantly make more money every year it has to make more money than the last that's how you know it's doing well yeah and you have stockholders that you have to you know your you have to listen to them and you adapt and try to make a better product I mean you look at like Windows right like we're on Windows whatever we're not still on Windows one yeah because they were like oh this works better oh this didn't work we got to change that oh this works better and they you keep adapting and changing the product or the same thing now sometimes you know like with the Apple would iPhones it's like sometimes lucky that phone you just change it for the sake of change in it like there's a reason there was no iPhone 9 right they were like all right we can't fool them anymore we got a whole 10 because it was the 10th year is that is that 10 year anniversary of the iPhone 1017 it started out in 2007 so 2017 there's iPhone X to mark the ten-year anniversary that's why there's no iPhone 9 but there is an iPhone 9 now it's yes see I see yeah so you need to I think you can do it but you have to build a value into making it am area and part of that is is marketing right like that the f-150 there's nothing more American than a Ford pickup truck but it's made in Mexico is it really yeah there's f-150 plants in Mexico they're not all made here in the US just like BMWs SUVs are made in South Carolina yeah made in Ohio so you and this is what I'm talking about about the global part they figured out well it was cheaper to make because America buys the most SUVs so BMW said well let's just make them there then we don't have to ship them across an ocean right makes sense and then the same thing probably the NSX so like listen there's gonna be a bunch of wacky Americans buy this fucking super horsepower four-wheel drive Honda right so you make it they're big now when you talk about that value there are some things like like Ferraris you know like it's a Ferrari so it it has a value to it in the fact that it's Italian adds to the value of it right just yeah they yeah when you talk about adding value like some Italian like we're just like well yeah that's even though a lot of times the quality was like you know falling off or whatever but it was just the fact that it's Italian so yes we could do that but I don't know that that anybody will yeah I was designed by artisans that's the idea I mean if you go my buddy mine went to Lamborghini factory he said first of all he goes they stopped working for like two or three hours and they just eat pasta and take naps yeah and he's like it takes forever to make a car yeah but they do it all by hand yeah you know and and it there really is an art to it oh yeah yeah we don't I mean we don't make bad cars anymore the cars we make now are getting a lot better than they used to be like especially SUVs like the new Lincoln Navigator is amazing I love that there's a new Escalade that they're gonna release right look gonna be amazed fucking incredible which they had to do cuz the new Navigator was so and then they have the new mid-engine Corvette which is a monster I mean that's not incredible platform that they're operating on people that drive it said it's like leaps and bounds better than any Corvette that's ever existed before and then we have great Camaros there's a lot of shit they make now that's good the new Mustangs are amazing there are a lot of great American cars a problem is they let their reputation slack so much that if you talk to a new car like a first time car buyer and ask them what they want they're not gonna name an American car they want up Mercedes or a Porsche right or they want or you know a Toyota or a Honda or something like that I'm super alive you know people would ask me what to buy and cars and I'd always tell them get a Honda cause it's just gonna run forever it ain't gonna break Toyota same thing Toyotas the same you know but yeah you get one of those and and I wish I could say get a get a Chevy and I'm sure there is one but I don't know what it is I don't know what to do I've owned two of those original NSX's I had one I got rid of it I got a second want to get rid of that I never had a problem no not a single problem in their sports cars yeah mid-engine sports car like a race car no problems last forever yeah and and they were all built like that then it's just a level of quality but yeah you're right listen the Camaros that the Navigator is the Mustangs there's so many cars like that that are great American cars but people they again you hurt your reputation for so long so many bad ones for so long at people man I had a 78 Corvette it's the worst car I ever owned it was mad Joe and and when it would break it wasn't mild like it wasn't you know no it was like oh yeah your intake manifold cracked like you know intake manifold like a major metal piece of und like yeah that's just cracked yeah your radiator the bottom of it just rusted out to nothing just you know like it was oh man that and what ultimately killed the car what's the wheel came loose the wheel came off the car was dry did some brake off of the suspension yeah yeah baby what did the control arms the control arm behind the brake yeah oh it just yeah so it lost the wheel cars they were because that was when they were trying to figure out emissions and they were trying to figure out mileage and you had like you had a small-block v8 engine I remember the Carly made 180 horsepower like like I have motorcycles that make that much horsepower this was a Corvette how slow would of the of Joe it was a horrible so crazy cuz now the base models like 4/6 yeah but at that time you know in 1978 that's when they had the Mustang to maro was a full-size Camaro that came with like a six cylinder engine that made like 98 horse Chevelle yeah it was this big steel car with a little yeah it was American cars where you know I love my country those cars were garbage that was a Mustang you met imagine going from go take that get a good look at it right get it now I want you to say 69 Mach 1 now you Google a 69 Mach 1 Mustang and then you realize how fucking fun I mean what the fuck that the same thing that is a monstrous beautiful sexy ferocious nozzle you took the company away from the engineers and you gave it to the bean counters and the board members who didn't you know who didn't want to drive didn't like you saw a Ford versus Ferrari I haven't seen it oh you haven't seen it already go see it's great movie great move that movie looks like a bad company song it was right but there's a scene in the movie where the the heads like the CEO or whatever a Ford goes to see Carroll Shelby and Carroll Shelby puts him in one of his cars and says take him out and they scare the shit out of it like they show the car like it's so fast and powerful that the guys like it build one you know but these are people like this is what happens when you have a car company run by people who know no shit about cars you get a Mustang - you get an 80 horsepower Corvette that wheels fall off just imagine that 69 Mach 1 - that mod that Mustang - in just 10 years right use me that's crazy for the Mach 1 had to be like what the if that happened to us from 2010 to 2020 happened 2010 was not that long ago listen I'm go to the 80s when remedy tried the front-wheel drive cars like this citation all of those cars those cook me and my brother laugh about those cars because they were such crap the citation had a vertical radio for reason and we there was a an Oldsmobile remember that I don't know if you remember this the four six eight engine that was an eight cylinder engine that would cut off cylinders like cut down the six it didn't work the theory was great that yeah you're in v8 when you need it in a force hood but but still have that kind of set up on some catalyst yeah but now they have computers in electronic fuel control that it actually works back it was like no that shit don't work ever a business that's fallen so hard so fast as the United States automobile business from like the 60s to the 70s steel steel us steel yeah yeah they start I think Japan took over steel ah because I knew people in Pittsburgh when steel went Pittsburgh went almost bankrupt Pittsburgh had the same fall as Detroit but they bounced back ah but yeah I hope that whole thing that they used to build Camaros and Firebirds right here in van nuys did they're really yeah in the 80s when I moved here the Camaro Firebird plant was in Van Nuys it built some dogshit cars yeah those 1980s Firebirds what in the fuck are you a chicken man you get that big sticker on the remember that yeah but that they did good that's one that you don't see enough resto mods done correctly wreck it feels like if someone took like a Burt Reynolds style Trans Am yeah and did it correctly and redid it you just don't see my look look at that yeah if someone just did that right but those were the cars they had a big engine that made no power you know it was just a big fuck big engine that didn't make any power but God it looked like it did look like a great car Robert t-tops remember those oh I do remember those you had to take your T tops off and go to Monroe it's funny though that was the only car that had a painting on every hood like that yeah yeah the Trans Am was the one you had to get the Thunder chicken yeah there's one in that show that I watch Ozark yeah watch it Jamie that guy's got a pretty badass one see if you could find that and see Google Trans Am from Ozarks stumble across a spoiler I bet oh you think so you haven't seen the Trans Am yet just just right Trans Am I'm dude from Ozark what's the Knight Rider wasn't that a Trans Am or a Firebird I think that was an 80s Firebird yeah no that's not good it's it's a it's an older one yeah exactly let me see what that looks like yeah that's pretty fucking nice yeah he's got a pretty fucking nice one that's rare though that you see like a restomod like really done up Trans Am yeah yeah the 80s um Knight Rider was an 80s Trans Am yeah talk to him right god damn that was a dumb show yeah people were just different back then it's like if you ever wanted to prove to people rapidly watch 80s TV shows like drama shows the 80s was a special time man there's so many things there's so many things 80s Miami Vice yes right there's so many things 80s that were just 80s yeah yeah Miami Vice man who didn't he what do you have a Lamborghini or something like that or sorority Testarossa yeah Testarossa that way yeah the white Testarossa with the things on the side Crockett and Tubbs yeah pastel suits yes with no socks they had no socks on always look at him loafers no socks not a bad show back that was a Ferrari that car yeah that was a different floor I think that was what he had early he had that one that and then he got the Testarossa that's weird being the other guy though right Oh like Don Johnson entire career gotta suck and then you're the what will we watch and there was some Oh transformers was on right and you know in the first and the Transformers when they're in the desert and it's like there's like five military guys you know and then the first three to get killed I was like imagine being one of those guys and then you watch Tyrese Gibson and the other guy go on to this billion-dollar franchise and like you got killed in the first scene like you live why didn't I live by the way I've been that guy in a few movies I haven't done I haven't done many I've done maybe five I am very strict in my casting I can be a security guard or a bouncer played a security guard as a bouncer and when you think about those kind of shows like fast and furious like those movies how the fuck did that happen how do those movies make that much money it's a simple formula but how many people are buying that simple formula over and over again how is it happening because it's it's almost like a cartoon right listen I like if the first Fast and Furious came out it's like okay we got cars we got women we got guns do we even need a script do we even need a script just turn it loose and that's what every movie right that's yeah like yeah just make the cars bigger make the guns bigger make the guys bigger drifting right okay women are hotter yep if you watch The Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift apparently every schoolgirl in Japan is wearing a Catholic school miniskirt at all times but it works it's a simple formula look at the amount of money it may absolutely my god 1 billion 518 million seven hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred ninety four yes what in the flesh oh my god that's the one movie no but that's the Furious 7 one movie made that much money but look it I mean their movies made over a billion dollars yeah why wouldn't they though it's it's a cartoon formula that works that's amazing it's a formula that works it's a totally six billion worldwide flashy beauty Ed's stuff like that you yeah how could it not work how could it not work alright and if I tell you I'm the head writer if I tell you I wrote The Fast and Furious I how you gonna prove me wrong but that was part of the first the first movies were muscle vs. yeah Tudor right they even got you they got you in the beginning you got the muscle car no what I'm saying is but the muscle car guy yeah they got the muscle cars but they didn't get this movie no not you but you know what I'm saying but they got the muscle car fans in the beginning and anymore Vin Diesel drove the muscle car all the time right he had done that dodge of Chrysler whatever it was yeah he he had that through like the first three movies right you know so much about these men oh I love watching those man Joe I love bad movies man do you biker boys biker
