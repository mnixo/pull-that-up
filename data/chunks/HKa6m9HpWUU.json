three two one boom check out this new Richard Pryor plasti cell come on live on the Sunset Strip iconic that was a really the first thing that I ever saw that maybe truly understand the power of stand-up comedy I was 13 years old I think maybe 14 my parents went took me to see it and we were in the audience I remember thinking how is this guy so funny just talking how is this possible I was thinking all the movies that I had seen and we're really funny like I remember was outback that maybe stripes like which was a great movie that I loved so funny so funny but this guy was way funnier and all she was dealing was talking and I couldn't believe it I remember there was a moment in the movie where he was killing and I just turned and looked at the people in the audience and people were just flailing up and down ah they were just the whole body was laughing everything was they were throwing their bodies around I was like this is incredible I've never seen anything like this super powerful dude it hit me hard it wasn't like I wanted to be a comic right then in there they really didn't want to be a comic for another eight years but fuck that was crazy yeah we were those things on back in the day my movies go to the movie theater oh you saw that in a movie theater yeah whoa yeah that's why there's so many people around Wow yeah it was think I just went to people's houses and there's a lot of me I thought maybe it was on HBO or something like that thought you were talking about the audience in that crowd like 1981 this this movie must have come out in 80 or 81 if I'm guessing correctly I think we might have looked this up before have we yeah is it 81 I think I was 14 um might have been 82 recorded was recorded during 81 and 82 so Oh March 24th nice need to okay there you go so beginning of 82 so I was probably 15 then fuck man I just I'll never forget never forget be in that audience being a young kid just looking around and all these people laughing so hard that's so who took you to that my parents Wow this how good this wheat is we just talked about it took me we just talked about as a theatre you like where did you see this HBO I know Attila T's become like a crazy old man where did you see it H now with the fucking theater I told you that people in the theater I was looking around my parent my parents took me that's so cool that they would do that yeah they're cool people they're hippies I believe that's the special where he talks about a guy named Tony from Youngstown Ohio maybe it was either that or live yeah was that the one where they were threatening them I can't remember that because gangster one yeah those guys yeah I think that was live in the Sunset Strip yeah you know the story about it is the story about that is that Pryor was there earlier in the week and he didn't have good sets like that the one that he filmed he just caught magic you know that but but that earlier in the week you know that guy's life was chaos mm-hmm just chaos and who could he relate to he couldn't even call a friend that was like you know enemy can all Kevin Hart back then and be like hey I feel about this right right it's all you called Dave Chappelle or Eddie Murphy knows just well he did have a conversation with Eddie Murphy when Eddie Murphy got in trouble with Richard Pryor with Bill Cosby rather it's a famous story because Bill Cosby was telling Eddie Murphy he was too dirty he was telling him to clean it up while he was raping people oh my god Jesus Christ why not drugging women and then give an hour comedy advice ah tell him you're too dirty yeah telling dr. Doolittle the watches now well he became dr. Doolittle back then he was Eddie Murphy raw yeah this is actually before raw and he put it in raw he said am L causation yeah it was um one of the one of the opening one of the bits in bra was Richard Pryor calling them up do the people laugh do you get paid well tell bill to have a cooker to smile and shut the fuck up that's what he said like he's do he did a Bill Cosby impression and by the way people forget how good Eddie Murphy's impressions are they're fucking insanely good and his Cosby was amazing so he's doing this Cosby it personally does a prior impression man is he still coming back is that fellow supposedly you know but you'd only cross our fingers be great for everybody yeah great forever but I hope he blows the fuck up I hope he fills Madison Square Garden murders and they do a giant Netflix special there and it's just ten times better than raw he could do it guys still healthy still smart as a whip you know still looks fucking great we went over it on the podcast of the day guy is 58 years old looks like he's 35 he looks amazing so healthy you think he would still like push it to the limit or do you think he would just have like smart bits about common things like life or whatever he would push it to the limit of who he is today you know he's not this 20 year old kid anymore like he was in delirious you know delirious he was really young I want to say he was like 22 or something how old was he in when he filmed Eddie Murphy delirious we were in high school okay so I was probably 17 or 18 I might have just graduated high school I think was 85 or 86 he was 22 Doody crazy oh my gosh wanted yourself 22 years old and by this is first you know you know the one right afterwards I mean raw wasn't that long afterwards yeah 20 so his perspectives were uh you know young wild 22 year old dude in the 80s who's like super duper crazy famous yeah you know when you say what do you push it now yeah he'd push it now but he'd push it now is 58 year old Eddie Murphy just calling bullshit on things what's nonsense what's stupid and what is and the impressions and I hope he has 20 minutes on Bill Cosby you know when I was 22 because it just just has a fucking epic bit you know SNL next week Oh any birthday yeah oh wow so he'll do a little bit stand up there yeah 100% is gonna do a monologue right yeah god dammit but that's gonna be excellent oh yeah the guy in wasn't he the guy that David Spade made the falling star joke about no what was the falling star joke on me maybe welcome back on SNL days David Spade had that like that Hollywood minute segment and and he made a controversial joke about Eddie because I guess Eddie had just left us an L or something like that and he goes hey everybody look a falling star I think it was Eddie Merckx Oh Eddie left us a no way before that way before David Spade's career way before - when I was hanging out with Phil Hartman that was in the 80s but his about Eddie Murphy about that this David Spade joke that kept any Murphy off SNL for two decades huh so maybe it was because of his movies it was definitely quite a bit after he had left the show cuz he was he had left the show like when delirious was out he said in an interview in 2011 that they said some shitty things to him a couple times after he left right but it was quite a bit after he left it wasn't like he just left and then David Spade came on board I don't think that was the timing I think David Spade was on way later by the way look at that little boy but you happen to be David Spade vigor that Greta Thornburg girl the climate girl who yelled at everybody she's Person of the Year in Time magazine let's go Oh is everybody losing their fucking mind I think so she's um wasn't she on a strike look obviously climate change is a real thing climate change is a real important thing just get that other way for any was it I'm saying is what is she 14 15 16 no no by complaining on television it doesn't make you the most important person of the year or the most impactful person here just got lucky that right around the time where they were making this list you did that thing they're like let's pick Greta let's pick Greta with a little trick her trunk Oh trumple get triggered you know and apparently Donald Trump jr. did get triggered and tweeted about it but yeah but this is a fucking if this was four months from now you would completely forget her there'd be some new thing see she she caught this wave I mean did she have a good little speech there yes it was a it made an impact you know how many trees had to get cut down to make all those time magazines that there are a lot a lot of trees how to die for that time magazine by the way that all could be avoided with hemp far superior paper way easier and that's what got the whole marijuana legalization process started in the first place was William Randolph Hearst and his fucking newspaper company he didn't want to convert over to hemp paper it's literally what started it these fucks Oh Greta yeah Greta with her horrible tree paper she should be ashamed of herself that she let Time magazine chop down on all those trees yeah just to give her something to frame on her wall mm-hmm right I mean come on Person of the Year it's probably gonna drive her around I'm just gonna be fuckin polluting the air gonna drive around fly around how much extra carbon would be a mid into our atmosphere because she won Woman of the Year or person the air kid of the year yeah this human of the year what is it Person of the Year it's so non gender-specific how many women have won it let's guess how many women have won time magazine person here do you know Trump as a fake person of the year framed in his in his house I think I think I've seen that yeah we were watching a we're of course we were watching home alone two the other day the one where he's lost in New York and there's this scene where have you seen this where he's walking through the hotel he's you know he gets this fancy of Delhi as his dad's credit card and he's like lost in the hotel for a second he's like hey excuse me sir do you know where this is and it's Trump hits the pans up and it's just Trump way back it's so funny and Trump turns around all creepy looks at his butt oh I don't think that's now I know he's looking at him like it's a little boy right everybody through this movie it's a really funny movie home alone to is like really well-written I was my mind was blown watching the whole thing such a great Christmas movie and there's so many great actors and it's an insane lineup Rob Schneider is actually hilarious in this one those are classic yeah he's mad we're kids those were huge they put it together so well like I'm looking at it now I guess it's the writer in me or the LA guy like I'm looking at movies differently now and I'm like this is so beautiful how they made this coincidence happen because you do anything else first of all they look like horrible parents no movie too terrible they cannot fucking play with other son but who are you right so they really had to make this one work out and they do such a great job with it he's the replacing batteries a guy they're they're running of course still this late family that can never have their shit together and he's chasing the guy and it makes sense cuz he runs into the lady taking tickets you expect when they took physical tickets and he runs into the ladies chasing the guy that looks like his dad and the tickets go everywhere so it makes sense that he doesn't have a seat and it makes sense and they wouldn't he went to the wrong gate following the wrong guy like everything makes sense it's beautiful that they can make comedies that way back then like could rationalize a family being in a different place than their little child wonder if you could do that movie today people would just shame you never get a chance yeah just announced today they're remaking not remaking they're making a new I hoped I guess it's a reboot for a Disney Plus of home alone a whole new story whole new characters you know what should be its Macaulay Culkin as a 40 year old man trying to figure out what the fuck happened to him they put him on these movies when he was a little baby he's a cool guy yeah very nice guy I had him in here in the podcast I really enjoyed talking to very smart just a very interesting little fella but you know it ain't good for anybody to do that to their kids make your kids that fucking famous now famous Macaulay Culkin was oh my god he was Giganta and when you're a little boy and you're growing up gigant I like that and then all sudden you're this 40-year old man where he is now really nice guy really cool really fun to talk to recommended by Kevin Smith Kevin Smith told me I have to have him on you'll say - you gotta talk to the guy he's great he really is really interesting cat just travels around the world does whatever the fuck he wants has a shitload of money right from all the home alone movies but doesn't spend it just not going crazy he's not buying Ferraris right he just does whatever he wants he's nothing like his character in the moment so he's out well he's a grown-up he's a grown-up man of leisure but I think out of all the people that I've ever met that are famous at a you know child's age he might be the best at it because I think it's an impossible task I really do and I think in the only way it really works if you can handle Fame is if you have you you've developed character over your life and become an adult and and we're nothing and understand hard work and understand the fortune that you have to be famous or to be successful in show business but if you grow up like that man all your signals are all crossed wrong all your wires are all fucked up you grow up thinking that you're SuperDuper important for no reason with no work at all and that you can literally get whatever you want don't have people get it for you anytime you want all the time like Justin Bieber how how how is he not gonna be crazy how is he not gonna be crazy tell me he I think he's handling it incredibly the idea that you're gonna hold him to the same standards as this other kid who's also 24 whose dad is a football coach at the high school and his mom is a math teacher and they're really in tight with their community and he grew up going to scout camps and you know he plays football he plays baseball and he's got a bunch of friends he grew up with and they're all normal and he's had a girlfriend for the past two years but he doesn't know if he should make it serious when he goes to college and come on come on man yeah he's a whole different kind of person man a kid who went to a normal high school and went to a normal college and then became 22 versus poor fucking him right pulled out of school so you don't have real like knowledge of history can probably barely read Justin Bieber's what 23 or something probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars and probably had girls just launched themselves at him from the time that he was a little boy in a way that no one who's not Justin Bieber's ever gonna understand and yet we're like look at this guy such a loser yeah get your shit together loser instead of looking at it like a child abuse case right it's almost like child abuse I mean the best kind of abuse ever like pull cry me a river you got a couple hundred million dollars out of a bio therapist bro yeah but but I don't know if a therapist would work the thing about something like that is that's the kind of development like a psychologist someone barely went to school but the kind of developmental damage that happens when you don't have to go through all the normal stuff that everyone else did like here's the thing about like one thing that UFC fighters and comics a lot of us have in common is that we had shit lives growing up you were probably bullied you felt insecure I got into martial arts a hundred percent so I was scared people can beat me up hundred percent wasn't a big kid and I didn't know a lot of keep people in the high school where I went to I just moved there and I was a fuck I am I'm so scared all the time I got to do something and I went to an easy high school like Newton South was an easy high school don't they bust these inner-city kids though that would fuck you up that there was some tough people there but the point is that like if you don't have a motivation to work hard whether it's to become a stand-up whether it's to become a martial artist or what anything that you like you like I got to get out of here I got to do something different I got to make something happen you got to go through shit for that feeling to sort of emerge with enough horsepower to get you some momentum it's I can't imagine who I would be if I was famous when I was six be such a mess that's I mean the drugs they have this they have this they just can't get they can't pump the serotonin out of their brain fast enough yeah so they a lot of you know that's why so many of these people chase these dragons well they also get really depressed when they don't have continual constant success like a lot of kids that experience like an early peak and you know everybody loves them and they're super used to it and everybody's kissing their ass and then it drops off and they're like what what do you mean drops off and they get crazy because they want to get it back how do I get my relevance how do I get my this how do I get my that I can yeah you see them get really even young just young people like I was reading do you remember Heidi and Spencer from the hills Jamie does Jamie's into he's got it on well those that couple was on this reality show and they were everything for a while constantly in these gossip papers everybody paying attention and then she got a king a plastic surgery - it was very unfortunate because it was like public right it was like many many many many many surgeries and she was a pretty girl to begin with that never works out you know you get a very damning look maybe kind of worked out with Kylie Jenner I'm just saying yeah right kind of did work out would she do a little jaw thing she did a lot of shit yeah I don't know what she did something happen less magic unless Pixies I mean I don't know how much she's saying she did yeah but it's just like everything changed for the better I'm assuming you did something like your nose your feet but the problem that is like really young girls want to do that too and some of them some of them are hot the way they are they just they're just super hyper critical and everybody else at that age is super hypocritical too so if your nose is like a little bigger than maybe you think it should be like you're gonna fix it kind of fix it but when you do something like that especially if it's not like an egregious issue that you really do need to deal with if you get your nose fixed like it looks like you got your nose fixed so every time someone's talking to you they're like you got you know that's not you nose yeah what's why is that nose not fit your face it doesn't fit your face because there's a ratio there's a specific ratio like the width of your eyes apart from your eyes the length of your head will give you an indication of how long and how what shape your nose should be as weird as it seems all this shit lines up the Fibonacci sequence I think is it the golden ratio the Fibonacci sequence or something other same thing the lips are the weirdest thing right oh that's the weirdest for sure that's well there's another weird thing when people's foreheads don't move okay what's going on are you shocked just like this thing that they do it's like there's no movement at all I don't mind the fake butts at all the more obnoxious the better I'm one of those guys I don't know what it is like I I love it never grab one now if you felt a frisbee inside someone's ass do you think you would enjoy it I mean I just wouldn't touch it that much I would just stare at it a lot but you would know that if you touched it you'd feel that frisbee in there a half a frisbee to give it some bulk dude is that what it feels like I don't know I would imagine it's like a wedge in there it's like a fucking nerf football in there or something I think it's like more like pudding or something like like squishy listen you know what it is it's a fucking sign that you're too lazy to go to the gym go to the gym it's not hard go do squats it's not hard the problem is the girls like Kim Kardashian have set the bar so high what's that girl's name is E as legs eeeh what's her name Iggy Azalea that one that girls that girl's butt is obnoxious that's outrageous there was a video with her dancing and it was like watching someone in a wave pool it was all just wiggling back and forth well Jamie what do you think can we see some of that I haven't seen this before you could see some wiggle but those girls have set the bar so high with big butts you know that you like you have a regular nice ass like it's not good enough anymore for a lot of these girls because you see these yeah I need to eat some wigglin who is what is that is that her over the years that's what her butt used to look like in 2013 and then she got super addicted to powerlifting but not with her arms or upper body at all it all went into her ass under by 2018 she has this badonkadonk look at that though isn't that beautiful looks like she was experimenting with it earlier though right 2014 just a little bit yeah just a little bit pretty girl bigger house hmm well look at that upper right picture look at that see that's where it's an issue that's what that's what you find out what it really is not to me it's not oh come on look it is e as well hi say your name's eggy eggy see that's sad to me that doesn't who can get that but you just have to do squats and if yeah that's so wrong looks like a human head under you know Madonna has one of them now oh really well Madonna damn so on polar side I go hey look at me oh no yeah that's right that's Madonna yeah what can I pull it up what whoa it looks like she has a bunch of stuff in her pockets might be a diaper oh yeah dude I'm telling you people are doing this and it's do you know you know what body dysmorphia is right yeah that's what it is man it's like when when a woman has double D tits and she thinks she needs ease I need ease when a guy's at the gym and he's fucking 350 pounds he thinks he looks small people get crazy when people are anorexic same thing its body dysmorphia it's an issue with human beings we don't see ourselves the way other people see ourselves thank God yeah it's the only thing that gets you through it's just you know people are fucking envelop if people are vulnerable that's why it's so weird today that it's so in vogue to be mean you know that uh being mean for social justice and being mean online it's like so common there's probably more people being mean to larger numbers of people like just saying mean shit than ever in history when you I mean I think so has to be right I yeah I mean there has to be because of social media period yeah has to be maybe using different words well they just getting there reaching more people like how many people have an audience of 1,200 to talk to it's very rare in the real world yeah what 1,200 people find out what your opinions are yeah you'd have to go over and comment like a shopping mall well the thing is about two if you have 1200 Twitter followers do you really know those 1200 people and how many of them are BOTS how many of them just sign up to everybody's account you know this the bots on Instagram are stunning and Jamie had a really good point he said they would never remove all of them because if they did it would diminish the number of total users they have I'm like oh I didn't even think like that yeah it's like it's what they're not they're not paying for them you know but right yeah it's it would didn't fuck up the incentive bottom line every time I put a post up it's just all BOTS bottom and wait like four seconds and then see how many comments and it's just BOTS just don't look at my store if you don't want to masturbate and all these ice-water emojis yeah in eggplants and Pussycats and fuck its wit this is you know that's that's how noise thing right the bot thing is just a noise thing like they're just trying to get you to click on their page oh this is a big one they're doing now - is is my music any good I saw that right here I was looking at it but that's not real no yeah it's not an artist right no but it there's various they could be as simple as someone's just trying to draw attention to an account so they could sell that account by it in some dummies you know one out of a thousand people click and follow that account now there's been thousands and they can sell it you're right right right that makes sense um yeah but it's just there's never been a time like this where you got a bunch of fake people talking - that's weird like there's a bunch of people right now for sure that are posting on Twitter there's probably thousands of them right now that are doing it because they're getting paid to pretend to be a Republican who's really upset about the libs or they're being paid to pretend to be progressive who thinks trans people should be mandatory in every position of power and like all that some of the wackier positions that people take online are most likely taken up not just from wacky people there's got to be wacky people for sure but there's also going to be a certain amount of them I don't know what the number would be where these people are getting paid to stir up shit online I mean this is this the Renee de Resta thing when she was on the pot this woman was on the podcast who studied Russia and these Russian troll farms there's this thing called the IRA it's the internet research agency and they just pay people to tweet this is one of the things they set up it some of its kind of funny first of all their memes are hilarious they do a great job they make really funny memes and one of the things they did is they took a they took a Texas separatism meeting they like Texas people who like we know we should buy our own country those folks and they scheduled it at the exact same time across the street from this Muslim meeting so they're basically just trying to get people to fight each other so they have this Pro Islam group that's meaning that they completely organize they completely organize this anti-american group they completely organize women for Trump women for Bernie it's like as a white woman I can't support Jill Stein or as a black woman how we gonna get let Hillary Clinton run this country all Russian people just getting paid this is what we're doing who's paying them the internet research agency this is this the idea is that they can shift look if you just stop for a moment and think what is if you have a close election like Trump and Hillary it's a close election right she wins the popular vote he wins the the electoral college but it's close enough where it's within a million people one way or the other if you can get people engaged on a very specific subject like the impeachment hearings if you can get people engage and get people to think god damn it these Dems this is a coup they're trying to take over the fucking country and you start telling other people and they start telling other people and then you got this Facebook page of these folks that put up and it's got interactions that are going on all day long people are arguing about it and if they're jumping in and chiming in then the pro Trump people try them in too and everybody gets fired up it's it's like that goddamn crow and the cats over that video we played the other day 100% like there's like things yeah think of this stuff all day long yeah new strategies new strategies to get people riled up and to get people to fight with other people so they'll have like black lesbians for you know for socialism meat and it's fake it's all Russian people that are just pretending to be a black lesbian he's really into socialism and then you know capitalists get on that page and fuck you get a job free market rolls libertarians you learn where to go and then they chime in back and forth thing and they're getting people fired up and the page gets all this interaction and sometimes they change pages like one of them was like a comedy meme page and then it shifted over and became like a black lives matter page when that seemed like to be effective so they already had a certain amount of people on it and they used it for something else it's wild shit man crazy and we're doing it to guarantee guarantee some there's some out contracts contracted out company that is doing that for whatever branches of the UF government US government if not all of them oh yeah yeah we don't know our governments so good we're probably the ones that make it look like the Russians are doing in the first we're probably hiring Russians and they don't even know they're working for us they think they're working for Russia like why does Russia care but black lives matter they do they care sorry who played who pays the internet research agents actly let's Trump all along it's like scooby-doo episode pulls the mask it was you I got away with it too wasn't for you meddling kids [Music] fucking stupid was that show you could have like a little tiny girl like an eight-year-old girl you pull her mask off and she's an old man like hey what the fuck I saw someone break down that it was really done that Shaggy and Scooby ran at the same speeds because there's a dog and a human being oh yeah and Shaggy was a STONER he's not in shape why but someone broke it down which is also stoner ish and ridiculous it's true but they're on to something I mean imagine being high watch that hey man how the fuck is that dude run as fast as that dog yeah man what the fuck what they just stand up in the middle of living room what the fuck how is that dude what this is bullshit I think about that stuff a lot the one that gets me is the Wizard of Oz in Dark Side of the Moon hey not imagine what that first person it had to be a regular human they had to have just smoked pot there's an away you didn't just smoke pot acid like a Wizard of Oz seems like that'd be fun put that in the VCR it had to be a VCR because it was way back then had to be a record player you couldn't play a CD and go the whole way through that's right you would have to flip it they do they did two sides on an album how do they know how to do it right and does it perfectly sync it's the first time I saw was the first time I ever did mushrooms and it was fucking crazy so like there are a lot of sync moments it's so insane if you're sober and now they have it what's crazy is that it's such cheap mode but now you can do and I remember doing it in high school as my buddies we smoked pot and matched it up and you had to start the CD on the second MGM lion roar and now all you have to do is type you know Wizard of Oz Darkseid and the whole thing's matched up on YouTube you could be watching it on the toilet in 20 seconds and is you're a moment in it where it doesn't match up I mean there's of course obviously because it's there's so much stuff going on it's the establishing beginning and you know started the middle of Wizard of Oz and but I mean there's just so much that sort of tonally beat wise lyric wise there's a part where like you know in us and them I like in which ones which and the button at that point right then for the first time the good witch and the bad witch are together so many things going on when she first cracks the door after the tornado you know the torna you know the great gig in the sky the one with the ladies singing like crazy like oh that's doing the tornado and the house is spinning in the house lands and that song trickles out and when she cracks the door and you see color for the first time the second that door cracks and this was back then we're stoned in 14 listen to a CD player watching a VHS and as soon as that door cracks and you see that yellow of the brick road and the color you hear the catching OH the coins drop and it's money and the little munchkins are all jumping pan-pan pan-pan ticket a ticket to Denon and down I can't see that it's insane you up that scene see if you can find it we definitely cannot play it up we can't play it but we could listen to it right and comment over it or know a little bit I looked up recently they some people thought they definitely tried to do this because it seems so purposeful but I read an interview with one of the guys in the band that at the time they recorded the album VHS didn't exist so they would have had to have had two reels in the studio and a projection and like the amount of work to do that would have been what time of the brigade when did they record the album 74 75 yeah and to also even if they were even if they did do that why would they do it doesn't make any sense like they made what is one of the biggest selling albums of all time Dark Side of the Moon it's the it's just a perfect album and and why would they all we have to match it up to Wizard of Oz like it doesn't make any sense at all so they did that that would be psychotic it's just a crazy crazy coincidence why I think it's the ultimate coincidence it's just so many crazy things that these two epic productions would match up at all yeah it's very weird do you know how long that album lasted on the Billboard charts for how long 741 weeks and the longest ever right from 73 when it came out until 1988 Jesus Christ they're just selling copies and still instills yeah one the album's how many copies is it soul I'll check ins yeah let's guess let's guess before we look what do you think 35 million like that's that sounds good I'm good with that all time including online those numbers become different but yeah sure I'd say I'm on line to get a jacket out further 1,500 plays equals a 1 by now it's hmm I'm gonna go high here I'm gonna guess 400 million 300 millions use yeah is that possible what's them what's the album that got sold the most the Eagles real latest hits anything so what do we gotten certified 15 times platinum in the US so it's 15 million altogether if I add these up it gets close to about 20 to 25 there's but that's in the US four and a half in the UK two million in France two million in Canada and then nothing else over 250 I'll show you got close to it the million close to me catch up Australia Jesus Christ those numbers sound whoa Wow fourteen times platinum in Australia and that's 980 thousand sales and platinum here in America is a million there's no one there I know but that's that's what's platinum then like a hundred thousand yeah he had a hundred thousand in Australia you're doing great so we're doing great Mike weird exchange right gradual ations yeah there's only 20 million people in the entire country of Australia it's a size Yugos greatest hits December 1 what does that let's guess that I'm gonna say 42 42 million I mean we're going US album sales no it's cool world we are yeah was was that global that number you said for Darkseid he added all the other stuff without okay it was 15 American right I'll go 52 on the equals Greatest Hits 42 and 52 that's 36 million certified Wow and that's worldwide or it's just as certified so I guess that is so much so what is that money-wise how much do they cost each ten bucks average that's what back then yeah and kind of now because it's not digitally it's like they were the first ones to sell $100 ticket to I heard recently whoa to sell out like nineteen seventy seven seventy five over like the price to go to see them was a hundred dollars in 77 yeah it was a hundred dollars and seventy sevens idly like a week of work let's guess that let's guess that how much do you think the $100.00 in 1977 in 2019 money 100 1977 I'm gonna go six hundred and fifty dollars I like that I like that I'm gonna go five hundred bucks seventy so everyone's trying to find out when they did it first I get that accurate thinks is around 79 they were the first billion dollar let's just try 77 because we're trying to figure it out just for how much is uh how much what's the word yeah what would you say the exchange rates on exchange rates on another country currency rate what's the relation inflation makes it about according to 2016 inflation would have been about $300 to 9605 that's it that's that's a lot 390 605 $300 is it 296 so far yeah yeah yeah but in comparison to 1977 I would have thought have been a lot more yeah well but that's still a lot they're charging 300 bucks for a ticket you hate the Eagles or dollars and was I can't remember where I learned that they were the first band to they had a deal where they would would not only would they get the tickets and a lot of other things but they sold they got part of the parking spots well is that with you where we found that out I can't remember where I was and somebody's like they were like no we want all the part like all the parking comes to us too so you know get that so it's basically like selling a whole nother $40 ticket for each person and then if the place or whatever if the arena was like no you can't do that they're like okay well we're going to go to the baseball stadium then they're like okay well I think we'll go to the foot or we'll go to the city next you and everybody from your city is gonna go to that city and you won't have you know a booming economy for the night for that night or we could just do it in your arena like we're asking they would just play super hardball and since they had all the leverage they would just fill stadiums mmm the people would be like okay we'll give you what you want it's the touring business is weird like that the ticket prices that get jacked like Andrew Schultz was talking about this about like the the fee I say if you buy a ticket there's a fee yeah that's crazy who gets that what is that what's that fee for you do any lifting weights you carrying something yeah if you're gonna take my mic ticket it's if it's a physical ticket and you have to fly it in a fucking airplane across the country across 35 cents I mean think about how crazy that is like a fucking you it costs 35 cents is that what it is for a stamp today sure let's go crazy trades 50 cents 50 cents so we'll take a fucking letter and bring it to Alaska for you they'll bring it across the country they'll put it in Hawaii they'll bring your fucking letter to Hawaii for 50 cents I don't know if that's true is it different when you send something to Hawaii or slash you guys mail probably not right they think they just fly it they fly everything right meanwhile if you want to buy a ticket they want like convenience convenience yeah so convenient you just take my money someone's just getting money for nothing well then there's the other thing man that's equally weird is that people are allowed to buy tickets and then sell them at exorbitant rates yeah so what they do is they'll buy tickets like you say if you know Kanye West is performing and the ticket says $200 on the ticket they buy a giant chunk of these $200 tickets and they sell them for 2,000 each and you could do that and even though he wants his tickets to be 200 bucks now they're 2,000 and then someone makes a shitload of money and posed to be laws about that but like well it's weird yeah it's weird it's supposed to be called scalping right it used to be illegal they used to look for people scalping when you would go to a concert yeah you need to get soon it's got tears in the cop to grab him pull him over and fucking cuff them like they used to get you just to get you how they do it just everywhere it's all around it but now you can do it I think legally I think it's legal and I think that these companies have found a way to do it where it's totally legal they just buy the tickets and then offer them for sale at a higher price but a lot of like these guys like Live Nation a lot of other comers they're trying really hard to figure out a way to stop it I don't know what you can do look Louie CK used to have a funny thing that he would do he'd make everyone pay for cash you have to if you want to buy tickets to see him at the store yeah he would charge cash and you had to buy them like a couple hours before the show so a couple hours before the show people will be waiting in line on Sunset to go see Louie yeah and they would he would limit him right yeah and that would be his spending money and so you get a giant fucking like a shopping bag filled with cash he could think of one of those paper bags you get at the grocery store you filled that bitch up with cash I don't know what he put it in but it's like a lot of money you know he's just doing all cash he's a five billion dollar business in the United States ticket or they call it re selling now and scalping so they've changed some laws there's loopholes and loopholes wonder who's campaign got that kickback huh probably tipper gore or something do you remember when Al Gore's wife was trying to stop rap remember that provisory yeah she was the one that was her tipper gore tipper gore sounds like she'd be a great rapper she's got a good rap name sounds like a performed white politician yeah TIPA you know from Boston golfer Massachusetts recognizes the great senator typical thank you he's fat and corrupt he gets up there the big fucking Gin Blossoms on his face hammered the night before talking shit that's like an Ed Kennedy or Ted Kennedy looking guy yeah tipper gore doesn't tell like a lady let's try to stop rap music I can picture that it was like a big part of her thing as the vice president's wife she was trying to stop and put lyrics on parental advisories on rap music that was back when 2 Live Crew were getting arrested we forget about that let's he get arrested for bad lyrics for bad language yeah yeah but meanwhile Richard Pryor could get away with that talking well was different and Richard Pryor got away with it because Lenny Bruce went to jail but no rappers had gone to jail the 2 Live Crew in a lot of ways we're like the Lenny Bruce of rap they were the ones who got punished they went to and they got busted in Broward County Florida Broward is like you know the way that's if you get if you're if you're doing up to anything that might be like a little slimy and you get arrested and they bring you to get charged in Broward County Florida oh you're fucked I see them all the time on a live PD Broward County when they go to Broward County it's a great one you guys ever see that show no unlovely I'll show you keep talking about it you love it oh it's so great it makes cops look like frickin Mister Rogers neighborhood like it's just amped up and they they just keep it moving it's been when we go now they make everything seem super live even though sometimes I'll be watching a rerun but I'll just pretend like it's live you know that's funny what's gonna happen next it's weird how many cop shows there have been and how much we love watching like cops like those kind of shows like where where someone's actually getting arrested yeah those shows are captivating for us nowadays they've gotten famous like you know these counties that they do it in so sometimes someone will get pulled over or whatever and like they'll be all fucked up like oh shit is this live feed you what's up and it's always the best that's why yeah one guy already so he was been out twice [Laughter] stupid you could happen us I mean technically it could happen to anybody next thing you know you have a camera in your face and I mean what are you gonna do yeah what are you gonna do if you're in one of those areas and you okay well it's just the business of making react you know air-quote reality-tv so weird it's so weird that's the most reality reality TV because it's not planned like you know for sure they're not talking to the perps and saying beforehand okay this is what I want you to do I want you to pretend that you're taking off then we follow you and then you hit the braces oh my I'm just playing just say that yeah you would never see you know you've never get a criminal to do that correctly where it wouldn't look you know right wouldn't look fake but these guys when you know they're getting arrested you see the glass you look in their eye you see them confused and stupid you see him say crazy shit you see him get pushed against the car see him screaming at their old lady with their shirt off you see them these are real people that's reality TV it might be the only reality TV there really is because everything else everyone's painfully aware the cameras they're the only thing that sucks about is the cops bad actors like most of those cops on those shows like well you know we're just doing our best here to keep the community safe like relax bro yeah stop it though some of those guys are already getting famous guys dating Lana Del Rey I think sticks yeah hey good job good for him Lana Del Rey supporting our first responders I love it girl can't get it done yeah he's gonna become famous and then it's gonna be corrupt just like everything else gonna fall apart and they're gonna fake arrests you know what we're talking about Lester out from Big Foot he sent me an email said he was working with a television channel that not to be named and he had a problem again with them trying to fix shit and fake things a lot of these shows that you're watching some producer is faked stuff it happened with me and a show that I was on I had to get furious at this production company did this show because they faked something on a show that was on I was so mad when I found out the cheaters wasn't real that they set up cheaters member cheaters Joey Greco remember that but was it real when he got stabbed cuz he got stabbed that's what ended that show I don't know if that was real it was said I'm after he got snaps didn't get fucked up anymore but we find out if that was staged cuz if it was all staged it was all fake they busted someone someone stabbed him I thought I was sitting it's fake that's damage estimate incident was staged Oh was staged or faked it says staged mm-hmm what does that mean would you let someone stab you on television like how much money would they have to that's dangerous you get stabbed man you could die I don't think they stabbed him I think they had red red ink or red paint or you know blood fake blood hmm had him really just clench up Inside Edition reported according to a paid actor that was a fake act he was paid $400 to act out phony scenarios on the show I don't know if that was that exact stabbing I thought that was gonna say I had a friend of mine back in New York that used to do those shows that lowered like Jenny Jones and shit like that or you know those shows like Phil Donahue like any guys show yeah like hey we're looking for a guy who's been secretly having an affair with his brother's wife for the last year you know anybody like what a coincidence I've been secretly having an affair with my brother's wife oh my god are you free on Tuesday yep and then they bring him in and then we go do that and they would call back like we're looking for a guy who pretended to be a police officer and would arrest people do you know anybody like that what a creep what crazy world I used to be a cop so they would just run a scenario by him and he would say that was and they everyone knew what what was going on and so they were all covered right he lied to them they didn't know and so he would show up and do this goofy fucking show and he was just acted I saw him on a couple different ones yeah yes Springer everyone thought you know Springer was real - until you it got just obnoxious they kept like running out of crazy things to do it's not real oh yeah no no no are you kidding I can't tell whether you're being serious I didn't know if it was real sometimes things are real I don't think I don't know about that on Springer I'm not sure though I mean some were so obnoxiously fake like these people break they they would have said that by the end they had such bad actors people were like laughing at themselves and stuff some of those shows were great though yeah some of those just there's moments on those shows hilarious at the security guard from Jerry Springer ended up with his own TV show because he got so famous for running a stage he willed us that's hilarious his show I love I love flipping those on sometimes if I'm at a hotel or something random you know and I mean just like just seeing what people are really watching the daytime every now and catch a gem it's gem of an episode one of those maury povich is you are not the father and the guys dancing and go crazy the best one of my favorite ones I was I don't remember which show it was but I was watching it with candy Alexander we're in my dressing room when we're doing news radio we're just bored in between scenes we're watching TV because sometimes like if they're setting up a scene like if maybe if they're special-effects I'm like you might be be there for fucking two hours right so we're watching it might even been rehearsal I don't remember because it was during the day but we're watching the show and this girl has this like real slutty outfit on and she's got all his attitude and she's talent you know telling everybody she's the shit and y'all just jealous you know and this one dude gets up and it was like one of the most calm dismantling of a person I ever saw a guy do the guy got up and again I'm I don't think he's an actor I don't think he planned this he goes see you could pull that off but it's all about your attitude he goes if you add some pizzazz you could pull that off but your attitude stank and that make you look nasty and the whole place is just it was the timing but your attitude stank and that made you get looked nasty I fucked it up she dude it was it was one of those moments where you know she has just look at her face like she just got hit with a fucking Mike Tyson right hand like like Deontay Wilder just Baum daughter like what those moments did you get those moments every now and then if you watch a religious show you'll get one of those moments sometimes every now and then they'll just say something so ridiculous like what the fuck did you say yeah they end up you know it ends up being too rythmics sometimes at the end like everybody that would walk off would always walk off on Maury to like that green room in the back right down the hallway there's clearly you know the cameras set up for access for there and everything and it would have been more random if they've stormed off in another direction sometimes something more believable well how about dr. Phil right no here's what's weird about humans and culture dr. Phil has been on for ever right here's about million guests one girl comes on she's like catch me outside and she becomes a multi-millionaire she's huge she's famous she sells makeup she's got a fucking giant billboard on sunset I'm gonna be honest with you I listened to her rap album and it is good there you go she's hypnotizing Tony every South Park made fun of her with Cartman doing that and I was like yeah 15 years how long ago was like it where he was a little girl on South Park talking shit he's like fuck yeah I'll do what I well about it yeah that is a long time ago not that long ago I think she's only like 17 or something now I don't think we were in this studio when that was happening cash me outside I don't you know but I mean the South Park thing was predated her by a couple years had oh okay so was the South Park thing based on anyone in particular I think that he just had a lot of grit like that was a typical show and she's all stiff stood out in the middle of Twitter world and then right isn't that weird though wouldn't something just takes off like that it's weird how memes take off yeah like in things like that like what what things really grab people catch me outside everything you're gonna be huge she's huge I do what I want oh my god imagine oh legend show legend show down that shows one of the greatest like entertainment franchises whether it's sports music films greatest franchises ever South Park no doubt about it they get away with so much because it's all cartoon so they can have people get their head chopped off they can get beat to death lose arms squirt right of their armpits because it's so not real looking like Canadians their heads aren't even attached for Canadians it's so funny but it's not even that mean you know anybody but it's so ridiculous as they differentiate like they're not even human they're just different thing their fucking heads aren't connecting that's just so crazy it's the best show ever and look at that oh my god South Park continues to mock China yeah I've seen it but you know they removed South Park from China but see like you can't trick them the way they tricked the NBA those guys have plenty of money they don't need your money they're there to make this wild ass show and so if you give them a reason like oh you're gonna take away the China money okay not gonna stop those guys by cutting off some of the money and they almost everything they almost 70 got there one one there one away from literally accomplishing you know yeah they've done everything they've been around forever they've put together a play that's a musical they put together films I mean Team America World Police is still to this day one of my all-time favorite comedies and then before that the South Park movie and when the South Park movie when the devil was gay for Saddam Hussein and like you see like big fake it like was dicks you see his dick yeah remember but because it was like a cartoon you like allowed to see it dick you look this is crazy you ever seen lemmiwinks the episode lemmiwinks which ones that favorite of all time it's one where mr. garrison wants to get fired from his jobs that i think they were just paying people or something like that so he's trying to get fired so he had missed he hired mr. slave to come in and try to get him fired by doing gay stuff like and then because he found out he could sue the school cuz if he gets fired for being a gay guy or whatever so eventually as mr. slave come in and teach I'm pretty sure maybe I have this mixed up it's been a long time but gayer than gay or stuff happens and he's not getting fired eventually he has mr. slave shove a gerbil up its ass and all of a sudden the whole thing switches over for the most part and comes back and forth but it becomes an adventure of lemmiwinks he has to make it out of the gay man but he can't but he can't go out of the gates have closed off for the sphincter and there's all these like things that happen throughout this show it becomes an adventure poem yeah because he has to go all the way up to get out look he has a little kick he has a little candle what is he standing into look look what's in the rectum is just green fluid with bubbles and chunks floating and and that's another thing he's going by corpses of other gerbils as do the shit they've had misses mr. garrison do is a perfect example of how you could never do anything remotely like this on a regular show how about when he had a slot off with Britney Spears and he stuffed her up his ass to win the slut off he stuffs Britney Spears up his ass he climbs on her head and shoves down until she disappears in his ass it's unbelievable what these people look like oh my god oh my god can you just pull up the scene just so Tony and I can watch it over the slot off by yourself the always parents hell why he was Britney Spears at the same time you know they've done Britney speed with the well with Britney Spears they did the whole what was it that they kept trying to make her be better or something and they end up they want her to keep making albums even though they're driving her crazy and then by the end she shoots herself in the head or something like that but then they have her in the studio and she can't even make noises with their mouth she blew her head off basically okay challenge season 15 years ago it's so important for comedy to have a show like that out there that just has no boundaries there's and calm essential just is smart enough as with all the silliness that they've been accused of they're smart enough to leave those guys the fuck alone mm-hmm just let them keep doing it you know you've seen six days to air yes right yeah do you remember when they had Mohammed inside a bear costume inside a van with the van door closed and people are still mad do you remember that now not exactly is that actually Mohammed I did they went full oh no was this recently yeah Mohammed getting knocked down by Lincoln no one takes it further than the Muslims though like even draw our guy if you even draw our guy death that's right he was in a bear costume too if you even draw our guy death I'd love to kill you I don't even know where to begin with that well how about you know Salman Rushdie is right now remind me Salman Rushdie was an author who wrote a book that wasn't even specifically about Islam was it called again I remember from that Seinfeld episode where George met him he's like there's Salman Rushdie and they're like Kramer did or something so I don't know either remember the book no I remember him I don't remember the book but some whatever the book was there was a fatwa put out on him you know an attack on his life so they he had to go into hiding and he was he's in hiding like forever people are mad at him for years and years and years Satanic Verses that's it Satanic Verses and people are fear but I don't even think it mentions Mohammed in the book yeah I don't get that touchy I don't get that that's some weird that's other side of the world stuff like well this a beautiful ice it's a bit like a bit that I used to have about Catholics like you'll never see Catholic suicide bomber because none of us believe in it that much well the Catholic suicide bombers go you go first how the fuck do I know you're gonna go like we know there's just so much nonsense there's so much nonsense in Catholicism it doesn't have people that well no one's gonna kill somebody for Catholicism yeah and we all know like we all not like it's so obvious you go to the Vatican yo this is where you guys been putting all your shitty took from everybody right it's billions of dollars of artwork in the Vatican billions have you been now you should go it's one of those places that I tell people it's worth it food there's amazing what do you eat it Italian food no Chinese everybody's leisurely something nice about that there's something nice about that but it's it's super interesting to see all the artwork they had Rome is interesting in general because like there's a there's in the middle of this area where the Vatican is there's like this courtyard they have a an Egyptian obelisk that somehow another they moved from Egypt I mean this thing's huge this huge stone obelisk that's carved and and somehow another they got it and had it stand up it's it's planted in the middle of this little in the one in Central Park zero Egyptian one from Egypt huge from Egypt yeah whoa no shit yeah what woman was that one put in 1881 dude Central Park is pretty fucking amazing if you're so lucky you can get an apartment that overlooks Central Park that makes New York a totally different place Wow look at that man that's nuts an Egyptian obelisk put in the New York in New York in 1881 what yeah that's nuts there's all sorts of hieroglyphs all over Oh nobody tagged it I know I've haven't you know I've only seen it once the person I'll have 24-hour guards around the thing I'll think so but they have guards all over New York so someone might find it quickly does cameras and stuff honey maze that no one did anything to fuck with that that seems like a little too precious to me just out in the rain and snow I mean when when was that constructed is that like an artifact I've looked up to II don't remember I've looked it up before it was like transported there for a very particular reason but there's like there's these little crab claws at the very bottom of it which you're like interesting hmm well the whole thing's cool yeah yeah I mean all of the hieroglyphs on it to it that might be one of those things where you could never put that there today if you said hey there's this place in Egypt I know we can get an obelisk this is put in the middle of Central Park they'd be like it's a fuck out of here Cleopatra's Needle yeah unbelievable yeah people would be like what what the fuck are you talking about man look I know you can't take an Egyptian artifact and just leave it in a park take a 200-ton thing like that on a boat strapped to you dick 200 ton granite obelisk first shifted from vertical to horizontal nearly crashing to the ground the process Steamship oh my god they brought 200 tons and you're making the fucking ship left the 50 ton pedestal oh you'd be looking at everybody on that boat oh don't you eat too much you fuck we're barely hanging in here 32 horses brought it from the bank to the East River into the century into Central Park it's already two horses with railroad ramp they put up to imagine that day god that's nuts took 112 days to move the obelisk from a quarantine station to its resting place Wow yeah that's weird it's weird they would just keep it there because again like if you had a novelist that you found was an ancient historical object anyway let's just leave it in the park put in the middle the park it's good if you can't do that you asshole all you have to put a fence around it you have to put put it into glass this is this is art that was made thousands of years ago these people are dead we don't even know what they were doing it's just sitting there yeah that is the place like I think if I had the choice if there was one place where I could go on a time machine just peek for like an hour just look around and then come back to present-day that I think that would be the spot I'd want to see what Egypt was like when they were building the pyramids like in the middle of construction when they're at their peak when they're building the Great Pyramid of Giza like what was society like who are the people like you just be a fly on the wall and no one knew you were there see if they saw you they'd be like what are you do what does this down your wrist who are you why your teeth are so good how come you don't look deformed I'd go back to the jail I'd be on the grassy knoll but Dave JFK oh yeah that's me now I should be on the grass you know or to be in the Book Depository see if you're in the Book Depository then you know that Lee Harvey Oswald isn't there I think he may have even been there I think he may have even been firin but I don't I don't believe that he was the only one I'm with you that's exactly what I think I think he could have been in on it and maybe he didn't even fire it right but when they said when he said he was a patsy you know the way he said it when he got arrested he said I'm just a patsy that is that's like a guy who knew he was gonna get in trouble for something that's not like a regular guy he was not a regular guy they easily could have talked him into doing something fucked up and then they did something as well and blamed it all on him and they had him set up for it he seemed like a wacky dude someone that did that and made that shot and really wanted him dead would own it quite the opposite at that point you're not trying to not go to prison mm-hmm well maybe he is but it didn't seem like it he didn't seem like a guy who'd just shot someone he also didn't seem like a guy who was shocked that he was getting arrested for something but you could make someone a patsy back then that was real you could set someone up and then you hired Jack Ruben just run up on the guy and shoot him he just did it now the guy's dead Jack Ruby drops the gun they put him in a nice jail cell I love you a nice jail cell I don't know I did and then what happened to Jack Ruby something happen to him in jail got cancer how much you know about those three guys that they thought thinking it may be that's John Carr there's three hobos or yeah is another one of them was Woody Harrelson's dad yeah they're in the CIA I read her they thought somewhere who knows look Kennedy was not a popular guy by any stretch of the imagination with a giant chunk of the population think about his mate like if as many people hate Trump right now if that's only like I mean I don't know how many people hated Kennedy but I know that the Bay of Pigs was a huge disaster a lot of military people hated him for that supposedly he wanted to get rid of the NSA supposedly he wanted to get rid of there was he wanted to do something about the Federal Reserve there was a lot of things that he wanted to do apparently maybe was the CIA I think it was the CIA he was trying to disband one of those but he just he didn't he had a disdain for secrecy and secret societies you know like that there was a lot of these like skullenbones type things that like george w bush was in or Herbert Walker Bush rather his dad was George GW and skullenbones - yeah yeah I mean all that wacky shit like what are you doing you fucking you dressing up like a druid what are you doing are you burning an effigy you know a lot of people thought that was all fake until Alex Jones and Jon Ronson was with him right yes I don't know yes I'm pretty sure Google that make sure I'm right I think I'm pretty sure was ronson appreciate onsen was I know it was he was talking about it was talking about on the podcast about you know like that they couldn't believe what they found so this is place Bohemian Grove and the idea was that there all the elites would go there and they would engage in these occult rituals this is in America yeah yeah it's in California oh it's like Northern California and so you hear about this and you're like what like if you heard about that like hey there's a place former presidents go top top ranking generals and heads of state and bankers and famous artists they go to this place and they they do occult rituals they perform occult rituals episode bar part four of the secret rulers of the world directed by Jon Ronson he travels with Alex Jones there you go Netflix you could definitely see it on YouTube right and definitely see the interaction on you so Alex films these people worshipping Molech the our God and doing this thing's completely sneaks in just acts like he belongs there just let him in navigate guarded gate just fuckin hey hey how you doing huh it looks like a Republican had let him through he is there filming them they have an effigy like a bunch of straw and shit that's supposed to represent a person that you're sacrificing to Moloch the AL God they dressed these crazy hoods they put the effigy down they say they have those loud speakers they have this crazy speech they give it's so weird but these are like legitimate wealthy famous people politicians these people are hit like heads of banks and shit and they're all in there and they're dressing up this is real like this isn't like you hear things like that like well that's nonsense right that's nonsense that doesn't really happen there's not a real like Bilderberg meeting they don't really get together and fucking pretend they're burning hookers they really do they really do yeah and so that he films this and like it's one of the first things that got me thinking about conspiracies as much as you can think that Alex is a wacky guy and he's certainly eccentric and he's not always right you know and that's part of the problem when you're being lied to left and right by so many different things you can get real off unspun things and he and he did right he's gotten you know he's you know it's been beaten into the ground but the the fact is that there are a certain amount of these things out there like that and if it wasn't for Alex releasing that video I think most people would think that's nonsense but when you see that video you have to go okay what is this what is going on are they really dressing up is this really an occult ritual what is this have you ever seen it no show my video Bohemian Grove just so we can watch their the textures and stuff yes it's really blurry and yeah but let's but well you'd have to hear it - sounds like a booming loudspeaker but see what what you can see it's kind of blurry but this guy I mean he there's like it's famous this place so do you think these people all work with each other business this all sees got this hidden camera footage of these people with torches dressed up like druids going over and they're carrying the effigy and then they're gonna

a very strange shit so they're yelling us out this guy's got this on a loudspeaker and they're they're engaging in this ritual and then they bring over this effigy and they light it on fire they have a boat in the water like it's queer dude just imagine being a guy who's worth a billion dollars and this is what you do for fun you're gonna get together with Mike and Harry who runs Microsoft and you're all gonna go and pretend you're burning something look look at this but did they become billionaires and then do this or is it a chicken in the egg mmm that's the question that's what people think about the elites right people think well and in some families it is true I mean if these people are all meeting up once a year to burn a stack of hay shaped like a lady why wouldn't they invest in each other and you know of course they're all bankers and successful yeah well that was the thing about skullenbones is that they all had something on you everyone knew something because you all sucked everybody's digging right took Polaroids of it and dressed up like a munchkin you know that's what they all did they did some wacky shit like hardly know fuck it's hard to think like what you could have had on somebody before porn search history they probably all fucked each other it probably was one guys like the top skullenbones guys just really into fucking dudes and you just convinced everybody no be crazy doing that how do we have a group super secret group and you can't tell anybody about how we're gonna stop people tell people I know we're gonna film me fucking really he's just trying to fuck these guys in the ass that's his goal is just to fuck guys in the ass he's like man this is getting harder and harder to trick these do this I didn't figure out a new way so he comes up with this super exclusive elite club it's called skull and bones yeah do you want in yeah well we are be able to trust you you could trust me I won't tell anybody I don't believe you Timmy Timmy I don't believe you I think you would tell we're gonna have to have something on you well I mean what do you mean we're gonna have to have you do something that you don't want to do and that way we'll if you ever say anything about us we'll tell everybody about you oh I mean I really do want to be in the club guarantee you that's how it went down that's crazy one Alfa gay dude just tricked a bunch of guys isn't that if it's not skullenbones maybe they don't do that but there's a group out there that does here's one of those groups one of those crazy groups that's just run by a dude's just dunking dudes my nice 35 is still in college everybody's like Mike why you still go to school here someone's got made sure that's how everything starts right now that's the bone yard the bone house the bone house that our ethics are true I'm here to uphold the strictest interpretation of the boneyards rules no trust you and I share your commitment yeah everybody bathes in oil first like why are we in the oil what what's going on just these weird fucking secret societies you ever heard the Kennedy speech about secret societies uh it's fucking creepy when when it turns out that eventually gets murdered it's creepy sorry Irishman hey no good about yeah yeah no it is good as so many people told me that they hated it that I was shocked when I watched it and it was good pull up Kennedy's speech about secret societies cuz Kennedy had this speech about secret societies that many people speculated had to do with the CIA or had to do with the movie brings up an angle I didn't know is that he hired his brother to become the Attorney General and he started going after yes the mob yeah oh yeah oh yeah he did right after they helped him get into office where's the other thing about the Kennedys they were drug dealers 100% bootleggers yes they were selling whiskey or moonshine or whatever the fuck it was says the dad was too old at the time to get a hold of the sons like they were trying to get old man Kennedy to tell us kids crack the whip get him in line but they couldn't get get to him cuz he was just staring out windows oh he was done already yeah yeah that makes sense listen man they were illegal alcohol salesman they made a bunch of money selling alcohol illegally just like a drug dealer does same thing the fact that those folks went on to become this incredibly powerful family and then two brothers get publicly assassinated fucking a man two of them the fact that you can keep guys around that you know will whack somebody for you like that they'll be a jack ruby or sirhan sirhan just trick a guy figure out what do you gotta say to that guy to get that guy to run up on that dude and shoot him in the stomach I mean if you put a gun to somebody's head and you tell them that if they don't do this we're gonna kill you and your family that's it pretty much you got them especially sometimes you know like in the movies when they show someone a picture of their family and they show them a picture of their house or whatever you know and I mean like I know where you live I know that's I think it's more than that I think it's guys that you can tell that they're gonna do a good thing they're gonna go out in history and they're gonna live in infamy like for their own personal gain like you're talking about people that that are so dumb you're willing to you're gonna you're gonna lose the rest of your life because someone's telling you to go shoot Bobby Kennedy and you're gonna do it in a restaurant front everybody it was a hotel we actually did all right that was in LA we actually did fear factor in the very hotel where he was shot because the hotel eventually shut down I don't know how long after the assassination but when we were there they would rent it out for television shows it's just like weird place man you walked through the kitchen where where he got shot like yet he's got shot in the kitchen they bring him into the kitchen probably on him and I think it wasn't like the convention part where they're giving a speech and that guy swears that he didn't kill him and licit but play that play that uh that kennedy speech it's actually like a 20 minute speech this is I think this is the main highlight okay hopefully looking for yeah let me very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies to secret oaths and to secret proceedings we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it even today there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions even today there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment that I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no official of my administration whether his rank is high or low civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to sense of the news to stifle dissent to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of Elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day it is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations it's preparations are concealed not published it's mistakes are buried not headlined it's dissenters are silenced not praised no expenditure is questioned no rumor is printed no secret is revealed no president should fear public scrutiny of his program for from that scrutiny comes understanding and from that understanding comes support or opposition and both are necessary that's good I am NOT asking you get it Wow crazy right yeah now if you had just heard that if someone else was saying that instead of Kennedy if someone else is saying those very things in front of you about how they have an open budget there their findings are all concealed they're a tightly wid group knit group that combines the military and science and all you'd be like Wyatt you want Sam sure please Bob that's big ha ha heon tinfoil hat you know what are you doing with this wacky thought we think that that would be the pret he's talking about secret societies talking about the industrial the military-industrial complex he's talking about all the gears that are in play all the pieces that are in play that are making money and causing war and deciding what information people shouldn't shouldn't have and what overreach you know they're going to put into action he's foreshadowing everything hit me I watched on the plane the other day the Dick Cheney movie with I haven't heard oh you must watch this since I called Cheney's vice with Christian Bale right he gained like 70 fuckin pounds were unreal in this movie he's great at everything he does he's in a whole nother gear he turns into this guy man and it's so crazy he was just a guy working for Halliburton you know he's running all this military stuff and has all this experience with you know politics but he's really just a business owner and so working a good he looks like incredible he's done real how many fat guys saw that movie and go if I just lost weight yeah could be bad inside of me I could be Batman I got Batman inside of me I mean I got these pudgy wrists and fucked-up hands but the practice Wow he gotta see it is crazy and is that him with or their next each other oh just a picture picture next to each other about he got fat huh he went for it he really went for it man it's so good you really exposes that part of things how close you know you can he's he wants you know he's running a massive business that makes military stuff so us having to do stuff benefits him how to tremendously it's one of the most transparent scams that's legal in the history of the world just pause and think about how crazy everybody's going on about this Trump call to Ukraine and whether or not there was enough to impeach him and all this madness people going crazy about this right this is like that this is the topic and I've heard many Democrats go there's nothing here folks you got to back up this is not enough to take a guy out of office the Republicans are never gonna vote for this like you guys are you know you're making a big mistake here now think imagine a guy who's the vice president of the United States who is also a guy who used to be the CEO of Halliburton then this guy decides to go to war under false pretenses they make up some shit about weapons of mass destruction they blow this fucking place to smithereens and then Halliburton gets no-bid contracts I mean this wasn't someone saying I can do it for 3 billion I can do it for 2.7 it wasn't any of that there was a no bid contract for billions of dollars to repair the places they blow up and he was making money off of it it's crazy I think for the first year or something like that I want to know when Dick Cheney was actually making money off a Halliburton I think he had abandoned his position or give up his stocks or something but it was a while it was it was it was one of those things where you like me you just left you just left and then the company you just left is now getting no bid contracts in the billions am i stupid right how are you allowed to do this on television in front of everybody in the movie oh and you know in movie also shows how much of the president's ear he really had because the president the George W needed him to win it you needed him to run with him to get the you know the real like Republican votes at the time for sure yeah for sure no one else was you know that could do what he could do he needed him he was deeply deeply deeply connected but it was also bushed in wha doing that Schiller you go ahead and handle it so yeah yeah that was the deal with the occasion at least in the movie that's the deal that they made basically he's like plays Bush someone unbelievable hits what's his name Sam Rockwell I think it is yeah yeah he's unreal I mean this movie was so easy to watch I never is one of those movies where like halfway through it you're like I hope this never ends long who plays Bush Sam Rockwell yeah did you ever see the moon move movie just moon there it is you see the two billboards that well looks like Bush that's amazing he's got the eyebrows down Steve Carell destroys as Donald Rumsfeld oh of course he does Carell is obese dude he's unreal in this they make Rumsfeld look like basically what he was just a big doofus like you know would get out and do his own thing and they'd have to control Rumsfeld you want to hear another conspiracy theory yeah you probably don't know it's gonna blow your minds do it the day before 9/11 the day before the attacks Rumsfeld gave a press conference where we talked about trillions of dollars missing the day then a plane slams into the very part of the building where they were doing the accounting blows up half the fucking building of the Pentagon blows up a wall Donald Rumsfeld was on what was it the White House lawn listen to this this is like ten minutes but it's at the Pentagon this is on c-span yeah look it up right now just we got to get to the quote where he says mentions 2.3 trillion dollars in missing receipts talks about his adversary but see if you could just find them whoa see the just there's I know there's YouTube videos you're what are you looking at these clips on here on c-span okay if you just google it on don't even do that just go through YouTube that's um I know you have to see it because you hear him say it you're like wait what the fuck did he just say yeah yeah I think that's it let's see already spends according to some estimates we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions 2.3 okay now again somebody told you that literally like right before 9/11 happened they said they couldn't track 2.3 trillion dollars you go no that didn't happen that did not happen but it did happen what the fuck yeah so think about what kennedy said yeah think about what you saw when you saw that vice movie where Dick Cheney who is the CEO of Halliburton becomes a vice president and gets billions of dollars in no-bid contracts now think about we just saw with Donald Rumsfeld saying they couldn't find 2.3 trillion dollars I I don't know I don't know it seems like we should have had it okay we'll keep looking oh no the spot where we look just blew up oh my god what find out if that's true if the it was the accounting office because this is what I loved I love to say it because it sounds good but let's make sure it's true that that part blew up but either way that he did say that and then they did get hit by a plane a couple of days later it's unbelievable it's so crazy and you know what talked about that trillion dollars no it's trillion 2.3 trillion to trillions bigger than most countries right that you build a whole nother country or so that's two point three million million ooh isn't it no so thousand trillion is a billion right no a thousand billion how about no yeah that well yeah a thousand million is a billion is a thousand billion a trillion yeah a thousand billion is a trillion and it's nine hundred every billion trillion is that really what it is it's nine hundred and ninety nine billion times two it was a billion trillion a couple more billions no its we're so stupid it's a hundred thousand and then a million and then ten of those is a billion right yeah or a hundred of those a hundred millions of billion it's a hundred so it's a hot each one is a hundred oh shit yeah trillions a whole nother three zeroes another three zeroes yeah that's so much how would you say that would you say that's uh look how big it looks written out so it's a million so that's a billion that's a trillion it's the word billion is referred exclusively to as a million millions a million millions okay but how many is a trillion a billion millions trillions a million millions huh oh well what's a billion a thousand Millions okay that makes sense a million Millions so it's 2.3 million Millions no that seems like a lot to be missing and then BOOM plane hits the Pentagon everybody stops talking about it what was the last time you heard about that 2.3 trillion never that didn't come up all the times we were talking about flight 93 let's roll remember that let's roll that's what they said right before they went up to kick her ass and that's why that plane hit the ground it didn't kill all the fine people that it was going towards the White House or whatever in British terms British English which is not American English the word billion referred exclusively to a million millions however is no longer common and the word is now used to mean one thousand million so if anybody is in another country and it's confused that's why it seems like if that would've got that make sense million makes sense million million doesn't make sense it seems like if that would have gotten out that that that money was missing that the whole country could have revolted like I mean that's what what did you do with our tax money that's not money right but that's a way to steal 2.3 trillion if you're if you get if you stole 2.3 trillion you want to cover it up start a war right I mean boom immediately everybody's freaking out they can't believe what's going on I mean that's what the tinfoil hat Brigade would say what does this say MSU scholars find 21 trillion unauthorized government spending oh my god this is recent 21 trillion and unauthorized government spending defense department to conduct first-ever audit oh they've never audited before why would they audit they just get free money they're not like a regular company right the Defense Department's not like a company where like all the stockholders are going hey fuckface what are you doing I got you know a hundred thousand shares your stupid fucking company your CEOs running into the ground no they don't even have to audit they don't don't do shit they just take that job oh we missing you know 21 trillion whatever I don't even know what that is so thousand million billion or something 21 so the last four years we've been good don't don't pay attention that last four years we have a misspent at all that's what Kennedy was talking about literally not saying that anyone you know I'm absolutely not saying 9/11 was an inside job I don't think it was but I am saying that when things happen and disasters take place people capitalize on those disasters and if it's possible that someone was going to set something up some sort of an attack and they're going to do it because they were in the process of stealing something or was gonna steal something you would have to be a lot Billy wait a minute what are they gonna do how much money would it be worth it to start a war that might be the number two point three trillion that might be the number like you feel like what's how much would it cost to start a war if you're evil anyway hmm would you start a war for a hundred million man I can't spread that then enough you know I got a gonna grease a lot of Palms we're gonna start a war why we starting a war what's going on well you gotta get this fucking oil man I don't know how to do it I'm thinking I just I don't like the World Trade Center hilarious I just googled how much have we spent in Afghanistan you want to guess how much that number got to okay I guess ever in Afghanistan wish I was going off of Congressional Budget Office reported report published in October 2007 said Oh could this isn't a potential numbers of potential spending then this is potential what they wanted to spend as of 2007 what they wanted to spend plan to spending well how much did they spend do they spend more or less not think they spent way more okay let's just guess what how much what do you think the number is jeez this is a tough one Afghanistan only enough counter it says uh actually says Iraq in Afghanistan bracha desk yeah I'm gonna go with a hundred and thirteen trillion dollars whoa that's a lot I'm gonna go with uh I'm gonna go with 100 billion what is it they conveniently planned on spending two point four trillion dollars Wow which is a very convenient number after we lost two point three but they spent closer to like six or so this is the worst is like if you check somebody's accounting books and they just have stick figures with googly eyes like what are the odds that is so crazy but it's not like we covered it up good they'll never imagine that that that's you're laundering that's your money laundering war it's not but right like if you're if you are someone that makes weapons and you have a huge contract with Defense Department and you have the ear of the Defense Department and you know you guys play golf jet and you dress up like druids and burn an effigy worship Molech the owl god and you start talking and you say hey man what are we gonna do to keep his fucking I got these tanks I'm making they are motherfucker wouldn't be great try them out you know tell you what I got a deal for you and they just walk around playing golf talking shit and the next thing you know I mean who has the ultimate influence in whether or not there is military action and how long that military action goes on for right like his Bernie Sanders and a lot of these people and tulsi gabbard a lot of people that are running for president say that if they got one of the things they would do is to stop these interventional interventionalist Foreign Wars and this world police wars that we just go on and invading other people's lives that we would stop doing that I think that's great right but who really gets to say like who gets to say whether or not like who talks to Trump and says let's just keep rolling into this place what's wrong there's a fucking problem over there Isis Isis building up what bumfuck eyes people like who has the real ear I mean is it that is it generals I mean does is there any industry influence at all from weapons industries or from people who have deals with them or you know that's what Eisenhower warned about when he left office you've heard that right yeah that is one of the craziest speeches a president has ever said Trump says you do have a military-industrial complex they do like war yeah well they say you try to pull some troops out and they wouldn't let him oh that's right Trump said that don't kid yourself he says you do have a military-industrial complex they do like war you know in Syria with the Caliphate so I wipe out a hundred percent of the Caliphate that doesn't mean you're not going to have these crazy people going around blowing up stores and blowing up things these are seriously ill people but I wiped out a hundred percent of the Caliphate I said I want to bring our troops back home the place went crazy they want to keep you have a problem here in Washington they never want to leave I said you know what I'll do I'll leave a couple hundred soldiers behind but if it was up to them they'd bring thousands of soldiers in someday people explain it but you do have a group and they call it the military-industrial complex they never want to leave they always want to fight no I didn't want to fight but you do have situations like Iran you can't let them have nuclear weapons you just can't let that happen that goes on like and that's you know that's one of the thing with Trump nobody ever talks about I feel like is it's like we've been pretty much anti you know we haven't been swayed into as many Wars as I feel like we would have been who knows I mean who knows me maybe yes maybe no maybe we're closer to war because of him who the fuck knows Trump administration considers 14,000 more troops for the Middle East as last week hmm but he also suggesting deployment you know who knows meant maybe they know things too you know the thing about talking to people like jaakko will Inc and you know my friend Andy stump and other other folks that have been over there like they'll they'll tell you there's there's some times where things build up and radicals control cities and things get really ugly and then they have to have some sort of military intervention or these people to keep growing and they you know they dump that's the other thing that people aren't talking about like in Afghanistan in particular the afghan e's are working with the soldiers against these terrorist organizations like there's afghan ease that are helping US soldiers is not like all of the u.s. against all of afghanistan no it's that they're combined against Isis the it's just the whole thing is so crazy that there's these groups these organizations that are like characters in a James Bond movie or in a comic book right like think about like Isis like some some other guy says that's like if you crazy movie about people that you know had a great leader who's like a spiritual guy lived in the mountains and you know if that's what sama bin Laden I mean he is like a character in a movie used to work for the for the good guys then he switched over to the bad guys it's like someone in a Batman movie right you know yeah lips and caves yeah it's just all of it is weird man oh I mean the whole thing about you draw Mohammed they'll kill you like how extreme the religion is and how devoted people are and you can't question any of it it's the most extreme in that regard where it doesn't doesn't allow any questioning of it and then you know people can't understand that some people practice it the same way some people practice Christianity or some people practice other things they only they only believe or take part in the positive good parts of the religion so there's a lot of people that are Muslims that are great people they're really kind really well educated wonderful thoughtful people they don't have nothing to do with terrorists and when there is some sort of terrorist activity it makes them feel bad that they're getting lumped in with someone who's doing horrific things these people that you know end up committing to these extreme religions I feel like and we should be dropping like soccer balls and intend oh switches from airplanes to give them things to do so they're well they're stuck believe in something if you're stuck in a place that it's got a very rigid religious ideology and radical and you know you've been radicalized since you were young and then you got places like Yemen right places that are getting bombed by the u.s. from fucking robots planes are flying overhead they're gunning down wedding parties accidentally and killing people I mean that happens it's pretty common right so you're making more radicals because then there's people who lost their family members to some robot flying in the sky that some kid is you know he's got an Xbox control on his hand he's shooting missiles you know they say those guys who are those pilots they suffer PTSD as well those pilots are weirded out by that shit you know imagine being a drone pilot and you're watching something that you kind of know is happening you definitely know what's happening right you were you're controlling it you see it but when you hit that button you watch those missiles choo choo choo choo choo shoot down Hellfire missiles to comb Hellfire to which is crazy shoot shoot down into these camps shoot down into these uh motorcades like you know what you just did and most likely you're killing eight out of ten of those people are innocent and because of the fact that a drone does it we're like are we gonna do like we had a soldier and like hey Tony you got to stop killing innocent people hey I'm a fucking killer okay you sent me after those bad guys there's a lot of babies around I had a fucking let them know you ain't gonna stop me from getting that bad guy there's no way we'll put you in jail yeah but if you have an Xbox controller and you're shooting Hellfire missiles into a fucking school because you think that there's a terrorist in there like what and you know they set them up sometimes too they give bad advice or bad Intel yeah so they try to get someone to blow up a school or get someone to blow up a wedding party like there's a lot of fuckery involved in anything you're doing like that where they know that if you do kill people it's actually bad press it's bad for you public public perception goes the other way that bad Intel something else I watched they came out with another different type of World War two in color you ever watch World War two in color I still have it oh my god I think it's one though right isn't it one they just came out with a second one I was obsessed with one eye it's the only thing on Netflix that I've watched like five six seven times and they just dropped another one with a whole different footage and a whole different angles with historian interviews cut in between and they're all the old film I can't believe how many cameramen they had shooting this crazy shit back in the day they're on the battlefield in there taught you can see it's a tundra people are freed the soldiers are freezing I'm like who's the guy filming this animals crazy yeah the actual like tick tick tick tick I can't imagine how they were doing this do you think they had a cranked it small handheld like eight millimeter you think they cranked it well they did it where would the battery be I don't know it seems like it would be ready have to they'd probably have to crank it don't you think yeah that's what they did in the old days ready action and they cranked it I think might imagined imagining that like old cameras I think so I feel like they cranked him imagine that was not that long ago man that's what's really weird just look right here I had this author in the other day his name Sam Sam Quinn s-see Quinn he wrote this book empire of the summer moon it's fucking amazing man it's about the Comanches and it's about the the war they had with like through Texas and Oklahoma and went on forever like a ganancias were the last holdout against the American settlers and events against the soldiers the Comanches were the last holdouts they were the last like truly wild tribe and they were running the plains for like hundreds and hundreds of years of horses and shit but here's the thing man this moved this book it's taken place in the mid 1800s to the late 1800s but just like that's so recently it's so recent yeah the the the the giant rock from Egypt came over in 1888 yes came over in 1888 where I was probably older than that but right these people were essentially living a nomadic Stone Age life everything was leather and sinew and buffalo tendons they used to make their bows and their bow strings they made their own bows and arrows out of wood and the arrowheads are made out of Flint they would chip away expertly and they would run around following Buffalo and just shoot him with bows and arrows and spearmen run them off cliffs they would run them off cliffs that stampedes they'd get to the bottom and there was sometimes so many bodies down in the bottom of these Buffalo jumps that the rotting wood caused combustion and they would blow up they would explode and catch fire just because there's hundreds and hundreds of dead rotting Buffalo on top of each other because they can't eat that many like say if you have a tribe you know a tribe 150 people and you kill a thousand Buffalo like how many of those you need you can't really eat all of them so they would just let them sit there and they would literally start massive wildfires because they would burst into flames I saw bison when I was driving from Salt Lake City to some other gig I should be clear I don't think they started massive wildfires I think they started a massive Buffalo fire you know the the fires of the dead bodies I don't know if there was like shit to burn outside of there there must be though right wait it's probably grass and stuff on the ground it's where the Buffalo were eating but it's at the bottom of a cliff I don't know what was down there but the you know they had these areas that they would call Buffalo jumps where they would just circle them on this hot and circle on this high yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah light on these Buffalo and they just off the cliff everybody and by the time you're running to the cliff and you realize oh my god this is a cliff you try to hit the brakes there's a thousand fat fucks behind you pushing you off the cliff Wow imagine being the first Buffalo to get like really close he's like running up to the cliff oh oh oh shit the dumbest fucking giant beast on earth the dumbest elephants are smart right buffaloes are so dumb they just run it buffaloes are like no disrespect to the Buffalo but they talk in the book about how they would shoot Buffalo and that like everybody had like disdain for our dumb the Buffalo where I think it probably made it easy for them to almost wipe them out to the point of extinction but if you shoot Buffalo one goes down and the other ones look and they go right back to eating and then another one goes down and they look and they go back to eating like you have to literally go out they were saying and yell at them to get them to move yeah that's the only way you got him away from the ones you shot because you wanted to eat the ones you shot so when the ones went down they were like get out of here fucker while my friends died do put up a bunch of dummies but meanwhile it's amazing animal you know it's like the like you had a you were gonna say that God had a plan to provide people with the perfect animal for hunting so the woods want you to be eating healthy so I'm gonna give you millions of this fucking enormous animal doesn't move when you shoot its friends literally fill the plains with these things it's just people were just such cunts that they killed them all people were so gross cuz the buffalos are so easy to kill that he just killed them all they killed they would have mountains of bones man there's a buffalo jump says he had the bone bonfire shelter's what's called a head two big events in history where it happened here right so they call it the bonfire because all that blackened shit apparently was because of the fires from the buffalos hitting and burst into flames and some of those Buffalo jumps they say to this day you can find arrowheads if you go wandering around the area because you know it's so populated by Native Americans at the time but the Comanches dude I think this is a this buffalo jump in Montana decisions in Texas Oh in Texas yeah so Texas with the Comanches there's other Native American tribes there too but a lot of it was the Comanches which is in this book a lot of this book takes place in Texas it's fucking amazing dude and so scary there's these Buffalo down hit in Iraq leave that large rock shelter was a scene of a series of prehistoric Buffalo jumps Native American hunting hunters ingeniously Stampede it herds of bison over the edge of a cliff overhanging the shelter in a narrow box canyon that empties into the Rio Grande near Langtry Texas the Bisons plunged to their deaths on a rock pile at the opening of the shelter and there are historically documented accounts of Northern Plains Indian groups using this effective if indiscriminate technique of killing bison we also have to remember back then there was so many bison if they thought they killed a couple extra thousand they didn't give a fuck they were everywhere there were so many of them and here's why that happened here's what gets even weirder they think that that happened because people got smallpox and it killed like 90% of the Native American population so when the Europeans came over in the 1500s and whatever was when Cortes came over here what was that was at the 1500s anyway when those guys came over and brought smallpox it just wiped out like most of the population so the Buffalo who really their major predator was people especially Native Americans especially once they figured out how to ride horses but now all's dus died and so the Buffalo went ham just fucked up a storm and then there was millions of them this is author Dan Flores it has this whole paper that he wrote on it was it called bison ecology bison diplomacy I think it's called something along those lines but it's crazy they said you hear about the fate of the Bison in North America it's like the most iconic animal when you really think about the Old West if there was one animal we think about the Old West maybe be horses but more likely to be a bison yeah why do they call buffalo buffalo the City of Buffalo good question because a bison is not technically the same as a buffalo because those people don't move when they should - you son of a bitch you snuck that ain't good it's good timing - you had a good pause there I got genuinely curious that's good good pause it seems like I I don't know maybe there was a lot of Buffalo back then there's Buffalo everywhere they were like elk elk were in literally every state pretty much we people were gross man we killed everything yeah the quick question of what's the difference is a contrary to the song Buffalo did not roam an American West they're indigenous to South Asia and Africa well below bison are for North America yeah that's what I'm saying yeah they call it American Buffalo but it's a bison it's a different animal the Buffalo that you get like Asia and Asian water buffalo those are the ones they get that are in Australia they brought those over to Australia and do they're gonna mess over there there's nothing that kills them so they're just all over the place and they destroy the land they're so big there's so many of them and they're wild they even have wild domestic cows that grow out of control and the male's become like super ferocious like you know like a bowl like a bull doesn't want you riding them but they have a thing in Australia called scrub bulls and what it is is a domestic cattle like domestic cattle but that went wild like generations ago many many generations ago so now they're just wild animals that happened have enormous fucking horns and weigh 2,000 pounds and freaked out they see people so they see people if you're too close they think you're closing and try to kill them they just fuck you up oh fuck that is this I think that's a water buffalo that's what's hearing that's this yeah see that above me is from my friend Adam green tree he shot one of those oh this is crazy he's gonna walk up the thing yeah like he knows food ooh he put his hand on it and it just dropped yeah in the real world he would be dead as fuck that thing would just smash him just touch your head high I'll just touch your head hey and then the bull just gave in and went down yeah so that dude you know he wound up marrying the girl that girl that girl with the camera no it's co-star yeah Wow she's like man you do that with a bull well screams yeah yeah but that's all around Australia those big-ass giant poles and then big-ass scrub bulls wild domestic cow Australia is a mess in that in that sense like wildlife wise because there's so much so many things that are invasive this last time we were there for the first time I actually went to a sanctuary one of those places and with Jeremiah and Joel and we had a blast man there are some crazy animals down that we held a koala bear took a picture with a koala let me tell you they feel like the American version of that animal seems like so cute and like soft and light it feels like a stuffed animal what we think a koala is and we went we went to take a picture of his sling it was lady Han and me this koala it was like it felt like it was tiny right same size that I thought it would be but the thing was like fucking three bowling balls it was just so heavy and it's a bear it's a real bear and that's the thing and exactly we call it a koala it's a koala but yet but the bleep though it should be illegal to say it without the word bear attached to it because let me tell you this fucking thing they have to feed these things eucalyptus leaves the entire time it's all of these well what they didn't with the I what I didn't know is that that's all it eats and that's all it does like the second this thing is done with with one of the eucalyptus leaves they have to hand it another one because you can feel its energy change turns its head and it gets like a fucking little bit of a look like these things ready to fuck you up you have to just keep feeding this these are like the drug addicts on an IV drip that are starting to feel pain the second they don't have the drip of course look how much nutrition is a goddamn eucalyptus leaf they probably have to eat them you have to stuff themselves with it yeah and they're solid as a rock so think about all that they must you know oh my god and Ian on the claws it's just it's a real bear man which well it wasn't until I held that koala on which I realized the true power of an what we consider an actual bear oh my god because it's like that thing's this big right and it felt like that was that strong and sturdy and there in their hands and everything you feel everything it makes it to say it's a ball of muscle would be a tremendous understatement and honest to god man I thought we were gonna go take pictures with these koalas cuz they have the little girl zookeepers and they seem super comfortable and they're giggling and happy and everything but it didn't it being a serious situation I was scared I was that's hilarious very scared jeremiah kept making fun of me because of how scared I was I'm like I'm good that she's like you want to take a group picture with all of you in the barre I'm like nah that was enough good for you yeah yeah it's you know they're right now because of a gigantic wildfire in Australia they become functionally extinct which means that 80% of their range has been destroyed by wildfire so you can find anything on that I think my numbers are right you see oh there you guys yeah that's not far away I am look at my hand my good cuz it's thinking about Pike it is like fucking Tony fuck you Tony's I'm ready to bite you bro look oh you guys are all telling each other we can't tell there's this the final result Jeremiah and that dudes break off literally laughing about that as it's happening like ya think I would see if you pull up the article on them koalas now functionally extinct in Australia because I think 80% of their range has been destroyed and you know you're talking about the only places where they can live and breed and there's a giant population of them koalas are functionally extinct but they need our health but what does it say well this is one scene that see Google koalas are functionally a state I looked it up and these things stink - by the way I I I was obsessed with the smell of eucalyptus I had so there's all these new articles that say there aren't extinct okay so you know what it probably was I probably got caught up in some scientific click the one that says they may be as of may so they created it but it was a really recent would where are these ones coming from these are you're looking at older ones from me see how everything's from Marin Times Forbes yeah no no look I'm not saying you're wrong Jamie what I'm saying is the older ones when they're saying they were functionally extinct was from a which doesn't totally make sense because we're they're that many fires in May cause aren't these fires like real reason or a bunch now yeah so most most of them are saying no koalas aren't functionally extinct I guess yes is after there were bush fires overstated claims okay yeah so that's what you got to wonder about today man anytime you read an art like I didn't even read it right I just read the ahead the heading that's what they that's how they're getting you with everything let's click bait and it's almost like they have to do that like if you have a great article but it doesn't have a catchy headline how much how many people are gonna it's almost you have you have to come up with something that's almost a lie yeah you have to get their attention you have to at least give them the little bit that might they article might not even be about you just have to get them to click it's like a Salesman or a sales job or how often is Australia have fires if they have one a giant one in May and they have another giant one now and I was watching a show some some show from Australia with some dude who's losing weight like some fitness show you know his uh his his wife got him to go on this show when he's losing all his weight he has to do all these exercises and shit and while they were there they were worried that they're gonna have to evacuate because he's giant fires were coming their way I'm like how often is Australian on fire hmm and when that place is on fire that's a huge place with not that many people right that's much has been burned equivalent map of America that's insane dude that is insane that's insane we're looking at most of Manhattan and then a giant chunk of New York State a giant chunk of Pennsylvania it looks like New Jersey's completely engulfed that's nuts wow that's a huge patch and all out into the ocean as well that's the thing like if you look at it that if you pulled way back at the entire continent and looked at that little square it wouldn't look as big Wow Pittsburgh to Cleveland yeah it'll go go way back go go go way small so you can see like the whole continent so that's how you gotta think of Australia so that's how Australia looks at it alright hopefully I get out on his own or hey not much we can do about all right you ready he's fucking Buffalo hey wouldn't it be fun to just get dropped off somewhere like that with a bunch of just like 30 days worth of stuff in a backpack to survive and Joey lost step if you break your ankle right and then you're wondering if you don't die this way that could be the future of vacations fact-check or this year as far as unprecedented conservative commentators have pointed out a long history of Russ fryers suggests there is nothing unusual about this season experts disagree so it's even worse this season yeah that's a big chunk of land I was reading or watching a video rather today I put on my Twitter about this this family in Siberia that they found that it escaped communist persecution they were really religious and they moved to the middle of Siberia and they found them one day there and they had no idea of world war two it happened they didn't did they're missing out on like giant then no contact with the outside world the daughters had never seen people before dude were they like home-schooled the kids Ernie oh yeah I mean they taught him what they could but they're all just barely surviving that one of them starved to death the mother starved to death and it's a cartoon of it all so it's real weird like you watch this cartoon you know and this lady's just starves to death in the cartoon yeah and the it was growing their own food and hunting with the Kimba they didn't have a bow and arrow they've never gone so they would set traps in the in the ground floor like an animals have fallen sticks would stab them is that what they looked like yeah not long after they got found fucking sever a Z man so they were I think they were out there for that was 78 when they got found I think so I think they were out there pre-world War two so wrap your head around that so they might have been out there for you know 30 plus years and that was the shock they lived in that was the place they lived in and they're there in the fucking taiga man they're in Siberia they're 150 miles from the late the nearest city they walked they got 150 miles in and set up shop because some of the people that they were with and their religious group were killed by communists somewhere arrested and persecuted and they just had to flee so they took off and they they made a little comm unit they're good five good God freezing cold Siberia freezing cold and starving to death the mother starved to death to let the kids live it's crazy they barely made it and then they started growing some food and they figured out a way to the remaining people that didn't starve to death figured out a way to survive but they were barely hanging on they were all barefoot when they found them they eat their mom probably not right you can't bring yourself to eat your own mother right you might eat your mom you're starving she's not gonna need that meat right you don't wanna look what do you do do you starve to death with her or do you eat her I think she would want I think my mom would want me to eat I know your mom would I get to see her this week I get that my mom's spaghetti sauce for the first time in year and a half years your mom Solaris you should really legitimately write for her and take her on the road is your mom work does she have a job no no she's an old lady dude take that old lady on the road haha your mom's funny man she could do it if you wrote for her that'd be a good writing exercise for you write for your mom yeah just and you could mean especially if he brought her to like killed Tony shows and she goes up and just does a couple minutes in the in these towns oh she's definitely she's definitely gonna do kill Tony again I don't think she knows that but episode five hundreds coming fast we're at like 419 right now so that's awesome yeah isn't that crazy it's awesome that you guys are doing these big giant Road shows - it's fucking killer man yeah we're in the middle of it right now this is the end of it we've been everywhere this year it was such a crazy year for us we literally went everywhere Australia Europe and everywhere in America every major Canadian city well it's such a good concept if you like stand-up and you want to know what it's like to try it out in the beginning and then try it out in like the most hostile environment and a man but also most supportive because if the comics good I give you we all if someone does minute every time I've been on the show would be like fuck yeah man that was good yeah the crowd loves it if people are laughing like ok how long you been doing it you ask him like alright yeah how'd you start it and fucking you mean for a comic man if you got a good solid minute if you actually can do it it's an amazing thing for you for sure you could literally get a career started enrolling from doing kill Tony with one minute they have I mean we've had so many people start on kill Tony literally start there it's amazing but it's also it's like it's a cool way for everyone else to see what it's like when someone's either just doing it for the first time or just I mean most people never been to an open mic night right you know they might see your special online or they might see someone else's special online oh that's what a comic looks like I don't know how to do that but then we watch an open mic night especially kill Tony there's at least how many people to get up in an episode about eight okay at least three are fucking atrocious yeah atrocious at least three yeah well you're just like holy shit luckily they're only doing 60 seconds and that's what makes it fun no that's mix and we I do this poll sometimes especially on the road shows we're here at some point in the episode I'll go how many out there like to like it when comedians do good on this show the crowd always goes like woo and then I always go how many you like it when comedians do bad on this show and the place notoriously and the cooler the city the louder that roar is like I specifically remember Sydney Australia was a big one like they couldn't believe we were there and they're part of this thing where they get to hear you know yeah and then yeah Sydney guys get to go up too and girls right and here's the other thing that makes it fun like both ways it's great like if the comic does great it's great everybody laughs but if they bum there's professional comics ready to talk shit about it yeah which is maybe even better and if they bomb you know the interview lasts longer than their set that's only 60 seconds the interview can last up to I've spent up to if somebody's super interesting I'll spend 15 20 minutes with them then were just about their life there just a guest on a podcast that's interesting do people get mad look fucker was waiting now they know my fucking laser-sharp 60 seconds yeah they know what's up they know that yeah cuz I'll only I'll only keep someone up there if it's super compelling we had this guy pulled out of a bucket two weeks ago that just came knock came down with but has Lou Gehrig's disease I missed one comedy for twenty years and now he's like come back to it and he's you know he's he's got it uh I don't know what the word is pretty readmission no the opposite of that Oh bad yeah he's got a strong case of it and but he's utilizing it and he's murdering and it's a perfect format for Michael Lehrer le H R er something like that I'm pretty sure that's his name and so at the end of his set at the end of this amazing compelling interview I invite him back to come back the next week so last night or Monday night we had him back on and I get nervous when I do things like this cuz I'm like man I hope they have another minute I hope this interview goes as good as it does last time because now I don't want to feel bad for them and mance mashing there he is right there he doesn't want to come up on this stage cuz somebody would have to carry him and his his entire body would jolt if he leaves the chair he said that's last week someone hit him he's wearing the UFC fight gear he can't really tell from this angle but he's wearing the UFC intro you know what I mean just the normal warm-up gear and he's he said it's because last week guys were hitting on his on his girlfriend slash nurse that comes with them she's like he wanted to let these motherfuckers know what's my gear he's been doing stand-up for 20 years he's been doing comedy for 20 years he started in Chicago at Second City and I think he's only been doing stand-up like four or five but now he's really leaning in to he's utilizing this Lou Gehrig's disease this ALS that really has a grass bottom but he's really leaning into it he's talking about how he has sex with his girlfriend but he can't do it any style of and on his back and like all this stuff you got it Sam I don't wanna die I'm not givin any of it any justice Garrett's disease is incurable right yeah yeah we have another girl from we found we did a show in in North Carolina we pulled the name out of a bucket she gets carried up by these people a wheelchair comes in behind her they sit her down she was 16 years old Caroline Smith I believe is her name and this she was 16 at the time and she is a murder she will be absolutely known by the world I think hers is um is cerebral palsy like I'm pretty again a pretty pretty strong case of it and we had her we do this thing called kill Tony mania where we have some you know it's just a big hoopla where I take a big ban of people from down here up there every year in San Fran and she wanted to fly out so she hit me up she's like hey I'm coming out on the cash in on my golden ticket which is something that people on the road can win where you can show up to any kill Tony after the only six people in the world I've ever wanted but if you get the golden ticket that means that you killed so hard and your interview was so great you're so interesting that you get to show up at any kill Tony and do a minute wherever it's happening wow that's a good dude that's a good idea yeah so she cashed in she goes I'm gonna meet you in San Francisco I'm gonna be and I go okay we'll keep it a secret blah blah blah she's coming in with their family this and that and that's another one where it's like man when I wasn't nervous at all until right beforehand and I'm like oh boy here we go this is a lot of pressure for who's now a 17 or 18 year old girl I'm talking about a murder the last thing she said to me was the last thing I said to her she said to me after I said goodbye that night she's literally like I just can't wait until August 21st 2023 when I get to finally come to the Comedy Store and you know show these motherfuckers what's up I'm just like wow so real comedian from Raleigh North Carolina Wow it's so exciting the people that we get to find doing that show it's just well tonight I love one of the best things for like amateur comedians ever like literally or you know the word amateurs weird right starting out right beginning comedians ever yeah and you know just people that are really good at it preacher Lawson we had right out of there you know drew Lynch these guys all went on to like win or place high on America's Got Talent these shows where they're sifting through everything to find talented people these are all guys that we were told that we were telling you know our monsters five six years ago there's such a great I did do on the road to how long you guys been doing that now years yeah yeah yeah we've been taking it on the road actually it's been six and a half years we're going back to Columbus tomorrow night have here you were doing them on the road that yeah well we started in at the store we almost immediately were doing him we did one in Columbus almost immediately after that uh-oh see I thought you maybe did like very rarely on the road until recently recently just ramped it up we've really we really ramped it internationally yeah we basically like doubled the amount of episodes that we've been doing and by doing them on the road but we're going back to Columbus tomorrow which was the first place we ever went with it and it's been a long time coming this like return to Ohio and we're playing the Newport Music Hall we're done the house English did that place I think I did that place at one point Tom Newport music all that's an old place right yeah the southern theatre I did when I was there that place had Mae West and WC Fields had performed there I know I was like whoa it's a big one for us so cuz I'm from of course I'm originally from Youngstown spent some time in working and going to school in Columbus and read bands from Columbus so it's a big hoopla and young Jamie that's right so from Columbia yes and the Illuminati and the military-industrial complex and the underground bases with the aliens Columbus Ohio dude so it's a hub to help for unusual things that's right the Wright brothers yeah just Ohio in general lot of crazy shits come out of Ohio Sun yeah I'm doing boom-boom Mancini x' podcast on uh when I get the young shot the Friday first thing I do when I get in a Youngstown it's so surreal I don't even have any time to do it really because I have one day in town to visit my mother who's in a different place than my father and my sister and my nephews and literally like boom boom hit me up he's like any chance they're gonna be in Youngstown just messaged me it's so surreal Mancini messaging you so surreal if he tries to fuck you hahaha I don't think you would let me tell you hit me doing me I'm just joking I'm a comedian sir I would have said it about a brother was it about Toni's brother let me just tell you that like you boom if you're from Youngstown and boom boom hits you up and invites you to do his podcast you she was wrong you tell your mom and your dad that you're busy for an hour that's what he was doing Fox pay-per-view commentary real recently I think it was for the DOS for the Deontay Wilder Luis Ortiz fight like he does commentary he works as an analyst you know he sits at the desk he's not doing the ringside commentary but he sits as a desk he's a class act great guy and when where how where I grew up and how I grew up you're you're taught that that's I my mother spoke when my mother and father spoke more highly of him than they did basically of God himself like boom boom Mancini in Youngstown when I was growing up there was it that's what you want to be that's what you got to do yeah that was a town that was synonymous with ray Mancini he said Youngstown Ohio people go boom boom Mancini yeah especially guys like my age because when I was young we used to watch him on ABC Wide World of Sports we used to watch him on TV like there was like a big big way that you would watch fights and watch him on television back then I'm pretty sure boom-boom thought Alexis Arguello yeah he did yeah unbelievable on a thing pretty sure he fought him on ABC those fights going back and watching them now it's just absolutely insane watching these guys were hitting the hell out of each other almost a totally almost different evolved sport right so much more defense I feel like now today I think think depends who you're watching fine yeah I mean if you watching Deontay Wilder it's people getting merked you know if you watch in Terence Budd Crawford it's someone intelligently picking somebody apart and smashing them this there's super high level boxers today man oh yeah for sure I'm just like him I'm thinking more I think the accumulation of punch especially since it was 15 rounds well you know he'd stop being 15 rounds because of ray Mancini and Duk COO Kim that was the fight that that really was one of the major catalyst for them reducing it to 12 rounds there's a good argument they should reduce it even further some people think it would be better if all fights for five rounds like like a world kickboxing fight and that guys are just also fight harder it would just go after each other for five rounds it would definitely be more entertaining I wonder man you know it's like you want to see a good fight but do you want to see guys sort of pace themselves to try to fight 12 rounds or do you want to see guys go ham for six rounds like what's better I don't know it's a good argument you know the best argument that I ever heard about about fights is the one where Frost hobby was talking about the other day and I agree with him 100% like why do you have a time limit just like start the fight let's see what happens like let people figure out when to when to expend their energy like why is it breaks why it breaks you should I mean if if we had it like the early days of the UFC then you would really understand all the nuances of comedy you you really can't sprint because if you if you hurt someone you don't take them out you're gonna get exhausted you blew all your energy out and the fight goes on forever it's it goes on until somebody wins that's when you really find out what fighting is but if you're gonna have boxing like boxing those rounds like three minutes three minute rounds is with just your hands you can get a lot of action in there if you made that up to five six rounds but I don't know I mean it's nothing wrong like this is also a great thing seeing someone slowly figure somebody out over five six rounds and and start working them in the seventh eighth ninth and tenth and get a knockout in the eleventh or something like that it's it's always interesting to see someone break someone's style down figure them out impose their will and then also see their conditioning as the fight goes on their superior conditioning play out there's some guys that just fucking don't get tired man those are the ones that I love especially in UFC yeah Nate Colby Yoanna these people he's a big one yeah hoping to spawn this weekend that's a big one that's a big one with two guys with enormous gas tanks what a fascinating fight that is to me because people want to pretend Colby can't fight right when someone's a bad guy that it sways everything in there reasonable rational mind it's so crazy watching what he did to Robbie Lawler make someone so undeniable that it's ridiculous meanwhile still in the aisle there in less denial though than they would be there in less than I than there would be it's a real problem he's a real problem because that style of shit-talking is infuriating yeah and you can't say a goddamn thing to him cuz he's in a character so if he pisses you off you say something back to him yeah I want you go suck Trump's dick you be like I would mr. Trump's good man but his dick tastes like lollipops he was he could say whatever he wants Colby gets it man listen he gets it he's full Rick old-school Ric Flair with a new style twist and it's a real fighter man he's a real fighter he's absolutely one of the best welterweights in the world and this is a very very close fight but kymaro loose bond is he's a tank of a man he's spectacular athlete he's got big power I mean he only has I think a couple knockouts in his career but it's because he's learned how to kickbox after he learned how to wrestle he was an elite wrestler but he does put people away and he hurt tyron woodley and he beat him standing and Tyron is a fan I don't think Tyron was at his best in that fight I think there's some issues that Tyron had but it doesn't take anything away from you on who spots been running through competition he has one loss in his career 15 win and then while he talked about the loss on the podcast he just got caught a rear naked choke a tapped made a mistake it happens didn't know jiu-jitsu that well but as an elite wrestler who's transitioned to become a world-class mixed martial arts fighter you don't get much better he was scared or he was scary rather everybody was scared of him nobody wanted to fight him everybody was ducking him for the law you never heard anybody call out Kamara loose mama he's running through competition everybody was like you know what this fucking guy and that fighter they get to lose like he's uh he seems like a nice guy I don't want to fight him Colby's my favorite thing to watch right now I think he's just a he's just so he I think he really gets so many aspects of the basic part of this sport endurance learn train and be entertaining dude if you see his new suit know he's got an orange one no and he brings that Donald Trump jr. book everywhere he goes I love it he's got an orange suit just as gross as the blue one it is goddamn hilarious he's there's photos of him at the press conference with the orange suit bro he is look at that look at his orange suit it looks like it cost less than the blue suit I didn't think that was possible it's got a pen he's a fucking genius listen that this guy let me mark my words when this guy is done fighting he will be a huge pro wrestling star okay fucking huge and he might do it quick how about that he if he wins if that guy wins and maybe he fights Maz Badal maybe fights one more time he goes right into pro wrestling hey any man cha-ching and what's crazy is that I've been pitching we do a wrestling podcast at the Comedy Store and I've been pitching for years now City the press coverage reading Donald Trump Ginger's book and I've been pitching for years that the WWE is missing out on having this pro-trump super bad guy character and then Colby comes out of nowhere and does it in real life in the UFC and they still haven't done it in WWE and you can't call him a joke cuz he smashes Robbie Lawler smashes Hoff he'll dos Anjos you watch him fight like oh my god this guy's a fucking beast a record-setting performance against Robbie Lawler 500 some punches landed not just that he mostly beat him standing up yeah it was mostly a stand up fight and he is the the guy that you thought it was the wrestler and Robbie's the elite strikers a former world champion and Colby ran him over it wasn't even a close fight and all this promo stuff that he does how good he is at that it's cuz he it's he wants to be it's because he's a learner he came in saw me perform at UH at the improv in in Florida in West Palm Beach and afterwards we were in the green room and he's like you know I learned a lot about timing and beats from watching you up there tonight I don't know you know what I mean how you'd get these laughs using your timing and your pauses in this I need to do more of that like yeah yeah so cool to watch a guy that's you know wow he being on top of a big business a lot of yeah I feel like a lot of people you know their egos this and that or it's just about the foot game you know no right but it's a genius pursuit and you know he has openly now said it we talked about on the podcast be saying it now I did on the Candace own show he's like they were gonna cut him they're gonna cut him they told him that his style wasn't fan-friendly and so he beats Damien mine and Brazil and calls him a bunch of filthy animals everybody goes crazy and I go hold on a second we might have something here so he talked about it on the podcast like look I got to do something my career is in jeopardy like I'm gonna create a character so he created his character like I've called his fights before I call his fights early in his career before that he was just a really tough guy who had a great gas tank who I knew from my friend cam Haynes he trains with campaigns right so just imagine the kind of gas tank this motherfucker must have if you do anything with cam Haynes you have to have a crazy gas tank well that's the scary thing about him right it's almost like again it's like a pro wrestling character already it's like oh you don't know right even if if you don't if you don't somehow find a way to finish it you're stuck in rounds four and five now it's always gonna be championship rounds now with this guy and you're gonna be stuck in there with him yeah if you can't take him out in one two or three and you can't maintain that pace and if you try to take him out and you emptied your gas tank he never empties his gas tank right and the thing is about his style this thing that he's doing not a style but his a promotion style with the cheap suits in the fucking book you think it's a joke yeah but then he watches fights if you didn't have any information about him in his character and you just watch his fights he'd be like fuck man this guy's driven this guy's fuckin driven yeah but then you add into that this character and then everybody's pretending you know that all that guy's a joke that guy's a joke that joke he's running over everybody everybody just because you don't like Trump and this is like it's a genius thing to attach himself to Trump right and what's interesting is like even fighters that maybe have paid more dues and are maybe are more respected like if you put them all at the table like when we were behind when we were backstage at MSG and the rocks there and Dana's got the new BMF belt and all this stuff's happening they were doing that press conference for this one a max Holloway is on one end and they have these guys on another and being backstage sometimes is a blessing because you can hear things that maybe you wouldn't notice if you're out front right and the roars and the cheers and the hoopla and everything was every time he talked you we had a good time just sitting there watching it from the sidelines he's great it's a it's a we're seeing is a masterclass in promotion and adaptation he adapted he created this character and this character is it's so obviously a character but it doesn't matter yeah it doesn't matter I mean so obvious I'm wearing that suit on purpose like it thinks it's good-looking no he's trying to be a dork he's trying to be a pro-trump dork like if I was Trump I'd be a little annoyed yeah I'd like hey man hahaha I see what the fuck you're doing you you're making yourself a very goofy support me please tell me you're following Colby on Instagram right of course I know the best the videos with the girls we just comes out with his hands on their butts hey losers it's wrestling and super high level pro wrestling like like promos three shoot look at this he's gonna Trump a Todd's data for the Trump Towers it's and the style even matches it too right cuz like he was just a quick round one knockout artist almost like you know sort of like McGregor esque right I still don't think it works as well as a guy that has a never ending gas tank never ending gas tank and and can take it tremendous shock to him he's a nightmare for everybody in the division Kolby Covington is a fucking nightmare because he seems like he's playing he's doing these promos with all these girls in bikinis so fucking Reid and Donald Trump Jr's book he's making it seem like he's a goof and you don't notice along the way that this guy stomping world-class fighters I mean stomping them yeah he's fucking amazing when he's done is it's like a master class and promotion for all the young fighters coming up I don't necessarily think everybody should do what he's doing right and you know but if I was in if I was in his camp I was one of his friends I would for sure be cheering it on think it's hilarious it's hilarious and everybody's mad at him everybody in it and it goes two ways right like even the people that are mad at him are still sort of laughing and you can usually catch them laughing while booing in between booing that's why the suit is so genius yeah so he didn't have to do the suit the suit is duh the fucking piece today is his dolls because why else would he wear that fucking suit that's here's what here's what's genius about the suit it's terrible it is literally one of the suits from Dumb and Dumber that orange suit is the one Jeff Daniels or Jim Carrey one of them has almost yeah close enough but they're gross that's the point it's like he's doing that on purpose he's got money he's a fucking he's fighting for the title he's made money right it almost says no go back to Coco's like the two suits that he he doesn't have that student in the oh it's just the recent one the blue one he doesn't have the orange one his Instagram he's slippin he's only got the blue one it's so funny but here's the thing that at the end of the day tomorrow lucemon is a nightmare for every fucking living human being that's 170 pounds go back to that real quick do that tomorrow man is a nightmare for every living human that's 170 pounds and if I wanted to see him fight a guy that I thought presented a bunch of unique challenges I would say Colby because Colby has a great wrestling pedigree it's fantastic takedown defense he can wrestle his ass off his cardio is never-ending we saw on the Robbie Lawler fight he puts pressure on you lands ridiculous strikes can stand in there against one of the elite strikers ever in the welterweight division in Robbie Lawler so like forget all the Trump bullshit forget all the the character bullshit and he almost should have a name for that guy that but that put that aside just stylistically stylistically it's one of the best matchups you're ever gonna find for us Mon because you want to see whether or not you smile can catch him and hurt him you're gonna see whether or not Colby can can outmaneuver him and outpace him you gotta see whether or not Colby could put that kind of pressure on him the way he put it on Robbie and you're gonna see cuz you know whose mom watched that fight for sure and I think Robbie was training out of American Top Team initially and then left American Top Team to go somewhere else you'd have to change that I'm positive with this Robbie left American Top Team so that was another thing that Colby was like shitting on him for leaving American Top Team and you know gotten Robbie's had a little bit from that like was really ruthless about it but tomorrow Iseman came from the black zillions which was the rival team across town and now he's with Henry hoofed and I don't know what camp they're calling the camp now they changed it what is a find out what camp kymaro spawns out of it's essentially Henry hoofed and all the other but Henry hoofed is the kickboxing guy who's with the black black zillions but it's either way he's got Michael Chandler there the showing videos of him chandler training this like Luke Rockhold was their super high level guys there so it's two phenomenal camps like everything lines up perfect you got this guy in ooo spawn it has just been steam rolling everybody you got a guy in Colby steamrolling everybody what do you got doesn't say anyway I know he's with hmm I know he's with Henry Hooft who's one of the best kickboxing coaches kickboxing instructors in all of MMA he's just phenomenal it's just a great fight man it's just a great fight everything about it's great everything about it's great that's crazy once you girl you want to fight him her next one is hey did they announce it for January I feel like I know it but I don't I think she's fighting Wei Lee Zhang I think she's fighting for the title son did they announce it yeah April fight maybe ha April oh that that would be in new york new york big city of dreams but everything in new york ain't always wouldn't see is that what it says it doesn't say it's uh Zhang Wei Ling you have to say it backwards now for a while we're saying Wei Li Zhong but now it's Zhang Wei lean over time yeah I'm pretty sure she's fine I thought we'd found it I don't know if they announced it pretty sure they did maybe I just know ship shit I do work for them bro okay well you let me let me know the date as soon as you know so they go on course I don't mean I don't miss you on why you did miss one you know when I started missing you wanna fights as when losing yeah do you think that's what it is it's like you not being there you know for a fact that sort of energy absolutely she waiting some there is it sexual or is it just powerful both what kind of weight kind of energy you putting out there big dick energy I mean yeah the only kind of energy I got bro what else is up on this card when you want to come to a UFC again you want to go that one in April yeah come to Brooklyn absolutely so max Halloween volca now skis very interesting very very very interesting cuz Vulcan Oskie is a tank of a man he has a phenomenal gas tank he puts people away he puts tremendous pressure on guys but smacks hallways the goat it happens the goat he's the greatest featherweight of all time and Vulcan now ski they have a common opponent in Joe's a Aldo Vulcan all ski just he beat Aldo smothered them beat him by decision max always destroyed them max max always destroyed although twice and Aldo is another goat I mean all those one of the greatest featherweights of all time and yeah and now all those fighting Marlin arises his first fight at bantamweight people are very concerned that's up he know down one tall going down and went 235 son you know looks terrible yeah that's no bueno see what he looks like is he Aldo looks gaunt preparing for 135 there's photos of him wandering around you know his shirt off and stuff we get a check I shouldn't say wandering around the scene you know hanging around and you see what he looks like yeah this is the photos from his Instagram did he super super skinny girl skinny he looks look at that right there it's crazy so he did it slowly they look how skinny is man the thing about it though is that he did it slowly so he lost the weight on purpose slowly over a long period of time instead of just dehydrating the fuck out of himself and dropping down you know from 165 to 135 what he did was drop his body weight pretty significantly he looks quite a bit thinner than they used before so he prepared for it over the long haul and got accustomed to being a lighter person if you're gonna do that that's the way to do that yeah the difference between dehydrating the shit out of yourself and just losing weight but even at 135 there I'm in a wonder you can take a hard punch to the head it's just easier to go out maybe but maybe not because he's doing it correctly so he's not gonna be dehydrated like TJ Dillashaw was the big example of where when someone goes too far you know when he went down to 125 pounds he looked like death he looked terrible yeah and Brendan actually called it sob called that he was saying I bet he took cuz TJ got busted for EPO he was I bet he took it because he couldn't train I bet he was too exhausted to train and that's pretty much what said he just didn't have any energy it was much harder than they thought physically on him you're basically starving to death right right if you're you drop it down TJ probably walks around the 160s or something and then he's getting down to 45 that's rough 35 is rough pace to do it in high school wrestling the thing I remember the most is having trouble not swallowing the toothpaste and then water in my mouth while brushing my teeth for those things you literally when it hits your tongue your body naturally wants to see ya it'll it wants anything it starts the process itself so you TJ to look thick like a Snickers there yeah thicker than a snicker he's probably in that picture he's probably in the high 50s no look at me looks like looks like Christian Bale's Dick Cheney and that so ridiculous please with Archuleta rampage Raymond Daniels who's a world world champion kickboxer that Louie Anderson in the middle there you son of a bitch son of a bitch I think that's rampage this guy I don't know what that is but what I'm saying that the weight cutting like the feraldo just seems like wolf makes me scared yeah and then you'll arm what else is on the card Amanda Nunez is fighting Germaine Duran to me this is a fight that people are not talking about this is a very interesting fight because Germaine Duran to me she's lost a couple of times let's just lost three times in MMA she got submitted earlier on in her career but she's much better now at takedown defense but as a fighter like guys a kickboxer she's a multiple time world champion kickboxer super legit striker we played a video yesterday have heard knocking out a man she had a boxing match just boxing with a man and fucking flat lined him with a punch she's a beast man yeah I don't I don't ever I will never doubt Nunez never or in a minute that's the goat yeah that's the number-one woman of all time without a doubt without a doubt a monster and you know what man even other support like if she went up to boxing like I mean Claressa Shields is a bigger woman and Claressa fights at 165 and she's better with her hands I mean Clarissa is a fantastic boxer you ever watch her her her videos of her training and fighting Amanda no Claressa Shields Claressa Shields is someone who trained a little bit with cyborg there was some like heavy-duty sparring with her in cyborg leading up to some of cyborgs fight she's as big a cyborg she's big but all natural you know and it that which she might be too big for Amanda she's like 20 pounds larger at 45 I think she's a 65 pound champion but like Amanda fought someone who couldn't punch like that if she fought someone that was just like a really good boxer that's a woman that's also 135 pounds bro she might put him on the moon the lady could punch so hard and she can box like she might not be boxing like a world champion boxer because she's adding in takedowns and kicks and this not all these different things but when you just come to a woman throwing bombs with her hands she knows how to hit you on the fucking chin and her power is extraordinary like Amanda Nunez power is extraordinary her fights with cyber or fight with cyborg rather those knockdowns like holy shit yeah she's standing in the pocket with a woman that no one wants a fight in fact a woman that germane to Ronda me she gave up her title she's like nah I'm good you could have it you keep that money fuck you yeah she's like I'm not fighting that lady fuck you she gave up her title she says she's never fought cyborg nope not interested who did I watch her lose to Holly Holm no you should have watch her lose to Holly Holm but they gave her the decision I thought Holly Holm won the fight and I also thought they should be taking a point away from Duran to me because their enemy cracked her twice after the bell and one of them was pretty significant she stunned her yeah I heard she hit her after the bell twice and also Holly dropped it twice Holly dropped it with a question mark kick and Holly also dropped her with straight left hand I felt like Holly did more damage I feel like those two things though those knock downs were big significant moments in the fight and she never did it to Holly and then on top of that Holly should have gotten a point because of that that punch after the bell the elbow it was like twice two different times she got struck after the bell so in my eyes Holly should have won that fight I thought she won anyway yeah I thought you won because the knockdown so I'm like you look at that these significant moments where the other fighter got rocked like that means a lot to me but when someone gets dropped with a punch like hurt that's that's a big moment like it's not counting enough in some cases people are counting like the overall around like with things are kind of even too much but there's also other good fights on that card Marlin Mariah's jr. Jose Aldo PHA Yong and Urijah Faber that's a fucking dangerous fight for Faber I think nathie SE pyaara pyaara Yan so people used to say Peter but it's obviously there's no e it's PE TR so now like it's like fate or do you know if a door and then go that's not his name his name is shield or oh yeah so everybody calls him phaidor and you're like well it's too late the return of the immortal Matt Brown nothing saunders woo now that Columbus Ohio got ready they're savages both guys Ben Saunders got sneaky ass card to first ever Alma plot to ever in the UFC that guy so it's a lot of great shit man this weekend so when you're gonna come oh that's right Jeff Neil and Mike Perry oh good that's gonna be chaos - when you come to get April yeah unless something crazy happens you wanna I don't I don't like to miss yo on and I don't like to miss a Nate Diaz yeah you need some sort of fan like a t-shirt or something like that fur so heart with you on and so oh yeah for sure oh maybe right yeah maybe a heart just a heart with Johanna we're dukes up yeah and so I tried to get one of the Yanni NJ check a warm-up jacket sent to me I have to follow up with that guy he sent me an email I think he had ordered that shit you can't ask those Reebok people though no they taught it they told me they tell what they forget I know you're right I just put out my own after party was everybody drunk no it was a it was one of the weigh-ins they're like how we want to get that for it cuz I'm like you know where I can go by because I wanted to buy it before a last fight I'm like you know where I could go buy one they're like we're not gonna let you buy one we gotta go give it to you yeah dude if you come to the fights in April you have to wear that the entire weekend for sure oh yes everywhere we go yeah okay that's on I'll wear it on stage if we do shows I'll do it I'll wear it anywhere all right let's wrap this up dude we've been having a lot of fun on the road though yeah this has been great Texas was amazing Phoenix was amazing Dallas in Houston but havin some fun man okay Jean Whaley Jean you say John Whaley now versus you wanna youngjae check targeted for UFC 248 which is Brooklyn whoa that girl's a monster two men Whaley is a beast she's so good man you know the way she took out Jessica and draw is just gonna drives a tank and she Kayode her just flatlined her to flirt beat the shit out of her in the first rounds like whoa there's only two people that have you on his number that's rose and me and on that Instagram and on the Twitter and kill Tony available on YouTube available on dreams every Monday when you porn all around everywhere Tony huh Scoob calm bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
