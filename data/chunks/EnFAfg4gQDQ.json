scared to be around us you again that's a one-time on just get the ice that's a one-time only thing you got to not do that again dude no that's how their concern released in the podcast cuz I'm

weed from the beginning of the podcast ten years ago yeah it was like weeds only been legal since two years ago Tom you laughed like crazy when you heard about it well I'm on the phone in a green room

my flights not leaving till midnight and it's like seven o'clock I can't be in there I can't be around them it's my time like talking fucking quick I have big ideas and so then I go to the store wait how good was the shower shower was pretty amazing yeah sure was pretty captain nine Molly's not fucking amazing it's not worth it my thumbnails not worth it at all and but then we went to the store well you did and I just had now I just had to sell I needed to be somewhere and I did couldn't just what if they wait at the airport yeah so the only place a 5:30 yeah sore so I sat at the store for like an hour drinking Comedy Store yeah how many stores so you went on Molly to the comedy store yeah I just went there to hang out in the back room he came in all angry like oh you and then David Spade was there and he loves celebrities like what happens like all right it's fun story let me tell you I did was killing in the greenroom you're at catalyze killing and it destroyed on stage so you were high on Molly on stage no no I know that told her about getting Oh what do I got to do with it yeah lay in my tour bus Donna thermos that's good you should do that if you get raped what if that's what's that's the new machine its I won't I won't be hey man why so negative because I it's amazing I go maybe that's your new thing instead of like taking shirt off people just spiked your drink oh my god now you cannot you can't accept drink from any what's a one-time-only thing fucking fans it's over that's my dance you have to apologize that is a one-time thing either said I'm sorry I'm gonna had a great time with you but I'm sorry had to come to me doing it behind your back cut that fucking thing off your wrist but but I'm glad we did it was so much fun at some point he just goes he was like starting to get angry there goes oh you're high so great let me see how highs everybody was on just a smidge yeah just a smidge of moly all the time probably a lot more empathetic world even give him full dose the best is he goes ice we were in the store and I'm talking to Tony inch glove and I go he wouldn't ever have done it to anyone else he only would have done it to me and he goes that's not true that's not true I said would you do this Rogen he goes a hundred percent it was all yes no no you and Joe at his house you wouldn't spiked his drink and then go hey man if he forced me into a thing where I had to give up things I loved for a month but yeah he would have got it so he is it has been mad at you and I I'm probably the only one here besides him that listens to his podcast Ari gets fucking furious at you Burt for this so mad so mad he got so mad he's a Julie thing he drink just as much after October as before I never curbed anything what are we still doing this for he's got a point that their whole reason why we did in the first place was to try to sober you up we didn't we didn't think be able to do it he had no problem at all so are we announcing that on the first of October we're done with this shit listen no one has a problem here except Bert I like a glass of wine with with dinner maybe two isn't like that shot I like a shot of whiskey before I go on stage that's nice too maybe occasionally I like a beer while I'm on stage watching the game guys I'm not a drinker in the sense of I don't get drunk yeah yeah if I get drunk once a month it's a crazy month like drunk and it's usually somewhere whether I'm like with you guys or something and we're just maybe a podcast we're just we just start doing drinks yeah you just get like I've always wondered that you just get like a buzz a buzz yeah you're fine and I stop yeah tonight I work out too much I'm too healthy um I you know I'm getting up in the morning most mornings I'm either doing yoga or I'm running or I'm lifting weights and doing cardio I just I can't take the beating beat in the end at 52 it's not fun you know the beating on your body of alcohol yeah you have the beating of the you know as you get older it's harder to recover from things hard to recover from workouts harder to get back into shape but if you stay in shape so that's the whole thing is like staying in shape if you stay in shape and take care of your body you can get you can get a lot more life out of your body than most people think right it's inevitable that your body's gonna fall apart and whether my body falls apart at 60 or 70 whatever the fuck of the year is gonna be it's going to happen but right now works great so my thought is right now I'm not gonna fuck it up I do a little bit of booze I like a little bit but I can recover from a little bit no problem sure and there's a lot of studies that show that like a little bit of wine in particular glass of one or two is actually there's some benefits to it there's actually some health benefits but didn't but also us pushing this month be you know has become more about the like the camaraderie and the challenge aspect and not really about needing sobriety right what he needs it though stop no problem at all quitting I've no problem you're correct and then he does because he's spiking people's drink to get back at him because they won't let him drink well he's just angry at you because he likes to drink in October and he actually doesn't have a problem and I like to do drugs yeah I don't leave a do drugs for you this is nice right here in this box I got mushrooms I got acid we can get partying we can get partying you guys we can get crazy how about we disturb October except for acid so you can nibble on acid the whole month for mushrooms we can micro dosed I would not for me I would just be like hey can we just do edibles all month but you stay away from everything else one drug on like my you know yeah what I like I like a couple of pumps of the old THC spray that's good just two pumps yeah everything's the sky's brighter I love a post post show like low Milich dosage I love that and then walk around afterwards I'm like a mild buzz yes like to get high before you go onstage I hate it make you too many that was the worst experience my life he was like you did the only thing that I've learned from actually from other comics doing and not like all the time and saying like I brought Jeff Tate with me and he gets highest thought is that he after a while that panic thing just dissipates and then he's in the pocket right like in the zone yes high up there I could see that being fun too yeah but I don't know I have I I prefer after show you know it's dangerous for me the first weekend after sober October because my brother is clean yes you cram the fucking weed hits you so hard so you're on stage going okay what am I even talking about yeah it's gonna it's gonna wreck you again November 1st yeah I'm gonna be in Europe for that oh yeah we're gonna be mark I'll be in London that day and the next day I go to Dublin Dublin they're gonna get you fucked up ya know you're here at bombs we're doing it though right oh we stay well I mean there's no bark on that table right there that's whisky I'm not gonna be one to bring the bell no he's not gonna do it listen not everybody could be a seal yeah okay some people about lorry just looks pretty well always wants to ring the bell girls so wait why do you want to continue this what are you why do you keep like this the same reason why he went back to his phone he wants to see if he could handle the cell phone you know your handle the month right can handle the self sobriety I can handle it but I won't enjoy it as much going to Yankees games and party we kept thinking like oh I won't drank by mail just doing edible or something it's not the worst and this hold your breath tea almost blackout and then catch your breath again they keep doing this through the whole game or make it interesting real interesting or just green light people Molly and you and then it's like you didn't do it that's why I green light people giving you acid correct you've you've absolutely not that I'm a big drinker you have ruined me accepting a drink from I would get scared leaving my drink around yeah yeah yeah a lot of girls men when they go to bars they get scared taking a drink from a man and they sure yeah they should how many people do you know that have been drugged and I know a couple yeah I know a bunch of girls I know at least three or four girls that have like said something happened I gotta get out of here and they tell their friends and then creepy guys like like predators are moving close like hey she's fine I knew that whiskey tasted weird what'd you do a shot was it in a shot a shot yeah are you tasting yes I did taste it you know it you know it's so funny I walked in and re was he looked like dr. Jekyll like he was doing something I know what he doing he was like I'm making a shot so I went okay just my back thing he was like two shots of scotch I have the vibe me to getting Molly on my phone put it on Instagram I'm him Molly me I keep like forgetting about it and then I keep I know you're a fucking psycho and then I can I try to put myself in like in the mind frame of how upset I would be well what would you have done if bird had a stroke okay good question you got to bury the footage you can't have that footage our thing so yeah you got to get in his phone you got to get what Evers babe recorder how do you know what his password is you got to figure out it just stick it up to his face give that face ID yeah half of its gonna be limping switching and you know wipe the foam away wake it up yeah wait up I need I need your help thank you okay delete delete yeah I get everything out of there now you feel terrible man I feel terrible yeah for sure for sure I don't know why we're talking about that though because that never happened so we're sticking the now which was you had a new appreciation of your family friends you do realize that last year was kind of like the idea of being sober part of it was for you last year two years ago two years ago well two years ago was the weight loss thing was like hurt can you not drink yeah right but I was yeah that was for you though by the way I didn't think I didn't think I'd be able to do it and I will say that at the time I was drinking so fucking much and I didn't I was unaware of how much I was drinking that's it and when you guys said that in here I went I kind of like woke me up and I was like fuck I really I'm drinking tito's by myself at night I just like to go to bed and it was a great way to cut my drinking cuz you guys made it camaraderie asked and so I didn't feel like all eyes were on me and I did it and it did change the way I drink it a hundred percent changes where a drink that lasts your strap that's gonna it shows you how much you sleep it's really sobering because you can't lie yeah like you look at he go for hours and 30 minutes right like is it sent me the sent me a notification like like you should should try to get this like he was late and I'm watching TV and it's like go sleep you should go to bitch where's mine I gotta put it on it's out there go grab it it's by the pool table yeah yeah yeah set it up what um but yeah and then last year was last year was more about the competition yes sobriety was like a side thought last year got crazy it's too insensitive he decided to not do that this year we gotta I can't yeah well it's just the competition was too absorbing too much time and it's just fuck it was hard it was a lot it was really hard it was so hard you need drive to make you work out huh well that's one way of doing it but I don't think that way hey hey be careful yeah don't just stab you're no good up here by trying to be angry on the Molly but also going like fuck this is gonna be a great podcast god damn it put it by your right have you gone back and listened to it it kind of made me ass upset really yeah cuz I I see I can see me panicking mmm I can see me going like all I said was fuck are you why would you do that like I'm on blood pressure medicine like we know a guy who had a stroke because he took viagra right and it counteracted with this thing and now he can't use his left arm right so I'm just sitting there going one of my biggest fears when that doctor told me I needed to lose weight was what if I have a stroke and then I just can't work out and be active like what if it was that's taken away from me I can't throw the ball with the girls I can't go bike riding because the left side of my body doesn't work yeah and and I am despite what anyone thinks I am active and I like working out I like being outside I like running that's what scared the shit out of me and that's why I started losing weight I gotta be honest with you thank God I lost that weight B and when he did that because if he had done that when I was 258 that could have been you'd be done and I had done the hot spin for a whole month and and been really healthy for a whole month I was like I literally in the podcast I go okay my EKG was fine my I'm on bum on blood took baby aspirin today that's gonna help I was like okay and I was going through the checklist to try to calm myself down but thank God I lost that wakes I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't lost that weight and he'd get Molly me yeah it's gonna take you a second to figure out the other side of it okay yeah yeah that's not cool already don't do that again yeah okay all right now we know never know but he he was angry that you lost all this weight for the weight loss challenge and then you got really healthy during sober October but then you got bigger than ever and that shit what smile I said pop it up and I couldn't pop it over I had a hard time popping it open to my bro I broke it when I fell we'll do this after the podcast story yeah there you go there you go Wow Jesus Christ I'm sorry sorry if anybody identifies what that word say I do closes like that so put your wrist through it put it on your left wrist or right wrist over the top like a watch and then clamp it down there you go now push that thing over the top lock it in place snap it snap it down there you had it you had it the right way there it is this is this is a riveting block so bad we're fine fine that's gonna show you a lot I I started wearing mine quite a long time ago start wearing mine a couple of months ago so you got you guys haul one out of sub rocktober sure would be lovely you want out that's what you sound like that your look I'm trying to get you guys to quit sounds like you brought the ring the bell I couldn't I got over four years I was thinking about going sober forever after October actually oh really special definitely when you'd say bloodshot November your shirt on forever - how about that no yeah get jacked what have you getting really good shame and you owe me in the briar patch what if you did like so but if you gotta take your shirt off yeah but it won't look good I don't QB shit but if you if you take your shirt off on stage and you have a 6-pack people gonna get angry with you they're not gonna think it's funny okay the reason why it's funny is because you're overweight and you're a party guy you take your shirt off everybody's laughing no I don't think I think I take my shirt off and I don't think people look at my body throughout the rest of my set I'm not making jokes like look at look at these titties you know I'm just up there doing stand-up what are they looking at yeah yeah yeah they're looking at me yeah come on stairs are the things you take your shirt off yeah I like taking my shirt off I understand but if you but if you got skinny would you still take your shirt off that's what I'm saying yeah I like to be gentle six-pack no if you had a six-pack you couldn't do it dude I'll do whatever the fuck I want no no I agree at you and he's taken out on us give me that thing again you don't know the fuck you doing he's angry no way if you had a six-pack you can't take your shirt off well you're doing a great body yeah you can but first no I know but is that one really a thing we're talking about like starts getting to 6-pack level yeah guys it's not gonna happen why can you do it are you gonna get a six-pack no why not because I've never had a six-pack of my entire life even when I was in high school so that's not a concern of mine of getting a six-pack now is your big chance yeah I gotta do that but I think if you stick to the sobriety and working out you're gonna be sitting up on your own in no time you know so all right should we wait what's the what are we gonna do are you back last year for a little bit we admit mid thrust I would get one mid thrust yeah Onan okay it's on right now that's how it's going okay so put your wrist through that there you go now push that outside over the top and clamp it down so it doubles up over here yep like that no choice BAM now you got download the app bro okay yeah yeah oh yeah you got a fucking phone you can actually do it I got a phone a real phone dude it's wonderful having access to it over yeah yeah you getting a fucking hernia yeah yeah I mean those the t-nut bert still upset at you look I'm upset it's red in the face no he's lost the memory of how great a time it was he's thinking about having a six-pack more than I he can take your shirt off not if you got right super jacked and ripped and looked good on stage well that's being like that would but I'd recommend you wearing a clown suit yeah if you're if you're super ripped it's knowing what's yeah you can't do that well you know does the Jamar does that who Jamar neighbors oh really god he's jacked yeah I'm super Josh super jacked Earl did Rose paddle shirtless yeah yeah that was really funny yeah yeah some suit and a gold chain on he was ripped tomorrow so Isan a stage does he it was grow up with like chicken or something species Nazis talker Chappelle jacked and was wearing tank tops and I think yes I looked I don't think it stopped anything it's even better no apps are different animal that shirtless though yeah he got yoked like the whole thing back in the day was if you have muscles you can't be a comedian right let's go go got muscles and everyone's like always no longer funny right and now you looking almost all the comedians are like work out work out and yeah when I was starting out I used to wear big baggy shirts you still good yeah but a really baggy ridiculously baggy now I just wear things that are loose yeah but you're trying to make it not a distraction right yeah yeah I want tight things onstage before it's very distracting to me even yeah that's the thing is if it's yeah it's my dad yeah if it wasn't in my own head it wouldn't matter I'm sure people don't care it's like that's half of the thing is whether or not you're comfortable onstage totally if you're uncomfortable doesn't matter what you look like yeah good smile I think like ultimately he's the most comfortable being like he's himself shirtless shirtless yeah you don't even think about it - yeah after it's off no Comedy Store the last time we did a show together I couldn't get my phone not quick enough yet shirt on before I even hit the mic yeah that's how you're taking it off you don't take it off in the or or is different short sets you don't really do sort sides it's like it's like 15 minutes of the main let me take it off yeah I mean rooms different I feel like the main room they've come and paid a ticket to see the show the ORS like people coming in out no one knows who the fuck you are yeah the main room it's like there's like coming from Canada presentation vibe in the main yeah presentation vibe you know I mean it's like it's like it is like almost like a theatrical feel it's also like seal swimming with weights when I die my Chiron I'm very uncomfortable and so I can find out what I can find out what material is working better easier okay that makes sense remember the first time you did it yeah it was in Columbus I ripped it off I used to rip it off I just get on stage rip it off and everyone's here and I've just put it back on and one time of clothes I ripped it off and I I forgot about it we started talking about something and then I was like oh sure I put my shirt on and this one goes keep it off I was like I did my whole hour was probably like nine years ago I did my whole hours shortlist how long ago there's a point nine years ago Wow yeah it was before it was before he was doing it all the time though and then and then I started doing it and I started doing it you know on the road and it was just I don't know it just made me really comfortable I sweat but I have a shirt I'll sweat you can see sweat pits in it it's annoying and I don't and it doesn't happen when I take my shirt off and I'll sweat at all I see that with you a lot lot of times when you're just like standing still yeah yeah yeah from the from the exertion you know yeah like just talking and stuff yeah are you took your shirt off on stage you liked it I do like it yeah I like having it off when I'm walking around like you're always like in the Sun for sure it feels great and it hits your skin all the time mmm people do a benefit where every we'll race I never will do shortlist and up this happen I wear a suit and almost wait so what are we settling on for this month well we do heroin heroin that we're doing heroin everybody first time I'm in what are we doing well what we decided over the phone is one one addition is we have to read 500 pages and buy read 500 pages I think we need read we don't mean audiobook redirect but I thought we're just doing these classes no we're doing the reading - that's great we should yeah the reading - yeah you read more so ten classes of something it can be hot yoga it could be jujitsu it can be spin hot spin some classes hip hop dance dance by the way how great would have hip dance been now that you saw the video I knew what you were gonna do you're gonna take your clothes off that hip hop dance video was great dance the dancing was okay it may be it was good I was so angry I got so upset why are you upset that people complimented them America's Got Talent reached out to meet Jesus Christ Oh bro do you go do you consider yourself more of a comedian or a dancer ha ha ha do you not have a Google search engine on your they don't want to bother with that they're monsters Leatherby's on Facebook when they emailed me on my website they probably have a million hyenas out there rummaging the nation trying to find people with any kind of talent so they can keep that monster alive yeah wait the other thing is we didn't we agree that within these classes they don't necessarily have to be a physical strain it's like a class of anything that's in some class this new like better yourself when I were talking about taking a tactical gun lessons I'd be great so that but I'm saying that's a lot of work out but it's still like a class and class are we better off with it than without sword fighting this year it's more about bettering ourselves one things that I think we agree to and and your wife actually reached out to me about there apparently her and Lyanna gonna get together and do it go yeah a pot they're doing a podcast so / øx oh yeah because last year was insane look I gave your wife good ammunition in this episode and the wives fuckin haters - well she didn't like seeing that part of me either yeah soon liked it yeah why - she was like your body looks better but fuckin so boring yeah bullshit listen livid when she found out that I got roof roofied because of sober October yeah she's was she was so she'll never speak to Ari again justifiably what me yeah yummy yeah Ari you're the one she'll never speak to Ari again no our door he's never allowed in our house it's so bad I and that's what was soft designed to take care of both of them yeah look I had to take care of Ari and take care of Liam why I think she's great whoa which isn't like you bro I think she's great this has been a great moms were kids with kids that's cool I'll look how you look at wonderful you say right side even though people hate you is awesome always had your back this is great and her temper anger at me is not gonna make me stop liking her so much oh that's oh wait wait where I forget yeah so within the ten classes yeah you can't do more than how many of one class three Rick yeah you can do one class three types you could technically do if you like those three - what why does that matter so you can mix it up a little bit do one thing over and over again spin class every day and be done with it as long as you can do something I mean but a little bit like if you're doing jiu-jitsu like say if you decide to do jiu-jitsu you learn it there's nothing wrong with doing six of them like that's how you get better or because if you do decide to do it you get into it you're gonna have to do more than one a week too easy to do the same shit and not challenge yourself hmm says you yeah interesting are you just making the rules up well it seems too easy they're like not that does that make sense to you this isn't with like against or will kind of like he's flipping a drug to us doesn't it I think that if we I think there should be a one other element to it is that you because there's always always been like this physical element to the whole month yeah you should do something on your own that you don't talk about til it's over that you're doing to challenge yourself like the crucible on it to like you tonight and it's not yeah like you for instance I'm gonna fall in like for instance you uh like you like to run the hills right yeah so let's say let's just say you go I've run it once a week I run it every Sunday or something right so for the month you challenge yourself on your own to do it twice a week and at the November first you like I took these classes I read these books and I ran my hills twice a week or like you know you go I wanted you know I'd do 100 pushups a day what however you want to do it that way there's a that way there's like some other physical element of you know wellness throughout the month okay so I'm you challenge yourself - yeah I don't like I think I can do this I think we're doing something back with you basically yeah kinda like let where you give up something they do decide that's right so you have four things to do if you can only do three no more than three of each one so there has to be four individual things you're doing that's right yeah yeah anyone for thanks for them total right yoga you could do spin you could do jujitsu you could do kickboxing you could do what else but yeah CrossFit so you got to do four separate things tactical we ten it's cool to do that tactical gun training yet I haven't gone there how many put bullets in it why it's really don't say that now say I'm a fucking awesome shot yeah yeah I like this I like the idea of mixing it up and I also like the idea we're not gonna go crazy this is like something see the thing about last year is like you killed all of us open-ended yeah I mean I have 1100 points one day when you're doing 80% of your max heart rate for a minute you get one point at eleven hundred points that was a nuts day finish at eleven thousand said John wick fucking bathhouse scene I watched that scene you have tee times in a row and I just wanted to kill it really yeah wouldn't stop no no I know but I felt like I was yeah mentally and physically breaking down throughout the month yeah I was getting really into it yeah that's the thing it actually it feels enormous you would feel drained but you would feel the cloud in your mind clear right yeah yeah we you know talked about the chatter yeah internal chatter gone stresses stresses like really yeah I didn't have nothing really working out like three hours back I remember saying to my wife you could get this in a pill what this is this feeling of not giving a fuck like really not giving a fuck because generally I don't give a fuck about things but man when I'm doing cardio for five hours a day yeah give a fuck yeah I really don't give a bro you don't get bothered by things by anything and the the stresses of life just really start to I didn't lose any weight though yeah you don't have any weight to lose I thought I was gonna get I am obese I thought I was gonna get at least some weight loss because of it I didn't lose a fucking pass that's a lot but what's with your body fat it's gonna be like what 7% it's probably ten around ten that's just cutting water to then I was drinking all the water but eating everything - but I think I might have even gained a pound or two I thought I was muscle not going to like I was like watching what I ate as the weak you know as the months started and then when it when I saw how competitive it was going and like how crazy were started be like six and seven days of working out yeah it was anything in insight and and I would and I was never full never know I was eating boxes of cookies yeah yeah yeah in between workouts yeah just kept eating hey the giant box of vanilla wafers ate the whole box just shoved him down my fat hole yeah drank soda like regular so yeah now I always drink tired my November was back because I was eating like that but still working out and then I just kept it in like that and yeah stopped working out that's what happened to me yeah you got shredded for a while dude yeah they told me as that bottom yeah yeah I love that body for a little bit you know you had a nice life be a dick root they told me they're like every time somebody blows out because we get you remember they had the point thing at my gym look every time everyone like it's like the next month there's such a dip and right they were like they're like and then you broke that record for like the highest total and then the biggest dip ever how long did you guys keep using the my zone thing I just to see what it was yeah like to end and fucking brought back like anxiety yeah I used it for a while and then I would not use the note take it again and then recently I lost it and they were like oh you know find it I don't want to find it yeah like I don't want it and then I did find it and I was like I'm not a sound mind when I moved and I was like don't touch it you touch it but throw it away yes fuck it like the thing they found the Exorcist when they brought it but this is more of a rapport though yeah this is giving you heart rate variability Ellen it's also telling you how much you've recovered which i think is very important yeah it's telling you like like if you do a hard work out in the next day you feel like shit it's letting you know hey your body's not recovered like it's actually giving you accurate data because it's your honor you wear it all the time to tell you the thing I don't know understand the thing oh you go to the website go to the website to explain everything but it's pretty simple 5 hours and 42 minutes Leaphart is big the only five out of an eight hours sleep yeah it really wakes you up think I got like six hours last night but the thing about it is like it's undeniable this is not like guesswork so you're six point eight hours sleep last night does it tell you what you'd get when you have sex is it like a spike well fuck bro it thinks I'm working out I'm saying hey what is it what was your activity Joe did you work out today no today I have not I'm working out this past activity day or day strain um under the strain coach ooh I'm sick 74% recovered oh well that's good there you go six yeah I got six hours and 39 minutes of sleep which is pretty deep pretty decent that's pretty good I never I never sleep like I struggle with sleep you know yeah and last night I got eight and a half hours oh dude that's a great unbelievable yeah if you can do I had a guy dr. Matthew Walker who really changed my opinion that was the sleep guy what I love is it was fascinating from the jump like he started right away he's he's excellent and he's a really great speaker too he's a professor here yes in LA - right um I don't think he's LA where's dr. Matthew Walker professor at originally from Australia his wonderful hair in the first five minutes does the importance that he's like the way he breaks out how important it directly directly the way he breaks down how important it is like it just hooks you yeah yeah I mean because he's just like it's the basically the most important thing the most important thing yeah yeah I mean and as far as like people who regular get four hours or less like how many of them get Alzheimer's it's over the fucking roof through that really yeah oh my god through the roof whatever it the charts it's off the charts yeah the numbers of people that get Alzheimer's that also have very low sleep there's a definite correlation mm-hm it's bad Bert come on bro we're gonna get you healthy this month I'm gonna sleep more yeah sleep more well that that is one thing that that straps will let you know cuz it'll hold you accountable when you look at the app and it says hey you slept for four hours last night fuckface you're gonna go yours really knows you do you take sleep aids cuz that's also bad well like yeah you shouldn't take nice with all kinds of stuff do you not all the time I just on a rotation like sometimes last night it was it was nothing I've done CBD oil I've done with melatonin I like the mouth that's all natural right yeah I've done that that helps cambium I've done that I don't like ambien unalloyed yeah I don't like it I've done xanax I'm boring really that I'm drinking right now being in weed yeah booze weed the men ambien mixed together you don't know what the fuck you're saying you're still there yeah yeah that's that's a really wild I think it's a disassociative is it whatever it is you start spewing bars annex xanax is uh talk guys you have no idea how I have to deal with this my blast drivers black and some guy comes up and he goes dude I love you racism my bus drivers like what the fuck oh my god man I've lost lost fans they're not because my friends I've lost a lot of fans what are you serious of what because I post anything with a black person in it on Instagram oh yeah and they start typing the n-word and then oh my god people that fuck yeah fuckin Tom's fans and then they fuckin in my like new people find me through Netflix and then they're like I don't even be a part of this wow so it sucks because of your mom's house it's because of I don't know it's because of a bunch of them with things but regardless the joke that I'm the most racist community in the world it's a joke again it top there's nothing you can do about it you can't stop it yeah once the internet decide something it happens but it just stinks I block them I bought I block a lot of people who say that stuff yeah it's like I'm like like there was they make some memes that are really like fucking disgust I like those 4chan type people right and you just like and you and and people don't know steeple I have fans that don't know about you guys just find me from Netflix and don't know about our friendship have a hard time believing that no for sure I was hurt I was and I were in Madison the same and I was like it'd be funny I'll just like his show started before mine and I would just like I'll just go with a broom and I sweep up and see who like goes nuts and like 12 people were like oh hey no one else when I was telling the Smalley story buddy Ari Shaffir and olive Ari I'd say it's Netflix is such a broad it's such a boring place Netflix and you know you can't like I can say Joe Rogan everywhere I have a joke you heard the other night yeah it's about you and I say Joe Rogan and everyone is your mom because you are fucking global but you get specifics like I mean I think my fans know Tom I think we share a lot of fans but I think that's because of our podcast - yeah it's like the people won't know Ari which is bizarre to me because I assumed everyone found me through this are you slipping you need a slimmer phone or a more active on social media gotta live your life still super anti-social million I'm trying it now the smartphone trying it for the month but she's gonna post you're just a lot of those are thinking of like oh how could like just you're in a moment with people and you're thinking like what can I do how can I post off and you know was it good as your self in a moment good things about Twitter well you could post pictures of your hog right yeah you can't unless Twitter's got porn on it they don't care yeah which is kind of crazy it is kind of crazy especially because they end up being like this person wrote something not nice right and there's videos I'll be scrolling through my feet and I see a video someone take it in the ass Wow alrighty but if you dead named someone it's over the ban you for life if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce you're done yeah forever do you see that rose how many times she congratulated herself for being brave she congratulated herself twice and Joe like I think it goes to show you trans people out there that if I can do this you can do anything like what if I come out of the closet in Wyoming and not get noticed yeah are you talking about of praise everybody forgets what a dummy she was yeah as dumb dude yeah yeah becomes a celebrated woman amazing it's a great hook yeah I mean it's a good book like wouldn't when they interviewer that's when you realize like oh wait a minute like you're you're not very moron yeah oh this is not oh yeah yeah you're just famous yeah you know that's it but the thing is why it's a there's no depth to any of it and then everybody conveniently forgot that she just plowed into some lady and forced her in a traffic and killed her yeah it wasn't paying attention behind the wheel this girl swept away and away I don't know how I swept away with with the whole dick because she's trans it's amazing you could tweet something a little racist like Roseanne Barr and you ruined your career we can kill someone yeah a bad thing she was also a trump supporter that was part of the earth compounded and the racist but by the way what she tweeted was not racist that lady looks like the lady from the Planet of the Apes and she did not know that that lady was african-american yeah she's a very small percentage after she looks well have you ever seen the images of her side-by-side haha dude it's like saying you don't look like a gay bear you know you hug a bear there's so many guys were gay who are bears with like nipple straps and fucking they look just like you you put them right next to that's not a bad thing yeah you look like a hot sexy character compounder I'm a muscle bear you're a bear you have to be a real brave bear to take in the putt right a bear with your feet up in the air and your asshole spread out just pulling apart that's a brave bear it's my favorite like message to get is like them to wait make you feel like what a woman must feel like all the time it's a message where guys like Saul your special hilarity love what you're doing love yourself can't wait to see it on tour and you're pretty cute okay all right that's like you know his will he ever shown you her fucking DMS No Jesus all dicks all dick dicks and guys want to jerk off on her feet they want her to jerk them off with her feet like there's something about real creeps all were in the feet there you go kind of like creeps have a sending Whitney messages for years that lady she's uh she's a fitness influencer she just got arrested she's gonna do five years in jail she sent two she had 269 different or 369 different Instagram accounts that she was using to harass people well threaten them say she's gonna cut them up what yeah yeah this one crazy she some crazy bitch from like a popular good state she's from town so she she did she also staged a fake kidnapping of her 12 year old daughter Jesus yeah she's a real piece of shit 369 to her accounts just to fuck with people and that's where the odd the fucking vibe online that's my favorite by the way it's like it's not harassment but um there's been some celebrities that have been caught creating accounts to defend themselves I think like Durant did that was like he called out really good lately you know Bert I had a friend who was a celebrity and was very vocal on Twitter going at people but they had a couple burner accounts where they'd light people up and fucking get into it with other people in there and I when I heard of that I went that is such sociopathic behavior I would never have thought of doing that right like like I was just like wow like it was so beyond me that that would happen what is a sickness right because you're trying to pretend there's other people that are supporting you but that's a sin this is fucking lame that's so sick look just give us a name that their name rhymes with could you describe them is it any more you have no names for me no names we had that bucket I see you ring that Bell we just get this over with that's a very Dutch Schumer that's not how work slide it died by the way take it off and slide that is the greatest technology technological advance I've ever seen I hate is taking my watch off yeah and the fact that the battery goes on the hwachun charges it in 90 minutes for five days yeah he's a fucking game changer it's great it's great is that the thing that's me that means the best or it means the most is the sleep that it monitors your sleep deep sleep let's see let's see who can that that's how we who sleeps the most this month for sleep suppose I'm in with that who's the most here out of all of us probably probably all right he's got nothing at me good looks like a good night for you Ari if I can get eight I'm good but I'll sleep until someone's asleep by 10:00 I like man I'm just go back to sleep nice we didn't know but kids he doesn't have yeah that's nice and he's missing to get up he's got money yeah yeah I don't have to go anywhere to earn anything yeah no responsibilities in life you're one of my favorite people that is like taking success and like really done it in a great way like you really bought freedom whereas a lot of people buy a lot of shit you don't even own a fucking car yeah no reason in the car they don't know if you got to drive somebody get a Zipcar I've never lived in you neither of you have ever lived in New York you two home while she got a tent I I

like almost definitely old ocean yes I would if if it was like if we were doing this podcast yesterday before October started then for sure yeah interesting probably just acid though what do you think

that one too what are you guys gonna start in on there's a book about the beginning of 4chan and - Chan was a to chant racism in that book of it yeah a lot a lot but there's all those things I bet oh by the way I still never found a contact at a Children's Hospital to give that money - I've had like a ten grand signatures how fun this podcast can be for me do you realize that this is like it's a fuckin achiever comic come on take your shirt off maybe you'll feel better here take a shot there's a whole library of books out there - if you guys want to so many people bring Bo really uh yeah it's probably I want to I some more what classic literature I feel kind of like fine back kind of stuff that I'm like you know I haven't read any of that like no other minute I'm gonna jump into something I don't know yeah yes that's a good boy mom well I definitely want to read the madness of the crowds new Douglas Murray book supposed to be excellent it's all about outrage and that's cool yeah so yeah Douglas Murray has been on my podcast before he was one of the first guys that I ever had on that was like immediately demonetized oh really yeah and he did a podcast with with sam harris and someone put it on their playlist love their channel and they got cited for community standards she made a playlist with that one in there yeah and I so I asked this lady at YouTube she was it's hate speech I go it's hate speech I know the fact that you just said that you're talking about to public intellectuals one of us was a neuroscientist the other ones a gay man from Europe who is a public intellectual and you just said it's hate speech is because he's written about the negative aspects of immigration into Europe and he brought a book called the strange death of Europe the somebody's called Islam and the strange to slow death or strange death of Europe till they do monetize them but not just that they cited this person with community standards and then the woman at YouTube that I was speaking to at a fucking party I was just at a party with a friend of mine who used to be a big executive at Google just happened to be there she brought me to this party and this lady just happened to be there that worked at YouTube and I asked her about it and she just flippantly said it's hate speech I mean you don't know well you didn't listen that podcast yeah the fact you just say I I know that if it would see it's the end all of any conversation you just say that and that's what she said and she was trying to do that when she was talking to me I wasn't letting her go and my wife was squeezing my leg it was super uncomfortable conversation but it makes you realize how arrogant some of these people are that are in these positions of power yeah that are in control of social media and now they're getting a lot of blowback so they've softened up their tone sure but they're still like steven crowder just had some peace that he did about how much there's a shadow banning with his YouTube account like he's one of those guys prove me wrong like like Hitler you know Hitler was really smart prove you wrong yeah yeah yeah you know he it takes like like there's only two genders prove me wrong and he'll sit down with people at his table and have these conversations and film them uh-huh and you know most people are not prepared or an emotional and emotional and he stays calm and that gets me more freaked out entertaining come so anyway someone was looking for one of those when someone was looking they so they googled steven crowder prove me wrong they couldn't find anything in the first 70 fucking videos that were recommended by youtube do they've just that's literally his video steven crowder prove me wrong i got message that i'm shadow banned on instagram they're like type in your name link more than ever that Instagram just has a really shitty search engine oh okay oh no I talked to a Instagram star about this they're upset that we are making money off Instagram without using their promotion they want you to use their promotion as a fact we're selling merch to Instagram we're selling tickets to Instagram and they're not gonna kind of man how does this fucking person who's an Instagram influencer know this that's all they do for their life but they don't know that but they're not inside the inner workings of the company and the more that I look into this the more I think they have a really shitty search engine but it's also possible that someone is preventing certain people from getting found like Andrew Schultz was the first person to point it out and if you just type in Andrew Schultz and tried to find his name you all you could find there's all these other accounts why is he decides he shit no cause he's a comic yeah if you're a comedy you say crazy shit and someone decides it's offensive and they say hey we're gonna put there I'm sorta on this shadow band yeah yeah that's crazy well dude it's real it's just nerve channel banning is real there's this all project Veritas is this guy James O'Keefe that's done this undercover investigation you had people talk to Twitter Instagram people and the people that work there when they're at a bar when they're out the explained there were explaining to the worl how you shadow bands someone how you stop conservative voices so I I had my patreon was like shot up and right away and I was like that's pretty quick and I emailed them in a calm manner and I was like hey what's going on I don't show up in search engines and she was let me look and she goes all right well you've been I see it you've been flagged as having pornography I'm looking you know you just started one there's almost nothing on there it's for sure wrong so I'll take that flag off and now you show up so I'm wondering if some of it's just like a bureaucratic like yeah just labels you or an asshole fan right because a lot of them just say uh can target you right they could defeat you and there's no way to say hey this was wrong can you take that off me yeah hey Ari you know spikes people's drinks he's that kind of guy what's weird about it is it's so ideologically one-sided well yeah people or everyone on the left is kind of free to post whatever the fuck they want and people on the right it's interesting for sure because like yeah even if you don't know if you're not conservative you should I mean you should want some type of balance to exist price the whole idea justification on those the justification is all that trumps a terrible president and that yeah the election was terribly you know infuriating and there was a Google executive that was talking about it recently there was this really weird interview where they were talking about how deeply upset everyone was at the results of the election I'm sure they've decided to take steps to try to prevent this their platform from being used for a similar similar result in the future this is a crazy time right now fucking right now this week is nuts man past few days yeah what do you think about all this impeachment shit and Ukraine shit I mean the the funny thing is it's almost like a perfect highlight of everybody being who they are you know but on him going like it's a perfect phone call it's like such a trump line and then he's definitely you know talking to another president about like he's denying what he did right but then you know there's people who obviously stand like Stan saying it's not you know the conversation was about investigations but you know he's always been somebody you got I think separate him from politics this is a guy who's new to politics essentially right right he has always been a guy who bent the rule like he's a rule breaker he doesn't fight you know he's always been someone who's like that shit doesn't apply to me make it happen and I think that you know what I don't know how far it's gonna go but I think the door is open now to like they're really they're really going to investigate that call then there was a report that maybe the Australian PM call had a similar thing where he asked him to invite you know to get involved and we haven't seen the readout of that so I don't know I mean I don't know it seems likely one from one we want to impeach for something's like right away to another one it's nice to think like I don't even know yeah it's hard it's hard to get like I think in in the normal sense like if we had gone through a more stable last couple of years as far as this would be groundbreaking holy shit we're like in the in the scope of what the last few years have been like it still feels like yes some other crazy I'm sure you're not telling me the words yeah yeah yeah I don't know yeah yeah they're saying they're opening the investigation into it but we don't know what really that's gonna mean yeah you're saying only one Peacham man things can get really ugly things could get crazy here supporters fuck yeah if you don't sign out if you just took their guy and just said we voted him in fair and square and you guys just removed him no way but today what was right impeach this pic no picture the entire country that's mostly red states a couple of blue which was the result the election that was Trump's post yep what do you think of that of the call the with the I didn't really listen to it did you listen tour do you to look at the transcript I read the transcript yeah I didn't I didn't read the transcript I'm gonna wait until it gets real I I like to look at these things like looking at soon because it feels a lot of it feels like sensationalized right well I remember Justin Martindale telling me the stormy Daniels was gonna take him down visit she's our Monica Lewinsky they want it so bad yeah they want that nothing like a duck to water just water off his back shook it off yeah kept moving but he also I think he loves this shit you know I think he actually look he like will complain about witch-hunt shit but I think he actually likes me talked about the game it's a game for him you know I think yeah I think he enjoys yeah but the game is try to put a real stink on him when 2020 comes around he can't win right that's things don't stick to him mmm other people he what he'll win the next election you think so you think so yeah there's I don't think the Democrats have come up with someone that's the they need someone like a no joke but like the rock something to be excited about then it's just the rock could win 100 percent even if he would be a terrible president and I think he probably would be he seems like a really smart guy might actually be good dedicated himself to it based on what talking to him oh you know yeah oh yeah I was like based on his moves not just that I mean I've talked him briefly but reading his stuff that he posts and listen to his little Instagram videos he's a considerate interesting introspective god just works hard bust his ass but he's very nice he's a good guy you know and I mean I don't know if that's enough to be President but I don't think anybody should be President yeah but once we're down to a popularity contest at least I think he would be a fair and equitable person it might just go to straight to popularity contest so no more politicians can win well well Kanye if someone really decided someone really famous not just Trump but someone else decided like especially a famous comic yeah decided to run for president he would be fucked because he's so easy to make fun of and all those fucking dolts don't know how to do it yeah and so he shits on them and all the the people that never had like the thing about him is he's the first asshole president like openly an asshole and there's so many guys out there that are assholes that want to support another asshole yeah like finally one of us remember I remember there's a scene where Ted Cruz was giving some speech there was a guy with sunglasses on who was toned quit you're never gonna win you're never gonna win Trump's gonna be President and he's in his face and Ted Cruz is trying to talk to him in his also a politician way but this guy's like fuck you yeah cuz he's an asshole yeah exactly and he wants to be able to do that to Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz didn't know what the fuck to do right and I was like oh you didn't know how to handle this right I've been heckled right right never a trauma is like fuck you like right back to your face yeah I think if a real like if Oprah ran I think she'd win I think if someone that's what we've entered into we're like now we don't want any with any expertise yeah he's not popular well I mean if someone like Obama ran he would fucking win but you have to that's how he's a unicorn like someone who's that articulate and charismatic you get like a Bill Clinton you get like a you know Obama those are rare people that are that good at talking and also have a good record and also you know know how to fucking rile a crowd up there's not a lot of those Joe Biden certainly isn't one of them he looks man Walking Dead and he also just notably slit-like every time like you can see that it's taking in a while to put together you know I mean like when an older guy takes a minute to put something together you see all this fuck and he's not healthy and he looks tired always tired you can't be tired and run for president and then you got that people adjudicated guy that guy can't even run his own fucking city they're all pissed at him you know it's the people in his own City there was a murderer cop murdered somebody and everybody was going crazy and like what are you doing you're not even here you're out there running for president yeah you can't you look you you all your fucking time should be running your goddamn City and instead you're on TV every day the fucking City there's no way it's one of the rare jobs you could it's fucking all encompassing run you should have is someone else run but it's the rare jobs where it requires so much energy to pursue and yet people pursue it while they have other jobs that they're being paid for with Pat taxpayer dollars yeah you should give up being a senator you should get an interim leader while you're running for poetry third percent and maybe you should have to fucking earn it back like who knows maybe the new senators better and maybe he doesn't want to be president that polling changes all the time but it isn't like the top three still is it's like it's a mix of like Biden more in Sanders right it's always like this yeah Bri yep though is also the three that everybody wants to win I'm always fascinated by that person who like at this point six months in or something and they're at 0.012 I'm doing another fundraising campaign you're not winning dude I wish I had a little bit of that in my personality like that's why you thought you're gonna win sober October last year there's a trigger for you that's the thing is if somebody goes you're definitely not gonna win then you go yeah well I said I like I liked I have I had fun with that I thought it's fun I was and when I didn't think that when I started don't you started throwing up numbers I was like there's no way I'm catching Joe but are still making videos going Joe doubled whatever you do and I was I just thought it was fun it was fun for sure was fun I didn't think it was fun I know you didn't it was horrible but it was still fun it was definitely fun for me to see what's a change in the ratings I feel like you would do anything yeah how do we decide champ this year I thought I thought I was gonna be a real problem because I know Ari Ahri's psychotically competitive only when I challenge it yeah it's got a iover entered in hey that's a good question though is there a way to win or lose this year kind of feels like she's not really doesn't seem like there is no the problem with a way to win or lose is it's gonna become a competition again and everyone's gonna go fucking crazy yeah and we're gonna spend too much time doing it that's the real problem the real problem is time constraints like the funnest year for me Wow last year was for him but it was too crazy but the year before that was the yoga thing was easy in terms of it was hard to do put time in that was time in yoga was the best one we've done because we all did it together yeah Tom and I went to almost every class together and that's nice we all went together it was fun yeah when we when we all showed up in Encino and so this class will be something yeah yeah we're still doing this yeah well you rather not what do you want to do I bring that Bell dude drunk is fuck this I called Jeff in the ice I mean we're in him you know we kill each other or we could get super fucked up and then still have to do these challenges and yeah we could do that no one's be drunk mmm yeah well I wouldn't do that but I've done jiu-jitsu hi many many many oh yeah it's great hi yeah I think so slowly good okay throws it down for you and tell what's happening if you have a feel for things sort of like pool you're better at pool when you're high two things that we have a feel for things do you get high to do arena shows now sure you do yeah well just a Tokarev oh you get bounced off really yep and you go up there fucking rip no shit I get exactly you say that yeah with Chappelle for sure those the biggest show of every attacks how we got blasted how many was around 25,000 Wow and you got high as fuck high as fuck we broke the attendance record for the Tacoma Dome we're both lit the next day that was crazy about him is he really goes rock star style we fly on a private jet we land and you get in a tour bus not a limo tour bus and he's on the phone with John Mayer they're talking about the benefits of the tour bus versus a car service pick a car service so the tour bus takes you to the hotel ten minute drive tour bus and then once we get there then we go into Dave's room and he's got all the fucking IV set up they got a doctor there or nurses there that are administering IVs to us they're giving you glutathione your process really process the alcohol survived hundred made you discover I did I shot in the butt right up to my boss that's my show in Casey so I was like fucking shaking and it gave it to me and I felt amazing and then I was like and then I started getting jumpy to go to a little too good and I was like Oh fuckity yellow well really reinvigorates you man violent drip vitamin Trump ID IV not Molly well I got i guess ii try to do the thing is if you're already sick it's too late really yeah yeah if you if you're you're sick if you're like starting to feel like oh man you think you have a chance can you get the drip but the b12 shot even when I was sick gave me a nice gives you a little boost yeah I got three hours before this you know it's hard to get that without the shot you know if you take the there's a liposomal b12 that you can take you put under your tongue and check yeah it's okay it's pretty good it's not as nice a shot yeah the shots the way to go yeah the shots the way to go the real way to go is to make sure you always have a heavy nutrient levels in your body always I always take multivitamins always you know make sure you get a balanced diet then you can party a little more and you got a little more leeway you can bounce back easier it's the people that eat like shit and then they don't you know he's but we we did a podcast for this we drank a lot of water and booze but I can't believe you dosed you I used to pissed about it I'm not pissed I mean I'm it's just it's it triggers things in my head yeah and and it bums me out that it's a close friend mmm cuz it's like a lack of trust you know well it weird is how like laughy he is about it I think it was a big part of that though is cuz he knows dude I think he's I think he knows he fucked up I think when I told him I said hey man this would have this counteracts with my medicine he was like I didn't think about that and I was like oh yeah yeah I think he knows I think you know what can I shitty you on with and emelina peen and this is all almost got taken off it yeah and this last I went back to the doctor and he's like blood pressure is perfect yeah he was like you know the goal is to get you to a healthy weight and get you off your blood-pressure meds is there an target weight no - I'd like to be 205 you do when you got down to the 215 215 was the lightest I got after the weight challenge but I thought I was dehydrated right that was dehydrate no no no 215 was when we did the weight loss challenge I kept losing weight I got down to 215 oh yeah and so I would like to be if I get down to 215 but in 205 I think I'd still I'm still not gonna be in shape at 205 I'm still almost obese but no that's the middle middle weight what was what was your OB 224 before Holly oh 6-1-6 one 205 is pretty lean dude Wow yeah I would like that yeah you can get there yeah I think this month will be I'll be interested to see how much weight I lose because I'm already 265 oh no nope 305 nope you're 412 oh can you wear your cells to 37 yeah come on man if I bust out a scale right now it says 237 really probably not no later in the to divert weighed myself since I got back off the tour that's great sex but yeah I'd like to look it down how much e Wayne 233 really yeah how often do you often scale every fucking week every fuck didn't you make some wacky deal where you kind of have to be on the road constantly no I made a deal but I don't have to do whatever I don't want to do so his tour bus is amazing amazing it's so much it's so nice on there that's great oh my god and so when you go on tour comments actually just take that bus from town to town it's awesome and that's how you do it from now on yeah this is great there's also gonna Sturgill in his band yesterday they were in here and he was saying that he would rather be on a bus for three days than go to an airport home it's all comfortable in there they're all buddies they're all hanging out yeah you get a good time how much fun was it we got great just on the show we get in the tour bus starts raining you're all everyone's in there drinking we're all talking we're watching we're talking shit about comics you can watch it on the fucking TV you can sit around right yeah I got 10 Dillon on the road with me this week that's smart together fungi that like Tim my bus drivers fucking hilarious my tour managers my cousin and that was a good sober guy because he seems like a drunk right interesting that he's seen does seem like a drunk but he's not like that Megan McCain thing you would think that has to be done by a guy was on a lot of drugs yeah he's really funny I will fuck you only fuck that Megan McCabe it is fucking crazy yeah I like it he's also like super I've seen his like Twitter it's like she's super opinionated which is Wow oh yeah it's fun to see so he to me he had the very best take of a lot of people that were attacking Louie and that there are really mediocre comedians who didn't like the fact that Louie was brilliant and they're coming up with all these reasons why they hate him on top of what he did especially a certain camp of comedian yeah really really embrace that which is like cuz Louie always had his feet planted both amazingly and all mainstream and perfectly well everybody in both was like that's the guy yeah but when the alt camp really came after him hard because those are the little virtue signaling those were the ones where like oh the king is done yeah oh he's so brilliant like you thought he was brilliant yeah said like you can't do rape jokes unless you're Louie he does it good yeah they were always saying that there's he's their exception for that yeah lol what he's doing is really interesting cuz traveling around and he's just doing clubs I'm fascinated by what the draw is if he were to and now it's the big venue because I like having traveled a lot this year and doing it makes me think that he would be at like at least 75 percent of what his draw was I think I really believe yeah yeah I think it'd be higher excitement to lost anybody there's an excitement to it now where it's like before was like he'll be back next year I don't know where he was he gained more yeah yeah he gained but it's just like but it's at the club's right now so it's like I want to see the like maybe he's just decided to just just do this and make a good living traveling around doing clubs she'll never do a special again maybe he just enjoys doing stand-up I don't know I don't know either there's I feel like I noticed different types of comics there's comics that like to live in LA and do spots in LA and not get out and I don't think Louise that guy I think Louise likes being on the road I think he likes the road you know the roads so different than la in New York yeah it is it's also you know it's always fans that are coming to see ya yeah I mean it's also fun in New York he does a lot of spots in New York or he did anyway does he do them now that's we're not really anymore because there were videotaping everything he said that's such a problem now it's people video - I have a lot of his video house everything I'm doing they're just videotaping the entire thing have you thought about using those Yonder bags I have not because I don't know I think it's just a pain in the ass what are you gonna do fight we did it at the Chappelle show 25,000 yeah yeah the other China people we did it also on the next night how long does it take to get them in Salt Lake out takes a while yeah takes a while but if you you know the thing is that yonder they know how to do it the the Tacoma show was the biggest show that ever handled before you know what's nice after a show like that as soon as it ends no words growing on their phone they're all talking to each other but what they just saw mm-hmm you know they're not disappearing leading up to my Netflix special - I did it for a few months I did it for three yeah was it what do you think what did it cost you it's we talked about it it's not it's not cheap to cost a little bit of money cuz right now I'm getting ready for my Netflix special and what I realized is like some like you still gotta take chances even though you're in a theater you're still gonna have to roll the dice and take chances and write new material cuz you two haven't really got it yet and I hate that people are recording me taking chances yeah like and like trying to figure things out and I go don't put that on YouTube it's not done yet like yeah I want to tell you when it's done yeah I can pay attention quit even if you're just using it for yourself just pay attention watch it in the room you know what's the best and put by best I mean the worst was Miami because when I use the yonder bags of Miami why was it the Jackie Gleason theater yeah these motherfuckers they would get up constantly to go outside to make phone calls and then come back so they liked the crowd instead of everybody sitting down focused was just people constantly getting up and rehab users coming back they had to use it so to go outside to come back it was the one city super suspect always said if you want to starve to death open up a bookstore in Miami fuckin party place on earth that's the spot yeah and that one it was so clear watching the audience you could get up with me you ever been to Fort Myers particularly party though it's a different vibe it's also an all night you know all night all the time you can get good food in Miami at 3:00 in the morning absolutely no questions I think it's weird that you're looking for it either like dinner now at 3m sure when the malls closed like I just got this drink there's putting a paper cup like go yeah all right okay it's the Sun comes up it's it's an interesting place it's not my favorite but I know but I like going there because it makes me really feel like I'm in another country looks like I'm doing stand-up at Costa Rica you are basically you oh there's wild people there's so much dancing in the streets that's like nowhere Miami's Latin America man yeah lively everyone's Lively a lot of Lambos a lot of Tom Segura cars driving around Jewellery a lot of fucking crazy coloring you ever see yourself in a flossy car no I don't care about cars really really really but yes sir you draw to you you show me that thing you were very proud of it I know you say you know I like it I like it but I don't I don't really give a I'm not a car guy with your stuff indulgence what's your stuff yeah what do you what do you go snack cars like what would i don't think i think i don't know not that indulgent I was like financially I don't really care about jewelry too much of a necklace my grandmother gave me I don't really care about stuff like that um like watches yeah but I don't really care I stopped wearing my Rolex I just thought it's too flashy and I thought you get robbed so I was like yeah fucking everyone what is that what you doing this is just a for my running humming garments yeah is you're on stage in front of fucking 2,800 people and then you go hey let's go out to a bar after this and then you got fifty thousand dollars on your wrist yeah it's it's just kind of thousands now what kind of roll-ups you wearing presidential rose gold damn you should go straight Tracy Morgan just giant fucking gold ropes the fat gold ropes and a giant dollar bill sign I get I get anxiety when I hear about you guys spending money like or like we need like something when you when you got this place I got anxiety for you cuz I go like I know you have a lot of money but I go but are you afraid you're gonna run out like that's how I am with money I know I'm a hard time spending it well some people are famine thinkers yeah why don't I buy I think yeah I think I do and it's like when you got the the Lambo I got scared for you because I was like why would you do that yeah I'm trying to get him to buy it for real yeah but you like to spend money yeah you do like spending money like spend enjoy it yeah I grew up poor I like I like having money I don't think you should have money if you're not gonna spend it I just don't I don't agree with that yeah but there's not a part of your comic brain that goes that's gonna be taken away yeah fuck that that's I got a different branding you yeah yeah my brain doesn't work I work every fucking weekend because I go oh I I wanna get the material sharp only get ready for the special I want to make as much money as well the sunshines make hay while the Sun shines geez you're gonna be fine to me more often and stay off the Molly this guy yes got the malayali all the time yeah let's do it so he doesn't feel bad to spend all his money on bars and shit you know because it's so crazy that how what a character I've become yeah but I'm not even a real human anymore ha ha that's you know that was kinnison's problem he became a character yeah kinnison even talked about it in books Hunter has Thompson the same issue you know as he got famous for being this wild man you know and people that knew hunter would say that when the cameras were off he was a different guy but when he knew that the cameras were there he would all sudden take on this character like you know there's a do you know that um band beardyman mmm Fitzsimmons and I were reading off Hunter as Thompson's daily routine oh yeah yeah great we're reading it off and beardyman turned it into a video turn the song and then turned into this crazy video oh yes yeah okay it's really yeah I saw five of this apparently didn't really live like that everyday it was just like when someone whenever order was there he was just like I'm just gonna do coke and drink all day I'm the wake up at four in the afternoon and I'm gonna you know eat fucking Cheetos and Doritos and enchiladas and be like this is my root drink margaritas and you know 6:00 a.m. and the hot tub went champagne you know and that's that's what he would do and he would write midnight after you mean so he had this reporter there and he's doing all these hard hard drugs up until midnight and at midnight he started writing well he writes till 6:00 a.m. and then 6:00 a.m. so cool it's not yes he would like it that guy like Kinnison said they would just lay out lines of coke form like oh you have no fucking idea when I just I don't bring I got bring a drink on stage and I'll drink having my drink from doing one show I'll have it when I tell the Machine story but if I just have a like a soda and I just take a big sip they go fucking nuts and and it's hard because it's hard because I do like drinking so like when people are like hey can I buy you a drink you yeah like alright and you're like well fuck like yeah yeah yeah right I get it and no one had like when I told everyone I already slipped me Molly on stage they just cure your the Machine and you're like I'm also a fucking dad like I'm crazy dad but you I don't even know like I remember hearing about Amy and Sara when they got in trouble for the jokes they made going up that's a character I do and I can't wrap my head around a difference between Who I am on stage who I am up off stage like I'm the same person so like I I can't understand being a character even though you know it again I know what you saying I can't understand that either I'm bait I'm basically the exaggerated version of me on stage that is yeah yeah the finest funniest ways I'm looking at life but they're always I've actually looked at life I've never said anything on stage where I'm like no not my perspective but I'm gonna take on this perspective in order to get these people to laugh at me I hate that shit anyone comments do that I'm like you don't believe that just change to choke up yea orsa take take the high road and try to write the fucking joke the way you want it to sound lasted something's fucked up to say that you got to know that I don't really think that I will say yeah you're saying I'll say yes I don't even fucking think that right I just think it's funny haha no what about you how much of you on the podcast is who you are off it's like a hundred percent of me on the podcast I've been doing it for so long I don't think I would know how to fake being someone else no but nobody's like but it's also it wouldn't work like this one of the reasons why this podcast works is because it seems like a hang like you guys know me this is me yeah you know yeah this is it yeah yeah yeah dizzy if you if that wasn't the case but it also makes it so much easier can imagine if that if you had a character that you were doing on a podcast and you have to keep that character thanks for me that's one of the reasons why it's so easy to do the UFC and so he's even to do stand-up it's like I'm live all the time yeah I'm the the the idea of someone watching you is easy it's more like when I do those UFC broadcasts and you know if I'm doing a pay-per-view millions of people watching this is fucking hugely important thing we don't rehearse I don't even know what they're gonna ask me yeah that's really crazy no idea of no idea and that's how I've always done it but I know what's happening I know who the fighters are I know what's going down but but that's because I'm a fan so when John Anik turns to me and he's like you know in this light heavyweight title fight you know you know John Jones and I'll just start going off I just started talking about it but it's because of this because I do this so often I feel like other sports broadcasters do so much more press so much more work than you sure yeah they all study their binders like five days well no to it I do study fights but I still fights because I'm interested that just happened to be a fan yeah so it's easy look if I was doing basketball I'd have to really pay attention to the teams early pay attention to who's playing who and what the implications are for fighting I know it oh yeah I know I pay attention to it constantly so when something's happening I'm like I'm excited about this I only know comedy like that like I know there's only one thing I know in its comedy yeah that's the only thing I have any expertise at all because like I don't know anything about anything well I think that's one of the good things about being not so good at something it's like something that you get excited about I think it helps to other things like I think archery like an bow hunting I think it helps my comedy and I think it helps podcasting either help because it's something that I'm learning how to do so it's not something you're excited about yeah because it requires a lot of work requires a lot of thinking and this it's a very absolute thing well you can't fuck it up it has to be done correctly it's like there's a lot of work that has to go into it you can't fake the work I don't know if I could get into anything without comedy being the purpose that I'm there like if I got in two or three I'd be like this is to write a bit about we have hobbies outside of comedy no well yeah like I don't worry I don't nursed I never understood when people say their hobbies I never cry can never wrap my head around that I go yet making videos running for it no but I don't even really I only run to try to be healthy I don't enjoy it like I don't have any hobbies what about you Tom yeah I don't know I mean I've I've actually always been that have that thing around like man I wish I had more hobbies and then all the way that I kind of talked myself down from the criticism is like well I just have a very busy life you know I have kids I have a wife I have the podcasting I have touring it's like they're kind of a hobby too though yeah I like certain things like I've gone to a couple tracks to drive and I really love it but it's fucking to find like you know that's a lot they're not here we're not like in proper la's you got to go to them once a week well isn't there a Porsche driving experience yeah fantastic yeah it's great yeah and so is I went to M school we could do that things we do for a class really focus to it do you are you allowed to use your own car do you know Derek I'll use that now there's a like in so basically at the Porsche driving experience they have one Atlanta they have went the one here you sign up for a certain thing for that day so it's like turbos gt3 you want to do with master the manual you you pick a class and then like that's your car for the experience right then they have different tracks they have a bowl they have a slip like flip this kind of thing where the ground moves oh yeah you have it amazing like if you want to feel like you can't drive you get in the car with like that they're Pro drivers and you're like yeah I gotta drive and they're like check out this shake you're like yeah I don't know I've been doing it for like 25 years you're like I don't I Drive because they're fucking amazing right yeah and then em school is like BMWs thing it's out and like towards Coachella mmm that's fuckin so fun and you get em to sm-3s Anam fives on different courses we should do what we should do is to keep the competition alive but not make us go crazy about it over time is do like two three activities like a driving a shooting or three active and activities that none of us have previous experience in and just it's just straight competition see who's the best but the driving part you're gonna be hampered by your weight yeah yeah there's a lot of weight mmm extra four or 500 pounds in that front see ya chat or join your table girth we're fascinating and certainly do something like that you know we could also do something like that where I mean we're doing this sober October right this is our October yeah unless you have alcohol you want to bring up we could we could break this up and we could do it at another time too like we don't have to do this just once a month or once a year rather we can do something else like literally this is this but it's one of the most fun things we do we could do on top of being sober we can do another thing on another month where it's just a racing month then you don't have to be sober at all I like pushing more like that you could do a fishing month yeah the race thing you'll love dude fucking racing designer track somewhere well the fascinating thing is like when I don't have that he'll have that race trigger no charm so yeah I'm just gonna yeah I mean I know it just I what the thing that gives like maybe you to where you get confident behind the wheel I start getting nervous going it's gonna flip it's gonna flip well if you believe the instructor because they're so good yeah and they tell you like no no no like like hit the throttle up to this point where you go that's way too late to be hitting the brake and they're like let me show you how and you actually see it then you start to get the confidence to follow the instruction well but it's just you're gonna panic when you realize how long 500 words is or 500 pages upon pages 500 pages to read size books you can't read a book that's probably that's what we can read this will be a resolution of just words that don't mean anything to how much is that I see something the quantum worlds of the emergence of space I would be like I bet I couldn't understand the first sentence I listen that book on audio and I had to go back over it multiple times yeah that's heady fuck it's less hobbies maybe yeah shit man I'm like I'm a different creative team how close was I pretty good thank you I'm a different kind of crazy though my kind of crazy needs other things thinking about to quit it's one belonging to Alice and the other busy Bob I don't even own equip it is I'm lost trying to explain it to you hmm I mean III can't I look at your schedule and it gives me panic I have to piss spearing a pan yeah yes Torrance maybe yeah take your drink with you take advantage you afterwards yeah we

than 30 days left right now yeah there's 30 and 100 by the Mayan Count calendar I don't think it's already over so we're all dead December twenty first two thousand is that come blue to have alcohol in it yeah I'm over here look man since since the challenge isn't like as intense like this is a sobriety really matters no do we even join the surprise October so so Bob doc told us and the problem is Ari and I already got higher earlier we were smoking cigars and we both got a buzz no doubt about it so it's over the silver part I think all right I cheated I think it I think it should be over that's a that's a I feel like we did it wrong yup how bad go to Europe why would you be sober how about with every drink you take you have to do an additional class oh I love this oh my god my dick just got hard I'm gonna get in black belt in jujitsu every drink is a class you fucking quit bitch are we really doing this every drink is a class you can start from zero with that every drink is that fast drink is an actual drink is it drinks you have ten classes that you owe period then if you drink every drink is an additional class if you have three drinks tonight you have three more classes or thirteen classes yes that's impossible that'll don't ever be able to get that many yeah zero a legit drink you can't be like a fucking beer started what about does weed apply to the same thing yeah yeah every time you take a hit and that's it I mean do you realize just for one night of drinking I would do - there'll be no time you would never be able to have strong zero class classes a day for the whole month wait one night yeah what is one night for real we're doing doubles all right like what's a double or one for if I'm if I'm on the road I'll have I'll bring a double on stage with me I'll have a double after the show I have a double at the bar I have a double embossing warmer done so it's eight weeks eight drinks oh that would be fun well then set you straight well you'd be like I'm straight right now or like you stop the shakes with stop times of course times I couldn't use chopsticks in Japan at the airport one Hey yeah dude what gets me is those long flights because I drink on long flights so that's what fucks me up you do it oh yeah do it just do it out of class I like that for every drink we do we have to add a class I would I would do it was talking from zero October that's not the thing is just people listening to this they're either severely disappointed first of all of me for bringing in shot glasses and ice definitely angry right now a lot of them I really look forward to doing this already angry at re-birth the victim you know you're a fucking rapist yes you're very bad you might out beat the Bill Cosby holy shit names coming your way there was a woman who was a she was talking about Bill Cosby she said he might be the biggest serial rapist in history Oh easily imagine like that guy are you going as far as T gonna be huh ha ha takin your complaint with you think about it when you're out there think about what you want to do with your sobriety the promise a bride is Tom gonna die if he comes in with a fuckin 12-pack of beer going come on guys a lot of booze in that fridge out there you could do a clasper drink 50 pages per drink one of the other like that start at zero you can have damage you could have two nights of drinking the drugs and that's already like seven right there yeah fifty pages for a drink is a hefty price what's the xanax I want to take one of those today Solana class why do you look to ever since the Molly on my panic has been fuckin tweaked I don't think my serotonin is not back yeah so they're coming to take 5htp did you try it no you got some here do we have any new mood 5-htp well you don't get nervous taking anything Jamie's gonna go something I got nervous sometimes taking stuff well I've HC P is just some actual stuff right yeah stuff really works yes it works when I get obsessive compulsive on it new mood is it turns it off yeah yeah really turns it off like sometimes I'll get repetitive in my head and I'll just start saying the same thing over and over and over again and it fucking makes me crazy let me ask you this when we were doing that sober October thing there you go so I wish to take four of those yeah yeah yeah it's really want to put them in my drink for me touch that's my only regret is not bringing 5-htp with me that'll ramp up your serotonin though for sure yeah take that way can i oh yeah yeah if you need more let me know um yeah I I don't know what it's called but I sell sometimes when I get obsessive with balls I say the same things over and over in my head it's great when you're wearing it working on a joke because you just start chewing it just and over and over and over again but it fucking backfires sometimes no but let me ask you this last year when we're doing that crazy Fitness shit did that kill your chatter like Tommy now we're talking about hot spins killing it really wow it's so aggressive it's I'm burning like 780 calories in a class hour it's hot as shit and you're and it you can't your brain just doesn't work and then when I get out my serotonin levels are so high I can feel I feel great and I'm calm and I can get through the day I really honestly I tried calling you one time because you'd always said that if you don't work out then you be go crazy and I started noticing that that working out was making me sane hmm and I was like if I wanted to talk to you about that you're not working that was making you say no no what not working outs making me insane so like the workouts were making never yeah that's why I started going to hot spin I need something I need to be in a class I can't go just go for a jog cuz I it it doesn't help right well you got to push it to look when you're going for a jog you kind of can go at your own pace oh shit if you're if you're in front of that instructor the instructors going come on let's go go we do sign up for five K's on the road ah so that and I forced out yeah I forced my bus driver I've run a 5k the other day the time he ran it was it's awesome man five K's half marathons marathons suck but those kind of things are so communal then you do them and you feel like a part of a community we ran through Des Moines gorgeous as a trail run tan that's cool all right let's trail runs all the whole we take the tour bus in park it everyone gets runs are you taking drugs yeah yeah we quit oh we didn't tell you oh oh yeah we all had to drinking drugs so tell you except waits for Joe is that is like for is like for you it's just nutrients it's not bad so I'm gonna fuck you up what is it it's 5-htp l-tryptophan which also converts to 5-htp see here put wonder lorries drink for me this is some vitamins and adaptogens and stuff in there too it's all good for you it's all healthy mood yeah that's a legit supplement um that 5-htp stuff is very legit it's really good for people that are dealing with serotonin issues oh man I was hurting with panic this week in the tour bus I couldn't shut it off why why because I think original name for a new mood was roll-on/roll-off and the idea was there was we like Aubrey was a big partier and Aubrey developed some shit to come down from Molly so that's literally what new mood was originally invented for and then we decided you know well there's a lot of benefit to increasing your serotonin naturally yeah just really does help your mood they're gonna fly tonight Neil Brenner it is a big 5-htp proponent he actually he couldn't take it with his meds yeah because it was too much really and where do you fly tonight I go to Dallas I'm in Tulsa and Antonio and then Houston Buckingham say what's up the gene for me gee Garth where's Garth that I think he has a nice big old couple places but a big old man Tulsa yeah does he yeah did you ever did you ever have a part of your career where you were we're not where we are kind of in like or did you just go from like clubs to like fucking massive theaters well Tommy now we're working together first we were doing clubs yeah I've done clubs and that was like nine years ago yeah and then you just you never did like like you just went to like fucking massive venues right I did a lot of theaters man yeah it's all just grinding what's through it you went through 30 years I think yeah yeah and went through all of it yeah started clubs I mean I still do clubs to this day I still booked weekends and clubs I'm thinking about moving to New York in December why to work I gotta come up with a new hour why do you want to move to New York is that a school it'll just me look for like two weeks and just fucking do two weeks out yeah yeah two weeks just go for two weeks and do spots like crazy yeah and right you do spots in LA and still see your family bro Jesus I like I like shaking it up Joe you know I've had that fantasy before yeah I've had the exact same fantasy of doing them by the fantasy came before already drugged me because I was like oh he's so great to be sorry for two weeks and just go do spots with him big J hugged but it'll be cool it would be cool but you're not friends anymore you can't do that how much I'm you know how much I love already that I have been damage control trying to take care of him in this I would you appreciate that I really care about it on a podcast no talk about it at all wait we'll talk about on the podcast there during the weekend I was like maybe I want I was worried about already and I was like I don't maybe I shouldn't bring this up I don't think it's a good thing and I think Ari maybe regrets it but yeah definitely doesn't look at this face he does not regret it no that's the real problem here I think is that I don't regret I think that is a problem yeah I won't do it again but I don't regret why do you not regret for real why don't you regret it was all I've nothing bad happened and it was awesome and he's and his wife is mad at me again but that's definitely not gonna be the last time or it's not the first time I thought is unfortunate but worth it I think great time I love I would love to see the video a Burt like it kind of him realizing it I have it really when you realize it's like kicking in yeah I remember I can't tell you I can't tell you hey guys saw it today because I'm debating whether to release that podcast but I saw it nice when it's I see it in my eyes I go back to that fucking moment where I'm like when you realize you gotta control it's like it's like getting Strymon because strapped into a one of the fucking hot rods mmm the fucking to the jet fueled ones and they strapped me in super tight and then they strapped my hands so I couldn't touch anything and I remember I couldn't get out and I had a panic attack I said I'm gonna be here for a while like and I was like cuz they were like and I was like I need to get out right now I need to get out right now and I had to get out it was wandering tribal channel that to me I said I can't get out of this fucking panic I go I can't fix this and then it overwhelmed me that's how I feel I take mushrooms overwhelm me and I thought I'm what if I don't like this what if I don't enjoy this how do I stop this I can't stop it no it's a fucking that's a panic attack right there but luckily it was it was a very it's Molly's a really interesting drug it'll fight for you it'll be an advocate Molly was like don't worry your cousin's here rub his back because you did that to him do you think we could allow him to do Molly in October I would say okay do you want to do it no I'm not doing any Molly ever again no ever and I'll be M never what about November first dude you should have seen I was here's what sucked about it as soon as he gave it to me and I felt it kick in I went I don't want to do this podcast I wanna go for a walk yeah I want to do Mona go dance I want to listen to music I want my children and wife not to be here I want to not have to explain the situation to my wife I want to not have to be on a plane so like I don't know maybe I it would do Mali in the future if it was like an awesome concert or something in Vegas or yeah cool sounds awesome right like Britney Spears or some dude I would do Mali and go to Britney Spears sure you remember all the lyrics all the songs do more you better work bitch yeah Swift the best was that so I started dancing a little bit because I knew I was taking it so it was like embracing kicking it and he goes out of the blue are you a Molly right now or you and then we just like I don't know what that was do you do it I do it when it's the right time I wants to see Mighty Mighty Bosstones in the Orient Webster Hall I did it that night you know you're an adult right yeah what are you doing Molly for what do you mean you know it feels great maybe he's gotten hit first of all those balls don't work so he can't make babies all right he had him snipped so he doesn't have real responsibilities none I think if you have more but you don't do it all the time just in the right like music really how often is that now it again three times a year four times zero okay that's not bad yeah festivals occasional board is maybe twice here Iza do Co not that in the coke cokes awesome it's around ethology in short it was real emotion by in that world yeah was last time you did it it's been a long time I didn't an accident one night accident yeah my buddies had that bullet where you load it and then flip it and they had a little bump for you and you can't hit it and they couldn't figure out how to work it and I'm watching them I was getting ready go to this spot here's one I was in New York I was watching I go guys you're doing it wrong give me the fucking thing I go you take it right then you load it then we hit it you got to hit it no what are you gonna do I was like the other fucking nostril you kidding me I used to cook a lot in New York and then you want on stage and destroyed Joey says that coke fucks his comedy up well then he said it made him good you might go a little deeper takes away your heart takes away the heart imagine him though like if you go like let's really do some coke - that is not a line he's probably just the whole bad guy the machine gun I would love to I would love to get on what's this thing all the people take the adderall I draw on saqqaq see how adderall the adderall is speed yeah speed yeah stuff man it's very fucking oh very very addictive it nicked out of this fucking you do that now I have no I've done it a few times but not recently I went down a YouTube rabbit hole the other day watching stories or people who were talking about what adderall did to them what it was like when they were addicted to Adderall we thought the whole world was against them thought they were on top of everything that they were super competent they were capable of anything they had unstoppable confidence they wouldn't shut the fuck up but everyone was against them this was being prescribed a lot of people yes constantly kids a lot of you get it done now you get shit done yeah how did I hit the fucking mic cord yeah it's a it's a spooky drug though cuz it's just it's a sign first of all journalists everybody mine as a writer says almost all journalists are on it oh it's so easy to write on now what's on it constantly I took it when I was writing my book but it just it changes who you are as a person like fucks with their head College Admissions have started a lot of them adding the the in the question it can the application are you want out of them Wow yeah really you know why mmm-hmm because no cuz that sometimes there's a talk to a doctor who said that I have to like sign off on some of these things where they'll ask me to fill out this form do I describe this to this person yeah this fucking super common man it's super common on Wall Street it's super common with people that are trying to get things done yeah we should do it we should do it for the month oh let's all just do our own fucking really good a hard time to get off that stuff though yeah so that'll be the challenge so are we really gonna add that for every drink you just out of class I think it's a good idea a drink or a drug or a shot whatever one of the things you would owe so yes so many I would have to do 80 classes but for a night of drinking it's out of class no no start at 10 you go nuts in a knife no no that's not easy that's too easy it's sober October supposed to be sober just be sober guys love yourself but Ari and I already smoked a cigar that's permitted guys a cigar cigar but cigars we got elastic I'm starting smoking for this one I took one a hitch cliff cigarettes once for once agent I stole one of Chappelle's - he gave me a cigarette before one on stage it gives you a buzz cigarette so no ball I hate anything that's bad for you but the cigarette does give you an interesting buzz it is a bus the in pick Jade did one of my podcasts we talked about smoking and it was so head rush I would love a cigarette right now do it you got to get into cigarettes cigarettes like regularly smokin cigarettes late in life is de pollo yeah he's like when he was 50 that's Jim Aaron was addicted to the laws in his head yeah he was and he was like he was getting the point where he couldn't see and getting physically ill he was eating so many he'd wake up and they'd go to sleep with him in his mouth goddamn like that's is he off now easier yeah he's off he's got likes I think he's got like 14 days off in lozenges what fucking dumb thing to be addicted to he must don't want really I think you have these chewing gums idiot oh he's 60 years old he can't get off gum must be good right Lawson just right yeah I tried the gum because I want to see if it gives you the same head brush that does it I tried snus in Stockholm that the packet showing who it gives you the boys I thought of like more than anything oh my god I remember the dip buzz oh really get into dipping yeah give you a buzz and that people like oh how white knuckling we're getting it you can choose you can smoke cigars you can dip you can smoke cigarettes I mean are you getting into cigarettes I feel like we're not sober how about just socially drinking you just can't do it what is it that mean I mean Bert's on stage in front of 2,000 people that's social yeah that's a good point I didn't consider that but you're right I think if you do anything with a needle it should be permitted just because it's kind of high-risk you know I deserve a little bit for taking me anal choice where you drink oh I need to tell you this a friend of mine his wife is a teacher and they have a problem in school with middle school kids who are taking tampons and they're dipping them in rubbing alcohol and stuffing them up their assholes food and they're getting high as fuck tampons rubbing alcohol you're an asshole apparently you just get blitzed get fucked up a tampon up your asshole with rubbing alcohol just get a tampon up her asshole first yeah I bet you do you know years of going a whole month with no booze I know how I know how he works Bert I bet you can't looks like a squid for each one of my family members initial results say this is an urban legend but there are apparently medical no no no

you can get dingleberries we can drink beer if we only do anal Chuck are you doing anal tug if you was the first to break sober October for sure I would I would do an anal Chuck if you have a sip of that I will do an anal chug okay let's let's talk about this what are the benefits she's sober this month are the benefits lack of a relationship with your wife I'm gone a month why I'm gone a whole

spearfishing videos she goes down to a hundred feet and chill are you gonna do it with no air well we're just know where it goes down and she was telling me that she just decided to get into it she was a Shaffer and she wasn't having fun so she got into it just one day bought a spear fish a spear thing just swam out and just was like what the fuck am i doing like this is the she was so out of her comfort zone that she felt and then she told a fish and she came and she felt so proud she was like I'm obsessed that's it I drop everything and then she went to the spirit fishing championships in like Nantucket right so she goes to Nantucket she's never been away from Hawaii and she gets out there and the water is black and she starts swimming down and she can't see anything and they're like trust me if you get down to the bottom 10 feet it clears up because all the muscles on the bar ground and she couldn't get down to the bottom she kept getting panic attacks so popping up going like I can't do it I can't do it and so the first day she didn't get anything in shake fuck it I'm not gonna be beaten by the ocean dives down gets down and it's clear as shit she's like shut the fuck

have issues which one guy was Unruh Nellis podcast was talking about as he got to the top of the boat there was a giant boil behind him and his friends saw this huge fucking great white shark that had come up to try to bite him then realize last minute that he wasn't a seal like a giant boil like water boil like Jimmy she's got she's got a shot with her and a great white shark he's her type Kimmy warned her great white shark and you just like yeah check this out I'm scared oh she's dead already she's beautiful she's pregnant now what happier babies you do Bert ya know she married give her male swimmers he jerked off in the water with it that's how it works Jesus is that her the white shark I'd shoot that thing right in the brain right from behind I'm sorry Sam great white sharks I've been in the water with my bunch and they move so fucking intensely like their their intent is almost like when you watch a cage fighter move like quick and you can't you I don't know how to stop that that's how great white sharks are just fucking they take a right so quick your little it's mind-boggling and you're like oh definitely it couldn't have been myself because remember when people used to kill sharks and everybody was excited yeah now you're a monster you know that's sir it's all that shark fin soup is so really really no I've never had it I had it once for real yeah a long time ago how did a Chinese restaurant I remember ordering that and it was before all the hubbub was before this big yeah all the bullshit about Shane Gillis before everybody was killing them and it was a big thing in the news I just thought it was like some shit you bought and was made out of shark's fins yeah I didn't know they cut the fins off and then throw the fish back yeah use it use the rest well that's the thing is they don't the money is in the fins and they don't give a fuck about that animal I really value that dead shark fins yeah super expensive that's dark but you know what the darkest shit is rhino horn that's the darkest shade because that doesn't even do anything lease shark's fin soup you're your absolute rim eating something because part of the thing of it is the fact that it's an exclusive delicacy right but the the rhino horn in some Asian cultures it doesn't do anything to you it's supposed to give you a hard-on but we all know that there's other stuff it works better than that but the rhino horn what it does do is it symbolizes your wealth and opulence that you can afford wrong rhino horn tea that's fucked up it's great but it's super fucking popular still really still rhinos are murdered every day for their fucking horns yeah it's crazy the elephants ooh right the elephant well the elephants for ivory though hmm which is more like for pretty things yeah but with rhino horns they chop their fucking horns off in these reserves they'll track them and chop their horns off so that they're not they're not like worth anything oh my god yes who does a bit Conservation conservationists will chop their goddamn horns on don't kill them don't they they also die their horns right so it looks like they're on no they die their horns I think I thought maybe they were doing it at us I don't know maybe maybe they did I do it makes it not as valuable all right I'm mixing up story yeah so what is yeah it makes sense they died in pink oh yeah so they're like oh no would be gay yeah I'm trying to get a heart but what drugs can't we do all of them you can smoke cigars cuz you guys smoke so we can drink alcohol at your bucho sure yes or not tell us what we're done or we could put vodka in kombucha our ari and I was saying while we're doing that suck but we did tell us to cigars John so then it's me and Tom going for the belt yes I guess Ari and I are

Tom and I keep going to keep you were saying I mean are you know I don't even have a problem drinking I think you dumb it it's very least you have a bit of a problem oh no problem tell you a fatty liver no mindful delivers perfect now I can tell to not spin glasses his livers perfect what were you trying to say though Joe I was trying to say you and I can just better ourselves that much better ourselves we could you know go to dinner with our ladies and and just have a nice glass of wine like a gentleman yeah a couple nights would you go for it a beer with your hot dog it's not a nice thing to have mostly chill it up when you're a Yankee game drink some beers with the guys or when you feel so much better if you went the whole month without it and then at the end then you could really appreciate it how do you even win it this month how do you win just beating you how would you beat me well how about me right how about me an REO back out and you to just go to town against each other but wait how are we going to town them what if Ari knows in most classes if Ari and I did most surprise emotional sobriety in most classes most sobriety so who could be so inside their type of sobriety definitely type of sobriety no but Tom could be sober easy easy that Tom's fucking dead inside what's your resting heart rate from when you're asleep did you see it no I haven't seen what's wrong Tom's is it's like 30 to 35 what does that mean well I mean Jerry low means it's boys horse on it means that if I lose 40 pounds I might be the most dynamic endurance athlete alive ever run a marathon yeah but fucking am nobody that's really low man well is yours show no where does it show it my resting heart rates I think I can always tie can just tell him I watch too no no no but when you sleep it's like you're true it was 1:30 1:31 I've got a really high heart rate today by the way where does it show it why is this thing it's like you think my app froze mm-hmm if we did back out what would you guys do how would you guys work things out but did you see whose belt it a seat Tom you would just beat Tom doing what doing yeah that you're not you're not most finding how you're gonna win more classes in him more classes more books hmm no not more books this is more books more I'll take more dynamic classes was that the higher level of class I'll take more like I'll do not just hot spin I'm gonna do like karate span I'm going to like every I'm gonna do is do the weirdest classes you can Transcendental Meditation okay I think if you do more classes than Tom you you would win the belt yes okay now you guys are not getting out of this you're not out mmm no go ahead drink it drink in it mm-hmm I know I really want a drink right now like I wouldn't have a drink if I wasn't tempted for this yeah but every minute the past that we don't drink it makes it like less more of a waste to not have a just drinking already where the fuck do you find yours you're really with it was I just saw it when I woke up and now I don't see it so I don't know where it is is it under strain coach Ari Shaffir jus come in Chicago November and San Jose as well Nashville this is so very tale it's so interesting how much I fear this thing tells you huh oh look at this sober October internal what is that living in our app how we have a group app did you see this Oh they've set it up for us if you go to sober October so how do we know mine is it shows you know yours isn't connected yet it just shows Burt and and Tom oh I see wait where do I see this I want to see this Joe I see it now I see your resting heart rate what is it where is it it's in that in that thing you slide over which thing the you go which one I don't know how to explain it man it says rhr resting heart rate but where do you see it I mean in within that internal thing right so I'm there and then but is this day strange I don't know swipe swipe like swipe over a page okay I see and then it says recovery HRV well my resting heart rates 27 what yeah HRP sleep performance 71% no that's up no no it's not it's not tell you something Joe mine says that your resting heart rate is 65 Oh mine says 61 mine 66 your says 78 on mine oh my see it so many other people's yeah 61 this is 61 to 74 that's the range but I guess it's giving me your what's your son Shawn so Brock toner ock toner Toto mu4 crusher so I'm winning right now you're really by being more fucked up than us 12.8 I've burned 2,100 calories yeah yeah but that's just moving your feet no that's a hot spin this morning da da dun dun dun don't don't yeah today I took the day off yeah I didn't do shit to you wait one last thing though well is there is there seriously like if we're all doing what we agreed to do right how can someone winner is it really the costs of extra classes well I mean let's get them it's gonna trigger that here's the thing if you want to pull out the fucking open the psycho door I don't want to open your door I I actually think last year you actually stopped liking me like halfway through I thought I think I was like bothering you I don't think you ever liked you you would look at me weird when you see me the side of your eye that's competition sir yeah I mean like that yeah I don't think we should do whoever does them extra click it's just gonna make everyone is gonna piss everybody off it's gonna piss the wives off for sure big time only a real problem and and we're look we already all have crazy travel schedules yeah listen we don't have to do that okay let's go extra so how can you win more pages really that's what I'm stealing it out there anyway but the problem is if we if he is a way to win you can't even just let you win put it to the side no I don't think so what if we made a caveat what's the caveat if Schober October winner doesn't have to defend his belt and that way you'll try really hard and that way we can get you out of this it doesn't have to defend the belt it's it's like the but you go but you win a new belt every year yeah well dafuq repels I'd want to stack a belt yeah you want to get the sub belt again otherwise you're just out of the competition I'd run all the belts I don't want anybody to win obvious we could have that caveat of a drink in class I would love a drink before you on my plane tonight yeah drink burn can we drink no you could have a drink what drink shouldn't be doing the drinking part we should say that for January why January because nothing's happening in January I think we should this the thing is this is a problem here's the problem we have got a bunch of other assholes that we don't even know invested in our little thing yeah yeah so that I can come with us upset with us if we just started if we just started drinking a little bit I can measure our fucking what days we're drinking problem we could stay sober and just eat edibles for the month networks how about your drug well sober used to mean alcohol it's it used to be just out long used to me now let's just stay alcohol-free and then see whatever and that's my thing just alcohol that's alcohol-free we got to wrap it so soon just almost five o'clock I don't know sure yeah meet Ari and I have a show tonight where you going comedy store nice comedy store restaurant and my clothes sold out chicken wings are fresh they're not even wings still like tenders no which is very very questionable you get a tender like where is it from like what part of the bird is the tender part so then let's let's let's get this solidified so we are all asses ten classes 500 pages we are in agreement and edibles under 20 milligrams and xanax and ambien just no alcohol no alcohol sober no alcohol if you want to do edibles under 20 milligrams on in sober so I don't sleep like this is that what you need it for that's right oh I don't want you to not get sleep bro thanks guys I want you to be healthy I like this fucking thing that monitor good song I don't mind I don't mind I don't mind edibles I won't use them yeah but I don't mind giving you guys a tables if you need that to get through right no I mean I don't really fuck I won't eat out of most studies I'm afraid well I'm not are you did you tell your doctor though that you're gonna dial back drinking I'd like to get through the month because if you do it cold turkey you can get really sick you get sick nobody you already know for that yes before I'm not trying a lot guys he's done it before the last two years yeah yeah but you always had medical no I never had medical supervision to dial back drinking yeah just stop you're not supposed to do this hey you know this is our fourth year of this shit what Thoreau no no you'll offer challenge okay and then we had years of sober October this is our fourth year of doing something crazy give me a weight limit give me a weight limit if I get to it I get to about five to a five I get to 205 by the end of shit to a five will do a hydration not oh yeah not a water bring in one Fc those one Fc championship people do it I think even if it cuts I mean how to 205 would be a miracle that would be amazing I'll tell you that right now I'll tell you this there is no competition however if you get to 205 you could hold on that belt for a year I do it because I'm the champ 205 yeah I say any to a fire and if you don't get there you have to go to therapy over a year I talked about your back it there because of you cunt you're already talking I've been out of therapy and then this fucking happens I had to talk to my therapist Jesus fucking jackass what'd I tell you about boarding stuff I feel healthier when I'm around you guys fix my brain I'll send you more of it it's really good this take before you go nominee by hours 5-htp it says take before bed yeah you can it helps no this was in your hands you keep it so ten classes ten classes and 500 page of a book all they all have to be different or just to fuck up and accidentally till morning 3:00 class every every drink the more in three of one class though no more I don't that doesn't mean anything to me if you want to take jiu-jitsu every day I think you still win just 10-car you still you still one thing but I think you should mix it up yeah I don't think you should have to that'll be the fun part I'll enjoy that because that whenever I go into new class we'll do an instant Ori hey guys I'm doing dope yoga if you want to do that you can do that but I think what's important is that you do something to better yourself whether it's I mean if you want to take ten tactical classes take that if you want to do ten yoga classes take that what did you 10 G Jitsu classes take that 500 pages of a book it can't be a children's book I think agreed 500 pages of one book any book we can blow it has to be two books I'm 500 pages of five different books if you want to just fuck I like doing that one of the things I like doing is I like reading a couple chapters of a book then I get bored I pick up another book you could also read this like big print you know huge print like crayon ten page books just a bunch of them yeah you could read Watchmen we all know no kind of real book
