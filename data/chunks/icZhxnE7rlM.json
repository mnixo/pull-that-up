everybody's saying it if people say it all the time when you see something fuckin crazy good googly moogly that must be brand-new it's a fairly recent one that Joey's been doing it for the past thing I'm sure it's an old saying Lex you remember the Sasquatch on a hat store what he went off about the Weeping Susquehanna weed we didn't know what the fuck that meant I think I bet good googly mooglies like that five some that dudes used to say to me I remember you remember good googly moogly I think they used to say on cartoons a lot actually like old ha now that you're saying that I kind of remember that yeah where did good okay let's google the origin of good googly moogly do you think that would uh possibly everything comes out man yeah right okay let's say the origin of good googly moogly yep urban dictionary Wow what do you what are you doing the commercial that has it on there for a while mr. Magoo would say something like that yeah I remember Mike I think my grandfather used to say it or something or it used to be in the old Looney Tunes or well it's in the urban dictionary and a phrase used when a real thick female walks by and you want to say damn they've basically co-opted it they hijacked it great googly-moogly horns how long is it gonna take for Joey Diaz to be like an a-list actor just a tremendous exactly right here's the origin here's the origin great googly googly mooglies in Frank Zappa song Nanook rubs it the song was released in 1974 play it the term is now used as an utterance of great surprise huh Wow I like Wanderers definition better yeah yeah well that's it works today that's the urban dictionary version so when you see a girl that's tree you can say something out loud good and yeah you could and it's not offensive how could a girl get pissed off at that especially if you're not looking at her yeah you know what rasaan hanging out with a couple brazilian guys and there's one brazilian guy that he says would his pickup line was my gosh a huge go my god that works in brazil great but not in the States my god that's all you needed Brazil that's all you're exactly you just grab them and you just take them what is it about Brazil that's there's way more girls in those countries like in Brazil and Argentina are very similar and that there's way more girls than there's guys in the beginning when we first started training jiu-jitsu with the Machado's we hear all these stories about Brazil and we all thought jiu-jitsu is as big as soccer in Brazil based on whatever sound and they'd say man when you go to Brazil 11 girls fabric guys incredible and why what so all these Americans and shit dudes it Carlos Machado skies all the Texas guys right we got to go to we got to go to Brazil so in 2000 and went it to check it all out and it's true there is a you just see that there's more girls and is that like statistically it's gotta because you see it and you even see it more in Argentina I was in Argentina 3 years ago and you see just droves and gangs of girls just all together but they react different to the situation in Argentina and in Brazil in Brazil it's it's a lot easier to make moves on chicks in Brazil but in Argentina it backfired so girls are in Argentina they're just like they don't trust dudes at all cuz dudes King can easily have multiple girlfriends and prostitution is totally legal so girls in Argentina are pissed off and they're like why should I trust you you're gonna definitely have other girlfriends and if I pissed you off you're gonna go right to the whorehouses prove to me that you you know so they're pissed off the girls that's that's my experience in Argentina that's the one argument I mean against prostitution is that it forces it allows rather guys to not be forced into relationships like how do you develop meaningful relationships and have children and all that jazz if there's legalized prostitution everywhere because if you've got a couple of bucks and someone starts talking shit you just go okay you know like you start going I don't need this I don't need I don't need someone in my life yelling at me just I can get my sex I could just go right over there I got the guy that was taking us around in Argentina we had a guide he said that it's very typical that you go out on a date with the chickee you just you know you try the civilians you try them out saying you know the the whorehouses are always gonna be there so he said he would just take a girl do a club and need to be dancing and if you know he'd start putting his hands on on the dance floor and trying to grab her ass and if she wasn't into it if she can't respond he would just say I'm going to the bathroom and just go right out and jump in a cab and go right to the whorehouse he had no patience no iske so that's why the girls are so pissed cuz girls are used to that girls are used to guys just saying okay I'm out you know they yeah they don't have to take anything off the bank basically what does that do to a culture that's very strange when you stop and think about it you know because I'm I'm a person that believes totally in personal freedom and I don't think there's anything wrong with someone being a prostitute if they want to be a prostitute I think if you work in a Denny's serving people food for fucking $3 an hour or someone says hey in getting a hundred bucks an hour you could fuck a bunch of nice guys you know why not why not do that I'm not saying that it should be something that people pursue but why is it okay just give someone a hug why is it okay to give someone a massage and it's not okay to suck their dick why is it you great point hey you could pay for a massage someone who doesn't want to touch you rubs on you for an hour and a half but you you telling me that the first of all we both know there are crazy girls out there that probably love to blow a bunch of guys all day they exist they do porn yeah I don't know why they exist but they exist you could say they exist because of abuse you could say they exist because of childhood neglect that's possible I agree but they exist and it's not like you're supporting that market by creating whore houses like the market that those people are going to be there no matter what you do unless you clean up Society so you're always going to have people that are off the rails why not that's is that the big ones yeah because you have to control the disease with a back massage you're not getting fucking AIDS well you know what crazy that you would think out of all the people on the planet hookers would be the first to get AIDS and it's they're not really crazy I don't know if anybody's really checking on hookers how you doing they are chat well you know you listen to that guy out in a podcast dude do his bird he said in Brazil virtually none of the hookers have AIDS I don't know if he's going down there with a fucking pap smear I don't know about Duesberg man I do not know I found his the conversation with him to be absolutely fascinating and very confusing and I you know use the phrase I hate it when I'm too dumb to know who's stupid you know I don't know if this one guy has it nailed and all these other doctors are out of their mind and they're all chasing a disease it doesn't exist that doesn't make enough sense to me it doesn't make enough sense when this guy starts talking about HIV and that HIV doesn't cause AIDS but yet everyone else thinks does like there's like serious peer-reviewed scientists that think it does so that's confuses a shit out of me he makes a lot of sense though it makes a lot of sense that's what Slater damn you know that debate him and Kalyn had I mean it seemed at the very end of that it seemed like as skeptical as Brian is it seemed like at the very end based on your podcast it sounded like he was starting to well to believe it's a bad situation first of all it's unfair because Brian is not a geneticist he has no no engineering background or no bio engineering background he has no idea what Duesberg does for a living like his concept of like how it all works is so rudimentary it's like four so for him to debate a guy like that it's not fair he shouldn't have been doing it I I wanted to have him on cuz smart dude and you should get someone eight Hamling yeah I tried nobody wants to do it it's really hard I hired one of the reasons why we started working with Matt Staggs is that very reason to be able to get guests like that to be able to get um you know use a publicist to reach out and let someone know there's a legitimate show we're trying to get to the bottom of something no one wanted to touch it no one one guy wanted to touch it and then he had all this backlash apparently from his peers people don't want you even debating Duesberg they think that it's almost like debating a Holocaust denier you know baiting someone you know who who believes really dangerous shit and so they think that his what his work has done has killed many many people I don't buy that though my problem with I don't buy I think the truth is somewhere in the middle but these these people that say you know dudes their burgers responsible for all these people in Africa and not taking their medication and all dying his points about Africa were really fascinating he was talking about how in Africa they say that everyone has AIDS but they're not testing for HIV they're they're assuming these people have AIDS because their immune system is trounced but you're also dealing with people that are exposed to a wide variety of other disorders and diseases and they have terrible terrible terrible nutrition and these people are not getting proper health care and when you see their sick if they have AIDS in quote at least you know that that qualifies for them to have funds for them to get funding if you're dealing with an AIDS epidemic you get money you get money from charities for an AIDS epidemic you don't get money you know based on the fact that people aren't eating right you don't get money based on the fact their immune system sucks because they're in a fucking tropical jungle I talked to this disease expert when I was doing that sci-fi show and he was said that people who live in jungles like people who live in tropical environments under percent of them have diseases 100% he's like they've all got something he goes everyone has something and I was like we mean like something's like there's all sorts of different diseases there's unjust undiagnosed diseases there's ailments that they just live with there's parasites that get in their system it's just it's just they get it that's what the Toxoplasma thing that we talked about yeah that's why it's like that that kind of how does the chick that lives in the Amazon jungle get into a river and not have vaginal parasites how is that possible they gotta be covered with vaginal parasites that must be a problem and the job we already have them from drinking water does it make their pussy feel better no it gives you feeds and worms in their dip-dip parasites dick leeches like I would say corners holes little tiny microscopic ones that you dudes pull out on their own and every time they're pulling out its down you're not joking around man there must be I'm just saying there must be no listen man when dudes piss in the Amazon they have to cover their dick you have to piss into your hand you got to cover your dick because fish will swim up your urethra Oh tapeworms coming have your penis hole that's not bullshit though they find your urine and they swim upriver into your dick and then they have to cut them out why do they need isn't it wouldn't it be easier if they weren't pissing dude the world is trying to kill you no but if you weren't pissing in your little yes lagoon isn't it easier they can't find the hole it follows the river of his piss swims up the river it's evolved follow the river I used to have a joke about that I didn't know there was a real disease that did that I should joke about it being at a strip club and peeing really hard because I was scared that the VD from the toilet was gonna swing upriver into my dick that's hilarious but I didn't know that they really got something actually does that free weed Rogan right there's a rat actually a fish that does that like a parasite oh I called swims you can't be banging Amazon chicks you know the kind of condom you would need you couldn't fucking nasa would have to make that condom made out levi's you don't have to be one of those condoms that that are actual shorts to to one piece they're like booty shorts and a condom all in one things and then you'd have to tape that the this it'd be too hard it's called the Candiru the Candiru is a toothpick fish or vampire fish a species of parasitic freshwater catfish ah native to the amazon basin where it's found in countries of Bolivia Brazil Colombia Ecuador and Peru Jesus Christ Oh swims Wow the smaller species are known for a tendency to invade alleged tendency to invade parasites and parasites the human urethra however despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century the first documented case of the removal of the Candiru from a human urethra did not occur until 1997 and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy uh-huh so it might be bullshit dude they might have anal catfish well look at that thing how's that gonna get in the tip of your dick unless you want it to my ships that could definitely get into vaginas yeah yeah fucking Amazon shit wow this is weird okay so this might totally be bullshit historical accounts earliest published reports of this Candiru attacking human hosts comes from the German biologist cfp von Martius in 1829 who never actually observed it but rather was told about it by the natives of the area including that men would tie a ligature around their penis Oh going into the river Dennis what happening you know that meant I meant dudes were they had cock rings on they got busted and they're like no no no there's a fish fry up your dude sound like we're about to take a trip into the Amazon and one dudes all into bang and Amazon chicks in here like dude look at this man no it's bullshit I totally believe it it makes sense yeah all that kind of does but it seems like there was only one case where we almost pulled out of a dude's dick maybe they just comfortable with them and they just they just know let's go Google up Candiru removed from dick it's probably that's what they're saying that's what they're saying they say punching Amazon girl vaginal parasite ooh here's something on AOL calm about an eel that's way up somebody's penis and they had to be surgically removed okay well hold on a second there's a fucking there's a penis removal video yeah dude oh my god go to this candy Rho penis removal operation Oh No yes yes yes get to that candy Rassi a nd iru penis removal operation good googly mooglies all I have to say this is fucking crazy man this is fucking crazy did you get it click on this way to see this shit they got one of them scopes so they're going down this guy's oh look he's got our fish he's got a little bit fish camped out inside his pecker you imagine in your fucking piss hole this oh my god it's got eyes it's a fucking fish Jesus Christ oh there's a fish in this guy's dick this is madness this is fucking madness this is a real thing this fish really does swim into your dick and you got to send this dude in there with a vacuum cleaner vacuum cleaner with a camera in the end of it to suck it out of there and then the fish is swimming away from your dick position in the Amazon Oh what it says what does this happen yes it said it lodged in the penis of Silvio Barbosa after urinating in the Arab Amazon River tributary dr. Anwar Samad removes the Candiru fish in a two hour operation dude he's got to keep going in there look at how many they're in there oh oh my god oh my god his it's like his ass is packed with dicks but it's not as his penis Packard fish could you just like put a poison hold them all that would kill your dick too stupid [Music] poisoning your dick what did it breaks your dick you got to let the bad man with the vacuum cleaner go in there and do his business well how did they deal with it before doctors they didn't they would just die they just died rotten yeah they just have a fish living in it dick you're not getting it out what are you gonna do you're gonna send a fucking fish hook in there may be a shaman could do something put a little baby can blow on it blow some that would probably wash get dust on oh this last year this last weekend's UFC you know hootsie do you know who is who yeah the he's aka striking coach no he's badass striking coach and I thought it was something lund des or something that's Xavier Mendes yeah he did some stuff with him to his I forget his last name but anyway he this dude got Kayode and he was like singing a song for him was it as fighters out no it was the other who's taking care of you know corners and check and so you know how they have a bunch of different guys who are trainers or Commission guys who Russian guys and who are you know taking care of various things like cut men stuff like that and they run in take care corners do various things so they're not that night he wasn't part right it wasn't what that guys with the Commission exactly so the I don't know you know his exact business he was doing there anyway when the dude was out he was singing them an ayahuasca song nice and I and I you know I talked to him about it he's like he's in the place of the dreams you know I tried to make him comfortable he's serious about it's pretty pretty intense you know he's uh he's an ayahuasca shaman so he'll he do he does like ceremonies and shit damn yeah so it was pretty cool how often do you see him all the time tell him I'm interested in doing a ceremony with us I'll do it yeah down we'll come down mr. wants to do him you know there was troubles really MMA fighters is he retired remember me I don't know but I was with him all weekend in China for Abu Dhabi did he compete yeah he did how did he do he did great he had four or five heel hooks he didn't win the gold medal in anything but he may have gotten third in his division do you notice about a scrapper tough dudes this year holy shit China stinks and if I never go back there again I mean that's stinks like literally like my bathroom and my hotel stunk like the sewer it was like the water they turn off the water and then they turn it on but the people are beautiful in China they're beautiful but they just have a problem in Beijing with their sewers man it's just whoo you walk down the street in every block and I whoa there's too many people someone died or did someone take a shit I don't know if it's that it's just old but Abu Dhabi was amazing the whole the tournament Jesus Christ there was so much so I mean you know um you know um one of my Brown boats fought a heavyweight division and he trained his ass off man he was ready he was on fire and we get a an unknown in the first round so we're thinking awesome we should beat this guy we didn't his last name was Dom Jarrod Dom we thought okay we should be able to beat this guy this cuz he could easily had cyborgs in the first round he could easily had buchecha in the first round that would have been fuck okay good luck you know but for people who don't understand sigh there's a bunch of cyborgs oh yeah you're only you only heard of cyborgs the woman fighter there's an MMA cyborg to her house her ex-husband is an MMA fighter named cyborg but there's a Roberto a bruise yeah yeah badass too dude he won the absolute he's amazing this guy impressed that shit out of me he's so big he's a fucking ox but he moves like a gazelle dude it was incredible there's a couple passes that he did just blew my mind I'm like running it I'm on the plane on the way back going over that pass I can't forget that pass I gotta analyze it was amazing tech there was at least ten different techniques right logged it in my brain I gotta go back and check that one out like kobrine a-- the guy who wanted all in the lightweight he finally beat half a mendes man half a mendes won the last two years he's virtually indestructible him and KO Brina were in the finals again and KO Brina won and he pulled it out a judge's decision at the end they couldn't sport or score any points on each other they just can't what do you think about those though there aren't those are weird when the judges make a score yeah well have a real problem with that well the one thing I love about Abu Dhabi is the Sheik is he's he's such a badass the she just decides to put together the best jiu-jitsu tournament on the planet he just makes it happen he pays for it it's all over all over the world one year it's in South Paolo one years in Barcelona it's an LA to China it's amazing the Sheikh just throws down and he makes it happen and he he created the rules and the format based on what he thought would be best for the entertainment value so he's down to evolve over the years he's tweaked stuff he's like the Japanese the Japanese and pride as soon as they recognize a problem they fucking change where people have no idea what we're talking about the Abu Dhabi is Abu Dhabi combat championships right a club they have the biggest jiu-jitsu nogi jiu-jitsu tournament in the world they have this huge thing and put together by yeah he is also part owner of the UFC and he's a black belt in jujitsu he's a huge fan I put together like this enormous grappling competition that's the most prestigious grappling event in the world and so Eddie was just there in China well let me finish what I was talking about the Sheik is we're talking about we're getting to the format the rules yeah so you know one of the coolest things that he changed was the same day weigh-in he changed that shit and not only is it's because generally especially in MMA and pro MMA you weigh in officially the day before and then you have 24 hours of recover so that's huge in deciding what weight category you're gonna compete in and how you're gonna lose the weight how you gonna its massive if you have to do a same-day weigh-in oh shit everything changes now you can't have that crazy diabolical cut that you're used to now it's a little different and the IBJJF changed it too they make it you weigh in right before you step on the mat and if you weigh even a pound over boom you're gone so Abu Dhabi the he he did the same thing you do not only is it same day wins but you gotta win but you gotta win the day before the day off and the next day if you make it to the third the third round you have to keep weighing in that's it because it seems kind of dangerous if you just did it right before you win because some guys would still probably push themselves yeah I mean it's risky because you see these high-level grapplers every now and then you see them gasp and they try to cut too much weight and you don't have that much time to recover so if you're gonna do a same-day way and especially Matt side weigh-in man you just gotta get in the best shape of your life and figure out what weight that is and you really that you really can't cut really or you're gonna pay for it you're gonna gas out and some people still take the chance though but with the rules the Sheik decided the best thing to do to ensure action most of the time because no matter how you put together the rules you're gonna not every match is gonna be exciting you have to accept that but you're always looking to make make the majority or you're striving for the majority of the matches to be exciting so in Abu Dhabi every tournament does shit different but Abu Dhabi they're ten minute matches the finals of 20 minute matches but in these 10 minute matches the first five minutes there's no points at all they don't count anything and those second five minutes that's when the points start and if you pull guard you lose a point so that that's huge when strategizing for a fight because when you're competing in this explain to people why the first five minutes there's no point that was that was instilled yeah that was instilled so that if there's no points you'd be fighters would would take more chances because generally if there's points counting all the time you don't want to take any chances one wrong slip dudes up two points now he's up he's just gonna hold he doesn't really think about the submission he's just trying to get to the next round so it changes the dynamics of your strategy and how it all plays out so the Sheik thought okay let's just try to shake it up first five minutes no points so the the fighters will take more chances and that turns into entertainment for the viewer so that happens sometimes with some fighters Jean Jacques Machado okay that he took advantage that he went out there pulled guard and got the party rolling he's like okay I'm gonna sit down you get on top let's go I'm not gonna spend five and it's trying to take you down I'm not a wrestler you wrestles your whole life let's just get the party started okay I'll let you get on top I'll kick the ball off to ya I'll let you receive first how about that that's all that is so in the first round guys will do that they're like am I gonna spend all my energy trying to take a do down it's not a wrestling competition so they sit down the problem is in the second half of the match if you decide to sit down you lose a point so the fight the ref goes points at five minutes so wherever you're at the next transition that you know like if you already have the guys back at that five minute mark they don't give you the points you have to lose the back and then get it back so there's a lot of weird stuff that I don't understand but but Gemma but again the point of this weird format is to make it better so the Sheik is always trying to make it better and the one thing I'm pretty sure he's going to he's got to change that losing a point if you pull guard because that changes a lot we saw a lot of not a lot but a couple of the finals where both jujitsu guys world class Jitsu guys like kobrine and hatha some of the two best guys in the world very good at submissions amazing at passing unbelievable beautiful jujitsu well you had in that match is nobody wanted to pull guard because in that in the finals you lose a point right away that'll give you it's not the first half no points but in that really good does come from guys just having shitty guards it comes from people not realizing how dangerous a guard is if a guy's a real bad motherfucker with it yeah and we saw that too one of the competitors came in he's a 22 year old kid him and his brother real famous they just got their black belts they're the Miao brothers or like Machida like half Japanese half Brazilian from Brazil yeah like a kitty cat yeah but it's like Sao Paolo meow not really like meow meow cat it could be but it's spelled I think am I why a is should get Brian a designer shirts well these guys all they do is pull guard and play della Hiva and spiral guard relentlessly they don't stop that's all they do the relentless they have an infinite amount of cardio and that's that's hist I sit here zero wrestling so that's why he lost he lost because BAM so what ends up happening with this rule set which was aimed at making it more entertaining but what's happening now and I'm sure the sheiks gonna see this because everyone's talking about it on the internet I'm not the only one everyone started everyone as they were watching everyone came to the same conclusion like oh there's a problem here hmm we got a problem the Sheik is one of those guys that will fix it and he's got to fix it because the problem was we have a co Brina and Hoffa in the finals and they never they never just try to take each other down and they couldn't cuz they're not wrestlers the wrestling's decent you know but according to do two no wrestling like do two wrestled in college they'll say they're at like a high school state champion level you know not d1 all-american Johnny Hendrix level right right a whole different animal so we end up getting is 20 minutes of two dudes who have okay wrestling you know ID 5 wrestling going at it and we don't see any jiu-jitsu cuz no I don't want anyone down I don't want to pull guard oh yeah yeah it's way easier to not get taken down than to take someone down it's way easier like if your whole focus is I'm not gonna get taken down and you're gonna take me down even if you wrestled in college and I don't wrestle cause it's still gonna be hard for you to of course I have to work on it but you can get that takedown defense a lot quicker than you can exactly exactly takedown ability man that's it no no a long time sprawling can come easier so what you end up having is two dudes that were wrestling for a very long time they got to the ground briefly a couple times and they went to double overtime triple / - it went forever at the very end 0 0 the rough makes the decision and gave it to Cabrini so how does that work how can a reformation like that that's what the initial that's how we got started off I don't that doesn't make any sense to me I don't buy that yeah how is that guy walk away with a win I mean I understand that they were you know they're the elite of the elite and two of the best the world I guess someone has to win yeah but that doesn't make any sense yeah yeah the rules need revamping and I'm quite positive that the Sheik is gonna take that because what you end up happening if you don't lose a point for pulling guard it's you know losing a point for pulling guards like this I I use a football analogy when I'm trying to explain jujitsu to someone who doesn't know anything about jujitsu do you understand that the rules of football in the strategy most Americans do so it's just like football there's generally a guy has a ball and the team has the ball and I'm marching down the field and then a team is defending trying not to let the march down the field same thing guy on top and jujitsu is trying to march down the field gone bottom is playing defense he the guy on defense can score but it's not it's a lot easier to score when you're on top and you can use your way cuz you have it's like you have the ball you're scoring but the defensive football team can intercept and run back for a touchdown they can't score some teams are very high so but it's rare same thing with the bottom it's rather there's guys that can score a lot off their back but generally you want to be on top you want to have the ball if you're on top you're in someone's open guard it's like you're on the 20-yard line you get on the top half you're like at the 50-yard line you pass the side control you can score from side control but it's a lot easier if you score from the back so side controls like the 35 yard line the amount is like the 20 yard like now you're in the red zone and if you get to do its back first and go on the 10 that's basically it's the same thing you're marching down the field you're getting into scoring position yes you can score from midfield you know you could score from top half you could throw a guillotine you can throw Darcis but it's easier when you're on their back it's easier when you're right there under 10 yard-line so in football the way they start the game as the ref flips a coin someone one of the team's picks heads or tails and I think it's the visiting team and then if it's heads whoever wins the coin toss gets to decide who receives and who kicks off generally a large percentage of the time if you win the coin toss you say we're gonna receive and you're gonna kick off we're gonna be on offense for you're gonna be on defense first I'm gonna be on top and you're open guard you're gonna be on the bottom you flip a coin you have to choose fuck yeah generally I would toss out wait a minute wait a minute so you're saying that you should do a match where you flip a coin decide no no no no no no what I'm saying is what I'm saying is so sometimes a team will choose to kick off and not receive that's kind of like if we're gonna grapple and I sit down I chose to play defense first that's what a guard puller is it doesn't happen that often so it's penalizing someone one point for sitting on their butt for letting the guy get on top he's working to get on top he worked very hard on his wrestling to get on top the dude is saying I'm kicking off to you you received I'm gonna let you go first that's like like a team saying we're gonna kick off to you and losing three points for it like you you're already giving them an advantage you're gonna lose lose the advantage and points doesn't make any sense Youngstown as I could see yeah I could see if so say if they don't have points you know they don't score points you know what they're their idea of advantage maybe you could say you could give someone an advantage if a guy pulled guard it's still a point because if you give an advantage you're still one zero zero with the guy who has the advantage really it should be it should be laughing it should be like this is she there to be submission only that's it and you have overtime rounds and I could explain that if you want here but generally have submission only no points no advantages it's all about who gets the submission the whole goal is to get submission because in a lot of there was epic matches there's incredible athletes I have respect for all of them but when you're under this rule set you there's a lot of times in these matches where the submission wasn't even a thought just the W there were matches where like three minutes left guys sat on his ass he loses a point now I'm on top I want to win that money at the end cuz the winner of each division wins $10,000 he's the guy on top automatically is gonna be very cautious reserved and be aggressive and definitely not even consider a submission it's all about the W so that changes the entertainment value and for me that's the most important do you think that it should be just submission only it's either submission only or you really really break down the point system for the way it should be and this is the way it should be like um in Dean Lister's match against I forget who he lost there were so many matches but he was down on points and at the very end he put I think it was you our sis he put him in a triangle he had him in a sense triangle at the very end and he was down by two points maybe three I'm not sure on the points but but he was down it was 30 seconds put him in a triangle in in my eyes a triangle you should get more us anything cinched like a triangle a figure if your legs are cinched like you have a guy in a triangle doesn't mean he's gonna tap a lot of times some guys escape but if it's totally cinch that guy was in deep deep trouble if he escapes he got lucky so that that since triangle should represent way more than a pass or a sweep that's just common sense so in my eyes if you want to score keep the scoring system and you you're in love with you're gonna commit to the scoring system really think about the score how you score this if a pass is three points if a sweep is two points a cinched Darce which people escape half the time but if you cinch it all the way up and as a referee you should see if it's a near sub if it's a cinch stars a cinch triangle a cinched arm triangle a straightened out arm like you straighten the guy's arm and you escaped by the skin of his teeth you straightened out his leg like a knee bar he escaped by the skin of his teeth you can see that I wouldn't count heel hook and toehold attempts cuz then that would you know they're so easy to just to jump on and then it turns into just a bunch of footsies but if you I would count in my world I would count so straight knee bars straight arm bars anything cinched any kind of that should be seven points yeah I agree with you son I think it should five something yeah yeah a pass what is it now it's one do you know anything cinched is not an Abu Dhabi there's nothing but it means nothing wait a minute it means not that doesn't make any sense it doesn't mean anything so if a guy is a cinched in triangle that's not a near submission that's terrible Sharyn abhi it should be worth way more than a sweep oh yeah without a doubt yeah well you look sweeps you know people recover from sweeps but if someone has you that close to being tapped like a cinch three or naked or some long those lines it's like a goal yeah you might touched it you got out of it but god damn my god I got to a incredibly dominant position exactly that should be and Naga is into evolution and so is grapplers quest grapplers quest sirtuin selected superfight submission only so submission only is starting to spread the gracie nationals is submission only gracie world is submission only sub league up in the Pacific Northwest is a submission only Midwest submission challenge which are doing submission only tournaments all over the Midwest it's growing it's growing but if you're still committed to points like nagas nugget they did that change up and tweaked the point system they are giving I think one point maybe two for a near sub which they're on the right track your honor whoever's running Naga you Kip caller you're definitely on the right track let's turn it up a little bit more let's make cinch Darcis cinch triangles seven points it makes sense that's like a touchdown a sweep is - yeah no I agree with you we're both on the same page so besides that the the tournament Abu Dhabi ADCC is the most prestigious on the planet if it wasn't for that tournament I wouldn't be sitting here that's for damn sure it just seems like those rules are just they need to be revised ya know tell me about Kron Gracie that's what I was about to tell you read my mind no I'm looking at a video of him Kron Gracie versus Gary tonin Gary tonin's a 21 year old dude who he shocked everybody that match was probably the greatest grappling match of all time Gary tonot racing Gracie gets his arm straightens it out it look he looks like he's gonna break Euler alert well but you know what I'll get it no no trust me it doesn't even matter he's straighten his arm out he wouldn't tap they kept rolling straightness on my everyone's going nuts he's wrong he's wrong everywhere he rolls the arm cron is right there every angle with the arm totally straight it looked like it's gonna break everybody's going oh hey he didn't just hold it and escape do they were rolling all over the place and that arm should have broke off too he survived he didn't Tom gets on top takes crumbs back Oh puts him in the truck almost has cron in a twister my cron spins out he goes back to the back puts an anaconda on I'm a ka triangle body lock on him has cron face down it looks over Hickson sitting there going oh damn and in the first match that was cron second match in his first match Kron demolished Andy when I love you Andy when but he went right through him like in 30 seconds and Hickson didn't even move he's sitting there and he went right through Andy Wang and Hicks and any move and I was like looking at Hicks and I'm like man that's way doper than getting all excited him not doing anything like he expects it it's no big deal you're you went right through him the best possible outcome Hickson didn't even make a move like Yoda and I I admired that I'm like wow that's it's deep right there he's not even happy not even a smile but in this match Hickson was like visibly shaking you could see him going what he's watching and where's this kid come out I think he's from the East Coast I'm not sure but he was on that BJJ kumite thing with Keenan Cornelius who also did amazing at Abu Dhabi but anyways back to Garrett G there's a minute left and at this point a minute and a half and cron is doing everything to try to escape yours you were watching cron be defeated right now we're watching him be defeated after you almost had that dude's arm like five different times come on struggling he can't get out Gary tonin's back defenses or back control is professional assassin like Kron cannot get out but by the skin of his teeth I have to see it again I don't know exactly I got but he got out they stand up Hickson looks at him goes you got one minute Kron turns around dude takes them down passes this guard it takes a while he gets his back dude he scores with two seconds left Gary taps Wow it was the craziest submission match I've ever seen it's really fascinating watching Kron for people who don't know his dad is the greatest jujitsu guy of all time there's one guy that's always thought of above all others in the world of Jiu Jitsu it's Hickson grace you gotta have him on his pocket I would love to have a bond it would be easy it would be lives in Brazil now doesn't he he's here I don't no idea right you're right I don't know I figured out I'll get in touch with cross outfly I'm in first class last time I saw Kron it was at when boys fought Matt Hughes in LA and that was like oh seven or six yeah he was a young kid he was really young that was right after I had dinner with Hickson once and I went to his house and watch fights and he broke down what people are doing wrong dude you know crazy that is you went to Hickson's house hung out with them watched fights and broke down fights I remember you telling me this yeah you were telling me you you broke down because phaidor at them at the moment was the mister indestructible yeah he was on top everyone feared him Nixon wanted to fight him yeah and he yeah he broke down how to beat fate on his mind right oh yeah oh he thought he could be fate or he thinks he could beat anyone he's a monster yeah he's a scary dude when you when you well he's a master he's a true master jiu jitsu yeah and he's got like that samurai mindset a lot of people talk that samurai mindset that fucking dude lives it like that is his mindset yeah the Gracie family is very large and there's a lot of sections a lot of greasy clicks there's a Carlsen side there's the Carlos side there's the Helio side the hell since I uh and a lot of them hate each other a lot of them talk a lot of crap on each other but Hickson man mm-hmm I don't know how many times I've heard people say fuck that great like Gracie said fuck that Gracie or no or a Brazilian or someone from the old school like all the old school guys but then then that they'll always say except Hickson they make they tell you except tix it like Alan goes Alan goes there's a he has a lot of problems with people huh but he makes it clear he goes but Hickson's awesome Hickson's cuz they all say if they all agree that although there's no roles on video like now everyone has their roles on video you could get them on YouTube like you catch Marcello's roles all day the greatest jiu-jitsu player ever but Hickson not too many roles but everyone sets all look like myth it's all legend but you got to believe because everyone says the same thing even David Camarillo when he went down there and David Cameron real is a world-class black though he said he couldn't do anything with Hickson yeah even Paulo filo said that Paolo Fela went down there and came back and was like Jesus Christ yeah it's he's a master in the brazilian jiu-jitsu community Hickson is a god he's the best gracie hands-down yeah so he had two sons and one of them hawksin died a few years back and he was already on his way to being a badass jiu-jitsu gap player and his youngest son Kwan over the last couple years has just become this fucking beats Hickson son and I remember when he was 12 outside of a jiu-jitsu tournament some IBJJF tournament and Dominguez State Hills here in California me and John Jacques my master John Jacques Machado we were outside he was you know basically giving me a sermon like he always does like everything that comes out of his mouth is gospel and everything's perfect and he just has like a superhero and we're walking outside and krons 12:00 at this time he's messing around on a skateboard jumping up doing the skateboard tricks and John John look Jean Jacques looks over at him and says that's the one right there I tell you that is the one he's gonna unstoppable I never forget that he called it out and Jean Jacques also he's called out a lot of people who you thought were gonna be legends and jean-jacques said he doesn't have what it takes he's gonna break and like no way Jean Jacques you say watch him break he's brain and damn he was right there was a couple that he called out that broke and they just disappeared so Jacque concede things all facts on shock it really is Yoda yeah and he he called how cron he knew it and cron he is now in a select group that man I don't know if there's more than three or four but he submitted everybody in his weight division he tapped everybody out and here's another Nixon story oh well Jean Jacques Machado was the first to tap everyone out back in 99 or 2000 one of those Abu Dhabi's 98 99 John Jacques Machado shows up to Abu Dhabi he's the first superstar back then everyone was having trouble with the submissions a lot of the key champions we're having a little trouble submitting dudes without the ghee and the wrestlers they didn't want to pass the guard or submit anybody but they could throw you around and you ain't taking them down so a lot of lot of boring matches in the early Abu Dhabi and that's why the she kept changing the rules tryna trying to work work it all out but then the next God who came and just submitted everybody in 2003 was marcelo garcia he was the the second coming of jean jacques first I was John Shaw marcelo garcia and now you know there have been other guys that have had a bunch of submissions and abu dhabi to hydra Gracie's done tremendous job so many good guys out there but as far as coming in and just submitting everybody in your division maybe Hajer did it too I don't know but Kron Gracie did it last weekend he went through everybody and I get you know the Gary tonin fight that was a close one man he escaped by the skin of his teeth but that showed how awesome he is and and how we can come back and in the final you know first we have Hickson the first first couple matches he's just real chill Zen and then when he beat Gary toen and you see Hicks and jumping up yeah I never seen Hickson so happy Gary was trying to get him from the twister without actually he was trying to get the twister before he even got the lockdown on the back leg he was like he was thinking about it early he was thinking about pudding like is yeah as the body triangles wrapped around him he's thinking of ground yes neck yeah where's this Katrina Gary tonin look about t OU n o n do that transition we took Ron's back is insane and not only you know what Gary tonin did he ended up doing the absolute and it's the first round he went against buchecha which who's who won the heavyweight division who is considered the best new heavyweight dude moves like a panther boo Shesha is i think his name is marco Almeida man you know some of these Brazilians I know him by their nickname but the real name is uh it's hard to remember sometimes but booboo Shasha he he wins his head the heavyweight division now he signs up for the absolute first round it's Gary tonin who's 170 pounds against bush Esha who just won the heavyweight that's the worst possible drop the smallest guy gets the biggest guy and you know what Boosh Escher couldn't tap him it was a good match which I got all sorts of position on him but Gary kept recovering and Gary kept attacking and then so he loses that right on points but he didn't get put away and the guy was talking about earlier Jared Dom the guy who beat Amir he ended up beating Amir and we were like fuck man we got an unknown it was perfect we should have beat this guy was a close match Amir had his back for a second but didn't get points he had him in a Kimura didn't get points for any of that and the guy took him down want some passes guard and Amir lost some points and and it was kind of a shocker I was the first round like damn we who is we got a got a guy that no one knows that we should have beat him damn then he gets a Vinny Magalhaes the next round Jarrod Dom she beats Vinnie whoa so then we're like thinking any loss then he got beat by the guy that beat Amir do you think that's cause Vinnie's doing so much am i man it's not Vinnie was not in shape for this Vinnie he he admitted it to me he didn't train very much at all he just couldn't turn it down you know I'm sure it had a lot to do with him getting cut by the UFC and not really fucked with his mind for a while to the last fight was hard yeah a knocked out with the first punch that uh homeboy through yeah and he never expected that he fought Australian gentleman the folks his name Anthony Perosh yeah Anthony Perosh who's a black belt in jujitsu and that's what a lot of people expect it they thought it was gonna be a to versa jujitsu battle yeah and he caught Vinny like the first punch he gets he gets cut he's in a depressive state he's not really training hard for Abu Dhabi and Jared got beat him he's from Rafael Lovato's camp he's a purple belt that's incredible yeah so he's just a incredible specimen so he gets cyborg next he gets cyborg next and he is winning he's beating him all he's got to do is survive for 30 more seconds he would it be a mere alum the top ten planet heavyweight Vinny Magalhaes who won the gold medal in the APA's absolute in 2011 and then cyborg he was gonna be cyborg he would have but at the very end cyborg pulled it off and he impressed the shit I mean cyborg ended up winning he ended up getting third in his weight Busha one and in the absolute cyborg took it all he beat Busha in the finals it was I mean what did cyborg catch him with he beat him on points I'll catch you it now he's just points so so he was losing until the last few minutes Jaradat was beating him on points and then I forget how it went down again there was 50 batches but Desai all I remember cyborg came back at the very end and jarred Dom couldn't hold he had it he just could hold on and cyborg pulled it out of his ass got some points I think he took his back or something got some some some good points and barely pulled it off he was his I mean and then Jared op did the absolute and he beats his first guy and maybe a second guy then he gets hurt he has to bow out his shoulder shirt he was gonna get a rematch with cyborg in the absolutes yeah but you know since he couldn't go Gary tone in 170 pounder a good loss against bouche a boo who gave him again a great match they call him and go dude you're in and he's like oh shit so now he's going to get cyborg who's like 240 pounds of pure leopard you know have like tiger yeah he's built like a brick shithouse oh yeah it's videos of him training strengthing auditioning online yeah push it and you know what he Gary tone and look great Manny he was given cyborg fits that guy's gonna be a superstar my words yes just remember Gary tonin for being that big and he's given it must be how young is this kid 21 strong as shit that's amazing yeah he's not even a big guy yeah I looked at the video at him and cross dude looks like a normal sized guy he's out of control and he plays his his best shit is part of a same style that I play Gary tonin plays a lot of prison guard I don't know if he calls a prison guard that's just what I named it but it's it's like a head and arm from the bottom it's basically a greco-roman full guard game that's what I call it prison guard there's a brown belt yeah yeah yeah and oh the way he got crumbs back the way he got it was to the prison guard and again it's it's not something that I'm sure he names it but it is something that I named and it's ahead and arm from the top from the bottom and you squeeze on it and you shuck that arm that's caught in between your arms you shuck it over your head you got to get really good at that and you get you can go right to the back or you could transition to swim move to spiderweb or if you can't shuck the arm over your head you could transition right into rubber guard beautifully or you could put the far side butterfly in and get some sweep so it's a very very strong position the actual position the whole style I call prison guard but the actual positions called homie control and homie control is the Mission Control of prison guards so I play it all the time all the time and watching Gary tonin go to it over and over did it to cyborg he would decide where it was too big it didn't really work on him and then he did it on boo shesha he kept trying I don't know prison guards gonna work on a guy that has a hundred pounds on here or something but he kept going to it so a lookout for Gary tonin yeah it sounds like kids a beast I love that I love with all these new dudes or just coming up out of nowhere yeah that's one of the cool things about jujitsu is that there's so many guys out there practicing it now yeah I think someone it's about time for someone to put it on TV I think one of these days they're gonna figure out a format or the guys are gonna get talented enough or scary enough where you're gonna be able to put it on TV and it'll have something I don't I think about that all the time and and I've had invest I've have a show that it's it's a concept we had financial backers that were interested and then they back out we had a couple other more that we're interested in they back out they're not sure but the whole goal of mine with this show is a 16-man tournament the whole goal is entertainment value and everything is designed to scored it's a submission only format there's a few different ways you can go as submission only but the way everything in my mind was all designed to create urgency for the submission like the like for example the ultimate urgency would be you do a submission only match between two guys and the winner gets one billion dollars the loser gets nothing you imagined urgency of that and how exciting that obviously you don't really mean a billion dollar I'm just saying I'm just that's that's an example if you could give them a billion that would be great but let's say realistically in 50 years 100 years two years jiu-jitsu is mainstream there's like some reality show about jiu-jitsu and it gets so big and people love it but we we have to figure out the right format first to make sure that there's a lot of excitement because right now you know you go to jiu-jitsu tournaments there's nobody there the only people in the stands are the actual competitors and their girlfriends and maybe their moms it we've been having these World Championships forever nobody's going to see it because the point system is developed to satisfy the competitor what's a little bit of that but it's also that hasn't been introduced right yeah it hasn't been introduced at all you know now that spike is starting to put glory on that yeah look like the highest level kickboxing they're putting down on TV I think one of these days someone's gonna realize that watch like that Kron Gracie Gary's opponent fight yeah that kind of a match it's very exciting let's say that okay realistically 50 years or whatever jiu-jitsu is mainstream you could do a show where there's the 16 man tournament submission only and the winner one winner only it's just like any kind of reality show one winner gets $100,000 - or whatever that's not that unrealistic can you imagine the excitement of those matches you'd have a good matchmaker you put together you know you don't just throw people together but the X the amount of urgency that there's gonna be for the submission the training would be totally different people would be specifically training their setups - these submissions it would be all about the submission right now these guys getting the W and winning by points is all that's necessary so guys are specifically training for the point system and I'm guilty of it - I mean I mean if that's this if that's the format there's how the I understand because I do the same thing with the mirror alarm he wrestled his whole life he's one of my brown belts but he's a wrestler through and through so we were gonna go in and just say you're a wrestler he worked on his wrestling let's beat these guys by the point system let's get that W I was doing that I'm not like this you know you're forced to think like that based on the system because you want the W so bad so I'm guilty of it too we were we were we wanted to wrestle Jerry Bob so you know you uh you make it a 16-man tournament eight-man tournament you make it a reality show submission only one guy gets $100,000 I mean if you did what I do you know if you did a million I would even be crazier the matches would be not full yeah all you'd have to do is just have guys who are really good we're going for submissions and going after it and you would be a really exciting sport a lot more exciting than a lot of shit that is on on TV it's just people just don't know about they're just not used to it yeah it could be done someone just like someone like to shake yeah you know figure out how to do it yeah you know it's it's uh you know and there's a lot of people that get they look into jujitsu and then they watch a match and go fuck this this is boring they're just the way the gay sport is turning into now it's like I'm a black belt in the Gihon I look at the new stuff I don't even know who's on top I have no idea who's winning they're playing tug of war with the pants and they're in this mangled tangled position that I don't even know who has the advantage someone got an advantage for a near sweep I know who did I'm one of the things I want to ask you about Kron he doesn't do any new shit like everything he does is old-school jujitsu old-school Hicks and Gracie style the the you know that that real basic set of techniques and just it just gets some laser sharp that's all he does he has an incredible rear naked choke and even more insane guillotine in the final he went again Soto otávio Sousa he's one of the the top Gracie Baja guy at that weight at 170 and Oh getting to this match right so it's the finals Hicks and Gracie sitting there Ronen otávio they're going at it Oh tabby Oh decides to get inside Cron's head and the way he's gonna do that is keep staying away from them not engage slap him on the neck push him away frustrate him cuz all Kron wants is submission right he's like marcelo garcia he just goes forward the submission is on Cron's mine right you know for damn sure that's what he wants and he kept going forward Oh Taylor keeps pushing oh he's a bad motherfucker he get pushy beat Lee oh yeah I mean he's he's legit one of the best and he actually they went against each other in metamoris and cron beat him in the gehe armbar Odom it was it was an epic match and the match before that at the world octavio one so metamoris was a rematch he got revenge now the rubber match in Abu Dhabi in the final he's smacking his head and Cron's looking over at the ref corner you know what is he doing just smacking my neck and he keeps walking backwards I understood what octavia was doing he was trying to frustrate him get inside a setting it was working he was getting pissed off but you know what it was also working on Hicks and to Hickson said hey and this is a courting I didn't hear it personally but this is according to what I heard the reports feed the reporters it's all over the internet so I may be wrong but it appears to be correct based on the reports I read that Dixon was at first he was like telling the referee he keeps he keeps going backwards he's not engaging he keeps going backwards he's he doesn't even want to fight and then he said he's chicken he's chicken and then he starts making chicken noises so you imagine doing that is that crazy you know what that tells you man you know there are some people out there that don't understand that but as a father I understand it I do it's like your that's your son you're gonna make sure I got my son murdered somebody I'm gonna shelter him I'm gonna hide him you know know what I'm saying no what I'm saying is you'd do anything for your I know even even doing making chicken noises that they could easily make you seem like you're childish yeah but he don't care all he cares about are you macho he was willing to do anything it took to make octavio engage and it worked he engaged took the shot grande guillotine de the fastest the guillotine ever as soon as he took him down cross that down boom it was over man I don't know if it's on line but it was over like it's three seconds or less less than three seconds bum he won the world championship submitted everybody that's amazing it's just amazing when you you hear about a guy who's the son of the great master like the greatest master ever it's almost like a movie yeah you know yeah and when he was young you know like I remember hanging out with him over at Hickson's house you know it's just like a young kid he was talking about rap music and shit and of course he trained jujitsu he loved you just so he loved the fact that his dad was this you know I mean imagine if that's your dad he's the greatest jujitsu guy of all time it's gotta be the coolest shit ever and he's right he's currently the baddest guy in Abu Dhabi for it's amazing and young and you know what no homo or anything but like that guys he's a beautiful man was wife was beautiful hixton's wife is beautiful beautiful Hickson marrying some supermodel back in the day and they had a bunch of kids and all their kids even hawksin and their daughters they all have perfect little model faces in their tan yeah he he could easily be a movie star they're models as kids like Abercrombie and Fitch model so well when he was in that that documentary choke if that documentary it's really unfortunate that that didn't become a huge documentary because even people who don't appreciate martial arts you just want to watch something interesting like people keep telling me about the sushi documentary Jen jiro Dreams of Sushi or whatever the fuck it's called it's supposed to be amazing about a guy who's like really into sushi but I'm not into sushi I'm not about jaian to be a sushi chef and hate it but if you even if you have no aspirations towards martial-arts choke is an amazing documentary because it follows this guy who's just he's just the he's legit he's legit masterful and everything he does I mean they dude is a he's meditating in the fucking freezing icy rivers of Japan gets underwater up to his neck and he's you know he's doing his meditation practicing and doing yoga where does this weird shit with his stomach and he's it's cool when a guy like that exists when there really is a bad motherfucker like a real like mystical sort of a shaman Brazilian Jiu Jitsu master who's better than everybody else and that reminds me of the most surreal moment of my jujitsu career man was at Abu Dhabi at the first way and Hickson comes up to me and says hey Eddie how you doing my head almost exploded I couldn't believe him saying Eddie yes very strange he knew who you were yeah because you know cron Khurana and jean-jacques are real tight jean-jacques is now a choral belt under Hicks and Gracie so Hicks and Gracie is John jocks master now and he used to be Gracie Baja and under Carlinhos and on him but now he's he's under Hickson and jean-jacques always been tight with cron that's how he had that insight that's how he knew he was going to be a champion the champion that he is so Jean Jacques brought Kron over to my gym maybe two weeks ago and that was the first time I ever got to hang out with cron and train with them and it was it was pretty amazing to have Hickson son there and any time I have a Gracie there with me that I could talk to him I always I always want to remind them that there's a big misconception about what ten planet Jiu Jitsu is all about and to someone who really doesn't know and hasn't done the research it's easy to it's easy to kind of see it all or easy to believe that I turn my back on Jiu Jitsu once I got my black belt I threw the gear away disrespectful to the ghee nobody understands this if it would they don't follow jiu-jitsu but there's a two scamp's of jiu-jitsu there's people who train with aggi this you know big bulky kimono thing and there's no ghee which is mostly guys wear rash guards or shorts and their training basically techniques that would work in mixed martial arts because of the fact that the ghee is this big piece of cloth people grab it and hold on to it and it it really changes the entire nature of of grappling changes everything because if although you have all these handles that you can hold on to it becomes really annoying yeah and a majority of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu community they really like the ghee and I understand that it's like liking long boards and your surfer and some people like short boards nogi would be like the short board and long board to be like the key it's really traditional it looks cool you grow up and you see these karate movies and you want to wear that gang you strap that black belt on and you got a key you feel like a superhero that black belt is real I get it I understand but I got into jiu-jitsu because of the UFC I became a fanatic of the UFC and jiu-jitsu is the closest thing I could do to be kind of close to the sport and understand the sport without getting hit in the face I don't like boxing I don't like kickboxing I don't want to get hit but it jiu-jitsu is awesome it's safe you know you're doing is practicing strangling each other and getting really good at that and practicing breaking limbs like who doesn't want to learn that anybody can learn that and you and you don't get hurt no one's punching you I I was sold right when I saw the UFC it was a way for me to be close to the UFC the sport that I worship now so when I see jiu-jitsu black belts in the UFC great with the guy but all of a sudden they're fighting in the UFC without a key and now they don't have their handles and dudes are trying to punch him and there's elbows and all that stuff to me I thought the key was the prom jiu-jitsu wasn't looking that good in the UFC man in those dark ages like UFC seventeen like even today overall the jiu-jitsu I think could be a lot better if the if everyone's focused on jiu-jitsu techniques that worked when specifically when dudes are trying to punch you or elbow you and you know and there's no handles it's different so anyways so I was I loved jujitsu so much then I I was tired of being an let down by never seeing you rarely see sweeps and the UFC you go to a jiu-jitsu class or Jiu Jitsu tournament where there were Nicky you see sweeps and submissions for off your back from the guard when you're on your back all the time but why weren't you seeing it in the UFC I go you rarely see sweeps and even today when you see a good-quality sweep it's Wu it's a highlight reel that was an amazing suite but in the ghee that happened all the time and submissions off the back happen all the time so the difference is it's just common sense in the ghee you don't have to worry about dudes elbowing you and you've got all these handles and you develop all these techniques based on pulling the collar and holding on the sleeve and that becomes your fighting stance right and when if that's your fighting stance and all of a sudden you do and the may and there's no fight the fighting stance is totally different your clinching out because you don't want to get knocked out you got to focus on that so for me I thought man if I ever opened up a school I'm gonna I'm I never liked the key to begin with person personally I'd rather train no key it's faster I like it faster I have no problems with the key a lot of my students they'll training the key personally it's just too slow for me I needed to be faster so when I have said a lot of people in the jiu-jitsu community think that I turned my back on jiu-jitsu man nothing could be further from the truth I don't think no no just a bunch of haters out there there's people that hate no matter what you do but there's no need to focus on them no I just I just wanted to make it clear and when Kron came to my school two weeks ago I made it clear to him like I just want to let you know that I have all the respect in the world for the Gracie's anybody that thinks I don't is ridiculous I mean in my first book that came out of 2005 it opens up with a paragraph or two on each Gracie and thanking them for for creating me and creating the sport and the UFC so and that's over that's like 10 years ago it's not anything that I'm trying to I'm trying to do damage control and hell or anything so I just wanted to put that out there that that uh you don't have to put that up and nobody believes that hey um what do you think about the UFC this weekend incredible was of the craziest GOC ever yeah it was going on right when I would I was going on it was going on at Saturday or Sunday morning was it Sunday morning and it was Saturday morning here or something like that it was like it was weird so I didn't get to see it live and I don't think it was possible to see it I've landed up seeing it the next day Amir and Scott Palmer another one of my students who went they figured out how to find it somewhere online she watched online yeah yeah the Diego Sanchez Gilbert Melendez fight was the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life yeah it was madness especially that third round god damn that was incredible he isn't they just went off they just went after it in a way like you very rarely see and for Diego to drop Gilbert Melendez with that uppercut yeah after all that damage he was taken yeah man there we saw some serious heart that night I mean Junior dos Santos that talk about heart yeah Jesus Christ yeah Diego Sanchez is a special dude he's his belief in himself and his ability to absorb punishment yeah it's craziness he just bites down his mouthpiece and he doesn't do a lot of slipping and moving you know he's taking a lot of them yeah just charging forward he loves it he hit a giant cut over his arm man it was bigger than his eyebrow yeah it was like the size of his eyebrow I was enormous yeah there was there was a whole wild fucking event did you see Hector Lombard Nate Marquardt yes holy shit at 170 hectares um Bart's gonna give he'll give anybody fits I could see him he could be the champ yeah easily yeah yeah he's terrifying at 170 he's a freak athlete man would GSP be able to take him down I don't know man I don't know he's a freak athlete when I used that term a lot freak athlete but Hector Lombard really is a freak and at 170 that may be the strongest 170 its ever existed ever he hits so fucking hard dude he chased down Nate Marquardt who was a Strikeforce former champion okay Nate Marquardt was the Strikeforce welterweight champion and Hector Lombard chased him around like he was some kid that he was gonna assault I mean it was it was amazing I mean he like almost like he had no worry whatsoever about Nate Marquardt's techniques ran after him ran after him kept throwing bombs at him and then that shock somehow that last shot do you see what it did to Nate's body yeah it made him kind of like hop and land on his butt I can see his legs slipped out from under him when he he was I kind of running away and he got him one of those uppercuts from behind yeah yeah and then boom it lifted him up and he landed right on his butters pretty crazy it was horrific yeah he fucked him up man it was it was spooky I didn't know that he was gonna be able to do that I mean I knew that he Jake Jake Ellenberger and Nate Marquardt had a real tough fight and Nate got knocked out but they were going after each other you know I mean Nate was going after him - it was a real it was he got caught with a big shot by Ellenberger and Ellenberger take anybody out but it was competitive up into that this was not competitive this was a mugging I mean he just came after Nate Marquardt Nate Marquardt tried to counter him a couple of times at right hands but mostly was just trying to get the fuck out of the way and that dude just came at him like a like a monster it was weird it was he's ridiculously strong yeah this is a scary dude at 170 pounds I want immediately to see matches with him against like Carlos Condit immediately to him he him against guys like Johnny Hendrix or George st. Pierre whoever wins the title according to Eric Paulsen I had him on my podcast he's telling me some Hector Lombard stories man the guy is intense 24/7 yeah I in the gym wants to throw down him and Josh Barnett throat threw down at least once yeah Josh mounted him and would never let him up was just beating on him he wouldn't let him up apparently he had an issue with something Lombard did someone else in the gym so Josh and him just went after it Josh said the guy's a freak athlete he said he does those muscle ups you know those things we do a chin-up and then you push up from the top yeah they're really hard to do yeah this motherfucker just he'd never done it before it banged out at ten in a row mmm I don't think I'll ever be able to do one he's a freak athlete like when you look at his body he's five foot seven and five foot seven wide you know he's so bit mean he's probably probably about five nine probably a little taller than me think I don't know my height or five maybe my even my height or maybe slightly taller I'm 5/8 but he's twice as wide as been I mean he might he might I'm pretty wide he might be like literally a foot wider than me yeah he I think it's an illusion he's actually he might be 510 but he says laughs so widen his shoulders that it appears that he's five four he's so wide I've never seen a dude his height that wide before and the power that motherfucker has god damn it's scary scary and just ultimate confidence and his ability to knock guys out ultimate confidence like as he charged in on Nate it was just he knew as a matter of time it was weird it was weird to watch I never thought I'd watch Nate get steamrolled like that you know you think about Nate Nate fought Anderson Silva it was a decent fight until Anderson reversed him on the ground and beat him up and stopped him but it was a decent fight before that Nate fought tyron woodley and knocked him out I mean Nate is a bad motherfucker he's a really good fighter you know think of all the guys he's knocked out he knocked out Martin Martin Kampmann you know Nate Marquardt's no fucking joke he's been around a long ass time too he's really fucking blah Bart's got that Hendricks power just boom but he's got in both hands yeah he's just terrifying terrifying Lombard terrifying he might be the motherfucker at 170 man it really might be yes so these guys man sometimes it's just a matter of making that wait getting my weight class yeah look at Demian Maia 170 yeah no but doesn't Jake Shields beat him which is crazy I could have went either way yeah it was a it was a I think one of those fights that easily could be a draw you could decide who wins but yeah my I didn't tap him you know a lot of people were saying that Maya was gonna dominate him the way dominated Rick story ya know people forget how good a round boy Jake Shields is yeah he never really got close to any submissions and the and Jake he's probably top three if not the best passer in MMA yeah his passing is incredible him and Sean Sherk incredible passing and Jake almost passed so many times and to have that kind of confidence to try to pass Maya's guard mo rustlers will just sell can this fighter you get on top don't even trying to pass but Jake kept trying to pass and even though even though he didn't quite make it it was very impressive that he had the confidence to keep pushing and keep trying to pass and Damon Maya really couldn't do anything off his back against Jake Jake's used to having guys attack him you know serious guys off their backs oh man that was a very very close fight I thought they would give it to Maya base because it was in Brazil I thought Jake's really gonna have to beat him it's decisively to get it in Brazil but that wasn't the case after all so congratulations to Jake yeah that was a big win for him because Maya was on the verge of a title shot after the RIC story fight after beating Jon Fitch John Fitch John Fitch and then beat Rick story like that a lot of people like Jesus Christ this guy might be the best grappler in the division no one can stop him so Jake wins that fight derails his title hopes that this is just so many good fighters now man it's crazy Robbie Lawler is about to fight Rory MacDonald how fucking crazy is that fight gonna be huh yeah Bobby Laura at 170 there's another one at 172 fucking terrifying he's absolutely terrifying at 170 did you see um I'm agog and TJ Wahlburgers yeah Robbie Lawler knocked out I'm a god with a flying knee that's how scary Robbie Lawler is yeah I'll never forget Dana White at The Comedy Store years ago telling you about Robbie Lawler for the first time I got this kid Robbie Lawler bad guy knock you out with both hands I remember hearing that and then he brought him up he did well in the beginning and then he started fighting for Strikeforce he was fighting at 85 it should have been fighting in 85 yeah he should have been fighting at 170 in the whole time but he also needed to mature come into his own you know he's like 30 now and now he's like a real legit professional you know he fights smart he doesn't just wing punches at guys but he does still wing punches at guys it's got a serious fucking chin and he goes after guys when is that fight that's November that's the George st. Pierre undercard good googly moogly dude Rory MacDonald and and run I mean think about that camp that Tristar camp Brian McDonald GSP he has so many good guys out I can't that Francis car mom guy but Robbie Lawler is a motherfucker I don't know who's gonna win that fight war he's like super technical doesn't take too many chances works on that long jab you know but Robbie Lawler will go after a motherfucker yeah he's spooky yeah would you think of Roy Nelson Cormier Carmy he's a fucking sick athlete man he's a sexy for sure going to 205 he's going it was fight John Jones yeah you saying it he was saying I'm going to 205 yeah he'll be at 205 he was 224 for this fight you know he'll he'll go down to 205 and he's gonna be a handful for everybody he's that elite Olympic gold-medalist caliber athlete those motherfuckers are rare dudes you know those dudes they break their hand and keep punching you with it until it falls apart yeah he was throwing punches at Josh Barnett with a broken hand you know he's taking Josh Barnett up in the air with a broken hand slamming on the ground you know he's fucking bones are rattling against themselves inside of his hand to do that to Josh Barnett man exactly that's gonna be out of this world and he's not even a legit heavyweight he wrestled at 2:06 thank you wrestled at 2:06 it was definitely light because he had a cut weight to do it and that's why he lost his bid at the Olympics because he had kidney failure because he tried to make the weight try to cut the way like cut a lot of weight and he fucked himself up a lot of guys have that man you know Josie aldo has kidney stones now had a kidney stone removed after his fight with the Korean Zombie that's from cutting weight yeah one of my students had kidney stones and and since since he went to the hospital and went through all the excruciating pain and me hearing the stories he said bro drink cranberry juice pure cranberry just don't drink that cocktail every day you do not want to go through what I just went through I swear to God I have pure cranberry juice in my refrigerator make sure my wife keeps it stocked and I drink it every day just hearing a story of excruciating pain in the hospital does this guy who is it which guy okay well I'm dizzy cut wait yes he cuts a massive white shirt yeah he's shredded see students it cut wait to do matches yeah fuck man that shit's bad for you cutting weight is not good but if you want to be a great fighter just drink pure Granberry cranberry juice not the cocktail and you should be fine everything tastes like shit tastes sour but it's like a shot I drink it every day get it you make it whole foods you can get it any way anymore supermarket there's some cranberry pills that's does the same thing does it do this just take a shot a shot of cranberries how could he do the same thing though it never does you know like you take those like pills green pills they're never as good as like real straight to juice it's kind of sour but you get used to it it's actually not bad yeah you just and you can't drink that much of it so it's perfect it's like a way to quench your thirst and you're not gonna down like half the bottle if it was a great drink or something shit you kill half the bottle but since it's so part you're forced to only take a sip and so that what does that do what's in it that protects your dick it's gotta be the acid in it cuz it's kind of sour it's gotta be has something to do with that and making sure that those stones are always broken down it probably just melts him or something I don't know I stayed this girl used to get urinary tract infections I used to have to drink cranberry juice to get rid of it yeah how weird is that cranberry juice is legit it's weird this foods though they cure things you know like you have any stomach ailments anything bothering your stomach take garlic it's incredible like if you if you eat some bad food and get some sort of stomach like food poisoning so like that eat some cloves of garlic it's like sending in rabid Italian troops that go down in there and just fuck up all the bacteria it's incredible yeah people who don't like raw garlic you don't know what you're missing just to eat cloves of that shit it's fantastic for you it's like an assault on all the shitty things inside your body how about that Tony Ferguson marce damn why is it called a Mars well a you know because you you got a name every move in every position in every transition in my opinion to in order to teach at the highest level so there's a difference between getting a Darce when you're on top and you're using your weight right he wasn't on top he cinched it in and went to his back and Mark layman he's a very well-known MMA jiu-jitsu coach he used to do that he's the one who actually called it the Darce when it was named after the first guy he saw use it joe Darce and i think his name is dr c yeah that's that's what mark layman is is very similar to me as we like to name everything that doesn't have names and lots of digits moved in so you got a name the there's a difference between the marks cuz the Morrises on your back and that's how he used to do it he he said that was his thing that he did his squeeze was so tight that he didn't need to be on top and he liked rolling guys and they didn't expect it and so he called it the marsh there's also a force which I don't know if a guy named Freddie made it up I don't know the story behind force but that's when you're kind of mounting the guy and you have you are mounting the guy in your avatars so there's there's a different variations of it and the one that Tony Transat 10th planet Costa Mesa all week and every Thursday he comes up and trains with me and that's the move you gotta watch when you're wrong with Tony he does flying Darcis man he's he's I mean his his jujitsu is very underrated man he's gonna shock a lot of people over the over his career well that darts that he hit that dude with he immediately scooted under him and then almost like an inverted crucifix it ties his arm up with his legs from the bottom has confidence in your squeeze to do that yeah so that tells you a lot like wow you won't ever see anybody going to the Mars you see people going to the Darce and if the guy on the bottom rolls you should be able to roll with them even if it turns into a more still finish it but you don't go there voluntarily unless you have your super confident with them having those long arms is such a massive advantage it really as far as like that leverage you can get with long limbs yeah it's really incredible guys who have like wicked arses and have long arms they can just like shove him under plate like Kendall Grove Kendall Grove used to catch them and all sorts of weird spots cuz he could just see had like an extra foot on his arms yep Jeff Glover is like yeah he's one of the best of Darcis yeah Jeff Glover lets you pass him I love that move where he lets you get into side control and you think you're going to assign control we're really just going to did are slammed yeah it just catches it in the transition yeah it's jujitsu for people don't know it's so fucking technical there's so many techniques I mean it's it's truly amazing when you stop and consider the positions the amount of different possibilities each position holds and then different ways to submit people and they all flow together if you've never done it before it's hard to kind of understand it and I know that's one of the things that I take a lot of time on when it comes to a ground battle in the UFC I always make sure I try to explain what a guy's trying to do where it becomes a problem where he's you know where he's going to and people get a chance to see it more that way but unless you train yourself you'll never really truly understand the beauty of it if you train yourself you'll get a sense of what it's like to struggle to actually catch a guy in a position then you'll understand how amazing it is when you see like really really high level stuff when you see a mad scramble like Kron Gracie and Gary tonin and Gary taking Cron's back in that wild scramble yeah you know they kept rolling kept rolling kept rolling that bam locks up the body triangle like fuck yeah yeah it's it's a it's an art that anybody can do children old ladies they all do it it's really really easy it's I'm not trying to sell it to obviously I want to make money but it's the truth the truth anybody can learn it all you have to do just show up to your local jujitsu school and just watch just go and just watch for a couple times it's free you don't have to commit to it just tell the guy you want to watch and you watch and you realize oh my god I had it all wrong you know yet you expect you're gonna show up and there's gonna be all these fucking douchebags killing each other and bleeding on each other and you realize it's a bunch of nerds it's a bunch of computer nerds and and after you watch after you watch one class you should be sold on it and don't have to roll and do you know people are scared of rolling and Oh what if he taps man who hurts me it's so rare that anybody gets hurt really it's so rare you usually get hurt more from positions than you do from submissions yeah you get hurt more when you let gets tripped unto you but you know as you get better at it that becomes less and less and as you if you're in a good school like tent planet or like there's so many good schools in LA and we get spoiled but most places have to be good in order to stay open in this day and age because there's so much competition there's amazing amounts of competition yeah from jiu-jitsu our beginning classes are we kind of changed I'm up a little over the years I realized that most people are a lot more scared of going to a jiu-jitsu class and checking it out and taking one class than I thought mmm they're way more scared than I thought so I understand that I used to I used to think that you know if you should know that it's a safe sport and you should know if you want to do it or not and if you're not totally into it I don't want to talk you into it you should just know and then that leaves me with a small percentage of the population which I consider that you're my family but in reality if I change my beginner classes and make them more cater more to the guys that want to do it but they're just scared of death they're scared to death of signing a contract they're scared of death and getting hurt they're coming in to jiu-jitsu scared so you got to really think about just walking them through it nice and slowly showing them that there's nothing to be scared of this is a beautiful thing that everyone can learn you can learn to get really good at putting people to sleep in six months you know another thing is don't be afraid to tap that's another thing make sure I really tell people it's nothing wrong with tapping it's not that bad just go in there and tap it's it's you got to think about it like someone's scoring a porn on you in basketball it's gonna happen it's totally normal yeah and once you get past that especially if you're training with good people you tap them they tap you doesn't matter it's good for you and if you can't tap a guy but he can can't tap you guess what that's good for you too it's good for you to know that someone can tap you you need to up your game and up your skill level to get to the point where he's at but just because he taps you it's no big deal it doesn't matter people tap people all the time that's one of the biggest free people are afraid to come in they're afraid to lose this game of death because really that's why jujitsu is so fascinating and such a beautiful thing cuz really it applies to life in on the streets saving your family protecting your children protecting your wife your wife protecting your children and back and forth your children knowing jujitsu protecting their father and son you know whole family we're what everyone does jiu-jitsu that that's you know that increases your chances chances of survival and like some apocalyptic era well either way it's it's a great way to exercise it's a great discipline it's it's great for your body it's great for your mind like after we leave jiu-jitsu class tell me when we more like loose relax and silly than after jujitsu meals the parking-lot after jujitsu conversations where everybody's exhausted even fighting for your life for the past hour and a half and we're all just hanging out chilling and try to kill each other just an hour before virtual reality okay exactly and you get used to that it becomes a normal thing for folks or it's not a normal thing it seems daunting it seems terrifying it seems uninviting but believe me I know a lot like you said nerds and it's a lot a lot of nice people in jiu-jitsu too people have a good control their ego we've talked about that in this podcast many times but I think it needs repeating and it's absolutely I can't tell you how many tweets emails messages how many I guess I listened to you guys talk about jiu-jitsu on the podcast over and over and then I finally went to a school and I tried it and guess what you were right this is amazing this is changing my life my son's doing it out to its stoat and that is the most likely outcome if you give it a shot and you have an open mind and leave your ego at the door is it's gonna change your life or this it's gonna give you without a doubt it's gonna be one of the best vehicles for developing your confidence that you can ever find it will change your confidence and that's women including women you know like think about women that you know that have gone to schools gone to different jujitsu classes and gotten better at it and then they become like a more relaxed person they become a different person they're not worried about their self defense around men anymore they know that the reality is a girl is a brown belt in jujitsu like you men when we had Felicia do that thing with Seymour butts yes explain anymore but who's a nice guy he's a porn star and a porn producer and he had a show on Showtime on Showtime I don't remember what the name of it was do you remember the show maybe was just Seymour butts I don't remember what it was but anyway real nice guy and one of the episodes he wanted to come down and do jiu-jitsu with a woman no no no he just wanted to come down and do jiu-jitsu oh really it was not with a woman he didn't want to do it with Felicia did you set that up yeah yeah Felicia Oh who's a friend of ours she's a black belt under Jean Jacques Machado and a legit bona fide badass she's like 135 pounds she's not a big woman but she is strong as fuck and heard you Jitsu is top-notch and she's really smart she's super super super smart so she just gets good at anything she just knows how to get good at shit and her and Seymour butts rolled it was like his first day and she manhandled this poor lad he didn't get hurt no he lost the game yes she was so nice which never which never feels amazing when you tap out it doesn't feel refreshing no it's fine that's why it's so beautiful because it didn't feel good you just lost a game of death no one got hurt but that tap represented the fact that he had your life in his hands and the only reason he let go cause he's a cool guy and everyone's cool in class but in reality of if he was a douchebag and he wanted to kill you he could have yeah they take your life if someone wanted to choke you out and then stomp your head out while you're unconscious that's what happens but the point is Felicia being a small woman just just using her technique just tapped him over and over and over again got it in a triangle got his back got him in an armbar and the way she did it was so fluid and beautiful and you watched the episode it doesn't I don't think it goes down like that they edited it to make him look good because we shot a segment where I'm teaching and then I'm teaching him and we're doing the teaching segment and then I asked him do you want a role too cuz he didn't know what like rolling kind of spar and he said yeah yeah we'll shoot that and we'll do that and I go well you got will spar with the woman you know make it and he's like okay whatever that was it was so long ago I forgot yeah generally if you're a girl out there and you do Jiu Jitsu for solid for one year solid you the chances of you getting raped to go down significantly hits guitar very hard to rape a jiu-jitsu girl and it doesn't take that long to get good at one said within two years time flies you gonna be doing it three years just like that and you're a badass the last time I rolled with Felicia I think I was a purple belt I might have been a brown belt was either purple or brown ball and it's not like I was like trying to kill her but I didn't tap her I didn't tap her she 135 pounds yeah you know and she's just fucking good man really she's fucking she's really strong and she's fucking good and when someone's really good they know how to put themselves in the perfect position they know how to keep moving they know how to keep but getting away from anything that you're trying to do to them and putting themselves in a better position to defend a better position to attack that's being many steps ahead of the person you're doing it was because they don't know what you're doing give someone a massive amount of confidence and I've seen girls go into jiu-jitsu class start getting good and then start tapping out guys and when they start tapping out guys it's a wild thing to watch it's a wild thing to see the guy's face it's a wild thing to see a girl like cinch up first girl I ever saw top a dude out was his girl Junkin used to roll with they were both beginners and remember we got Duncan and Ari who gave him a free year for like Christmas do you remember that yes yeah very well ari stuck it out ari got some taps in on some dudes he kept going but Duncan ran into this girl who was very pretty and very girly but she tapped him with the quickness like how many times she'd have him stop the bikes several it was ugly yeah but that was it was fascinating to watch like this girl realizing like she could if she knew the techniques better she could get a guy the guys probably stronger than her she could still get him that scarred Duncan he know he didn't laugh I think he up to maybe a handful classes at most he already stuck it out for a while yeah but with re he got hurt he something happened to his knee I think yesterday half and then he had well he had a meniscus surgery and then he got staph and that was too much you couldn't tell you some people there's a small percentage of people that get hurt doing jiu-jitsu and that scares them and they never want to come back but generally most of the people who do jiu-jitsu love it so much that the first thing they think of when they get hurt they're pissed off because they're gonna be out for six weeks or they're gonna be out for three months they're gonna that's why they're pissed they can't wait to get back and you can't wait to get back so much that you're like you could of times you come back too early and you're not really healed right and then you reenter yourself so that's not generally you look if you come in with an open mind and you leave your ego at the door generally you're gonna fall in love with it it's gonna change your life and when you get hurt you're more bummed about missing jujitsu than you are about the actual injury you know but there are some people that they might they get ringworm once except a ringworm and it's very easy to eliminate ringworm you never have to deal with it if you can be consistent with the yogurt and the acid office defense soap yeah get some defense so absolutely how everybody yeah defense soap is the best and it's a great company owned by a great guy yeah and the the company they said they support wrestlers and they develop soap that cleans your skin without fucking up all the natural bacteria yeah all the healthy for I was resistant to defense so for a while I never really looked into it in the very beginning I thought it was so soap that out all these antibiotics antibiotics some chemicals that I didn't wanna have nothing to do with it just sounded like that but when I finally looked into it and found out that was just eucalyptus eucalyptus oil and oil and in high amounts it's like wait like three times the amount that you find in it I bring that everywhere yeah I brought on the road with me I don't I don't go to a hotel room unless I already haven't I use deep defense soap every day every day yeah me too yeah once I found I was all-natural and I was sold now that I don't need shampoo anymore I'll use it on top of my head too I'll use it everywhere I use it a shampoo damn it keeps dandruff away because dandruff is a form of fungus similar to ringworm totally makes sense well healthy skin flora is something that people don't even think about but you know I mean that's what killed a lot of motherfuckers back in the day when people got scratched and you know they got some sort of infection and you know they people used to die of infections all the time that's like one of the biggest deaths or the biggest scary things about going to a hospital today is infections you know and you can do a little bit to prevent that stuff by healthy diet eating a lot of probiotics even so if you're a vegan say if you only eat vegetables you can still get probiotics in the form of sauerkraut sour colic natural raw sauerkraut super good for you vegans you just can't have acidophilus pills well see they shouldn't even really have kombucha because kombucha is a fungus and a fungus is actually closer to a person than an ant than a plant is funguses are actually closer to human beings and plants are funguses are actually much more like an animal than they are like a plant so if you're a true vegan and you're eating kombucha you're kind of a hypocrite the mushrooms are kind of a hypocrite to Shilo but they mean that's probably they actually probably want you to eat them that's the whole idea behind psilocybin said psilocybin wants you to eat it that's why it's big and white and gigantic it's it shows up like it shows itself very easily on like cow patties and shit like that like it's literally like inviting you to come and eat it because that's already hops with the light yeah I mean come on how beautiful red one's right yeah how beautiful that's Amanita muscaria but psilocybin the ones that grow on cow shit they have you know the big giant ones in the Amazon they grow the size of dinner plates what's the difference they both get you to that other dimension Amanita muscaria is a very controversial mushroom and for folks who never heard of the Amanita muscaria the red one the red one with the white spots it's literally Santa Claus okay and I'll break it down real quick for people who have never heard this before go to my whoo look up Joe Google Joe Rogan Santa Claus was a mushroom I wrote a whole article about it in like 2006 or someplace I'm talking about the in my website and what about explain don't let's explain to people the Amanita muscaria mushroom is native to Siberia to Europe it's a different mushroom the mushroom the psilocybin mushroom that you see in tropical climates and you also see in a lot of places now the Pacific Northwest has a lot of its that that's a different experience and that's a much more accessible experience and it's a much more reliable experience the Amanita muscaria oftentimes isn't even psychoactive like they don't know what makes it psychoactive and what doesn't there's all sorts of speculation that it could be genetically variable it could be seasonally variable it could be you know there's strains of it that grew in certain areas and they were super potent but they don't exist anymore or you have to find I've never had a good I'm Aneta muscaria trip I only had one to speak of that was that really blew it out but we took we took psilocybin - we took the Amanita for like an hour and it wasn't doing shit that us no no it was me and Stanhope me Stanhope and Yann Irvin how many grams um he made this weird soup he made like a tea with the the Amanita muscaria like he knows how to do all that shit he's yawn is pretty well-versed in how to prepare these things there was a mountain amount specific amount that turns McKenna 5 about 5 grand yeah 5 well that's just that psilocybin this is the M&M scary ok so we took that and then an hour or so in we decided to jump it with psilocybin and then when we jumped it with psilocybin wow the the two of them together it was pretty fucking intense and it was the day of the war so it was really really really weird and we had this Mata de cocoa tea it's uh it's cocaine tea it's tea that's derived from coca leaves like natural coca leaves this is Marcia that yan legal I don't believe so I would say name but it should be because the the actual leaves themselves in these indigenous high-altitude hurting populations they just chew them they chew them all day and it's like tobacco to them or like anything else that people normally have looks like you know chewing gum or something like that and it provides like it's a clean stimulant it's when you break it down turn into cocaine that it becomes like a real fucking pain in the ass comes addictive and you know people get weirded out on it but they say it's actually better for you than coffee if you just chew the leaves I just found out within the last year I saw a documentary on where ecstasy comes from it MDMA right yeah it comes from these trees in Thailand Cambodia yeah so the root they're like chopping down all these trees to get like the inner core of it and that's what makes ecstasy how crazy like a pure lab-created thing I did to I think there was a vice documentary on another fucking vice one those vice guys are on top of everything maybe that's the one I saw probably but it was fascinating crazy it all comes from Cambodia and Thailand and there's a lot of violence associated with where these trees are now because people are killing people to try to get to these trees crazy yeah I wonder what how that would be like taking it naturally like right from the tree I know right wonder if you crazy trip to Thailand just go find the trees that's a movie a group of guys that go find the tree that's with like three hot chicks that all the chicks die of course within the first 45 minutes a one survives only one at the end ecstasy is a funny one man it's a really funny one it's a really interesting one because it's uh it's thought of as like a party drug and it certainly is but you can learn a lot on ecstasy man I've only done it once but I learned a lot I had a very beneficial trip I paid the price with my my mental health for the couple days afterwards I was wrecked yeah but my brain was not working well the comedown is terrible for me it was throw some people apparently it's not or if you take 5htp supposedly if you you down 5-htp you new mood that's why that's 5htp as well with mood has no it seems like I'm specifically creative or the partier well used to be roll on roll on and roll off do you member and are you joking around remember roll on what are we created it the original thing was Aubrey likes to party and he created it to Kate for the calm down off ecstasy because 5-htp but new mood became right sort of it became it was enhanced and now new mood a bunch of different shit in and like l-tryptophan which converts to 5htp so it has like a time release that's better yeah well it's better in that there's more than one mechanism for converting 5-htp to serotonin and the l-tryptophan converts to 5-htp which converts to serotonin it gives you the building blocks to replenish your serotonin surprise after you do something like that but also gives you the extra serotonin throughout your day would which picks your mood up so much so man that they say for people were taking SSRIs or antidepressants they tell them not to take 5htp because Neal Brennan you know Neal Brennan the dude from the Chappelle show he was on 5-htp but he was also taken an antidepressant the doctor told him to lay off two 5-htp because it would give him too much serotonin huh oh it's definitely for real have you tried in that shit well I will say this Depeche Mode was just in town last month and after the Depeche Mode concert I did take some new mood took about four of them I see what you're saying yeah I see what you're saying without saying you should have taken alpha brain before the Depeche Mode concert and you wasn't smart enough to not go oh oh so about the Staples Center three nights in a row come on I haven't had a hit single in ten years old friend of ours I think you're friends with me I was friends with him he used to work at the Comedy Store I was murdered last night and don't I remember Katie I used to work there at the Comedy Store and he recently moved to Los Las Vegas and what happened is this gunman came into a nightclub I believe it's oka calms and I shot two two guys and then he was just a supposedly a guy that was at this club and he tried to tackle the guy because he the guy was pointing his gun to like innocent people she was like doing a hero thing and then he got shot oh that's hot he was dating Katie no no his name was kids named Kady Oh Katie yeah yeah we talked about Katie yesterday on the podcast how hilarious she was it makes a KD was one actually Mike one of my first friends in Los Angeles when I first maybe that's terrible fuck man there was another school shooting the other day - did you hear about that shit when we get to the school shooting back to the mushroom thing yeah I'm reading oh yeah we didn't even describe the difference I'm reading a baby book this is back to mushrooms and I will I've never read so many goddamn books in my life over the last six months my kid that's his favorite shit is to have he ghost grabs a book we have a thousand books he grabs his favorite one he sits on my lap he loves that and I think he knows what the last page is and he'll flip it over start it over son start it over and there's just one book about Nicholas the bunny and he's talking about how in the fall I like to watch the leaves and then in the winter I find shelter from the rain under a toadstool hmm and it's a mushroom I never heard mushrooms called toadstools before yeah why those and then on the other side there's a mushroom with a toad actually sitting on top of the mushroom right yeah they've been called toad stools forever but they also if you look up any old-school Christmas shit yeah all old-school Christmas cards anything with elves they all have mushrooms from yeah and they have that mushroom the Amanita muscaria mushroom don't isn't there isn't there a myth that if you lick a frog's ass you get high no it's not a myth at all it's real some frogs oh come frogs it's different though what they have is five Meo DMT in them but what I'm saying is I open up this baby book there's a little bunny Nicholas the bunny hiding under a toadstool and then they show a mushroom and a frog on top of it sitting down on it so maybe that's why when you lick a frog's ass you get high because they actually sit on no no no no maybe they're using the mushroom check said no you don't extract listen you don't lick a frog's ass you don't lick a frog to get high the way this doesn't work okay excretion yeah this is what it is this is an excretion from certain types of frog skin okay and you have to rub it on glass so you take this frog and you rub them on glass and they'll excrete their substance on the grass then you take that glass put in the Sun it dries out then you take a razor blade and you scrape it off the glass and it's a white powder you smoke that white powder and it's five methoxy dimethyltryptamine now is that secretion coming from the rectum it's coming from their skin okay it's that whole thing of licking a frog is just one of those urban myths okay it's just it's just weird than in a baby book you'll you hear about the myths of licking frogs ass and they're sitting on maybe because you know you some people put ecstasy pills in their ass for better absorption you heard of that brighter so maybe the Frog is trying to get high and maybe they figured out how to get high by sitting on a mushroom it goes up their ass and they get and then you lick a frog's ass that's all I'm saying this was in a baby but this is the name of the frog it's called the Bufo aureus and you can't get found by licking it if I remember correctly it's super concentrated and super dangerous though to do it to get to lick it lick it because it's really you remember if I bought the I bought the yeah yeah but you got a Google shit the books called I am a bunny bought a bufo alvarius yeah cob it's called the Colorado River toad or Sonoran desert toad it contains five Meo DMT and bufotenin bufotenin bufotenin bu f o te ni n there's a website that sell sold these frogs and so I bought one was it alive oh yeah so you never looked at whatever I think it's a myth if you had it why don't you lick it I don't know it's scared can you can you google licking a frog is concentrated on the surface of its skin and that's why licking is dangerous smoking is a different story however yeah so it's too powerful if you like it too powerful Wow if it's concentrated hmm the toxic ingredient the toads venom is called bufotenin which is burned off while smoking that's why it's dangerous because the two things are in it if you burn it off what's left is five Meo DMT so you don't want to lick it because if you lick it it gives you befo Janine but phoneme gets burned off smoking that's why it's dangerous poison yeah so I guess it really say anything about home so listen to this this is what's weird it's this this frog they're native to the Colorado River or southern Arizona California and northern New Mexico even though five AMAO DMT is classified as an unscheduled substance which means it's legal to possess but the venom also contains bufotenin which is scheduled so you all you do you can be in possession of an illegal substance even though it's not a psychedelic the weird thing about five Meo is it's stronger than N and DMT and n DMT is the one that gives you the crazy visuals but the stuff that we did the first time that's five Meo it's even stronger than n N and it's legal the one where I was screaming yeah they did they missed that one in this the sweeping psychedelic drug Act of 1970 they missed five Meo DMT this is what I had by a Colorado River - yeah that's the motherfucker good thing you didn't lick it dumb cuz you wouldn't Google it Google back then I think I think this is that it was right before I moved here well anybody listening please don't lick the toad cuz you can die it don't don't lick poisonous dart frogs yeah but if you take that stuff and you smoke it it's DMT you will trip your fucking balls off if you smoke the shit that comes from that toad skin which is really kind of crazy the difference between that and and psilocybin is very similar psilocybin also is in in dimethyltryptamine it's got that and something else is a psilocybin is like for Fox for a Locksley and in dimethyltryptamine so the last part of it is dimethyltryptamine then five Meo dimethyltryptamine which is what these frogs have is dimethyltryptamine with like an oxygen molecule attached to it so it has a different impact but all that shit that's like prevalent in children's books in folklore like all those elves when you see look at that guy's name is toad and he has a mushroom head yeah and he has the head of the muscle that's a turd telling you I I think that's the people that are making books for kids you gotta kind of have had a mushroom trip to really want to help kids you know and it's kind of like like oh that's great I don't know man there's a lot of mushrooms like watch hitch they don't have to trip on I don't know but I'm sworn to God I watch a lot of educational TV for children mm-hmm and they bring up mushrooms a lot what is this it's a mushroom and it's a red mushroom it's like wow there's so many other things you could have brought up you're talking about mushrooms you're trying to teach it mushrooms come up a lot in children's books yeah and in their TV I don't know what it means for Mario Brothers well look at but yeah well think about Lewis Carroll and think about Alice in Wonderland that was all about acid yeah right now there's billboards everywhere all over LA there's a new show called Wonderland or something and there's a guy and a girl they're looking at each other's eyes in the background all these mushrooms red hair red topped like those yeah yeah those mushrooms are what they believe to be Santa Claus because it even looks like Santa Claus yeah those mushrooms also this work it's really crazy if you haven't heard the whole ship filled before they are there they're they have a symbiotic relationship with coniferous trees like pine trees they grow under pine trees they have a micro Raizel relationship with the soil like those trees that's where those things always grow they feed off of each other so this fucking thing is always underneath these trees just like brightly colored gifts that are always underneath Christmas trees why are Christmas trees always pine trees why do Christmas trees have these ornaments hanging in them you know because these mushrooms I used to pull them out of the bottom of these trees and then hang them in the tree to dry them out the other way they drove them drive them out was they would hang them in front of fireplaces that's why socks are white and red Christmas socks are white and red who the fuck has white and red socks nobody why would you hang your socks in front of the fireplace like that because that's how they dried out mushrooms pasted tying the strings and dangling from a fire and that's how they dried them out that's how they preserve them it's like everything about it has to do with shamans and everything about it has a connection to this mushroom and that mushroom was like synonymous the the Amanita muscaria mushroom was synonymous with reindeers because reindeer love those fucking reindeer or caribou caribou live in Siberia that's what they they live up there and these motherfuckers when you're in there like a shamans Hut and they're all like eating hominy no muscaria mushrooms and having these tribal ceremonies they would go outside to piss and the the caribou would literally knock them over to get to their piss because they're pissed had a Vinita muscaria smell to it damn hamilton morrison did it on Vice of course he did on the show you puke a lot this is the Amanita yeah there's part 1 2 & 3 or he's done wrong well there's another type of frog if he shows a scar there's a different thing there's another type of frog we take the venom of the Frog and you you cut yourself and you take this toads venom and you put it like directly into your skin and somehow or another by doing that by doing it I think they burn themselves like they burn themselves like with ash like an ember and then they put the frog like so it opens up the pores and they put the frog's venom right into them and they have this transient and transcendence transcendent experience is that we Hamilton Morris my stomach is in excruciating pain he's such a freak I love this guy got a frog yeah yeah see they burn you and then they stick this shit in on you and you trip your balls off you go meet with the spirit world but you know there's people throughout history have come up with a bunch of different methods to transcend normal reality normal consciousness and in different parts of the world when they were stuck in some area that didn't have mushrooms they figured out what datura does they figured out what you know what is this what does this cactus do if you light it on fire you know what is this bush what's in this bush people been finding that stuff forever these scholars in Jerusalem think that that was what Moses was seeing when he went to the burning bush he saw the burning bush that was God gave him the Ten Commandments they believed that was DMT because the bush is done they have like the acacia bush very rich in DMT it's all over that area bush burning DMT like DMT on fire get high it's like so obvious the crazy expense I had with mushrooms is back in 2008 I did five grams specifically five grams weighted put it in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and went to the zoo and that was a bad choice yeah yeah it was a bad decision I thought hey we'd be with animals and to be all about love we get that I went with the chick and while we were checking out the gorillas is when it hit and all we wanted to do is just sit in the shade not look at the animals close our eyes and the visuals you get are just amazing when people say oh that's in your head you made that up like there's no way if I made that up it would be fragmented and all fucked up there's no way as soon as I close my eyes there's a show waiting for me and it's there's an in my opinion there's no way I'm a I'm doing this if it was if I was running the show it would not look like that I don't have the ability but well that's the actual what they believe is that what you're doing is you're you're hijacking your visual cortex and so that these chemicals impact your visual cortex and create this incredible display because your body does not know how to process what's coming in that's the idea behind it does it does it what I've always said is it doesn't matter because whether you're creating it whether it's real or not real it's still the same experience yeah whether it's real or not real whether what is real when it breaks down to it you're actually seeing that yeah so whether or not that's your imagination that's creating it that's how people like to dismiss things oh it's just in your imagination no it's not and it doesn't matter even if it is because it's still the same thing it's still this insane crazy thing that you're looking at yeah so even if it is your imagination it's still the wildest fucking thing you're ever gonna see in your life so hard to explain the only way I could explain it is like it's like those visualizers on your iTunes times a thousand yeah it's perfect it's not broken up to me in my opinion something else is creating it I don't know what it is but there's something is creating that because there's no way I can create this amazing art and it's perfect and perfectly symmetric and it's like snakes of just crate so after like five minutes of just sitting there at the zoo we thought we had like a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas moment when we just had to get out when I just we ran to the parking lot and it's an at the LA Zoo and we're looking at the mountains like are you looking at the mounds look at the mountain I instantly understood what all the Aztec art was all about I'm like that's what they're seeing I go you look at them at the mountains were dancing yeah the guy who who gave it to me goes dude the clouds are gonna dance for you I thought that was a metaphor I didn't know he actually meant that and anytime you focus on something for one second you look at the clouds they start dancing for you all perfect was like well this it's it's a weird feeling because it feels like something's there all the time you just can't see it that's what it feels like whenever I've been on mushrooms like when I was talking about the the one where Doug and I took the Amanita muscaria and then the psilocybin yeah the feeling I got and it didn't last very long because there's so many things going through our head and it was the day of the Iraq war the day the war started so it was a pretty freaky moment but I saw this honeycomb pattern in front of me like where everything I saw like the pattern of the universe and it like occurred to me like oh this is here all the time I just don't see it and that's what it feels like when you see those things dancing absolutely it's it was incredible it was so hard that was the craziest drive home it was exact when I first time myself Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I thought man this is so unrealistic it doesn't you don't see shit like that when you get high I've been high plenty of times you don't but I understood it cuz the drive home I didn't know it was I should have been dead there's no way I should have made it home I didn't know if that was cars next to me they were right here though it felt like I was driving through a jungle it was remember you you called me said dude the road turned into flower petals yes yes like I was being guided by I was in a jungle and that was flowers and green moss and I'm driving through it and I could see the cars like in the distance but just in my little queue my little circle I was in the in the forest don't recommend that if you're gonna experiment with psychedelics stay home stay home cuz what the show but the great part of it is being in a dark room and closing your eyes and checking out the light show in your head that's the it's not like you pass out or anything like if you smoked DMT you pass out and it's kind of like you're in a dream state but with mushrooms you're completely conscious you're talking but as soon as you close your eyes it like it takes 10 15 20 seconds to dissolve into the show the instant you close your eyes it's right there waiting for you it's like right in front of your eyes and it's deep five dimensional and it's perfect there's nothing breaking off it's just it to me there were some intelligence behind it well if it certainly feels like there's some intelligence behind it but the thing that's always struck me as weird is it always feels like it's there all the time yeah like whenever I do DMT one of the weirdest things that happens is just feeling like oh I've been here before even before I ever did it the first time I ever did it I was like I've been here before I know this place like I know this place you know it's I don't know what with mushrooms awesome yeah although it seems like all those who listen I did like I said I've done this before well one of the reasons most likely is that mushrooms and DMT all of these all these things like mimic human neural chemistry so the real wonder is what's happening to you while you're sleeping what's happening you for that six to eight hours whatever it is where you're out cold they don't really know but they do know that the human mind mimics the reactions to two dimethyltryptamine not only does it produce dimethyltryptamine but it produces similar reactions like dreams when you're done with a dream it's hard to remember it you know you know how that is yeah you know it's weird man it's like the dream is so amazing I I've said to myself to like oh I don't have to write this down someone remember it's I'm a lazy bitch I don't want to get up a write something down like I'm not gonna forget this then I wake up in the morning like what the fuck was it I don't remember it all forgot you know DMT is the same way you do DMT and the dream just whatever was whatever the experience was disappears like in the morning you can't remember it or when it's over rather you can't remember it well how about when you're dreaming you don't remember reality exactly right it's true you have you don't remember it so much that your uncle could be David Cassidy yeah like you're totally cool with it you're not going wait a minute fuck is he my uncle he's my uncle The Partridge Family yeah wait a minute I actually had a dream like did you really David Cassidy like random people would show up in my dream and and you accept it you don't you don't remember you remember this dimension as much as you remember your state when you're in this dimension so it's like man what what is it really and when you when you think about like that we're all empty space you know that quantum theory where you know at the subatomic levels it were 99.9999% empty like this this is empty your your this your body's empty how is that possible solid how is it possible that this is empty when you look at it at the subatomic level how is that possible it's so hard to wrap your brain around well we had that admit Goswami guy yeah great great puck yeah but did you understand a word he was saying I wonder if it has like the reason this is solid I wonder you know because electromagnetic energy is running through everything right so that's it seems like it's must be powering everything like where do we get our electricity like we're plugged into the universe some house and according to science we're just flooded with electromagnetic energy and it's just running through everything so it seems like that's how we might be plugged in and that's what's giving us the power cuz it's not our muscles that are are doing anything it's it's the electric pulses that are doing it that's we're estranged from and that's what's running your heart you know your heart isn't just beating there it's connected to this this ocean of electromagnetic energy that were in so if we're electromagnetic energy magnets might have something to do it so I'm thinking you know when you try to put a magnet together there's like nothing there but it's solid like maybe our the subatomic particles that were created it's maybe it's solid because it's really just a magnet in its own little unique form like it's really not there it's not but the way it's the the photons or whatever I'm just making shit up I'll put together the way they're put together it's a certain form of magnet like this is this kind of magnet it's the skin magnet but it's really not there just like when you try to put well we're all empty space I'm trying I don't get the magnet thing when you try to put two magnets together you can't write it's like you don't see anything there but you just can't it just something solid again if you flip it but you know what I'm saying that there's nothing there yet it's solid like they're saying something's there but so maybe maybe since we're all running through electromagnetic energy now this is just my crazy stone theory maybe it has some people are baffled or the top scientists don't even know when the fuck how is his empty space how is this empty space when it's solid to us maybe it has something to do with like particles being magnetized well who knows but you know these are just theories see the point is there's matter in a book anyway the reality the reality of quantum mechanics this is what we absolutely know is that particles can be in a state of superposition which means they're moving and they're still at the same time yeah they blink in and out of existence they we have no aliens of times per second yeah and particles from you know here could they could be on the other side of the planet and they react instantaneously if yesterday the speed of light they split chata they've done experiments where they'll split up a photon yeah whatever they separated by 14 miles or whatever one experiment was 14 miles they're in different labs and whatever they did to this half of the photon the other half reacted in the exact same way so with no lag yeah with no lag at all they don't understand it yeah so it's but so just that alone is like that's science fiction those are all they can link in and out of existence yeah how does it work I think there's something way more to this world than we're ever gonna be able to wrap our heads around with what what our crude minds and bodies can perceive of the reality that we exist in I think we have this idea that the reality of the we exist in the measureable reality we exist in is all there is yeah but I think there's probably a whole soup of possibilities that were swimming in we don't know we're not we're not interacting what we don't have but we also know it exists like that's Karma you know that's love that's like the one that's momentum then you start having good things go your way good things tend to static going your way and it all sorts of feed into other good things there seems to be like a way the universe would like you to to react and behave and it rewards you with like a positive experience it rewards you with love and if you pay attention to people that are living like a fucking disaster of a life the universe is not rewarding them at every turn it's fucking them up the car is breaking down the getting or rested the girl hits him in the head with a fucking frying pan with a sleeping it's like a constant stream of shit keeps coming their way until eventually they either die or get locked up and it's like the universe is setting that up as well yeah it's like it's like warning or not rewarding the correct behavior or the incorrect your life is so perfect and so beautiful and so it's just incredible I mean as humans we have the intelligence to make satellites and rockets and airplanes but we can't even make a flee we can't make a flee we have no idea how that shit works yeah make an athlete that can fuck and try to another flee I don't know how can we can't make a tree yeah we can't make a tree yeah we think we gotta figure it out we think there is no higher intelligence out there some kind of something yeah come on it might just be law you know it might just be a law of the universe or you know instead of a law like an equation like you know positive and love and this and that it moves towards this direction negative and horrible and evil moves towards that direction and it's almost like the two need each other to do battle back and forth and to empower to empower the other absolutely Esther Hicks says you know make sense like you were here who knows if this is true there's just something that someone said that it's seems pretty awesome to me that it seems that we're here we're existing we're supposed to feel the pain because if we don't feel the pain we're not gonna appreciate the good stuff and it's not gonna feel as good like she uses an example of your best meal is always eaten when you your hungriest and that totally makes sense like if you're never hungry you won't really give a fuck about food mm-hmm if you're born a billionaire you don't care about money you don't care about what it can buy and so it's almost like we need we we need the pain which it's almost like we're here for the pain well there's certainly but like reward systems built-in and it seems like if you look at like all the animals on this planet at least there's a struggle that's going on constantly nobody lives easy everybody's struggling you're struggling to find food you're struggling to keep off predators you're struggling to keep your your young alive and it seems like it's set up that way it seems like it could be way easier if there was like total harmony in the animal world well isn't like life and success like what they're looking for when they all just be fucking and eating plants would that be like the best way to go about it but no it seems like the struggles built into the whole code of life yeah and there's a battle to try to figure out how to do it right well we want the struggle and a lot of things in movies we don't want to go to a movie where nothing there's no conflict or bad happens that would be the worst movie ever the movie the greatest movies are the ones that take you down to the depths and you buy it you're and you you suspend your disbelief and you're down there and then you come up with it and the story's believable and you lose yourself in the movie but without the conflict the movie sucks do you worry about that with your kid like in a certain way I do with my kids it's like I don't want my kids to experience a lot of adversity just you want to protect your children yeah yeah but I know that all the people that I know that experience adversity are the most interesting people you know all the people that we know think about all the people who know look things like Joey Diaz he's one of the most interesting guys ever because his life was completely crazy like his life was full total chaos like the adversity you had to go through the adversity I had to go through the adversity Cowen had a good like all the people that we know that are interesting they all had kind of a fucked up life yeah what's that about do you think that you could get away with just exposing your kid to difficult things like jiu-jitsu like exposing them to martial arts and maybe they could develop their character that way without having to go through the horrible ups and downs of I don't know if jiu-jitsu promotes or guarantees great sense of humor and the ability to make other people laugh but the one thing in my experience that I know that jiu-jitsu does for children absolutely and it's it's has a lot to do with you what you always talk about and when a kid doesn't have martial arts in jiu-jitsu specifically because of the tapping and getting tapped out what that shows you that automatically in jiu-jitsu you know where you stand you know where you stand you know that you're a blue belt your problem not gonna be purple belts that much but when you do you'll get your purple belt and you're probably not gonna be brown belts and black belts that much in the beginning but when you start doing it then you get rambha and so on in your black belt so when a kid comes into jiu-jitsu he's four years old five years old he knows that he's not gonna it rarely gonna beat the seven year olds and when he's seven he's really gonna beat the ten years so that teaches if they don't go through that there is a possibility not always there's plenty of great kids that have never done jiu-jitsu but what I've seen with jiu-jitsu kids it almost guarantees that they won't be delusional and become a douche bag kid because if you don't if you're not checked that way with the cap like reminding you that this guy's 15 years old you better respect that 15 year old and then that what ends up happening is when you become 15 you you know what it was like going through the early stages of jiu-jitsu so you I see kids that are 10 and 11 are great with the five year olds and great with the six year old it takes you out of that delusionary state and lets you know that you better respect your elders and as you get older you better respect the kids too because they're gonna get older - so what jiu-jitsu really does is people put it instills discipline in you like most people think martial arts does like karate and Taekwondo and that definitely works too cuz it does promote discipline but jiu-jitsu does it I think better because of the tapping most kids that I know that are good at jiu-jitsu they have a tremendous relationship with their father it drains them tighter traveling all over the world like I do in all these seminars uh-oh I don't know how many times I've met kids use jiu-jitsu fein arms that are eight nine years old and their dads bring them to jiu-jitsu and they're best friends Avery down in um and he used to be in Springfield now he's in Omaha he's 16 now him and his dad are best friends and when I when I run into them like yeah you give me advice you know what else did you do cuz they're just you see it over and over again so for those of you with kids out there and maybe you're having trouble with the kids try to talk them into jujitsu you know it might be hard but I think that if you're having trouble with your kids or you want to ensure a beautiful relationship a tight relationship a trusting relationship and you know relationship where the kid your kid wants to hang out with this popping and you did you just until you do it with your kid that that's just a little something that I've learned that's a little insight you can take that bool for what it is I I'm just I'm just relics good advice if anything the kid can do that's difficult it's good for their personality development one of the real problems with kids today is cuz everything's handed to you you don't develop character because you don't ever face adversity your food comes from a supermarket you can go to a store and get whatever you fuckin need you know it's it's not hard it's it's it's easy to live life and so when when you're not tested especially as a young person like a lot of bullying comes from insecurity and people say like what's the best way to stop bullying I always say the best way to stop bullying is teach kids how to fight if you had like mandatory jujitsu classes if you had mandatory martial arts classes in school you would have a whole lot less bullying because first of all that they wouldn't be inclined to do it and second of all it wouldn't work like if a guy is talented and skilled and he's 155 pounds and there's an asshole that's 180 pounds it's fucking with him he's not gonna back down they're gonna figure out a way around it the kids gonna be able to figure out a way like listen you know if you want to fucking fight you want to be an asshole and pick on me I have to fucking defend myself then I'll defend myself but it's not he's gonna be terrified not know what the fuck to do it's gonna be a completely different scenario and I think that one of the reasons why people do in the first place is they're trying to they're trying to prove that they aren't scared themselves the reason why people are bullies what I have that instinct is they're insecure they're trying to be dominant without you know without putting into work but if you put in the work if you do jiu-jitsu if you learn a martial art you actually develop some proficiency you don't have that need you know that need to dominate people you don't have to need you get it all out you get it all out in the gym all my boys were arrests on the wrestling team so that kind of like no make wrestling's different expressing the sport and probably they're just sick of you know I mean where your boy did your boys growing up no really yeah I mean I was bullied before I started doing martial arts but from like 14 on not really because I was like thinking about like all my bullies were all guys in sports like football team wrestling most of us like john wrestlers yeah with bullies in what way like how you you know like just pushed her out on the like the playground and stuff like that what year you talking about middle school elementary middle strip you like when you're walking yeah I was fucked with a lot but didn't like in high school it went away it's a douchebag move man to be a bully it's one of the worst things a person can do yeah it's a it's a weird natural human weakness it's a weakness instinct like my shit was muscles a bone my parents were divorced and I was poor I think was that big why they picked our mean they pick on you because you're poor yeah because I lived in Worthington which is a higher-end place in Columbus but I was like living on that one part that was all apartments that was it shouldn't have been in there you know but somehow I was in Worthington I knew I was poor and my parents were divorced back then back then divorce wasn't as crazy as it is now or you know yeah it was unusual yeah a little bit more unusual yeah isn't that weird that like when we were younger people didn't bother getting divorced or they didn't happen nearly as much not in my neighborhood everybody got divorced all my friends didn't have fathers all of them except one manorial Galvin he's the only one out of maybe 15 friends that we had growing up everywhere every father left you've been a really poor neighborhoods all Mexican Mexicans believing they get drunk and go back to Mexico say fuck that isn't that weird man with people that don't kick take care of their kids as a father now doesn't that freak you out yeah man I can't imagine me my father had 19 kids from 8 different chicks 19 is he still alive I don't know what kind of crazy hell does that guy live in when he closes his eyes I'm one of the last but last time I saw him I was 27 and he my my on my mom's side my mom's mother and father they stayed together to the very end never married 50-plus years and had 10 kids and my dad told me first he told me at 14 I saw him at 14 then I saw him at 27 at 14 he tries to shove advice down my throat and he said make sure you marry when you marry your wife she's at least 15 years younger than you tell me that I remember that and he also said the office and my wife is 15 years younger than me it wasn't strategic but it just happened that way and the other thing he told me at 14 was be nice to kids because they grow up really fast and they'll turn into adults so he was trying to give me the right advice and then at 27 I hadn't seen him in forever I thought he was dead he shows up one day and I my grandpa cize goes do what your old days I do what your grandfather did that's the way have kids every Christmas and Thanksgiving has all his family and all his grandkids that's the way I to do it over I would do it that way that's what he said he was a massive player just banging everything and just getting everybody pregnant wow that's so sad yeah it's a sad life man yeah and I asked him I go what made you want to come by this time I was like he hadn't been around and I just I heard he showed up to my grandfather's house he had been friends with my grandfather while he was messing with my mom and him and my grandfather got along and my aunt called goes your dad's get over here now your dad's at your grandma's and I man I'm in Hollywood I Drive down to Orange County and the whole drive down I'm like I'm just I'm not gonna give him a hard time I hadn't seen him in like 13 years am I gonna get my hard time I'm just gonna start over I could get another chance my father I was like Troy was a long drive I can Howard drive and show up at my grandma's house and I'm happy got a smile like damn I thought he was dead I'd have dreams of him dying and he is this real he's right here shed let's go out to eat we went to Black Angus and Tustin my mom went we're all sitting there at like Bach we get a second chance meanwhile I'm all happy to see my father and I rarely you know my mom wants to see me more than I actually drive down and see her but now I want to start another relationship with my father so then I asked my father and at this point I didn't know about his 19 kids at this point I thought I had five kids from I knew he was married had five kids and he was seeing my mom and on the side I knew that my mom is a side girl that's what I do at this point and I said why did you come by this time look I'm curious age and I was expecting them to say it's been so long I wanted to see what happened you know what yeah it's become of you and he said oh I just I was passing through Orange County and and I wanted to see if your grandfather was still cool with me I didn't know if he was mad at me or anything no and I just I just kept the smile on and right there right there looked at my mom and I'm like fuck this dude fuck this guy I'm gonna spend time with my mom fuck that dude and just kept a smile on it right there I made the decision I would never see this guy ever again and I never did but that's so during that dinner he did say one of the two of his kids live in LA the ones from that family because they want to have dinner with you they want to meet you so I did end up meeting with them never saw him again they're the ones who told me they sat me down at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Hollywood when I was 27 and they go do you have any idea how many kids your father has I said five plus me hey God he has 19 kids I said how did that happen because he got not only did did they know about it he told his family about every kid and every girl he was seeing he was trying to drive his wife and saying to get a divorce she wouldn't divorce him she was hardcore Catholic so she wouldn't divorce he wanted a divorce he wanted a to marry my mom that's what he says but she wouldn't give him a divorce so he would tell her they knew all about me because he would come home and to say oh my TS pregnant now Almighty I had the baby we named it Edgar who would come home to his wife to his wife and kids and say ah Maria had had I just got pregnant we just had our kid I'll be gone for the weekend I'm gonna spend time with my son so I actually spend from my mom Mike my dad had my mom in an apartment promising that he would leave his my mom thought he was gonna leave us his why his wife for him for her she was in love and he never did but he had her in an apartment in downtown LA and then after like three years apparently I lived with him for three years my mom just said enough so now she went back to Orange County back to her parents house and that was the end of that weird thing isn't it the idea that someone could just do that when you have kids now and you you know I know you you know you get on a plane we were talking about you leave your house knowing you're going away for the weekend you miss them as soon as you get in your car yeah you start driving away but this guy could just abandon this kid and then see you and even have like a connection with you be like oh I just want to see if your grandfather was mad at me yeah and then when I talked to them when I had that when they told me about the 19 kids they it started to make sense I'm like no wonder he didn't give a fuck about me now I understand I got 19 kids how can he he was you know was never a dick to me when he would see me once a year he would cruise by did he hug you maybe not but I found out that he never said I love you had some probably never told any of his kids I love you never said I love you so he had something really wrong with them so then it all became clear like oh this guy has no love in him that's why he just keeps having kids with whoever and he doesn't really care he was never a dick to me he just didn't really like care that much about me it's kind of weird because that's sort of like if you look at nature if you look at the programming of the human animal that's like the programming the programming is to spread your seat as much as possible the programming is to have as many babies as you can the program is not for the male to take care of them though it's really strange you know the program is to keep going to keep spreading that seed and that's one of the reasons why they say that like the intensity of an attraction like it goes away within a few months of meeting someone like the intensity when you first meet them that intensity of attraction for a man goes away with it within the first five or six months because usually by then the woman's already pregnant in nature yeah you've been banging her you know every day for several months one of the days she's been ovulating he's shot one in there and insured this intense bond you know initially to make sure that you continue to having sex as much as possible to increase your odds of getting them pregnant and then all of a sudden this weird thing kicks in where you want to go sometimes i kicks in as soon as you not post not syndrome' baby yeah but it's it's it's a weird thing that that nature is literally set up that way and so in order to conform to what society expects from person you have to fight against your genetics you have to literally fight your instinct you're interesting to fuck other girls their instinct to shoot loads into them and get them pregnant it's weird remember do you remember that when we worked on the man show that sketch I wrote for postman syndrome a pill that you could take that where you could you could have sex with the girl and not get PostNet syndrome if you take the 30 minutes before sex I don't remember that obviously it never it never got green-lighted but I just reminded me of that that was a pill right that's a real thing with men though Plus that syndrome is serious it's the feeling that you have like right after you tell me like oh my god I gotta get out of here but and if you don't have that that's when you know like hey I think on somebody she's cool I think I found a real relationship like hey let's go watch TV what are you saying what after I come I just want to with every chick he's half retarded Wow it's different you know those girls think if you have sex with and they're really dumb and you go oh my god why did I do this you just want to jump when he's as smart as them so it's perfectly they talk about shoes yeah they sit there they talk about who that girls don't really get PostNet syndrome unless they're married or something and you know then they feel guilty but if they're not married if they have sex with you they they fall more in love with you oh that's especially high early that depends entirely on what the experience was generally though right more the guys get post on syndrome way more than girls it's also the guys that we know - we know a bunch of savages you know if you compare like we went to an accountants meeting you know how you guys feel after you come hunt you know people some people manage to talking about sex it's a weird thing when dudes start talking like you and I have done this before we won't name any names but we've had sex conversations around square dudes and you watch them panic like they absolutely panic you know like they don't know what the fuck to say like how often you fuck your wife be serious and some guys that tell you like fuck my wife like three times a week no more than that like I don't want to fuck her every day but I fuck her a lot and some guys would just go what they just they just cluster them up twice a day I can't or they will say I can't know why just not something that I discuss you don't discuss how often you bang your wife with another man like it why wouldn't you discuss that yeah do you not love your wife if you love your wife you have sex do I so is that off the books you can't talk about it like woody I'm not I'm not asking you like specific details you know it's crazy about my wife is before the kid you know once you once you're going out with a girl for a year or two years you come home from jujitsu my classes are kind of late a lot of times I'm broken I just went to war for an hour with guys from out of town trying to tap me I come home I'm gonna drink a protein shake I'm gonna get on the internet a little bit I'm just gonna collapse and die generally after jujitsu so you know for a while there you know it's like I have sex tomorrow you just keep putting it off and you don't have sex as much and then when you have a kid now you can only have sex when that baby's asleep right so now I I really can't have it that much so I wanted way more than ever geez don't be easy with the voice in the microphone in my old age the one thing I learned cuz I've dated girls that didn't some girls didn't want sex as much as I did and that would kind of piss me off I'm 23 and it's like man this is bullshit I should I should get it whenever I want you're my girlfriend why are you oh you're tired like it would I would get pissed off and I'm like man I want a girl that wants to fuck anytime I want it you know so but then you have girls and I've had most girls were wanted it more than I did I was always the tired one and they always wanted more in it I get to the point where it's kind of bothersome I'm like damn she wants it way too much but now looking back at all that and where I'm at now yeah looking back at that now I would rather want it all the time and rarely get it then always get it and rarely want it that's the one thing that's definitely better as long as you are still getting it yes did you see this day Chael Sonnen and Wanderlei silver gonna host tough Brazil The Ultimate Fighter Brasil fect Chael Sonnen is gonna go to fucking Brazil that crazy asshole after all the shit that he talked on Brazilians and Wanderlei Silva and chill has been like putting like these rhymes up on his on his Twitter account is it gonna be in English or Brazil

headed to England I'm going to Manchester UFC yeah well I'm going I was going to do that blood treatment thing in Germany huh but I mean now I'm gonna do it in Santa Monica they do it in Santa Monica what's the blood treatment so stem-cell thing that guys do for their discs it's supposed to be incredible for it's been that's the one thing that kept me out of jiu-jitsu I've been like we were talking about been injuries and you look forward to getting back to jiu-jitsu I've been stitched up before I've had two knee surgeries and I went back to jiu-jitsu at my nose fixed went back to new jutsu and everything's fine but this was a scary one when you start getting numb hands and then we knew quite a few people that have had like real serious issues with their backs where they have atrophy of their arms and bas Rutten has one arm that's like literally half the size of his other arm it's scary so I wasn't down with any surgeries man I wanted to make sure that I did all the right things as far as rehabilitate and I got a lot stronger I came back that one day and rolled pretty fucking hard and didn't have any problems but it was real stiff and I'm the next day it was stiff and sore but I'm like at least I could roll I know I can roll but I think I can make this thing better go back have a road sense mostly been doing just more time and a lot of weight lifting which doesn't bother me it does bother me with kettlebells and it doesn't bother me with with Muay Thai it's just getting my neck cranked and the day I came back to the gym - it was all arm triangles it was a member believe it was a arm triangle transitions and guillotines which is um my favorite I love arm triangles but goddamn this a lot of shit going on with her neck so how are you feeling right now today feel fine stiff my back stiff but that's just cuz I lifted weights yesterday pretty hard man I hope that works out for you me too you got to do it too men yeah my back's feeling great but I would to make it it's not it's not 100% but it doesn't stop me from rolling doesn't I'm from training I just got to really focus on keeping my hamstrings nice and stretched I never stretched my hamstrings ever that was that's the downfall of lower boxes is tense and in tight hamstrings so that's a new thing of mine where every morning I'm waking up I'm stretching my hamstrings before class after class sometimes you know I don't have time but I I'm more committed to stretching my hamstrings more than anything this is a stretch this is what the stuff is that's important but this is what this stuff it's called it's the the way the term is called regen Akeem re GN okay I and II ortho keen it's is the actual medical procedure and you take they take your blood extract it they manipulated somehow then reintroduce it to the body as an anti-inflammatory drug to reduce chronic pain and arthritis and the process involves two ounces of blood drawn from your arm then it's incubated in a slightly raised temperature the liquid is then placed in a centrifuge until its constituents parts are separated the middle yellowish layer is dense with agents that are believed to stop our and arthritic agent known as interleukin 1 which causes degeneration of the joints and a breakdown of cartilage that serum is injected into the patient's effected area the procedure reduces pain and discomfort to the joint and the treatment generally lasts five days with six shots of the serum into the affected area it's normal for a patient to receive annual injections to ease joint discomfort so many pro athletes have done this and had miraculous recoveries Peyton Manning went to Germany for this he's he did to neck surgeries and he was on his way out of football and now he's a fucking
