late but things got delayed to point seven so Tom you recently got one on a biker here sober October is fucking over Oh how'd everybody get through I mean I got through I think the real question is Bert how you feeling I feel great yeah yeah I was upset this ad nauseum I feel ridiculous saying it one of my funnest months of my entire life it was a very educational month for me yeah it was it was a learning experience I thought that I really thought that the exercise and discipline is like benefits super beneficial I'm trying to do something restrict your socks or something yeah yeah and like you know the fucking class has got tedious for all of us here say it's a chore oh especially like when I I went on a trip you know like a road trip where I was like traveling every day to a new city you know so when I got back I was like I'm gonna go like eight days in a row that's what I did and I finished it off with nine days in a row that kind of sucks I thought or something the weird thing I knew I was gonna be home for nine days so I planned it that way but the weird thing about it was that it was almost like a oh man was like a fucking Vision Quest or something yeah I knew that I when I got to that 15th day I was like giddy that was that beam class was like wow can't believe is gonna go down and as I was starting the breathing thing I was thinking at the end when I'm doing that breathing exercise I'll be fucking done ya know I was really excited I did 14 with you guys yeah and that next day I was like this shit is over and I had four days they go people were like go for twenty and I was like go fuck your 14th or by the way the best class that anyone's ever taken really halloween-themed hold on hold on hold on so yeah I saw that yeah sorry and I walk in we pull our mats in the room isn't as hot as to our liking oddly enough were now experts at this she's like you know it's got a Halloween theme I hope you guys are cool with like a little heart not lighted approach Ori and I get and they go all right time to do breathing exercises and you hear more Ghostbusters smiling through the whole class it's like thriller ghostbusters and then that last one when you do their quick breathing exercises and ease dude I looked in that mirror and I thought I really thought man I've had a really into it a little bit I'm like I've had an insane fucking journey this mat over I was like ah and I didn't feel like I was done in a weird way like I was like I'm gonna do it every year I'm gonna I'm doing I'm doing that every year but I'm going back to hot yoga tomorrow morning really yeah yeah cuz I enjoy it I got a guy I get to like it yeah I've got a bunch of classes that I take regularly but I'd like I like doing at least once a week I feel like when I do it once a week it balances me out I feel like that was a very fun class it sounded like you were taking is the opposite of most the instruction very good I hate to say this with say without sound again you have a good body thank you you don't want to work out like it but if you're not just long you have like you have decent genetics if you got into genes face like his fucking yoga was impressing Mia yeah like that your ability to achieve that eagle pose and I know it's because you have long legs you can wrap around the wrap around dude I was I was pretty sure no yes when we first started doing it I was like everyone's gonna die I've been doing this for a while this guy's gonna feel it and then Ari's like I could do to order by the way 100% that sounds just like you we're talking about was that when you said like that that 100% bird and I were like he's going to the wrong class we had zeroed out that you were they were definitely not going to the height like we thought you were going to some fucking like like smell the flowers is breathing right into this space right here through my nose just on a critter whistle do you ever like finger your own buttons the best I can do look at that shit Wow at least you get the elbow under the elbow yeah I can't go where you are yeah post yoga but doing nothing but lifting weights because I barely lifted weights during yeah it's a pretty good workout though it's a very good work that's great it leaned that my shoulders are my neck not a ton but I noticed it that I was like oh I should definitely lift some weights well you know what it's good for for real as your back yeah it's phenomenal for your spine yeah make it makes you work in ways you're just not gonna do yeah you're never doing that standing airplane standing T when your arms are forward your leg kicks back and you barely can hold it for 10 seconds yeah or that at the bolo point post rather do that shit yeah there was a lot of people that we were getting like people right I'm going today I'm gonna fall you fucking assholes for a mom going alright and they were trying it out that's all the was gonna be you know what's good about this here's this good about this it lacked all the controversy of the first contest the first contest was like a bet there was five states there's stakes it was weight to lose and at first I thought well this one doesn't even have any fucking stakes yeah like who cares if I don't get the 15 class yeah and or if I sneak a little weed in but you know who cares you care right yeah like the weird thing is that we were all doing it together and every time every time I got on stage this weekend I would say so I just finished sober October you would I thought it'd be like saying I just wrapped fucking Star Wars eight like they want to open up my square garden when do they go crazy they were crazy see they went crazy and then I said is the dumbest fucking bet ever because there's no goddamn steaks and if you were to finish 14 classes or drink then the punishment is that we would go like also like you're that guy no you host a party for everybody yeah I guess yes I forgot about that right yellow Corvette that's what oh you've got one fateful evening that would have been a lot of fun it was you think you're funny it's a need a comedian the best part for me because I think and I take this a little more introspective that dub I doubled up on someone therapy and I was like the coolest part was that I was I should have been honest when I am in retrospect the next day I was like I should never have told him how much I drink yeah I was like I don't say that now but that next day I was like oh this is coming come out bad like people are gonna see be sad when I drink [Laughter] there was the feeling going into the month to be fair was you know we're all trying to do this it's a challenge but everyone's like how is Bert about we you did get a lot of it and we did pray for you tell you guys that I decided like literally last minute to forgo weed yeah I decided at Disneyland we figured we can you up until the 31st at midnight and the 30th to midnight I bet she'll come to your senses well I just decided some somewhere along not at Halloween the other than we make any sense before not on Halloween what I remember what it was I was a businessman that's what it was before October even started it was like the 28th or 29th a.m. and I was like no that was August 11 all this his runaround is a man so spoiled in a good way but we when I decided it I wasn't gonna tell anybody but I told Tom I told Tom like four or five days in I'm like I'm not doing weed any they're talking all this crazy shit just wait I'm gonna tell him at the end they hadn't even smoked weed but then all these people were commenting and saying like you can't even quit weed for a month while these guys are doing it yeah this is a bad example let me just come out and say it yeah that's a nice term you're talking about it well that was the my favorite I had a lot of favorites about this the one was that you guys all joined in and all gave up something and did the challenge to made it fun and really took it like this scope off of me like everyone was like what's her per can I do but it made it fun it didn't make it look like now it's just Bert not drinking oh yeah yeah and then my favorite part ever was when I got that text I was sitting naked in bed crisscross applesauce and Ari's text said get ready for your comments gentlemen we're going after Joe on my Instagram they've got a lot of views and it was me jogging through the woods I shot a long time ago yeah and in and I sent it to each of you and said can I green like this I'd like to post it and then it said the Machine goes sober with Joe with two titty Tom Segura are either well severe and powerful Joe Rogan and I was like gentlemen no weed no booze and I was like Joe hadn't replied I'm not gonna post it because I didn't know about the weed thing and then Ori came out and was like no we're going after it get your decks ready I remember being excited you want to pay into a corner yes not Joe in my head and I was like no he is he is one of us fucking take him down he's right and so we all set our text up Ari posted his me and Tom went right after it and we watched it just you texted you motherfucker we never did say there's like last minute you guys like two or three days away you guys were deciding that there was gonna be no weed and I was like fuck these guys but when I said fuck these guys man the response it was it's not right the right thing to do is I gotta quit lead to even guys doesn't quit anytime what is it not quitting exactly you gotta just quit Burt you don't understand this is me and Joe's medicine I didn't have weed for the entire month but when Ari came to the yoga class in Encino and I heard that he was getting drug tests so I was like okay sure they go into my brain and go wait a minute where is that I'll tell Ari but I'll take his weed test if I can fucking punch him we test but if I'm clean the three of us were sitting in the corner and they're like where's our needs we run late and I go I think you went to pick up drugs yeah that thing where I go I was thinking the same thing I was like I was like yeah no I'll be clean it's like it's like your gland it's like when you land in Singapore yeah and you're like I know I don't have any fun because they're like death and you're like I know I didn't bring any but then you start unzipping every every yeah you're like in your backpack yeah nothing right I got nothing in here a cop or something yeah here's the problem with smoking a lot of weed I have a really good memory but I also don't sometimes weird shit will happen and I'll go I didn't do that right you know like I get weird about sir like if I see a cop anyways instigating a break-in in the building I would start feeling guilty yeah I'd be like I definitely do anything didn't want to make sure these guys know I didn't do anything then I'll sound guilty right doesn't like what who the fuck would rob a building yeah society those who wouldn't do that yeah I might even say something racist if it's a white guy yeah sure wait I'll talk so much shit about white people it feels good in white people yeah dude did you was it hard at all what about the fun you hadn't flown sober in her on the fly how many years I am sober in a good good deal years no no at least seven and you be not sober not what I wanted to jam I mean like you've gotten drunk flow without some sort of an abrasion and probably the last time I remember doing it I was still doing laughs unlimited and I had to fly that for an audition and there was an hour flight and I had to either give me two beers and I held onto them in case something happened I was I just gonna kill him and fuck it I was like but yeah that was it wasn't he was held on to two beers during the flight whoa you were on death's door son you were like still Wester Stallone and cliffhanger with that fucking ice pick hanging off the cliff yeah yeah just held him in my hands for the first flight it was a long time ago I was on my hands I was like I was like if we start having real bad turbulence I'm just gonna kill him real quick and then all my anxiety go away that was the first flight wasn't hard as soon as I got home it was super easy did you ever hold any alcohol during the month I didn't touch any alcohol didn't you hold it in your hand I mean oh what a plane yeah no not at all wait how did it affect you going booze free not at all not at all that's right lost weight I lost weight I wanted sugar eight pounds right didn't you say I was a sweet taste sugar like a motherfucker yeah I could not stop eating sugar um I felt great there was no detox I just started sleeping better and then I started feeling amazing I gotta tell you my biggest thing is I was like I was in love with coffee a lot started loving coffee so good it's such a treat man yeah it is great coffee yeah I have a friend and he had a little problem with the pills yeah and when he got off the pills he started doing Monster energy drinks like yo and motherfucker yeah yeah oh wait a minute how many you always have one of your hand you ever met a mountain Dew addict yeah I know a guy that wrote rolls around with a two liter good like in like like tucked into his pretty fucking high you know I mean like between fuck like a like a two liter just ran around with it yeah in his lap and then it's deep right yeah next one I used to be the sign of what alcoholic one ten years ago was it they had a Red Bull like no one else drank Red Bulls well you know what's crazy when I was a kid I worked on construction site there was a guy was an alcoholic and he would drink out of a mountain Dew jug he would drink 40 ounces take a 40 ounce and he would pour it he would drink it warm all day long you should drink nothing else Jeff I'll never forget him he I'll never forget this guy because I was about 18 and I was just getting out of high school and one of the guys that I did martial arts with owned a small construction company in Dorchester so we'd go to that bad neighborhood Dorchester wasn't good and was drinking Mountain Dew out of his when I lived there he lived in this house that we were renovating the house is fucked up it didn't have any air conditioning did some windows were missing there's a lot of open insulation and he had like a camp set up in this house and he was also like working for this construction company that my friend only had a green plastic jug of Mountain Dew and it was filming for it and you could see the bubbles in it you just look at it you go give this definitely not fucking soda it's all the bubbles in it let's go drink it all day and his hands would shake but he would do his job what if you found out he quit and it's actually Jeff Bezos that founded Amazon figured it out bro figured that nobody got a hold of an Anthony Robbins cassette yeah fucking got his life together went to a Cal cease seminar yeah sparks coming out of his fingers on it no I had a word for somebody teased none never what are you gonna die yeah that was but your blood pressure dropped substantially right yeah yeah and I and I kind of fell in love with being sober again like of like of like how much enough it feels good to just drive around and just go I'm totally clear-headed and I'm not like going like I fuckin beat man I'm hungover yeah yeah I need a coffee just to get to the other side of the hill just wake up and go maybe I'll stop in the top of the hill and go for a ride hike on Runyon yeah it was like really great flying Sobers changed my life although I didn't do it on my flight back from New Orleans he did her trunks yeah I had like four or five drinks yeah one but that was only because I've got way too fucked up on that cruise you know Melissa Etheridge she doesn't think that she could ever be in a car crash why because she thinks that she knows it's a reality with her mind hmm and she gets on a plane and she says these people are so lucky on the plane with me because they'll never be in a plane crash yeah I'm that way with AIDS the new terrorism some dude running down the street with a needle just fuckin squirting AIDS and if he will most likely if you stay away from needles and weird gay sex you're not gonna get AIDS probably not but like you can clean crashes yeah you can't control a plane crash no that's so dumb it's not even like what are you talking about well it's based on the same thing that the secret and all that Law of Attraction steps based on it's based on success yeah but your problem with that is being delusional you don't know well the problem with that is you're eligible no the problem with that is you're only talking to people that are successful yes a lot of people have similar ideas they weren't successful so you only it's you're dealing with a very shitty control group Yeah right because you're only going it's not scientific you're only going to the people that were successful you talk to someone who just has perfect features talk to Angelina Jolie how do you get so lucky well I was in another dimension and I bet she got lucky she's got Bell's palsy right now really so half her face is frozen yeah from what stress from Brad leaving her and her raising six kids whatever she got she's got Bell's palsy yeah she got Bell's palsy you get that from stress you friends with Harvey Levin no somewhere I'm obsessed with Bell's palsy because I'm always afraid I'll get it before I shoot something big and then just like sorry it's had a teacher that had it for a couple weeks for real yeah all right it's great birds do you ever think you'll get to a point where you realize you're successful enough where you could just relax or do you always think you're always going to be in this place where you like but I hope nothing happens to me before this masshealth balls it yeah I hope I hope I don't get sick before this big thing happens because the the thing is always right around the corner like what if the thing what if you got to a point we like Ron White right we're talking about Rama for the podcast how funny is Ron white still 60 kill yeah killing it's selling out six thousand seat arena it's just killing it you know do you think he'd relax like Ron it like Ron doesn't gala wouldn't be long I really couldn't be running I don't follow Ron on periscope he doesn't give up he really genuinely does give a fuck and I wish I could be more that way I would like he he came in to do when I did a podcast with him he came in smoking a joint smoked it through the entire by himself in all didn't offer but not in a rude way smoke the entire joint and then said oh I forgot you're a drinker and then we started drinking tequila and now in my head I'm like my days wrapped like I've just drank half a bottle of tequila the wrong way I'm gonna go home and celebrate and I was like so what are you doing tonight he's like I want with the store and I was like I could never go to the store that fucked up like and he was totally fine but I see him on periscope and he'll just be smoking joints and drinking and tonight just love and life I can never be that in what way why can't you be that what do you mean I don't like going onstage drunk I don't like being out of control on stage but what about what about the part of like being content what do you mean like isn't that what the professional however you can tell well the question is not a matter of content it's a matter about worrying about potential horrible things happening to you because you're so insecure about the future wow that's so stay away because I believe that my my worrying hope it sets up scenarios for me to avoid those problems that's a good point of view so i sledge it I worry about a lot of things like when I go to do radio I worry about like what have asked me this wasn't and I get my myself prepared for it it's a lot of times it's for nothing yeah and I think about it when you say are you saying like when you go on the radio you're worried that they're gonna set you off are they gonna be mean to you or something or maybe it's not always not always be prepare for the onset right I always prepare for the onside kick I mean it's like a once in a couple times every year or something we try yes not that comes the last minute attempt so it's basically with a channel wofe it doesn't happened once well it's like it's not gonna happen every game it's not a surprise though what you do once a year or it's like you need the ball back you have ten seconds left yeah it's a way to kick to the other team but you kick it let's say very short and you get the ball back it's like a martial arts comparison so in question mark kick no it's more like the one that Miyagi taught what's the name yeah that thing just like front kick that's what I have it once yeah lyoto machida vert he did that exact kick really knocked out Randy KOTOR the crank cut he literally did the exact same kick you said arms in the air well huh but Duane Ludwig did put his arms in the air in king of the cage and myth he was beating the fuck of this poor dude this is old school and you can wear wrestling shoes so shad Smith was wearing wrestling shoes chad smith who eventually became the first openly gay MMA fighter article about him in new york times are very interesting like super honest article very interesting stuff but he fought dwayne he had no business being in the cage with dwayne it was the early days of MMA people hadn't realized that Dwayne was a bas Rutten student yeah super technical striker one of the best striking coaches like today like just he coached TJ Dillashaw just won the bantamweight title yeah but Dwayne fuck this dude up for Dwayne was on like a way higher level and and these guys were used to in the middle of the fight he stood there and put his did crane kick and the guy walked into it well look there's doing he was just he was beating the fuck out of this guy so bad that he could have done anything to him why see if he could play the fight oh my god it's just it's it was preposterous how bad he beat this dudes like yeah dealing to beat yeah he was like skateboarding with those shoes on I mean it was ridiculous other guy fans yep he has crazy laces yeah but look at the beating I mean it's just so wrong this is done already Dwayne is so technical he's never in a position where he could do anything to him like right there that combination man this art not gonna that left hook to the body right low kick that's about as classical Muay Thai combinations you get such a small cage right but in the middle of the fight Dwayne did that you please he's like bitch I got you extend that analogy and then just don't prepare for the onside kick runner great fighters is there a fighter that doesn't look at every option because I believe there's a lot of factors I look if I figure if you I do that with material where if you just look at every angle and just kind of obsessive-compulsive lee tear it apart then you're never gonna be surprised and when you are surprised it's you won't get hurt there's yes and there's no right because there's there's factors when it comes to fighting and then this factors if you made the analogy for comedy that you wouldn't apply to Joey Diaz like one of the things about Joey Diaz is Joey Diaz is going off the cuff like a good 60% of the time and he has all these ideas that he can go off the cuff from but it would almost be like preparation for Joey would be like detrimental yeah like he prepares a certain amount but that off the cuff has got he's got to live in that moment yeah like that's why you got to see Joey Diaz lie it's like living in that moment nothing like it and that's and it's also almost like I think his best shit is like hanging around with him like who knows you love him like Tommy when you and I did that podcast with him when we did the thousandth episode and the three of us we were Tommy and I couldn't breathe we're gonna talk we had a stop we were both leaning old under the table holding her sides while Joey was just crushing yeah and it you can't you can't write that down we did you couldn't plan it out you couldn't can't take it to the stage he's got to just he's does it in his way and like there's there's like there's a lot of power in that too so like there's a power in like a guy who has unbelievable athleticism and power like a rampage Jackson who just hit was so powerful rampage in his prime was so goddamn powerful and then there's being like super technical and like which ones better both depends to the means in any part of my life that's ten but it's a technique to observing your comedy like to going over your material I think I consider to be a very technical thing the over the last like four or five years I've taken it progressively more and more serious where I forced myself to listen to recordings I forced myself to write bits out and consider all the different aspects of them writing them out and then consider them as I'm saying them on stage and I never did that before yeah I never did that to about four or five years ago I would write occasionally that's what I did till about four or five years ago I would record my sets and I would write a case you become more technical yeah it is technical but I'm never gonna be as funny as Joey Diaz okay do you know I'm saying yes yeah yeah those moments that he hit they're different they're different there's a different kind of moment yeah and it's it's not a planned out moment Oh soon as he says let me tell you something dogs that's what I that's my jaw would get mad not at me but about things to me that I wasn't even arguing with yelling at you just to get ready to go onstage so you'd be backstage with these fucking guys with that fucking comedy rooms what the fuck is all comedy get so fired up who do you fuckin mama's with your glass is when you're old school fuckin lace-up boots get the fuck out of here he was just get so anybody anybody was saying he would take that just run onto the stage and he would just go on there already fucking beat it up that's what he calls you like bootleg hello let me tell you one thing she yelled at me at The Improv once for bringing a notebook no you're right fucking no poker here Joe Rogan you like one of those fucking guys who come let me bring my notebook on stage and all the same fucking material I have a talent for five fucking years I told you I would Joey and my dad on every plane yeah they flew together yeah my dad flew with Joey no really so yeah my dad gets my dad loves Joey loves Joey certain Tampa Joey's doing Tampa my dad gets on the plane and Joey's eating a space cake and he goes oh mr. Kang you want one of my cookies Joey's already dosed my dad before my dad twice my dad's like no I'm good Joey so my dad sits on the flight he lands and he texted me and he says Joey Dee's on my flight maybe we should get my ride home except with Joey and I live next door to each other near each other so my dad I get my days off the plane and he goes he goes as I was a flight he goes it was great I was looking at Joey Joey's out the whole fucking flight he sucked I said what about your fight because I said Nicole goddamn moron and I said really was a fucking more I didn't tell you this because I sat next to a fucking moron I'm more on Burt guys rip with muscles but the dumbest human being I could sit next I said why and he goes five hours he played candy crush he's a grown man the first five hours he played candy crush I mean you think he'd have a thought that he'd write down I want to lift up a paper but for five hours he played fucking candy crushing Joey Diaz comes out around the corner of the airport and goes dog your dad sat next to John Cena John Cena plays candy crush fuck with those games man I don't fly with those game they cause the pressure about that yeah yeah my wife's got a problem with that that subway surfer won i watch her piloting all the time no there's too many crazy games out there and you know razor you know the company that makes gaming peripherals parties they have a fucking razor now has a phone a gaming phone all for those games with crazy large speakers on the sides of it so like it as bezels that have like these speakers with base it has a giant battery where it'll fucking play video games forever and you're just gonna be a stone-cold addictive man on your phone and it's good 120 frames per second yeah the refresh rate is like way about like double what a regular phone is Matthew taught his wife I don't wait lost in those fucking if you're in London if you doing coke in London you fucking crazy for Heisenberg got the girl oh never mind I shouldn't say that yep who had the craziest dreams do we go do we all have crazy crazy dreams at this five days at this time Lucy it's like eight days it's for lack of a weed it was like almost immediately from a maybe two or three days really yeah two or three days no weed yeah but I didn't have much weed before then I got a tapered off the last week and then two or three days with no weed and I was having fuck primal dreams yeah really wolves chasing me to cave there was a giant blonde like a light brown bear and it was with a baby and it noticed me and I was realizing it was gonna chase me out of the fucking cave I'm super realistic like terrifying super realistic super realistic wolf dreams wolves with extra-large paws they were like these big wolves that could run in snow because their paws were extra large they'd like snowshoe paws and I was stuck trying to run away from wolves dude is that your is that your go-to animal that kind of lets you know that shit's going on in your life I was a little kid because I always felt like what a werewolf represents is like obviously it's like a fun fake movie monster yeah but also the idea behind it is like everybody is normal and calm like in in most circumstances most circumstances you're talking to people in there like us just hanging out having a good time talking for the most part but we all know that shit could go horribly horribly wrong and when shit goes horribly horribly wrong whether it's like that Church Massacre in Texas or whether it's fucking bear chasing you things go primal and they go to someplace where you you you you if you want to survive you have to you have to behave in a way that you are very uncomfortable with yeah if someone's trying to kill you and they have a knife and you grab their wrist and you know that that knife is going to your chest you're going to get to a primal terrifying place well you can shove a knife in someone's neck and cut their throat open yeah cuz you know they were trying to kill you sure that's when the wolf comes out yeah and for whatever reason the lack of weed made me go wolf wolf cuz like the weed keeps the wolf at bay that's great a weed keeps the wolf at bay in my mind mmm I'm realizing now the more I talked like psychologists yeah and people understand neuro chemistry like my developmental process of going through high school fighting was super bad form it's like worked out really well as far as we can commentator for UFC great fucking DEFCON three all day long trying to calm it down I'm always at DEFCON 3 yeah like growing up getting kicked and punched and standing on alert it's not just that it's like your brain expresses itself in a different way because it's like I had violence violence violence violence no violets big cut off no more violence right and there was no violence like someone coming home from war in a way similar in a way that I didn't recognize her I literally until I started smoking weed and then I didn't stop fucking almost 20 years you know 20 from 3 I'm 50 okay from 30 to 50 it's almost all weed once Eddie Bravo turned me on to weed yeah I was off to the races that's when though that was like how long when I was 30 really that's it was 1998 oh yeah 1998 1998 Eddie Bravo and I became friends that's when I started training John John I want to take you a year for you to go like alright I'll try this stuff right away but were you in at being pitched to you right away or you were like no Eddie has a crazy way of pitching things as you know Eddie gets very excited about that but that was he was more reserved in his idea so I don't think he believed in his ideas as much but he believed in weed you know what I mean by that is like like I had to tell Eddie that he was a genius I was like dude you're a jujitsu genius like I've been around martial arts my whole life I'm like you're like a prodigy like you know shit you see things other people don't see him like you're crazy and then we choked out Hoyle er Gracie in Brazil and I was like I fuckin told you bitch Yeah right yeah oh you knew him during that time oh yeah man I went with him to Brazil in 2003 that's crazy but from then till now it was like pretty much all wheat and it changed the way I think about things because it makes you more affectionate it makes you more like compassionate it calms you it calms you down and then from all the talks with like psychologists and neurologists and always been neuroscientists you realize like to others pathways that are formed during your developmental period and one of the big ones is the period between 15 and 25 because when you're 25 that's when your frontal cortex is supposedly formed when all your experiences and all of your genetics they all come together and kind of form who you are to the point where we've all decided like this is a time where Tom at 25 can be rational whereas before you're dealing with so much there's so much of your consciousness is in development so much of your opinions on life are distorted by your environment and your ability to discern objectively what you should and shouldn't do isn't quite in place yet and neuroscientists believe that that takes place according to the people that I've met somewhere around 25 so from me for like 15 to 21 22 it was okay it was all chaos it was all head kicks and getting your Bell wronged and watching people go unconscious it was all chaos because that's all I did that's all I did from like 15 to 21 and it's like this and so this suspect that in perspective joy I remember the first time I watched someone get knocked unconscious and that was traumatic for me dude I've seen I've seen saw my people get fucked up really think about it all I've called more than a thousand events really more than a thousand more than a thousand so I've people seeing people give up yeah for sure all the nons so you probably seen like 3,000 fights at least oh no no well there's only UFC - yeah but a thousand contests between individuals you know thousand individual easily easily a thousand fights so you gotta think 10 fights for a hundred cards that's a thousand I've done more than that feels like you would like live on high alert you know it's not good yeah I'm saying I always like he did not have her head once yeah she was taking something out of the back of the car and as what hatch and the thing came down you know they actually come down and the point got her right in the fucking head and she was bleeding like blood was pouring down her head I got a real problem with injuries man what's your job can I go that's nothing oh really I'm like that's not shit this is a little tiny cut something like an inch long like my thought is like unless it's catastrophic yeah you're fucked if your mom five your arms broke I'm like ah you gotta go to the doctor yeah but this little cut I'm like that's nothing yeah and I'm like what the fuck is wrong with me there's blood pouring down her head and I've already liked of like like I'm doing triage no I'm like what the possibility what's the worst thing that you know what the worst thing can happen well this ain't the worst thing we're good I wish I had that no one's bones are poking through the skin way too comfortable with trauma way too comfortable not good yeah that's not good to see sure hundreds of dudes get knocked the fuck out right which is he that's the similar part to ward like to create the parallel is like people who have seen obviously really horrific but that's way different it's different but there's a similarity because they see they see people you know killed and or maimed and then so when you go like this hurts they're like you're you're right you're fine but that's why I never talk to I have that lady on who won the Moab 2/3 yes yes yeah Walter she's amazing please she's a monster she was by more than ten hours ten hours well she wasn't even get into his own yeah she couldn't even see anyone around her she could even be like I'm ahead of that cut she's like no nobody around he's even crazier she won a race while she was 90% blind rich 90% she she some sort of cerebral or a retinal edema or corneal edema during this happened during one of her races not this one but another one but this was another crazy long one and she just gonna leave yes she won and she fell busted her head open she's a huge gash in her head blood pouring down her face she barely could see stick she could only see her feet she didn't know where she was going she's like literally running while her contact lenses had some sort of a reaction with her eyes and she could not fucking see and she's still won Wow so when you talk about like tough yeah like you like to think I could fucking take it no no she can take it yeah I don't I don't know how the human we're complaining about 15 yoga class I know that's gross very hard you could do it all at once we had to like the whole month loser one yeah but I'm telling you like the people that people that current can go into a state of mind that we don't understand because that's how long did she do it wasn't it 48 hours no more than 50 so she once you realize she can do it and what is it like 58 less than 58 she realized like it would be 38 hours though she completed 240 miles 291 minutes of sleeping she tried to lay down for 20 minutes and she couldn't fall asleep her mind was racing and then she took a one-minute nap I'm hop though she was like the guy was like she was like stumbling zigzagging across the road she could barely stay awake and the guy that was keeping pace with her like people would jump in the race and keep pace with you for like ten miles at a stretch that makes sense so when this guy was keeping pace where there was like you know he's like if you wanted taking that she goes okay you got to wake me up in one minute you okay one minute so he wakes her up in one minute and she was good to go Wow she said one minute she had amazing sleep she woke up she felt refreshed she couldn't she was mad at him because she couldn't believe he let her sleep he goes I let you sleep for one minute she's like okay great I feel like oh the FBI needs to fucking talk to her it's not cheese candy candy when she's here she is a hero my new hero yeah because her fucking mind dude it's amazing is there's no other way when you fall when you're half blind you hit your head and you're bleeding it's so easy to quit that's incredible she won't quit like I got the excuse now won't quit is understandable I'm not not to where sure extreme but I do understand people that go I just got to finish it but not to her extreme that's insane yeah I think at a certain point I go my visions more important than this race so you would barely be behind her it'd be like her yeah I think so I'd be on her heels a lot of great as I did running a half marathon on the 19th of November we'll find out varied a little no training well do you like injuries I won't get injured I'll be fine Nicky man over here in Tampa on the 19th after I do my weekend at the improv this weekend everybody pull you from the trail and lick you in the woods did hero drunk man there's a lot of people love you numerous reasons on the cruise he got drunk hard in a casino and it was the life of the party supporters like just shirt over the head okay that's that's sort of a kind of performance that I don't do and you don't do no I know right and you don't do either please so it's like in trying to get you to conform to a life of no drinking are we removing some of the great classic American drunken theater Berta - it's like yeah just that like first why do we always think why do we always think of performances and I'm not saying that you're performing like you like like you need attention it's not that it's in you right it comes out when everybody's drinking you're having a good time it's there's not nothing negative about it but why why do we classify that as being different than things that are entertaining that we go to see right like if you go to see someone do stand-up you expect it to be funny if you go to in a movie you expect them to be funny but part of what being funny is is like being able to be funny like you're being very you're your fucking performances like when we're drunk at a bar those are legit totally it's a nice fun thing to be around it and it's sort of a piece of art yes saying and you got a bit of a piece of it's very enjoyable you don't like going - yes thank you managing the room - you manage the room and it's in you it's authentic it's who you are you really should just live in a bar they gotta come up with a pill that makes alcohol not bad or a new alcohol yeah yeah problem is when I heard that your blood pressure dropped substantially I was like wow all I could think of in a bad way it was like what what would happen if you continued the way you did and we didn't do this over october thing and you're just dealing with metal medical solutions to this or you quitting booze for a month dropped your blood pressure by how many points was it 150 thousand weighed 335 when we started 380 if you know what the good thing is for you though for real is that even though you're like I know I can you you know for sure you have no doubt that if you had to stop drinking for any period of time you can't do it he's not addicted you know I think no I talked to dr. drew and Bob Forrest about it well two good experts definitely don't talk to real doctors actual research but no the yeah it was just no disrespect I don't even know the second guy is he's he was on Celebrity Rehab well that's a good show for science he was uh he was net he wasn't at spit on it no on Celebrity Rehab oh my god Stanhope went in oh I love dr. Drew but he deserved it Dana doesn't like it well it's not real you know that's not the way you're supposed to be healing people with cameras in their face yeah it's not good for the it's not good for the actors or the musicians or whoever it's not good for anybody it's not good for people that are trying to understand what their diseases to see each other mocked like that and having these mock arguments with each other and having these four reversed forced inner yeah where there's two cameras and two people are arguing by the pool and insulting each other's plastic surgery and failures and all the divorces oh dude we said this like where we started we were having so much fun with this re a night I think we were talking on the phone and he was like he was like this should be a TV show but then he's like immediately all the authenticity would be removed out of this competition yeah if we build these competitions they're so genuine and we do get to put them out in media for our fans to listen to but if you did it with a camera crew front II would never be real it would never be as in a time limit that kept specifically check in now and said oh look at this Photoshop yeah you know it's also part of the what I think the experience was amazing was that we were all like tuned we were all locked into a task together and but there was no official thing to it we all put posted it did number six today yeah yoga town make a little video see but it was like photo shops by the way off i screen saved some of them erotic panda erotic panda killed and praised did one offs there was some great one-off skills Prosser meant that I was like I would like quickly get online is like has anyone seen oh it's there I have to cross-reference your instagrams like nobody's gotten there yet chasing the card tasteless hard you killed it to I think doing stuff like this is good for people that are listening to it I think it's definitely good for us but I think it's good for people listening too because I think doing something where you all can like join in with your friends and I have a task pray other it's good for you Burgamy ran into you at the store that's what happened oh that's right you told me at that I was going to try I called you when I saw you in front of that's right I saw the Lamborghini I'm like it's gotta be Tom yeah the best thing like the whole thing was so I was gonna try to get the three at you try to fool the three of you yeah and then and I was gonna go I was like I'm gonna go the store tonight in it just to see if the rumor will start spreading you know and then no but then I was like not a bad idea ya know well the thing is I didn't bring it I was like no that'll ruin having it at Yoga right so then I go it happens that you're all three there I'm like what that's good I didn't bring it because then they would have seen it here would have been it so then I'm gonna leave and as I'm leaving you know when you're excited like you're excited about a new joke that's Joe he's like he's like what's up I was like I'm bringing a Lamborghini and I go you gotta back me up he goes fuck yeah I'll tell me your Bali that was the dream the dream was that the next day I had I wouldn't reveal it and then you pull it in the Maserati to the store the hardest actually I laughed was second-hand comment because so the whole thing was just to try to get hurt I just wanted to get burnt and there was a time by the way when you got in your car and you walked towards Bert's car I turned I was backing up in that car and I turned I see Barry he's like so but still 260-thousand still a lot of money still figuring out how much money you made the year signed I know how much money you make Oh based on like just conjecture and you telling me we started trying to figure out how much and then I go how many weeks you'd have to work to earn that car yeah well this is the best part when so I I go I return it right I Drive I make a video with the guy go I'm gonna hold this he was super nice guy he knew about the challenge and everything I'm gonna point the video vertical and like what the brains blown out the brain no room but the best part was that when I post I posted it before class number 15 I posted it and I got my take class and then when I come out I'll get comments and all the jewelry so I talked to Burt and he goes I he was like you fucking dick I knew you wouldn't be that stupid to buy that and I go he goes re thought you bought it cuz you're white trash from Florida arms folded riding shotgun down Myntra I mean this makes sense makes total sense white guys were bored by trash like having lived in Florida for so long like that analogy is that analysis is perfect like if you go like if somebody's like driving a Lamborghini and you go that guy from Florida fuckin Mega Millions Lamborghini and I was googling bobbers Harley bobbers chopper but it's cool-looking do you tell Ian I think respond to you guys without lying to trying to figure out what I said like when you asked me did Tommy really get a Lamborghini what did I say fuckin dance it like a lawyer dude the other thing was I told you he posted all these pictures of me in the video Jared but didn't post my reveal like my roots on stage I start talking about it and everyone everyone's laughing at all the setup stuff and then I go and then I got I rented this Lamborghini and there's like a oh and people meet me afterwards gonna go can't believe you're oh the other best part was this so right for that class right before I posted the video I'm talking to Bert on the phone and we're talking about like authenticity and people and perception them and like how you how you value relationship and I go I hope you'll never see me differently just cuz I have a Lamborghini he goes really thinking you have to catch up hold on I'm not buying a Lambo I just I have a conversation my head you gotta get a feeling on the bond the board before how I deserve a treat you at least have to get into the C or D position you're not gonna be a you're not gonna be B but I'm a barber gets you in like the yeah do your mind you I hold on let's just keep things real and cut me off if you I'm gonna stop it like I come over here we do a podcast I see the new place I go wow Joe's got some treats and I go and you get a Lambo and I go Tommy's got some treats how do I treat you just true the Reese's Cup yeah Psalm layin in bed I have a fucked up reward system I agree but I'm cooling them and lands like daddy a treat did she see you she sees you what are you doing I said I'm looking at eight motorcycles and she goes we can't afford that right now and I go the don't say that I go I'm gonna for whatever the fuck I want okay it's 300 fucking thousand dollars whoa no I go cuz you had gotten the Porsche first you this Friday part the surprising part of it yeah because because do you remember my look on my face when he when he but dude dude it wasn't it wasn't healthy no it wasn't it wasn't what if I was your shrink I was like hold on what's happening does so yeah you said you kept saying what's happening the first time Tom told me he sold out the truck and you still got like six fucking shows I remember you memory I was I on the phone go and that's amazing like what's happening what's possible they called his shit I don't think that was possible for guys like me and you yeah so then when I saw that he was like I was like wait well important thing that already said earlier when he was telling you to go after me he's like he's no different he's one of us that's a hundred percent we're all the same yes it no anybody who tells you any different is lying to you we're all the same everybody that gets on stage and tells jokes is the same how you far you get through the maze has zero bearing on whether or not you're a real comic so if you see Tom doing it you could do it too the thing that keeps you worrying about Bell's palsy is the same thing that keeps you freaking out about like whether or not you're real it's all the same thing it's all the same thing so when you see him get something like I gotta get something too I gotta get a reward to show that I'm like right here with you I thought the keeper is but it's like but it is it is everyone's getting presents it's the same thing you're only doing it because he has if he had you're right they had if he had not shown up with a fucking Lamborghini to yoga like a 20-17 who would have done this is the part I didn't expect which was the part that was not thought about in the prank the whole thing was just like just get birds ago what happened yeah was all the people cuz you know comments can be like Sat like you know everything is like fuck you or whatever like you know it could be really negative right yeah can be for sure I can't I can't tell you how many people were like happy for you man that's awesome like you deserve it well why I think some people were like really lost the fan yeah I lose three or four a day yeah sure you're right but people were genuinely like happy like you sir are done with me yeah I really think and I really think there's there's so many hours of you being a nice guy that people understand you're a nice guy really did do get it and they get your sense of humor and so when you if you bought a Lamborghini like Tom's father yeah right right I'd like you I guess I didn't expect it it's hard and there's been very many of those in the world I don't think there's been very many of those like environments where someone can do something that makes other people happy over long periods of time like a podcast and they get to know you grow and then they see you I mean dude when I first met you was in Phoenix in like 2007 that's right that Charlie Murphy the real men of comedy yeah and we did that Phoenix Theatre in the round that's right Liberty fans and you were living in like East LA yeah you it was a super scary neighborhood you heard gunshots like remember you and I talking I'm like damn I hope Tommy makes it I don't want you to die yeah we started doing the road I mean dude we started doing the road together in like probably two thousand seven or eight right we did a bunch gigs together it's true so so to see you struggling from then to killing it now and then doing all these podcasts in between I'm not alone like I've done this with millions of other people that have like watched you as well yeah so if they know you and they like you they they want to leave a positive come it was a nice surprise I mean it's just a part of it I didn't I thought people were all gonna be like you're a fucking piece of shit yeah which there were a few but most people the majority of the comments were like way to go way to go that's so great it's possible man it's all possible the reason why people get aggressive and angry because they feel like they're on the outside right they feel like they can never get inside they're angry they're on the outside we're all on the inside it's like a perception that keeps you on the outside yeah that's true it's all perception and to this day every time like my name gets like like ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan I fucking go what are you even doing you didn't know what the fuck you're doing like to this day you didn't my subscriber be Rios that pretty nice too didn't see where it was always a stage I did the theater at Madison Square Garden it's like 6,000 people well it's insane doesn't it feels so scary like before you're about to come you told me you did a six thousand seater and you're like I was in a traffic jam and I said to the driver what's all this traffic for he's like oh there's a big show me use me and Tony Hinchcliffe Ian Edwards we're headed to this this big giant ass fucking Theatre in Dallas 6,000 seats and as we're pulling up a goddamned Saul's fucking traffic and we realized we were stuck in my traffic yeah Wow this is nerve-racking that's wild but don't you a 9/11 of Comedy it's not it's nerve-wracking but what you agree I think the way the reason I am the way I am with a little bit of all and impressed like on both of those stories would you rather me be real in those moments ago like what five years for sure no for sure no one's criticizing who you are yeah we just like sometimes you need to see from someone else's perspective because you don't even realize like you might have these like little roadblocks you keep bumping into and you're like hey may you just go around that bitch yeah you don't even realize yeah like people don't really you run into like one or two people that want you to fail guess what those people they don't even really want you to fail they just don't feel good right they're mad at you they look anybody who doesn't want someone to do well if I see someone that's a total fuck up I want them to do better it doesn't be better if they're better it affects me in a negative way if they fail but that so you run into people it's a bad sample like you're running into people like so often when you're paying attention to social media you're running into people that are judging you because of their own feelings right yeah that's true and I know it affects you it affects the way you think and the way you think about the world try not to engage really the negativity no you can't it's not good you encourage it this and there's people that feed off of it yeah and on both sides you know it's just like Owen Benjamin I got a text him I just fucking fighting with people online you know he's been on he's a fucking smart dude too yes mark but he's caught up in that that weirdness of where it's like get out of there just go walk on this birthday he does a lot of that too he does build fires and sit out he does that too did you see Jamie kill Steen oh it's all my fault I saw him in feet had him here I had him here two and a half hours you really think I did not listen to that whole wait was that that was a response to the one or you say this is a separate thing separate one recently no but I'm saying no what you know his whole thing was know that he was this guy who was attacking people online Jamie was yeah you know Jamie was like a full-on social justice warrior vegan yeah vegan warrior he's not anymore no oh you don't know what happened do you don't have no idea oh it's a crazy story is the molesting joke separated from his girlfriend her wife rather uh-huh I had some sort of a open situation and during that open situation he had had sex with a couple of the girls and they decided that he was in some way predatory who's right and who's wrong I'm not going to engage him because I do not know I would hope mmm that uh it's a bunch of misunderstandings I hope that he didn't do anything wrong and they didn't lie about him doing something wrong when he didn't I don't know I don't know really what happened but what he talked about there was honest was about how he would feel going after people trying to get people fired he would feel good yeah I'd feel good you feel fired up but he would also feel like engaged and and and part of it was like you're terrified of other people coming after you so you're gonna go after don't show your virtue an attack and that you know he was just so caught up in it that he wasn't even like looking at stories objectively he was like like finding a direction that he should definitely go into to get the most reaction from all these people that are supporting this direction right comics who are he goes after who just post statements where they're trying to get likes yeah well there's a lot of that the shorts are going but like what I believe but ignore on like you're right you're right but ignore them like they let let the fucking regular folks friend sometimes it's all they talk to them detailing not that good of friends yeah Louis Jaco was always fucking post post pictures of his goddamn new girlfriend and it's like Louis come on well he's a lot better than that why'd she come on don't be ridiculous and then they fall in love like what I really love it I know he loves herself when she finds a new man stick it in your face over and over again how deeply they are in love when you know they're pigs yeah like this those guys when you're hiking or taking pictures of girlfriends or like not take me like this no take it again like this those pictures gonna be used on their tinder account when they break up right right it's a good right wait you took a picture of me to get me laid thing man you gotta welcome them you get to give them the golf clap when they get some new day I love you I want you to have that expression you take care bye yeah you got to be careful you got to be careful who you fucking link link hooks with Jamie's pot that podcast you did with Jamie is really good and I say this is someone who liked Jamie originally and then when he did the rape podcast with you and Redman I took no guessed but like what he called you guys rapist you know no no no no heating cause rapists don't charge you with rape no he called he joked around about red band being a rapist afterwards cuz red been criticized him after being on the show it was like it was really stupid but I never disliked him after that but I was like I was like man that was fucked up because he did represent that story incorrectly well is this what you're talking about as a radio called The Kills team delusion yeah where this guy Brendan branded took one part of what we said together and then kill Steen's version of it yeah spliced him together so you could see what we actually said and what he what he reported his name on his show to all the super lefties but he was super honest about him when he came on the podcast man oh yeah yeah that's gasps man and I'm glad weird he still he does stand upright is he so this wants to do it again he wants to start stopped he wants yes he stopped dude they want after him I think they attacked him like and here's the thing whether or not he was guilty of basic normal slimy male type behavior that we do on occasional especially when intoxicated try to get laid wrong by the way if you are guilty of that okay I know you okay opinion and you know I don't trust people who don't have that on their roster right trying to get laid too much just like beer drunk taking a chance just like you tell a few jokes on stage don't work sure Harvey what's in front of a chick I can't believe that you believe it and then I go wait wait you can't do it at all and always like yeah definitely happen like if you're a neutrally masturbated with a chick oh and I did it with a girl boss did it with what had a girl give me a generally nervous once I was like 25 years old she said that so we'll masturbate in front of each other yeah she's wearing you so me and this girl she weren't used to bartender at the Boston Comedy Club they're doing coke we end up going back to my place listen the unnie DeFranco like a boyfriend she's like listen I can't I can't fuck you yeah but boy you can both get naked and just masturbate across the room from each other oh what a good thing for her boyfriend had that go show the boyfriends like can you add me to the limit toys normally so I said have you asked her to spit on you yeah what if you guys might be cheating I don't know I jerked off with her spit didn't ask us we were across the room from each other why why is it hotter knowing that she has a boyfriend she's not she's a naughty girl can't help it and then when didn't know why it was rich was her boyfriend no no no so computer toe nails is slightly chipped drunk she had smelly feet the kind of wieners feet you know Cirelli waitress feet we address very specific that's not good first we talked about how kind of waiters feet girl with smelly feet and smoking a bowl with those little bump aking bowls you know yeah okay you know what you talking about this back in bold slope items that's it and so right that's right you got me saying so we both come and then she says she says this I'm headed back to Brooklyn hollow tell anyone about this definitely don't talk about it on a podcast she goes audience their name yet and so uh she goes you definitely can't tell the rich boss and I go okay she goes I mean seriously don't tell rich balls I go that's odd all right so I used to work the door at the club so I walked through the club at like 7:00 that's when I had to sit out and vaz his back when he smoked was sitting out smoking a cigarette I was like what's not boss he's like I heard you jacked off in front of Jenny last night Brooklyn NY you said her name you asshole her name was not Jenny good Oh your feet bacon on your stinky waiter face somebody's get a dick you know that's the thing that there's like connections that happen especially when you're young that Chris Ryan did talk about but when you have sex with someone when you're really young if something happens like there's like a trigger that goes off and that thing can become like a fetish sure it's like weird stockings or stinky waitress feet or rubber gloves yellow rubber gloves made nope I don't know where they came from yellow rubber gloves get where it came from like you don't pay from but that's but you're talking about a different thing then the idea is you get where it came from it's like like a girl like you used to bang this chick she worked together with you you guys are both tired you get off work you're all sweaty takes her shoes off your feet stink who cares you eat her pussy like you don't give a fuck tastes a little pissy but whatever who gives a shit if you come when anything like you know out of the norm is happening yeah

service took a nice warm shower felt good ate a fat steak and some fries coke and then you could have gone there and watched that poor fuck the second-place dude that's why the way it's very rare than women when those things although there was two huge wins by women in a row a woman run weren't one that she won the Moapa 240 which is like one of the most insane endurance races ever and then a woman won the New York City Marathon on Saturday on Sunday for the first time it'll be 40 but she was not just the first American she was like the first woman and over him at the same time what the guys the guy won like 20 minutes faster than like she was the winner they like American woman was the first female to win the marathon yeah and for American woman amid no marathon of his that you Aryan again

house from the fuckin Mossad saying we needed an interview with you and they were like i he doesn't live here anymore he's like he's gonna do that interview whoa yeah wait what yeah I'm like it wasn't me really that's not what I thought it was you yeah like you didn't do it cuz it's us talk just about it holy shit yeah I'm like not me man she pleaded to join the marine corpse marathon Sunday she came in first against chicks or dudes this is the whole thing women's women's division of the Marine Corps with talk of 245 you couldn't be that bird this is the same thing so listen what I hate to be the guy but like are we admitting that it's impossible for women to compete in a marathon again man cuz if my Kourtney do altar can win well yeah 40 shows you she she won Russia giant margin so where would this lady have come in like if in the all-over division how many men is my question this man is 225 so what she comes over already five what's she coming over all like him at the same time well if she's still came in seventh thing you're like yeah those seven people had said she would work but this is the thing about that Kourtney check it makes you wonder like what if there's like a number where you pass where it's just in your mind like you can get to a place where it's your body like you can get to a place where I train hard it's fairly easy but there's a number that you pass whether it's a hundred miles or 200 miles or whatever that number is where it's just your mind it doesn't matter how strong you are because you could force your body to do things that it doesn't want to do yes matter whether you know what's his name he's actually transitioning Eddie Izzard transition yeah he's running for what political office as a woman right now yeah but you know he did his whole act as a woman right Ready's mean but no no like he's just crossing back then but no announced that and now do you know about the runnings book yeah I do know about the fucking runnings a look at that read that headline 27 marathons in seven days he started it out with zero running oh well that Burt can do it dude this there's some there's a fire in his fucking mother it's got that dude my dad my dad my dad really yeah because look there are people that do it for the first time all the fucking time now kid like that son I know I don't think so no the reason I say that is like he's seen on November 19th I would like to try to run a sub two hour half marathon going to win the whole thing if you don't go in to win you're not gonna win you need to have the attitude you're gonna win okay let's yeah put away did dangle if y'all say in jangle something and you'll watch me hurt myself yeah Harley's yeah what the Harley the Harley did he did you limit Robert what's a copper wanted to know it's not a time down I'm running its two weeks your way this marathon are two weeks how how much is the is the is the bobber I don't know we talking I don't know what are you looking at ringing try to figure out what's going on with his see how much that bobber okay Jennifer's is about 15,000 dollars that sounds good to me salmon harley-davidson bobber been nice trick that I'm sure there's a listener cord I think mama you're running the full marathon into running a half marathon in November 1912 that's nice that's what you really want is like one of them fucking cruising bikes right damage if you want the Harley ball screen what it mean that full that's a beautiful bike imposters look at that don't you wish those weren't dangerous yeah that's badass dangerous a fix your blood pressure but don't you wish you could just ride a motorcycle there's no back on that it is you have never been working your moment what's a good time cycle what's a good time to hit on a half marathon half marathon you're doing the whole know he's doing sober and I was signed up for flying classes and TMZ check I was like nah are you taking flying class still no okay but flying class like a cheerleader or flying class you would be the best fucking cheerleader dude that's really good if you have the national champions on the team looks like the mountain for the gate what's wrong you can turn oh my god Florida State season around cheerleader this is what we get Icelandic dudes and you in a fucking speedo with your flip-flops on oh my god you're flipping you through the air catching you like you're a pillow oh you got a bottle of tea those in your hand while you're flipping so strong these guys they just shut those d1 cheerleaders or we're not gonna use those pussies we're gonna use all those dudes up to that strongman thing where they grab a block yes wait what's a good time for a marathon though but it's a full what's a good time for five hours was the one we all talked about that was originally a really hard to do wait how many many five hours in the last marathon what's the abject average marathon in New York's differ because you have to qualify for it okay yeah so that's not like the average just like John or any people beat five hours knowing that you have to qualify let's take a little bit a lot or Marine Corps what's your goal irregular one what's your goal so my goal in my head has always been five five you doing the half what's your goal on the half two hours and thirty minutes not on a pace for five hours for a full weight it's not really to slow down to average finish at the New York Marathon was four hours 34 minutes seven-minute mile yeah this guy's finished in two hours frankly I bit frankly I had a bit way back in the 1980s little arias about the Olympics he goes he goes I don't look at the guy who wins he goes I look at the guy who loses yeah he goes he goes you look at his face when he's coming he's like goddamn I'm gonna come in last in the Olympics and they start sticking man if I didn't even fucking train I'd still come in laughs things all the time trains he goes never reality starts setting then you see oh he's like I don't even have a fucking job so true it's a great bit man yeah fucking great bit yeah did he start that off with garlic cuz he's in his country is the fastest so he can start again down yeah I'm gonna win the Olympic gold me like you run your first few paces down and then you come up and then he was like what the fuck realize you're from why don't you try to crack two hours I think that would be impossible for me really fast what's your normal Mouse if you were just went five five miles if I was gonna go out run five miles treadmill know what Saturday I got one of those air assaults there's they're sick yeah I got to thank the guy I wish I could be stumped and I don't know what the name of the company is what's the name of the company air assault and he was so cool he said man I heard you talk about it I want to just hook you up he's like I don't need anything they don't need anything just enjoy it and it was so cool no difference there's um there's treadmills that come towards you these treadmills that are basically like see let it run on one it's called run it one that says has wood in the name because it's all like wood part see we getting the aerosol one that they gave yeah I'm serious yeah yeah it's way better for you than running on a treadmill cuz like Burt was telling talking about his running times and I was thinking yeah but the things coming towards you it does move like you think it does matter you got one of those Burt yeah thing so this runner it's called the air runner yeah that's it the air run are not air assault but there's an air assault bike that's what you're thinking of that's a rogue this is a would--we would way makes a treadmill that's the one I was thinking of this thing is that like a slight angle you're also running on the toes of your feet and the ball your feet too instead of like flat on the ground so how many how many minutes do you go on that miles an hour only right now I'm just getting that set up in the memory I haven't gotten on it it's uh I I could do ten minute miles very easily for on a treadmill on the road I'm at like 11 minute miles 11 times how many 13 miles so 13 miles okay that's but that's beneath two hours you just you just carry an extra you're just carrying next to if you just committed to some sort you could actually live the lifestyle you live in because you're not gaining you can be shredded yeah think about this when it comes to like body like what you're carrying around with your body like you're not gaining a lot of weight you're pretty consistent right when you said you guys lost the weight like Tommy you've been very consistent yeah don't don't very consistent that's true it's not truly what happened what do you think I gained weight you want step on a scale enfermo never asked me and you said I don't have time I kid and then I got it right and you were point four pounds lighter than me right but I haven't gained weight but the way joe says it is you've been very good you think you do that to fuck with you or no oh you know what though I end up salmon that feeling like Lindsay Lohan in her apartment where I go fucking wait are you delivering the coke ages there when it arrives our teacher called you fat hey no more calling you fat no called you by your name fat she goes as fat here what teachers a woman the nicest one she goes with your friend fat and I said what and she goes I'm sorry and she goes like that and I go Bert she was Bert he's on the road yourself and you will only point four pounds below him right and you are over an inch shorter than him right the way you should be with the extra inch I gotta cuz I'm high you should be thinner but you're this round I don't understand Eliot I want to go you guys you guys work this thing [Laughter] remember where the battery goes that's I want to see both your bellies it doesn't make sense and we're gonna talk about this we give back soapy and think about this the fat shaming I want to talk about fat shaming when you come back oh well we were kids there was no such thing and I think the world was yes and the world was a better place it just happened you mean I don't think you should be happy being fat I don't think anybody should be mean to you because you're fat but I think there's a you could do you'd feel better if you weren't that's it if you weren't fat yeah yeah maybe something else was that shaming shaming shaming so it's too strong for you it's like like I seen them talk about fighters like oh one fighter tried to bully the other fighter I'm like what are you talking about they're about to kick the shit out of each other imposes game this is this is psychological warfare you can't calm a bully yeah I'll comp what you call bully cuz he's a champ that's how you say the champ keep every scared remember Mike Tyson in the 80s he the greatest time to be alive use the robot he was a bully when he got her saying oh my god but that words bullshit the word should apply to someone who is picking on someone who's meek but a little kids but you're a more little kid yeah yeah yeah there's there's something about that that's like horrible but you can't apply that to things that aren't real bullies especially like fighters talking shit to each other they're not being bullies they're engaging in you're trying to get a psychological upper hand we all know that that's real to pretend a psychological upper hands like forget about fighting what about girls you remember when like there was a girl that you did not think you could talk to and if she talked to you you'd fucking lock up and panic you know we've all been there that's like there's a psychological position when you feel like you're not in the position to be able to like kiss that girl or have sex with that girl who's like there's no way especially when you're a teenager you like baffled that you could use yeah you don't even know you don't know like how which one's gonna like you which one's not like why do people like you why do they not like boobs I was like one day I'll have boobs like one day you do have boobs he go just play a prank or something that is new for but girls in high school where you couldn't believe that they liked you like my meeting people like when you were young like when you would if you a girl would like you or not like you you'd have no idea it's almost like you like like you open up a page in Spanish and tell me someone told you what the word is like oh okay that's what it means alright good yeah that's how little you knew before they have no idea why a girl would like you or not like you like when when you're a teenager when you're in high school oh yeah yeah yeah then when it goes sideways yeah that's to begin with and I was like never never again and it's over and then you smell like desperation or do you remember when Mike with you or someone because I'm pretty genuinely not interested oh and like when you discover that your lack of interest gets interest and you're like why like you're not into that alright yeah fuck now you like me and like yeah but like I really don't like you know yeah I like even more but that's how you operate ality me too it's very it's really weird psychology like but I don't like you I don't like a girl turned around doggy style spreading her butt cheeks apart looking back at you and is gonna be a cartoon balloon and says validate me Tommy bun now there is yeah that's a worse that was so that's always so weird that holds and then you're like but I do like you and she's like and I hate the attention that like the obvious no liking me you know that's what when people say mean shit about you when you're not around no more you know what like that fucking loser yeah oh really is that what it is he's a loser loser cuz he does wanna fuck you anymore now right haribol terrible yeah what was he getting the whole time you were dating for three years oh my feeling of pain that we have when someone leaves us like yeah have you ever uh never mind two or three more drinks he's got a strong fuck intensive he's got a good appetite yeah did you get super high when you start smoking again oh my god terrifying the I I was terrified before it went up at a Madison Square Garden oh so high I was nervous I also I was talking to me did that high and I wouldn't do that couldn't go on to try the hot box again Edwards he was totally sober that's a weird thing about traveling with Ian he's goddamn hilarious but he's a vegan and he's fully sober he's so fun he doesn't drink he doesn't smoke it doesn't do anything yeah does the Cuban you guys we got to eat oh yeah he's still gonna have this weird conversation with the waiter like there's no cheese there's no cheese on that yeah okay you use butter like you can't use butter is so whack yeah Wow this Christ I couldn't go vegan up the door to the next child can we dip our toes in with vegetarian maybe vegetarian you could have eggs but you can't have milk or cheese I'll give you the eggs how about that we got a yellow Corvette with your name on it you have to get the are that I'll do that in New York but with eggs that I give you guys cuz I have eggs I have too many eggs my chickens are fucking molting and they're not laying eggs really you got bitch-ass chickens yeah you might have bitches chickens gotta feed them good I'll take those knocking eggs men I'll check on you run through a gives house yeah we do too but all chickens mole my chick is due to I guess once a month 20 chickens you get eggs once a month I'm like today thank you good dude yeah I know but you know what's good about really if you have your own chickens their Karma free those those chickens don't give a fuck about those eggs those and the eggs will never be a chicken yeah and you have a good relationship with the chickens I feed them food they give me eggs yes it's simple it's like it's not it's not like an imbalance because the would it cost to feed the chickens is basically would it cost to buy eggs you ever uh never feet and watermelon runs feed everything from they go no say or not nice my nice in there yeah they go crazy like one leg story so in the interest of brevity I'll tell it I'll tell it quickly this is what happened yes oh my god feed of myself go crazy now they're yolks become a dark dark orange to its well fence in the back of my yard and hawks keep slamming into the glass fence we've killed at least three and Kayode several more right well these Hawks RKO'd blood come another knows we're here yeah dude I'm a camera it's probably a good idea but it only happens like once a month right but anyway one one honky odd came back but at a fucked up wing so we take the hawk and we preserve it and we put the hawk in like this like container and we get some food for it from the pet store the pet store these things called pinkies what a pinkie is is a little tiny baby mouse that's already it's it's weaning off its mother it's blind can they feed them as snakes it's a horrible horrible shit so we get pinkies for this Hawk this Hawk fucks up these pinkies all except one pinkie we get to Hawk to the wildlife place with a repair wildlife on Monday you know it's like one of those places where they deal with injured and drive a Hawk there yeah we took the Hawk fucking in worried about getting out well the Hawks are you know they're very valuable to the ecosystem the trunk well yeah they're important know you put the fucking class evolution works whenever possible these Hawks got to figure out that's a fucking fancy dumb cunt yeah I could see the fence how come you don't see this you don't deserve with a steel spike who write with a rabid flying right-hander raba oh so what it was done was one pinkie left over that the hawk didn't eat and my daughter's one of the key that pinkie is a pet I'm like it's gonna die it can't eat it's gonna it's supposed to be weaned off its mother it probably should even be alive still it's a day later I go let's just feed it to the chicken and everybody freaked the fuck out like you're a monster you're an asshole I go okay listen no it's good no one call me an asshole bring it back to the pet store but they're just gonna feed it to a snake I go that's what they have them there for they haven't a feed in the same the mother won't accept it it has our smell on it I go it's gonna die I go let's just feed it to the chickens I go why is it okay to feed it to the Hawks but it's not okay to feed it to the chickens so they like do you think the chickens are gonna eat it I go I fucking know they have they're gonna eat it because I have YouTube I've watched unusually the till you see it happen I saw them chase it mouse once that got in there fuck it up so I knew they were gonna do it and I put that Mouse in the ground dude they dart on that thing in less than one second one chicken had it and it was running around and all the other chickens were chasing her and they were running around trying to show they tore it apart yeah if I put a plate of corn down yeah they barely Flint right right they did go okay time to eat how often do you give them mice very rarely it's only happened at one time you're on caching oh oh shut that's what happens they yeah did that never happens with any other food though you don't know she left in there for all of us no but that one chicken has that Mouse and she'll have to fight for it and all the other ones are gang up on oh yeah cornered cornered sorry Han it's like she's gotta get him as quick as you can but like it rewards selfishness oh this one chicken this is running away I'm getting a mouse but you could do that with full-on mice man your your chickens are designed to kill mice Faulk yeah I'm gonna try tuggin work they are all you do definitely definitely not won't piss the neighbors get rooster appreciate ya we had to call one time for that when we lived in that was waking everybody up fuckin every morning this guy just had it like on a chain in the back concrete backyard Bert why is it the weed that makes you uncomfortable but the booze doesn't it's very beginning in this podcast and I noticed that was

around the interview serial killers and so really to try to like get research yeah so they it's it's fucking cool that's what you're a fan of that and also Big Bang Theory not an agreement come on guys I didn't hear that's a show Big Bang Theory you ever seen there's a video on the tube of the Big Bang Theory with no laugh track no yeah we don't want to play you ever watch a sitcom on TV at a bar I just see it him on mute and just be like look at how obvious they're being so weird oh it's terrifying it's to watch somebody watch I'm gonna break one of those shows and laughs have you ever done the room like in other words like a show like that is on no like like a show like some sitcom is on TV and you're with somebody and it's just you know the kind of thing you'd walk by and be like whatever yeah and they're like really laughing at those set up like really a big amateur no you are no you are yeah and then you see them laughing you're like holy this is a whole other level that you're existing on yeah but I also like that's really good really making you laugh you know it shows you like how subjective it really is because there's and there's a lot of people there's like 20 million people a week that watch that shit a lot the most watch that yeah yeah yeah you watch one of those and you and you can you see somebody really really laughing at that you're like wow you can just point in that direction the most actors in those shows like there's not at least there's not more people who kill themselves for being a big an officer like that for seven eight years I could totally do it you can kill yourself I have to make on that long no I could just do one of those really of course and just like nah what's what's the number cuz I'm phoning it in No it would have to be my show again totally shitty yeah who have to be my show about me yeah I think it'd be totally shitty I never leave it oh well merna merna merna those three that's out I'm Bert mark murky time-traveling Gunners and they do adventures daily utility into it yeah of course all the time for seven years no matter how awful it got yeah as long as I was like enjoying the cast and we're all partying and paid and get paid I'm riding my chopper to work CBS Radford yeah stopping by perennial marijuana and getting a one-hitter because we don't drug test on our show what's the next what's the next marathon in Los Angeles so you could do a full marathon full marathon that you can actually get to Jamie yeah we got to set up a we can't set up those treats at the end of the fucking you know the the finish line yeah I have one of those but yeah have one of those bobbers parked there and have it Bert congratulations but then like what you think is a real no bullshit achievable time for you at full marathon full marathon Jamie you gotta help me 4:45 Jin it a little over two would be a pretty good little marathon full five five has to be a good mark because after that three-hour mark or even do and a half you're gonna hit a real tough wall but you also will be running with a pace group the whole time which helps yeah and I'll be running it's like they're like I have to go with them no matter what I have to go with them five hours five hours that's hilarious I don't even know what I'm saying I'm thinking about draining my bank account to bet you five hours what are we doing here I like this do you think yeah I'm thinking Ari and I could make some serious money on let's get let's get it let's get a course that we're talking cuz we're not gonna can't do one in Colorado I wasn't I wanted I want to Boston it'll keep you a lot I'd say like five hours you would have to have really prepare no anytime he's bailing I want to see what he said never shape right now so wait he had a really prepare to do five hours I think you could do it a year from now right now north just a couple of days hold on let's stand up what do you go to Tampa wait a 50 miles he can't run 20 he's not gonna run 50 miles bro no there's a twenty six to thirteen point one yep there's a twenty six point two that's a trail rush a trail run oh you'll die cuz you do a marathon a trail that'd be easier for you no trail will be harder at much harder let's do that do that no no Rock the coast Long Beach Long Beach December second is plenty of time dude breeze coming in from the ocean Oh what day is today no no right sorry how would you race now what's Tampa I don't know just break time do you recognize our predatory instincts we're coming out we find so that's about three days later no wait wait what about the stakes though here's our okay what are the stakes so you sign over hold your home child to today a state that we choose yeah or to one of us right and then but if you win if you make the time believe it how fucking funny would it be let me just stop you right here if one of us won the other person's house and left them live there that before you get to make the decisions now legitimately we don't have to put this on paper but bitch you know I own your house own your house and that's why I'm taking their canoes what I was saying is you would you doubt you'd make some sort of a deal where you have to pay that other person a mortgage yeah let's do it but what about what you could win what can I win so you could win lifetime supply Reese's peanut butter cups whoever whoever wins the other person has to pay the mortgage plus a hundred dollars okay so you got to pretend that Tommy owns your house if you lose so you owe him a hundred dollars every month on top of your more that's fuckin awesome you have to pay him every month a hundred thousand okay you have to realize it's because we all realize listen bitch we own you you know in your house okay whether or not this fucking bullshit Zionist government agrees we had a goddamn deal we did like Outlaw Josey Wales we slid our palms we shook hands together and if I win I own your fucking house okay I don't own your house as far as legally why do we have to go through other people yeah we didn't we don't we didn't go through other people for this you hit it you get you know Tommy owns your fucking house okay I thought I'd like to change the locks in your house you just give me the rest you I want Tommy's fucking house Tommy's gonna give you a hundred these times Jamie this is for a 44 year old male this is what I'm expected what about one 326 oh my god that's for average 44 year old male you're better than average I know that much your honor scrolling down thanks for that amount of time I know you're better than an average 44 year old male can you try to break that half marathon 138 no he's gonna beat our he's dad yeah it's gotta beat our he's dad you say that's easy oh this is interesting we just twice that long these are the female distracted by dick look look at 7:37 36 you think you gonna beat Ahri's dad are his dad was six one no no 50 miles that's a junior be there on that's per really quick yes a pace 754 what's that mean a min a mile that's really fast so the average guy gets to it 327 I was forty four-year-old really hold on that's amazing that's amazing what's marathon this is just a marathon time in general 20 so that's the average is 327 wow that's what you were if you're running and you're training for that fast you should probably should be running that fast I mean but for a dummy like me or birth you're not training for a marathon though and you don't run like 70 miles a week that's the average when you when you you should do for hours it would rise you a lot now my team Bert they're trying to steal money from your bro you're not gonna make it for hours yoga classes a month ain't shit we barely got through that let's be reasonable with the average runner and birth better than an average person ari it's right in front of our face your dad how you making with that no whoa gonna be no I couldn't be my dad wait what six hours 27 minutes you might be 660 but let that Seahawks he speed walks yeah I can speed walk ari he's gonna stop six hours and 27 we have beer trucks along the way oh that's auntie noses you aren't you friends with the Tito's people yeah they've accepted it Austin we find a Marisa so we do we fucking make a marathon man how hard the fucking marathon oh yes you can't pace with anybody yeah well this is even better we create our own marathon the bert bert-- 26.2 marathon we put it in Austin Texas or someplace we find a place that we have a place we could run I like the sound of this now we do a goddamn marathon people sign up anybody can sign up but Bert has to win this motherfucker has to win that's the way no no yes so what's the bet Birds gotta win this bet excuse me this this proposition yeah by beating Ahri's dad's time you think you can man but this is like 15 yoga classes you don't think you can you don't think maybe six hours might be a better 23 people this is the wrong grab it win it do it and look what less than 6 out of 20 times about these people like their Bert I tell your 95% he's a marathon runners drunken comedians nothing against sarees deputy is 80 okay stop right now today tomorrow morning if you say brazen great day out in front of the fucking Barney's Beanery stretch for you let's go yeah would give you some old-school adidas and you're gonna run do you think you'll be able to do it that's a little tough right there right fire would be 11 and a half very hold on what it re 6:26 another hour no no no no knowing but here's the thing that's why I'm looking at this 14 all that's cute the real number is you have to figure out how to finish that thing yeah that's it's like the real number is not like how fast you're going per mile because it's not realistic cuz you're gonna get tired and that numbers gonna drop off substantially gonna hurt you if you say like 7-minute mile I could do that I could do seven miles do one but you used to say that I can do one let's not say that anymore because you were talking about a treadmill but if you say on the street you you obviously could can't do another 25 miles on top of that your father you thing you do a five hour marathon I know I can get six hours and 26 minutes no questions asked if that's a Joe says there's no way you could do all 26 miles the same way you could do one mile you'll slow down it yeah well do last feel but you'll do one mile like an animal I fully believe you could do one mile on the road in under seven minutes yeah if you got fucking crazy you had a shot of espresso no I agree per mile the times because if that if you're saying a six hour marathon is 16 minutes Jack it's dark around 20 miles I'll tell you this from watching for much of my dad 15 years ago when he did the last time we take the metro to different spots you could cheer him on and you get in the back of the metro go to another place cheer him on again and the last spot we're supposed to cheer mom we like waited there for like 15 minutes we're like fuck maybe we missed him he should have been here by now hello wait another 10 minutes and then he was like stumbling down yeah I like mile 25 it was like fuck and he zombie walked the rest of the way so you telling me you're telling me Hawaiians there might be a shower marathon but not Bert this is the reality we gotta hit a wall it feels it feels good to tell

would yell out things like do the Johnny Hendrix like there was a lot of times like camps will develop codes so that the other team has no idea what's coming you say the Johnny Hendrix it might be like an overhand left yeah if you say the Georges st. Pierre might be a Superman punch like you have this weird code so he's yelling out retard strength great and we're on Spike TV Spike TV and I go I think he's yelling out retard retard he was fighting George st. Pierre do you every touch me for sure I think I surprised things that Tom and re go oh and then we just very simply can you hold your breath and swim to one side of the pool and neither of them could do it no by the way you didn't try to champion your yeah you didn't even swim underwater he had never done it before my book both my kids were like does he know how to swim cuz he tried to swim on top of the water slap in the water my duck when you hold your breath you dive underneath alright now I know now you're sure you're acting like it's like you're angry that doesn't have information that you have to you're a Florida boy let's go do that fighting sharks yeah I'm curious that what do you think you could do tomorrow morning if you were like I'm running the marathon tomorrow definitely six okay let's make a bet whole shit way tomorrow let's rope something off now give you an extra half an hour okay well actually half an hour give you say you say you can do it give you six hours and 30 ml 6,000 30 minutes I'll give you $10,000 give that money to the charity of your choice 6 hours and 30 minutes you got to do a full marathon we'll figure out a course and you don't do it if you do it if you don't do it everybody on the internet knows about it you can't lose but if you do do it if you can do it by 6 hours and 30 minutes I'll give you an extra thirty minutes I will give $10,000 I'll give $10,000 anyway well just make it whatever it is that's the number that's the number it's gotta be your dad's number water it's of course yeah $10,100 cuz i'll throw in another hundred dollars and if you lose if you lose if you can't do it in six thousand thirty minutes we need you to go to a detox like a full-on Harvey Weinstein are you friends with dr. Jordan wants to help those people Kumiko I will throw in 360 assorted candies okay I will definitely run a marathon you're in a race with an 80 year old Holocaust survivor against ten grand money if I lose I'll give twice the money if you it's really against her so people gonna root against you this is my and if you go if you go to a drunk drunk fat Burt calm well update I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I'll tell you what we'll give you this option we can make this is if you win I'll pay I'll give three times as much but if you lose only give two times instead of ten I'll make it 20 but if you win I give 30 and then you figure out the charity if you can do it faster than ours dad I give $30,000 too ever charity you you choose and then if he doesn't 20/20 so you've reversed the back yeah yeah well you lose you lose and people are angry and inside like really angry people like people with head injuries like we're gonna give money to dudes from car it's a sign over your house to don't forget about them no nothing over my you have to sign over the house there's a pinky swear thing and it's a hundred bucks you owe Tommy 100 bucks a month yes so this is the bet unless they're closed there's two things losing if you don't be my dad is one thing but if you quit that's also another thing quit if you quit I give nothing to anybody and I piss in your mouth no okay espresso do you know you don't express all my piss you look like a great athlete listen I'll give you some wild elk sausage oh good food this is the other big factor the big factor that we're not talking about

you're a drunk drunk faster no no I'm thinking about that now it feels right coming back drunk drunk drunk drunk to find it just start trying hated rumored hammered have a hammered for me how about I have to fucking drink with you when I go do we're ready to go and then you run guys 13 beers do a speak they might have shot him up there longside that's a university look at that kid that kid probably got a hammer for a dick I used to be you can beat Ahri's dad's time in the marathon and survived one Holocaust and survived the helicopter and you have to drink throughout this one this is what you have to do you have to fly into Dubai and just fly back that's it no no come on one sec I might I'll do this one check American drink twice this drinks 26 treats in six hours you can't you can totally die wait a minute I'll get you a motorcycle listen I don't like to hear any this bitch-ass talk who's this guy chugging a beer in any day drink one every mile well it's a court needed a sub to our so he's obviously got fucking Mickey male jeans for sure no he's got John snow jeans and he just drank a beer every mile yeah well that's how it shows its topic in a second that's great fucking GoPro in his head the whole time hilarious what a savage passing everybody passing people drop its him passing everybody wow that's incredible hammered he's already in shape right yeah I used to do it during the Tour de France - that's a good lesson in physics but the glove off those hands they'll get cold hands up in the air - he's running with his hands in the air passing quitters I feel like somebody just tried to lecture him like you really shouldn't be doing that yeah here's what I realized - like bring this back home to base here's what I realized during sober October October I don't need alcohol but I like it it's great it's great I need weed like him I like it kidding it's for me it's changed how my circuitry works you know it's changed how I like how are communicating with people and I think that there's a thing about alcohols like you pay for it yeah you definitely pay for it physically but you there's like an exchange the things to figure out what that exchange is like what's it what's it worth getting really lit and having an amazing time and hugging your friends telling them you love them and just hold it and let me tell you something I think to this day about one of the times you and I got drunk together in Texas we first started going on the road together we would go on the road together a couple years yeah and we were in like a honky-tonk Bar yeah remember that yeah yeah and was it Houston or Austin I don't know what I think I thought it was just Louisville or something if somewhere in Texas I was Texas okay and we were hammered we were just hugging where I'm like dude I have so much fun yeah and you said the same thing and like we could say things that you always knew that I appreciate you as a comedian and you always knew that we were friendly and we had some gigs together but it took us getting drunk to like hug it out good yeah we're having so much fun pretty try cried we did yeah yeah so that's that like I didn't want to bring yeah you're a good dude man you were funny as fuck and I and I knew what you were because I had been where you were you're you were at the launching pad like goddamn is this happening like what's happening yeah I did my fucked is it gonna work out you know there's that weird moment and you know and I had already been there before and we were friends and I was like dude you're gonna it's gonna work you're gonna do it the other percent and then we were drunk together and we were talking about that moment I think about that all the time man I really do really I do now when you're killing it yeah I think about I'm crying I think about that shit all the time I do you know to see someone that you like when I met you in like 2007 I mean you would obviously like been doing comedy couple of years but you were you were trying to figure it out yeah well I think about I think about it too cause like you know it's hard like people don't realize the opportunity when when you when you kind of reach down and you bring somebody along for that it's hard sometimes to convey like your gratitude you know so like that was one of those times where like in soap when you're sober you go like dude thanks so much right how many times you're gonna say you know I mean I really appreciate it but when that's this goes back to like what the alcohol kind of opens up for you is like you let down your guard you let down that you let the vulnerability come to the surface and I think that was really like for me because I thought about it is like the expression of gratitude overwhelmed me because I realize how lucky I it's like you know you and any number of people can bring along whoever they want on the road with them so like that for me was just like I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be able to travel and do real shows you know do real shows with like these really appreciative audiences and like you're bringing me along and like I feel like a like an equal it was overwhelming to me you know I was overwhelmed you you are an equal we're all equal it's like broads and like different parts of the road yeah you know I could the road is the same Road no it is like going but there's lessons like there's lessons from that you know like there's lessons of people of yeah they got a they got to be willing to learn it themselves to tell you you have to know it in current you know it does just living through it encourages you to pass it along yes so that's kind of the coolest part is because like I mean I've really tried to to mimic that you know I bring like I brought a bunch of guys most recently Josh Potter is this really funny dude from Buffalo and I brought him on most of these dates and you know I hook up you know that could take care of his travel like house yeah yeah he's a great just moved here yeah really funny really really funny you know are either one of the only times I ever cried on the podcast was listening to a podcast where you were talking about your and our relationship it's one of the few times I ever cried like listening to a podcast like wow this is like heavy emotional when you're talking about like me and you going on the road like in the early days yeah it's pretty fun I was amazing man what was that it was your podcast we did the buck hunter podcast at the beginning of that end at the end we we were talked you were talking about our relationship when you first started out yeah yeah it was good to go from open mics to be able to see like like you said just like oh it's like a real crowd it's here it's so big people some people never even get a taste of it yeah and you come back oh yeah I always try to go back on some night to the potluck excuse me was it was no Sunday then and then it was like to go back to dose of reality what's right this sucks but I know I can do it now yeah but you you all need you like everybody knows that kana can do it that's what they're trying to do it but you need to someone who's ahead of you yeah they like holds a flashlight yes like come on take a look at this shit come on we're all the same keep going keep the beat like when you took me to laughs unlimited like our II didn't know you from the time where I first met you to you have in your own Comedy Central show to having your own Netflix special was double special don't special yeah two hours you had to do to you pretentious I thought for 45 45 still a half hour more than anybody but yes it was still was like wow that's weird when you can set your reality one way and then it like just slowly change over time yeah ality is like and that's what we it seems counterintuitive cuz you seem like you're trying to hold down the competition the problem is if you hold down a competition you inevitably hold on yourself you don't you don't mean to hit the bar set lower it's not just that it's like you're looking at the wrong way so one of the reasons why I always took killers on the road yeah that tough dude we say Joey Diaz we took Duncan we took Ari like I always took murderers on the road anybody following bringing electively bringing Joey is always bring yeah it was me up with a long time me and Diaz the rogue at great show and then it was in Austin Diaz goes hey I'm gonna go first today you're gonna go last there in a second I mean and I didn't know now he likes to go to sleep but then I was like am I being punished what did I do anything it's a terrible place to be following Joey unless it's not right the thing is if you let you embrace it was a good crowd I'm the number one Joey Diaz fan in the world other than like Joey Diaz wife and his daughter yeah it's like they're it's like everybody else is like sure if you might be the same but you definitely don't love him more than I do right charlie so for me it was like taking that guy on the road it's like I want to see him that's the only way you learned that doing staying up long enough if you embrace the person in front of you like you embrace it that dislike you enjoy it you can follow you can you can go back looking yeah you could because what people feel is you being nervous yeah fearful I feel like this is awesome dude I've been there I mean I thought Jim Breuer once when I was like 26 25 changed my fucking life yeah he he crushed so hard and I ate so many dicks yeah I choked to death like for the rest of my life I would it doesn't never gonna feel as bad as it felt then yeah and I was like 24 or 25 whatever the fuck I was I might have been younger I didn't know shit and Jim and I were just starting out and Jim was middle act he and I was the headliner but just because I have a good manager because he got me I'll be really like I can't follow Jim Breuer back then I just couldn't yeah I mean I did we did like three shows I think I think we did like two shows Friday and one show Saturday where I followed up and then the second show Saturday was so bad it was so bad I went down so hard maybe seriously considering not doing comedy anymore really really was like I ate so many dicks this guy looked at me in the audience that he goes you not fuckin funny oh my god I'm like you're not right if I'm being honest with myself he's right yeah yeah it was a horrible man I was dressed like a fucking Guido trying to get some pussy at a disco are the worst I had a torn ACL my girlfriend dumped me and just moved to New York it was a combination of all sorts of things and then Brewer Russian flame thrower shit he used to do this bit about coming home drunk and meeting his mom and his mom turned into a monster so good hey she's crushing so hard come on kitty you know Brewer has crazy facial expression on drunk he was killing it so hard he must have followed some savages in New York that you can follow right no I feel like I'm like in a plane no but I know that you were you moved to New York you're like you had like a good set in Tallahassee like what you're following fucking pros some nights right yeah yeah I want to end the end of every night at Boston Comedy Club yeah but I don't know I just I feel like if you embrace the energy you could always moving forward I remember having a followed Billy Gardell on the Jameson Comedy Tour and Billy was like a road destroyer yeah just like he would have everything I remember I used when we used to follow when we used to work with Jay yeah you'd host Jay would do an hour and then I close and do 30 which is by the way the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard and I didn't hear it until last week what when you taught when he told me the the order the date wait what did you say Jay would do an hour and then he would close close why would yeah but it was it was it was after he had come back from not doing like he didn't always do that but he took time off of stand-up you're a good guy so then he came to I like about you Tom he came back after like not doing stand-up I've never heard that in my life like I'm gonna do like Joe Rogan at the Belko yeah then I'm gonna have his trio go on and do after me yeah yeah what yeah it was it was it was like rude to hit was like but it was like in in the like I'm fit like I haven't done Stu have in two years so I know Tosh does a brilliant thing Tosh host shows and so does Russell Russell host Russell Peters and friends gonna bring a gang of funny jobs with them like he ensures that everybody comes out we're gonna have a good old fucking time this is a roast in the middle a weird different way to do it so differently or get our butt right who's to say right way to do it other comments like you say other comedians who say nobody yeah nobody you could do everyone does works yes is doing a beautiful and Russell's like same thing for sure and pasta dough's he hosts really I've never seen that if he doesn't host he brings like a ton of dudes on the road with him like Ian Edwards like murders yeah yeah you know it brings a ton right a lot of times if you feel like doing 18 minutes you can it's really doing three not feeling it cigar to see Russell and his friends yeah yeah it's like these guys are like stamp of Russell Peters around you know he knows you're gonna see some killer comedians they're gonna go up doesn't care by the way he's anyone who fuck what you coulda like that shit you could set a fucking stick of dynamite off and then he'll walk out there and they'll forget who the fuck you were immediately yeah Russell Peters I love him Russell Peters in my mind embodies like there's like I don't want to do this to you cuz you're here but there's two people that embody like what you should do right if you can actually do it right we should like what you did like we vanished for four months to fuckin Asia what you do is like somebody brings you an ad like yeah that's not cool fuck that yeah yeah you gotta fuck those that yeah well the whole Comedy Central thing we like yeah it's like you and Russell Russell doesn't give a fuck in places he he could look Russell has the love of first of all a billion people forever mmm-hmm forever about a billion a billion he's bigger than now he's bigger than anybody right so Russell has the love of a billion people yeah yeah I mean it's him and Aziz and his easy as a bit smug you know has ease his eases rgq he's in Paris why they come to Bali motherfucker what's going on you're talking to me no Russell Russell can't go wrong and he knows he can't go wrong so he doesn't give a fuck like the - you guys don't give me like it's like all these things are bar setters yeah Joey Diaz is a bar setter for us mmm Duncan's a bar said her because he's so weird he's very - things different he's a poor setter he's a bar centre as far as like psychedelic consciousness exploration understanding Tom Segura - just Hannah King bottles problem song maybe maybe he's not the water champ champ could hold his water yeah you gotta be free man I like when dudes shave their heads I like when they give in cuz it makes me like we're all together as long as I can let me see what you got it's alright it's curly well I hold on to it man I'm telling you - waste of time hold on to it Bert I wish I could go back to like me on Newsradio to shave my head back then I would be like fire me bitch I'm free I remember you committed to full sleeves people like you you're not gonna work on TV anymore and you're like right you and I had a conversation I was like that's why I'm doing it both lives they didn't care I'm not a big deal well when I when I decided to do it I was like I like art I'm like wise skin like regular skin so good why is it so important and I was like there's a certain aspect that I like about tattoos you're embracing the fact the year of a finite nature you're a punker well you know you're gonna die it's like it's not forever cuz you're not forever it's a patient a concept no I'm joking they look cool they look good well this is I got one guy did both of them seems Aaron Dellavedova from guru tattoo in San Diego the guy's a shit he's awesome would you add to them you all shocked you Dan them on your chest no if half your chest like just like die in the line there's one pack varies one has a see what pack know I'm feeling uncomfortable maybe like some strategize like what's that dude from blink-182 the guy let's band crazytown no no fucking really handsome guy mark he went on to energy of Mark Hoppus you got four sugar ray no sugar a breath yeah he's got like cute little doves I got like the Korean flag over like something like yeah I would have got it when I was 18 yeah I went out when I was fucking full-bore and Taekwondo I would have gotten Korean flag 100 percent I would attach to that shit yeah I used to count in Korean I just teach classes in Korean all the techniques where in Korean I don't know how to speak Korean at all but I can count getting really yeah Hana DOOL said Ned you do yeah I used to be able to do it it's just water its ability counts like a hundred but I forgot I you know all the names for Taekwondo techniques yup Chucky doli Oh Chucky yeah like everything you teach class like every time you teach gym B and everybody would like half like to stand there everything was done in Korean yeah I was intense man we drove not drunk the field so finally I never drive oh yeah yeah I got nervous when you said you took I'm spying on us cuz Ari and I actually had a discussion about it I got legitimately nervous when we were on the podcast you said you drink six doubles a day yeah I got super nervous but this is why I lost its pressure a lot it is a lot but this is why not just because I love you and I want you to be healthy but also because I'm like I don't think you need to do that no like if you had a drink a day or two drinks a day or three drinks a day you'd probably be fine like you give your liver enough slack no you're talking so documents eventually but not right away you wouldn't get drunk yeah but when you get into that neighborhood of like six doubles a day like dude you're talking about 12 drinks of alcohol where you're fine you're fine just because you want to win the hundred bucks but you couldn't get drunk on three drinks did you yeah good TT toes in a single tito's yeah are you drunk off two shots in New Orleans oh really yeah this time yeah I got so high the first day back mean Owen Benjamin yeah I got pretty I got pretty toasty in there I just got what I killed her high anything different not different for you at all well the first time I got high alone not drinking we drank of them we added some some blunts and stuff yeah well round blunts I think even you out cuz it's kind of a stimulant oh look I didn't smoke blunts until I hung out with Charlie Murphy really Charlie used to smoke illegitimate who would rolled these legit blunts out of like swisher Sweets take out the tobacco leave like a little bit in and then roll it up with weed and then lick it down and we would get [Music] nervous hi terrifying hi he was one of the hardest deaths that I ever had to deal with really yeah cuz I wish I'd contacted him more I wish we got together more we were always on the road you know I got that guy's a man like he was a he was a real man like like like he never had any like weird shit yet to work through he was he was held as mud like truck Charlie was a different man he was like a guy who didn't come in to celebrity at all until his 40s so he was developed he was a real man that loves that guys it's one of those guys like sometimes you get tough you get just get tired you're just doing too many things and you fur you forget to concentrate on people that you've run into in your life that you're like god damn that guy was a good dude like Charlie Murphy was a good motherfucker like he had a joke onstage that talked about he wasn't trying to but he was like he goes people say to me you know that people yell out Charlie man hey Charlie man hey he goes hey man never bother you it's someone just yells out Charlie Murphy every time you see him he'll know he goes because for the first time in my life was like hey you Eddie Murphy's brother right yeah and he would laugh about onstage like slap his knee and like that was real for him we got to experience a guy who like went through a whole life as a grown man and was approaching middle age before Fame kicked and wildmen and he only had like a 10 15 year ride before he died yeah it was a good dude man the magnitude of like you know that show but like particularly like two sketches like that's how big an impact those two sketches they just play that I remember when he started a tour you know when you go to the club's they play it before oh just that that I got the teaser that he's coming I'm coming next week or two weeks would be just like a little bit of like the Rick James sketch for the princess right and fucking all shows be so that look I'm so dialed man you know what man he didn't man I really feel like there's a developmental process that you could apply to like UFC fighters and even stand-up comedians if you take a guy who's got some potential then you make him fight Anderson Silva in his prime when he's 20 years old and he gets knocked unconscious yeah he's never gonna be the same again yeah and I almost feel like this is the same thing with comedians I don't care if you're 40 or 50 or 60 or 20 yeah the go on stage and eat dick is horrific yeah and what Charlie did was he went from being a guy who was on the Chappelle show to hosting a show with other comedians like Donnell yeah and and Dave and whoever was on the show and talking a little like hey what's up and instead of just continuing to do that he started headlining cuz that were the money that's where the money was no open mic no open mic famous so bringer shows no fame no I'm seeing dude we did 22 dates together 22 days together and we swapped who went back and forth like he had line one I had line one he in line one I had line one and he just remember those Doug his who had like the ones you were on well I swapped that they I did three I did Irvine San Diego and Phoenix and so different yeah different people in different nights but I saw yeah some I saw him struggle when I busted it oh my god and then I saw him actually do really well the next night really yeah yeah well if you can get on in the middle spot yeah he could do pretty good yeah he was a funny dude but it's just not it's not a good versus the right place to put somebody his Mega Millions joke he was doing that you know a bunch of great jokes great jokes man he's a funny and off stage maybe one of the funniest guys of all time he took me to dinner yeah on that thing which I didn't expect and I don't think rich wanted me to come and and like we went out to dinner really yeah but he was as he was like what like that show was fresh that was you know there was to you and like he was telling stories he he told the story that I texted you to ask him when you had him on I asked him if you like yo Donnie Gill fucking Mike Tyson tiger story pet tiger no one want to get out of the limousine yeah so crazy the jury or the bus boys story which one is that Charlie Murphy when is Eddie let him borrow clothes that's so funny just I'll never do it justice and it's so good when he tells it no you got to tell it you got to tell it because then I can sit up vailable online so you gotta find it so seeping in fun so you know you're never gonna be able to find it since snoop doggs podcast oh all right yeah I bet someone's put it on YouTube I know Bert Kreischer did I fuckin grabbed it the day he died I was like there's one of the best stories ever that's right yeah yeah yeah that's where I saw it yeah I don't

Charlie Murphy was at dinner with Morrie Smith who's a former UFC heavyweight champion of the world Ivan salivary who's a former UFC fighter who actually had a move that we start number one the salivary remember Ivan from yeah yeah I haven't had a move where it was what wasn't really his move but it was a move that well he was one of the first guys to tap somebody with it where he got the triangle from the back and elevated his hips it's like press down on your back guys were tapping out from like getting triangle from behind we started realizing like how dangerous that movie so Ivan salvers like a time-tested warrior right so when Maurice Smith former UFC heavyweight champion Ivan salivary Charlie Murphy is explaining why y'all niggas don't know about the Chicago Ridge head he's explaining some particular like martial arts move which it's called a ridge hand it's a strike and I don't know what the Chicago Rich hand was but Charlie was insistent that no one was trying out the Chicago Ridge hand in MMA and that people could do it and like they were laugh-in and Charlie was like nah fuck you he goes you tell me I'll I don't hit you in the head with a ridge hand red band took a picture I'm gonna find it it's Charlie Murphy standing up Mary Smith chopping someone on the bridge of their nose I'll hit you on the bridge nose oh fuck Chris Steakhouse somewhere yeah thank God I

right-hand corner is my as Marvin said that's the Ivan salivary and right to his left or Charlie Murphy's right go for the black guy that's Maury Smith that's Mary sport that is the former UFC heavyweight champion of the world that's Charlie look at the smile underneath his left arm look at that guy laughing I was crying too but I was probably under the table at this point cuz right leg like fuck you go change that podcast with Joey's all under the table crying at that point I love you guys but I gotta head out look we're all gonna go this is the point like Ralphie like Charlie like everybody we're all gonna go you know the quicker you realize that and quickly get that in your head the more you'll enjoy this weird time we're in the sunshine right after the rain it doesn't last it's good time to be a comic it's good time to be alive but as a human race as a person all of us there's no one gets out alive no one quicker we remember that the better we'll all be not work cut off a couple times this is all we heard is this is the end I'm gonna go did you see you here we're all gonna go you know I mean we miss charlie I mean us everybody that we know that's gone it's gonna have

okay yeah that was like you gave like a touching tribute man to Ralphie yeah you want to listen to it yeah you did that's a good guy he was gay as fuck man okay wasn't super gay yeah dude punished my asshole yeah punished it it's like eight guys just judging yeah okay belching is like where the line was crossed and they brought it back yeah there's not like a lot of felching videos out there anymore no no it was a bit of the thing about four or five years because that was that fat Burt pusher four or five years ago people talked about felching now people like let's just preserve our own sanity okay listen we didn't come to a conclusion we didn't decide they're gonna be my dad drunk yeah you have to be his dad you have to be drunk and you have to do it in six hours and 26 we don't have any stake in this like physically I'm uncomfortable with that because I feel like we're bullying no there's no reward we'll talk about it later guys we have to figure this out do you think we fucked up on the last one by not yes sure yes for sure okay I say will chip in and get you that fucking listen my wife doesn't listen to my podcast right so that grill where's the mic but we're wrapping up right now I'm gonna have a drink did your wife yeah there's no way your wife is gonna listen this deep in this is my thought yeah how do we the bet is for the motorcycle we're going we keep that bitch here could hide it no could hide it bird said you could can you imagine within a few years what's riding with your daughter's yeah no I mean she's also motorcycling because you guys are fucking bad-ass parent parent daughter - that's awesome the rush that you would feel if you survived would almost be worth it so we gotta get that motorcycle for you yeah 6:26 the Friday after Thanksgiving sure think like Melissa Etheridge how about a drink every two miles No hold on hold on Melissa Ethel's convinced you guys she's not gonna die every time she gets on a plane you got to feel like that every time you get on that bobber we're talking about three different conversations it's Melissa Etheridge alive or not has she been in a plane crash or not by the way this is exactly how that last pet park without realizing anything well we got out without realizing anything and then the bet was started yeah but it was great great okay let's wrap it up in two minutes should we all run this marathon together no that's impossible no possible oh I already know I can never do it all drunk drunk and stoned this is what we do we do something incredibly physically intensive but we do it hammered I mean hammered if as a group I'm back yeah oh man that'd be this is what I'm saying I'm not gonna run Sheila every two and a half miles a dump no one has its holler it's fuckin pressure hose I don't care I'd rather just drink it Gator event wise not if we're jerking off in the bushes just you one yeah no one's in a marathon everyone we buy connects in no I got a roller skate already five miles we drink a shot definitely if it was flat it was flat is it flat hold on we might have a visit flat down it oh no I mean it might be oh hell attract that one that was a track you don't you don't think he beat you on rollerskates let's make the bet Tom cannot beat me you've gotta wear full fur wait a minute on what fuck you Frank can you stop go to roller skating parties like a real speed skater that's that that's different than what you're saying but here's the thing you've run the roller skate so you don't green on the same runs out of steam which is very how'd you win that this is how you win you'll quit how would you win them oh quit six miles roller skating to walk then roller skate around you ever roller skating around a lap and you're like I'm exhausted I'm gonna take a break with three straight hours you're gonna do that four straight hours hey shit man I mean I've been oh my god this way it's the slightest uphill and he's walking it we do this track Jamie this Turkey stuff slightly uphill so much more exhausting to roller skate uphill yeah yeah of course it's so much easier on the downhill the other way skating 26.2 miles 42 point 2 kilometers is undoubtedly easier than running it okay this is roller this is from rollerblade key AutoKey off your skates our fair but roller blades aren't fail have you ever seen Bret Ernst act that's roller skating skating yeah that guy could beat you in a run I think you're missing here hearing me it's easier rollerblades yeah we ways your roller skates is the hardest thing for wheels roller Tom not Edline real but skeet speed skating they do like they go fast unrolled look man yeah too fast it's easy I did my bio Burt here no call the new birth about this bet well Tom if you are on skates you have to beat him by half no no just beat up just beat them it's just the Naro skits betta is easy be real real quick he's confident do you know I'm going right now to buy fucking another pair of roller skates yeah I thought this through for me and I wondered if I could beat myself rollerskating a marathon and and I was like dude you're forgetting I'm not gonna tell you why I'm fatigued you're choosing that the fatigue is totally different than jogging yeah like yeah you go a little faster in yeah you get some down hills but you also have up hills oh I got pink roller skates Courtney dole alter ran 238 miles and you're telling me you could rollerskate those I know I'm telling you the point it's like a mountain yeah weekend it's a real possibility cars here I'm going home I think you can if you don't quit you are re gets a razor yeah you get roller skates listen let's not be hasty this is a long podcast let's think you get us out this this has real merit to another podcast ours going back to New York little swipe it we could Skype it local board you have a skyper it okay so we'll Skype it will have the three of us will get together will Skype re in will put them on the big screen this is what I feel I feel like the first time it worked out amazing we didn't really have it ironed out before we ran off to our 15 yoga classes in our nope yeah alcohol and no smoke weed and we didn't have any steaks I think time let's let's give this a time for a bunch of fucking assholes to chime in online you know bunch bunch of us to sit around think about devious ways we could trick each other to do it something that seems okay way more difficult like Bert beating Tom you know I'm being so nice but not even suggesting you beating him by running in him on skates I'm not even suggesting that because that's just ridiculous but I'm thinking maybe like half maybe half is the real bet he does anyway straight hours not quitting a two and a half hours - I'm gonna get him high as fuck he's gonna be thinking about the universe steroids and electromagnetic fields listen if it all comes down to whether or not who's gonna tire out he's gonna get hot baby tires out he's got no heart you got no heart every if there's no quited Tom there's no way he won't beat you I haven't if he quits is your quit if he doesn't waiting wheels are faster than not wheels you know what's gree yeah but if he if he quits which is probably possible Bert thinks he's holding on to some logical linchpin here tell us tell us what why you think it'll definitely go your way I have many a reason gene number number one there's so much more weight on a skate than there is on to pick up to pick every time he's got to go he's picking up an extra and when you skate for the first time - yeah his thought I'd be on fire and he'll be sitting down and the rabbit or the tortoise will run right past him MMN go well did you have a good time rabbit did you chase the tortoise turtle I'm Bertil the turtle yeah turtle first top Tommy skates we will follow up on this oh I think is the way he exits like he's gonna be so just no no half doing my bed was ridiculous please try to be you can't you think you're gonna be wheels dude think of happy wheels yeah let you take off and I'll be like yeah see you fools just holding onto my shirt as I jog are the same on the same track you pass you get ahead the beginning and you be like hey I'm on for that somebody you are alright so can some rollerskating people reach out I gotta get ready there's no chance good night everybody call me dates how
