boom and we're live Kevin Lee yes sir about its fresh off of a fight as you can get man yeah just about touching us yeah barely slept yeah it's been a crazy first of all like after a fight it's probably you probably so wired and like can't believe it's over right what does it like it takes you a minute for it to hit you really I didn't sleep at all after the fight I just I laid there for a little bit mine kind of racing didn't really settled down I just ended up just getting up getting some breakfast and then right on the plane over here didn't sleep all out on playing came over here 3 a.m. I've been up all morning but you what do you like 25 yeah yeah yeah give you a rock star lifestyle baby 25 like two days in a row for really starts to settle it yeah I'll be good for a minute besides get kicked in the head I'm all did that was first of all it was a very very very impressive performance I mean Edson Barboza is no fucking joke and notoriously difficult to take down even khabib struggled getting him down in the early parts of the first round but you got him down quick yeah I think a lot of people underestimate that especially how technical my wrestling can get mom I I just feel like Edson was really strong he was probably the strongest guy that I've ever faced physically it just his body is just it moved a little bit different but technically I just had the aspect there and when you had those two things up I'm equally as strong you know that yeah I'm just gonna blow him out the water well he's just a bundle of fast twitch muscle fiber man and that dude I mean people you know they'll see the Khedive fight no see this fight with you they might not understand how good that guy really is he's very very good he's a beast and he's gonna come back he's gonna knock some people out for sure he's only gonna get better from here I think yeah it's just he it's the style make the fights too and me I feel like I can fight any style you know that that was my number one goal when I got into this sport just to be the most well-rounded complete fighter that there is and and I feel like I can take advantage of like some of his things that he's not good and good at but gonna get better at him he's going he's gonna be back he's a beast well that focus in that mindset of being well-rounded was very obvious in that fight I was very impressed by the fact you you fight just as good southpaw as you do Orthodox you switch up easily I've been I've only been going southpaw for maybe the past year a year and a half or so and just kind of getting the filler forward down but I feel like that could be one of the when you listen to a lot of the great fighters in the past they talk about a right-handed southpaw there's so many advantages they can be there and it's just it's just always great to be able to switch up and change time and especially when you got a guy that's that's trying to time you like Edison because they say that I'm sorry but they say that if you work on the opposite side it actually makes the other side better yeah yeah it makes it a little bit easier when you switch back yeah and I've noticed that I mean there's still some some kinks and twists that I want to kind of get out of there you know you see I study a lot of people I study a lot of switch fighters especially in MMA recently I want to say about the last two years he hasn't been doing it more often but some guys do it better than others I get the perfect mix you know well some guys do it but there's a twist right like Wonder Boy does it but when Wonder Boy does it you know that the front leg is coming yeah and then he's you know he's he can fight any style I mean he could fight left or right but when he switches when he goes right you know that front leg side kicks coming that front leg roundhouse kick is coming and then when he stands Orthodox he's much more likely to throw a punch or you know maybe even spin he mixes it up but he's limited maybe in the way he attacks the blending yeah but I think Wonder Boy is one of those guys that his switches are like really you could see him coming you know the he makes him really pronounced you know they're big switches and you know the the attacks that are coming there's certain guys like TJ Dillashaw who was great at mixing it up completely right where I feel like he doesn't sit down on his punches too much or you know he gets in spots where he can get clipped in between those with your feet off the ground so I try and find the happy medium between those two switching up too much and being able to make those hard switches to it well TJ's really been doing that style for just like three or four years now since he's been with bang maybe it's about I want to say three years four years yeah probably some of it takes some time to get used to we get used to the timing and everything and and that's one of the things with me like I try to be the most consistent guy that there is out there so the more consistently I'm getting in there the more I'm seeing things coming I'm I'm reading the angles and you know getting a lot of different looks a lot of different bodies being thrown at me so all that adds up to experience and you know it's only gonna get better from there yeah it's also one of those things when you're 25 years old you you still are like realistically five years away from your athletic prime yeah I get it I keep that in the back of my mind sometimes because that you know you obviously don't want to overwork the body too much you don't want to burn out but I think it's just staying consistent and staying healthy as long as I'm healthy through it you know I got through that fight no no serious damages at all and that's the most important thing is just staying healthy when I'm young and then you know tailing back when I'm starting to get more damages or more injuries but I'd do a great job keeping my body Ellie I think more than anything what are you like when you are in I know Robert Fellowes was your coach for quite a long time and we both miss him I'm sure you you were very close with him he was such a great guy yeah yeah was he the guy that like did he sort of map out your training program when you were in camp or you know I had we kind of structured it or at least I trying to structure it like a full team aspect you know Rob was kind of like I think of it like a race car you know I'm I'm the race car itself but Rob's was like the hit driver you know Rob's telling me where to go what to do Dooley was kind of like my horsepower you know he's ver ya doing Cooper uh got a phenomenal striking coach you ever you know tastic fighter he with him he he was a smaller heavyweight but he would fight jiying I was like Peter arts and a dude that you you gotta you know you look at him he's only about 220 you know six foot one maybe he's fighting six foot seven 300-pound guys so he has to be extra technical in there and not rely on his speed and power that's why I think he makes such a great coach and and he pushes me through it but I had another guy I've been working with Corey Goodwin for the last four or five years since I've been on in Vegas he's kind of like the mechanic you know he keeps me he keeps my body fresh and going he is here strength conditioning yes but we call it that but well what we do is a lot different than strengthe condition and you know it's not a lot of I don't live any weights I mean people with fever Seaton yeah I haven't touched a weight since college you know wow the only time I did was when I went over and I started working with the UFC PR guys a little bit they wanted me to touch weights but uh it's just not a good fit for me are you doing what are you doing plyometrics are you doing he'd had to explain it to you more you know this is that this would be he does he worked through excels for a long time so he took a lot of their their physiology and or their exhales exos the I think they just had to deal with the UFC - a lot of guys been going over and uh they're a big strength conditioning program they get they got a big facility down to Arizona but they used to be based out of Vegas so he worked for them where he gets a lot of his training philosophies and stuff but it's not it's not any any wait listen calisthenics CH a lot of Callanetics a lot of movement a lot of we work a lot of the joints especially you know where he over extends my joints he pushes on pests past the limit and then we work out from there so it's not very heavy lift and it's maybe 15 what do you mean by pushing him past the limit like like hyper-extended yeah I mean no is it almost like you get an arm board so uh one of the things we do is he takes a ban any any stretches it out so it really pulls my shoulder and I was telling you how I very rarely have shoulder problems and I think a large reason he pulls it all the way out kind of out the socket and then we work out from there I don't know to build strength from those little muscles which I feel like is that's the part where I get my true strength from you know I do that a lot of yoga a lot of you know a lot of things that just all the strength comes from with him you're not lifting weights or anything how often you doing yoga when you're in camp two to three times I've only been doing it for like four or five months since the twenty fight it's been helping me out a lot when I when I started doing it guys were like ah what are you lifting or something I'm like no just it's hard just do it yoga like isn't it crazy how hard it is he's like you just fucking off okay I'm doing yoga are you lazy bitch he's doing a stretch and touching your toes maybe for like the first two months like I'd be like a shame to tell people they like where you going to like you know I'm going to this one class so you know we're gonna be lifting a lot of weights and we gonna be grunting this shit like shit nom in there would like killing me that's crazy they telling me they killing me I've gotten good now though but uh yoga yeah yeah I uh I do a couple different stay even then you also a little bit I tried Dibble dabble but I've only been doing it for a couple months now now when you do how do you structure your camp like in terms of like how much strength the conditioning you're doing how much skill work how much so it kind of depended on it depends on the opponent too uh but you know generally I'm doing three times a week of some type of grappling whether that's wrestling or noogie then only spar once a week at the end of the weeks we pick our sparring partners that we pick that we choose you know we fly guys in or guys that are in town because I'm in Vegas all guys are always in it all but then you know I only only do strength edition maybe two times a week not too much now when you say you spar once a week and you bring guys in are you sparring hard or do you are more technical you just go when I'm in camp maybe four or five good but I go pretty hard and it it ruins me sometimes because I run out of sparring partners and guys don't want to show up and all this but uh yeah I ended up having to start pay you guys just come on man give me some work here right yeah yeah we try to make some money do you think that that's the way to go like for longevity do you see there's a there's a big debate right whether or not you should spar skill wise and then save it up for the fight or whether you should just fucking go to war I think I think you need that that reaction time you know with a guy that's seriously throwing at you and I mean we're not trying to hurt each other for sure the smart part is 80% maybe 70% someone we go pretty hard up until you obviously can see that there's an injury or someone's hurt or you know you back down and even on like some of my takedowns I back down obviously I'm not trying to knock the guy out but I am trying to give him some good work and I hope he does the same we pick smart guys that'll do it that's what it's about at that level when you've got two very high-level guys going against each other we can go hard and not injury right if I'm going with like a new god or you know it's a newer team like I don't even try to make a name yeah there's a lot of that man too much yeah I remember I ran into Vitor once and his hand was in a cast and he had not a fight in a while I said what happened he said some new guy came into the gym and he's sparring with this new guy and this new guys trying to kill him and he broke his hand this dude's for it and I was thinking you're Vitor Belfort I mean this is Vitor like I want to say like eight nine years ago I was like man like that's crazy but yeah that's the kind of shit that happens right and guys are very tough in the gym I mean especially someone who do like they tougher than you think 16 and they're tough yeah they're coming out with with you know noosed I think each dinner generation has a new style tool that you're you don't get used to and if it you know if the boys that catch you if they they be hungrier than you uh well you seeing all these new guys that are coming up they can do everything you know they have like Taekwondo skills they got Muay Thai they can wrestle they do flying arm bars and shit there's just kids are because MMA is such a part of like the zeitgeist now and everybody understands and kids know if you want to be a really tough fighter it's not about boxing it's about MMA and so you're getting these wild ass kids a really young age practicing the shit out each other learning it trying going to gyms when they're 910 years old by the time they're in high school they're killers yeah I mean and we have so many of them that come through Vegas especially and I think that's what that's my favorite part about living there is is the the training partners and like I said the new kids I try and even though I'm only 25 I'm trying to see what they doing right that's coming up next tomorrow because they're they're gonna come with something that you a see before there's some out there like like even my younger brother my younger brothers just getting started in his America career he's only got five pro fights now eight in total so not that many fights but there's some of the things that he do I'm like you know let me try let me the are from you a little bit right well the barbozza fight you got clipped it was a third round the beginning put the wheel kick that recovery was amazing though man that's an amazing recovery man Barbosa puts people out with that shit and your legs completely gave out but man it's that's a weird moment right more like anything if he wasn't near you right where you could grab ahold of him and take him down if he just stepped back a little bit you know interesting right yeah yeah I mean I was still there um you know I never went away and I think a lot of even the way I moved when somebody showed me that video after I crack though I was I was dying laughing because when I'm in there I don't I don't know what happened you know I see the video and I see my legs just go bro they pretty good though I've been laughing a lot - all morning but I think a lot of you see my a lot of what I was my focus going into this one was really on my footwork my balance you know doing yoga I've been dancing to a little bit some ballet I think I was a you know his dad had him enrolled and danced for four fucking years yeah traditional Russian dancing and he credits that for his footwork yeah I mean I've I've only been doing it for a short amount of time but still I can tail right off the bat and I think a lot of what you saw there was that you know when I looked at before the only other fight I've ever got dropped in or hurt seriously was a the Leonardo Santos fight and really it was me dropping back on my ankle and I broke my ankle in that fight so when I tried to stand back up it looked like a wobble - and that's why I John you know John McCarthy stepped in so a lot of what I focused on was the balance so when my you know that equilibrium gave off and you seen I would saw four guys in front of me I'm just like let me just keep my eyes on this motherfucker right here like easy because you think of how hard bar pose is usually to take down you just got you it was very fortunate it was right there for you to grab him because he was trying to move him for the kill yeah yeah I mean uh if you were his coach you would have been screaming get the fuck away from him right his coaches was not doing him no favors - no I felt bad for the guy what were they could they could have did them better through the site he I probably could have put him away in the second round um but he was panicking and I could see it in them you know and this coaches like caused him to panic a little bit more you know they just kept screaming at him the time like you only got two minutes the survivor is like I mean that you know new barbells a nice guy he really is and you know I didn't want to hurt him too bad it's two very similar fights for him in a row to maulings that's in a row that's you know when you're that guy who wants to stand up and you know you got guys that are just just constant pressure constant pressure means that people don't realize how much endurance that takes to move away - moving backwards it's a lot more difficult to do yeah true I mean I feel like everything kind of pushed you know it's about who controls the pace of the fight and I felt like I did a good job of that and uh you know I thought even if I got wobbled with it with the kick in the third I still came back in you won that round yeah I tried to make it a point to finish that moment you went around you know and you hurt him bad in the second round - with a kick to the body let's see him cover up and Tencent it but you could see it it was a strong right kick to the body one of the reporters he asked me like why was i standing at at range with him and it's just like I feel like I can do it all you know and that's my true sense like I can stand at range with it with I mean he's definitely the the most explosive dynamic all those things you want to say the best kicker in the lightweight division and I and I can stand at range with them and kick just as well with him and I can wrestle with the best wrestlers I can I can kick with the kick best kickboxer I could punch with the best boxers so why not test myself um I'm not one of these guys will shy away from shit he's an interesting case because he's really primarily a kicker he will throw punches but that's not his strong suit I mean he's not a guy that just wants to you know just just dig in and throw bombs yeah but he got some bombs hit me with that left you know enough he hit me with a monstrous left hook in the fifth Rossi man he's still there the kitten that he never gave up he was taking a beam he hit me with a monstrous left hook so I gave him one back and bless his orbital uh pretty good uh you know he was still there to the very end he can box - he's got some power in his hands yeah and the cut it was a pretty nasty cut pretty nasty cut overs right I wouldn't stop the fight we were you shocked that they stopped it no I thought it was the right call you know I think more coaches and MMA should definitely get in there a little bit sooner and I think I think that's what the some of our problem with his corner was - you know you see some of these fights and you can kind of tell when a guy just doesn't you know it doesn't make sense some make them take more beats not right somebody like Barbosa is explosive to the very very end you have to give that to him that's the thing you never know right me if he connected with that left hook perfect and you went out and then and then he's a hero yeah then you know I guess you then you look like the asshole but ah you know I don't know it's it's a thin line across yeah it's a tough decision you don't want to be there when you guys getting beaten up like that and you have to make that call yeah yeah and I mean maybe I'm just speaking from because I'm not a coach yet maybe you know my stance will change when I'm when I am a coach but you know or if I have a coach but we'll see yeah it's uh it's it's different with I mean the same thing with referees and Keith Peterson did a great job in that fight this is he's a guy that doesn't get enough credit yeah there's a few like you know herb Dean I think cuz John McCarthy is retired I think he's the gold standard Josh Rosenthal there's a bunch of really good guys but that's a tough call to decide when to stop I think even Yamasaki you know yamasaki takes a lot of uh he takes a lot of bullshit especially from the yeah from from Dana don't like him at all he hate Emma but uh he does a great job in there even that that fight where he let the girl take a lot of punches a lot of damage she was still moving she was still showing that she was in the fight I think you got to put that on her coaches and her and her trainers they know that she's if she's really in there yeah you know some guys are just too tough for they own good like like barbozza well she was fighting on Fallon Tina Shevchenko she's been in their first UFC fight and she's fighting a woman who's just a straight-up assassin yeah and it can't be on the ref you can't put it on the ref to know that you know yeah or to make that call the breath has to be completely sub not not objective at all it's I think it's got to put in other cultures they should know yeah what weight do you walk around uh about one if I'm completely just kind of like bullshit and doing whatever I've gotten to his eyes like 195 when you're in training like when you get and like save your four weeks out where you're not eighty five years on one eighty four eighty five you're cutting a lot of weight man yeah yeah I mean that's uh do you see yourself ever moving 270 or no I'm not not seventy necessarily just because though those guys they're you at that point you're talking about a frame issue you know you got guys that like six foot one and you know they're just it's it's a different it's a different body style you know I train with a lot of them high-level welterweights too you know it's a different body style right I'm more suited for 155 it's just with you know some of the things that I got to play around with I think will keep happening in the upcoming months I didn't project that I would fight again until July or so so a lot of the things that I was doing diet waz was kind of getting to that and they approached me with this barbell as a fight maybe like eight weeks earlier than that so I just had to do it at to do so is it a matter of just you didn't taper off quick enough or you just came in too heavy before you started you know it was just it was just the timing wise you know I missed it by one pound yeah yeah it something on that time in that I've really got to figure out and that was the biggest problem with with the Tony Ferguson fight you know I can break it down for you so usually uh you know I'm normally about 185 through six weeks of diet I can usually die down to about 76 77 like that's where I'm and then from there I start the water cut so the week of the fight the Tuesday I'm 76 you know I saved that all the way until you know I overload my body with water and you know cuz flush out some of the the sodium and the carbs and all that I saved the rest of that up until the day before and I try and cut as much as I can as because I wanted to spend as little time dehydrated that dehydrated as possible and I think that's some of the problem with having these early morning weigh-in is the time and issue of it and as you wake up and then you have to start from the time you wake up rather than if it's at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon like it used to be you'd be able to do it all throughout the day yeah yeah I can cut more you know reasonably through the morning you know you can wait like if you had more time you would have been able to make it oh yeah absolutely 1% yeah time thing yes yes I got confused when they were doing this early morning winds I thought you had like like from 8 a.m. to 4 o'clock right right that's right yeah I thought if you could weigh in early go ahead way in early but they gave you the time yeah I mean I'm not really I don't really know the solution either you know I don't think nobody really knows the solution to that problem the the timeframe because you are seeing a lot of guys miss weight because of that and I think that's that's one of the biggest problems and not only that but guys are going to sleep completely dehydrated and sleeping through the night 20 pounds dehydrated that's a lot of water coming from your blood your blood gets thicker your heart rate slows down when you when you sleep I mean you know I try my best not to spend as much time dehydrated his partner so it's just a timing issue on that last one especially when you see guys like those on Joe's that just can't do it anymore and he goes up to 70 he looks better than ever what do you think about that it's always an option for me it would be an option now like I would I would entertain the right fight at it for sure it's just right now at the state of it is you know they're doing this bullshit interim title and you know tyrants sitting right there and it's it's a lot of movement it's not a lot of movement at the top right now so 155 just more fights interests me it's bigger challenges I think the guys are honestly better at 155 170 maybe in a future but you know it's got to be the right type of fight or something yeah they're well there's so many good fighters now from I mean you go all across the board I mean pretty much every weight class that's strong now but yeah I agree I think 55 is probably the strongest weight loss right yeah and it is so strong that you can make a 165 out of me I don't I really don't see what what the holdup is on it it was 65 to a 75 I grabbed because we have so many guys that you know can bounce between those and you'll have a whole new top 15 a whole new champion and to be just as strong as any other two weight classes next to it I couldn't agree more I think it's very important that we spread it out better I think ten pounds is reasonable you know I mean the way boxing has it they just thing you know they have a 54 and then they have a 60 that seems a little ridiculous they're 47 and then they have a 54 I think you'd be better off with 10 just said straight up 10 pounds that's reasonable but when you go from like 85 to 205 that shit's crazy boy even 55 to 70 because most guys you know like a normal-sized guy is about my son is one hundred eighty-five hundred ninety pounds that puts you in that in that middle you know yeah guys like me with a lot of muscle where I'm not gonna lose a lot of fat in between you know right even for this one I was 177 but I was born and a half percent body fat you know I couldn't really lean can't get too much more lean than that sixth floor and a half of somebody fight when you weight in yeah before well I was four and half percent maybe two weeks before the fight Ashley what are you getting calipers are you doing how they totally testing over at the UM in the water not over at the P I lost but anything yeah they've got like so the scales aren't that good yeah here's the thing about those scales those scales when you hold onto those things I mean some of them are okay but the best way they say is submerging you there's a submerge one and there's another one that uses some sort of like electricity thing like you lie in a bed and I think that the Performance Institute has that too they're explaining that shit to me yeah yeah the the full scanner yeah done that a few times but it's much quicker much easier just get on the scale and as long as it's real low four and a half percent sounds it does but as long as it's it's still the same measurement you know an obtained as my last fight for the Tony fight I was five and a half percent on so as long as it's in the same with the same CalPERS yeah I mean what they're using you know that you're basically on point yeah exactly I can compare it at least but again I can't get much that much leaner you know it's mostly just gonna come out water if they had a 65 then you know had I've got ten more piles of water that I don't have to cut out how fuckin ridiculous how frustrating wasn't you for you going into that Tony Ferguson fight with that staph infection cuz that was a that was serious for I didn't notice it at the weigh-ins but then the moment you walked into the cage it was funny man because they were telling DC don't talk about it yes it was good that staff that that his fucking staff and then they said to DC don't talk about it yup that looks like staff for me he just ignored me fuck you man I don't know why they didn't want anybody bringing it up because it's an important point it's it's a an unfortunate thing that happens during training sometimes yeah it I kind of noticed him last Sunday you know and then Tuesday we do the check-ins and everything and I had the girl I'm like can you you know put some makeup on it because I didn't want right you know nobody to find out and even Tony him you know I if he would have saw it he wouldnt knew he knew uncompromised all that yeah but yeah it frustrated things that make things a lot more complicated it put me it made the weight cut terrible just to go back to it I mean I'm cutting from 76 to 250 yeah I have to be 55 for that fight and I try my best to skim it down in about 12 hours so I woke up at 5:00 a.m. with at about 162 and Williams are between 9 and 11 and from 5:00 a.m. till 8 a.m. I had only cut one pound compared to in other cuts that have gone really well I've normally cut by 4 or 5 pounds at that time but because I I just was feeling good and I wasn't worried about it and thus and I was using the same temperature of water I was using the same everything but the staff made my body hold on to the water hmm so when I went down and checked I saw that was still like 5 pounds up with like two hours to go they started like don't let boiling hot water on me to get you know the get me swathi yeah to get me sweating to get it off it was brutal yeah that's a first for know for someone who doesn't never never experienced staff explain what it does to your body yeah it makes you feel the next day I just felt so tired I never felt as tired in my life and it felt I feel so tired to the point where I tried to counteract it by getting myself as pumped as I can and the you know when you normally get there two hours before the fight when I walked into the arena that night two hours before I was in a sweat you know my body was like full of enjoy my taking any medication you weren't going on in antibiotics you figure if you have this to decide whether you should take antibiotics and then you know that compromises your endurance for sure or just let your body fight it off I had it before so I had on the antibiotics and they just make terrible you know if you've ever been throwed I mean it's a terrible feeling so I I just was like you know what I think I can just push through it and I'm young and I was like you know what fuck it like let's just go like did you try any like natural remedies yeah yeah yeah you know it wasn't a whole lot I could take cuz I also gotta cut the weight still right uh there's some topical stuff that one of the things they say that works really well topical believe it or not is minced garlic realize garlic apparently has a tremendous effect on staph infections swallowing whole cloves of ginger I'm Rob I would take ginger I would chop it up and I'll swallow it to see if that would do something but you know yeah it's a harp garlic has some real strong antibacterial properties and one of the people that have been on the podcast many times dr. Rhonda Patrick said she had dealt with some persistent staph infection and she had like a you know hole in her skin and what she did was she took garlic and packed it into that whole ten and fucking killed it Fiji is I wish I would have known that befo I just kind of just fought through it was like fuck it I'm just going defense soap makes some really good stuff for that too they make these essential oils it's tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil and you put it on where were you in in October anybody that has that staph anytime you have any sort of ringworm or staff or anything there's some natural stuff not like some bullshit homeopathic nonsense but some actual real natural stuff that can help you and defense soap specializes in that because guys Sacco the guy who owns the company he is you know coaches wrestling and deals with kids that always have ringworm and staph infections so she came out with these soaps these natural soaps that are just designed for grapplers that's why it's called defense soap no and then I'll have them send you some and then the essential oils and bombs and stuff like joint mints for scratches and shit like that so they don't get infected that's you know gyms it's you're always getting infected yeah and that's it that was one of the biggest focuses in the dis campus like make sure I stay healthy because hey if you don't have your health you have nothing and and that was what it was at that tawny fight it's just it it became something I didn't want to it was such a big event and it was my first real big event too that I just wanted it all just to go right and go over but it ended up being just a lot on my body the staff originally I think it came from mental stress you know it was so many stresses going on you know you really miss her yeah you and you look at the three biggest stressors you know I was going through a divorce and I just moved into a house you look at those in a normal day-to-day life that those are like the two biggest stressors you can have then the add-on fighting for world title in six weeks so I'm just like let's fucking go like I like you know I wouldn't expect and I was thinking maybe they was gonna give me Tony but maybe in December Indian Detroiters shot my dad when he was like six weeks all aha well fuck that's right they were thinking about doing you in Detroit right that was that was that was the talk and you were requesting a big fight in Detroit yeah yeah that's where all my like you know every year I kind of sure plan on my year and and I got my vision in my head I gotta call the multiples in there that was one of them but yeah it ended up putting a little bit too much stress on me all that once and I took on a lot for it for that one but you didn't let doc tell you what man when you took him down and mounted him in the first round I was like holy shit cuz I know how good Tony is on the ground you know it's interesting because you don't you look at someone when they fight and this is one of the things that I've been saying about khabib it's because it's so hard because he's doing what people do right he's taking people down he's mounting him grounding pound him but he's doing it to people that other people can't do it to and he's doing it in a way that it's like wow how good is this motherfucker like when he was mall and Michael Johnson I was like how fucking good is he cuz this is crazy like he's in that moment several levels better than anybody Michael had fought before on the ground and when I'm seeing you first of all see the key ossified and right to this day I'm like Jesus fuckin Christ just let him go out let him go out and we would have known but at that minor controversy from that moment you got a fully locked in rear naked choke and he's still conscious let him go out he doesn't want to tap let him go he he was gone lip he was maybe but let him go out but you know the defense isn't you can't you can't something I can but the thing you know what you're saying but I know Hicks and camp yeah but the thing is it the the ref you can't put that on a ref you know it's defend yourself in Ted and tell Mario was that Mario games Mario but it is defend yourself no no it is defend yourself intelligently it all you can't you can't say I'm blocking punches with my face until the guy gets tired you know you can't say how I'm just gonna try and sleep in this choke concentrate on his neck it just completely tense up his neck and try to push blood through if you have seen guys do that I feel you but to the point right only to a point right and then you go to sleep yeah sleep yeah yeah I mean yeah I'm with you he could have let him go to sleep but I think as soon as he as soon as Mario saw that his hands went from fighting the hands to doing this mm-hmm Mario stopped it I mean and I thought it was a good stops I mean it's not a bad stop as such but it was controversial you call it off these controversies always good I said that right after like keep it up keep it going like I love it they got you to talk about it lease is an undercard fight became like bigger even than a lot of the other fights on the car because of that yeah yeah no I thought we up we headline that that he meant you know it wasn't right I'm sorry doing my thing out there was only but that fight was really like a top contender for I mean chiesa had been on a roll he's very strong on the ground which is one of the reasons why I was so impressive that he took his back and choked him like that yeah I mean I think I have a different style than then a lot of people can see you know you you you go back to Kobe man and I was like his style is it's good it's obviously very good but I can see a lot of holes in it and I saw those holes many years ago I've been called big it could be four years I'm gonna want to fight him just because people got those questions I got those questions too so I'm like let's see what this motherfuckers got like cuz I see it I see them holes you know I don't really focus on too much of the good I'm like what holes now boy number now telly you Joe holls what do you say you know even though some of his take on a lot of his takedowns he he misses a lot of them you know he's very square he kind of just bum rushes you know people were talking about the Barboza fight before and they're like are you looking at that fighter and you're gonna try and build off that when I'm like yeah I mean he did okay he the fight was good he beat the hell out of Barbosa but I saw the holes in it you know he's just running square for at him you know he got hit with a lot of shots it's terrifying for people in the outside watching him because the way he just came forward on Barbosa was like he was indestructible yeah I mean just it didn't matter I'm just gonna get you it's a matter of time keep throwing your kicks I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you I got you you got those guys but the body gives up you know yeah just engage you is the same way the body will give up Amit with you you can't keep putting your body on the line like that I mean if he wants to run at me square for and square like that I'm getting paid I love BG I love watching him fight but part of me is like Jesus man just if he mixed what he can do cuz he's one of the very best at and leg kicks and close that dude will be in the middle of a combination like chest to chest with you and then somehow or another he whips a leg kick straight down on your leg I mean he's nasty with that he's got a couple things that he does real good you know I've been studying jg2 he's just he's just hard-headed than him like you don't just take yeah he'll just take it and just walk right into it but it's it seems like when you look at all the skills that he has like that would be better represented with some movement and some footwork and some other things yeah especially with a guy like Trevor Whitman and this morning you know Trevor is a great great coach which he did the rose I mean yeah he spent eight there I think their styles are very opposite uh you know he should probably listen to him a little bit more they see one of the things with me and Robert faultless you know I had them with brother Robert was the the pretty much the only reason why I moved to Vegas because he did there's a there's a weird bond between a like a fighter and a coach you know and he just got me more than any other coach before or since we'll you know we were very different but he just understood me at as an athlete a little bit more and even some of the things that he would tell me I wouldn't listen to it like he you know he tried to tell me to stay smart and you know not brought his eye at the end of the day Joe I could I'm like fuck this I'm a fight you know I'm a bite down on my mouthpiece he tried to get me to be smarter and just some of the things that he would say to me resonated with me more than anybody else so I think now that he's gone I've put what he said it's still in my head and it you know I try and follow it even more now you know you know and I wish somebody I guess you wouldn't listen because you know Whitman is telling him right what to do the right thing to do he should be probably listen to him well I think Trevor just tries to complement your style and gay G styles just savage this is he's just going war we're going to war every time one war oh yes I get it yeah you know watch I think you can I think you learn from learning from somebody else you know I think everybody has what they do that that's like I say I and create a strong team around me where everybody has what they do and I'm just gonna try and listen to him you know and even more so now not that I understand that a little bit more as I'm getting older and you know going through life - with it I said well Rob you know what one of the one of the reporters there he asked me he was like I said we seen you in there talking and they thought I was talking about Boza but I was really just talking myself like I was saying things that he would say or Robert would say yeah that Robert would say and I'm saying them to myself and I guess my mouth was moving I don't really know I thought it was in my head the whole time but I guess like some of the reporters could see it but you know I really tried to make that a focus interesting so do you do that in sparring - yeah I don't I don't know I usually try and did you realize you were doing it until they brought it up I didn't realize I no I'm not because he when he asked me that it kind of caught me off guard because I remember in the fight I'm very cerebral III I remember everything about it but I remember I was gonna say something to Barbosa too you know talking my shit you know I'd do it if I see something right on the time but I didn't because he was a nice guy I didn't realize that I was talking myself to on it so you were just kind of going through the things that you wanted to focus on in the fight while I was hot yeah I'm like stay do you know what you're saying even the kick the kick that heel and it if you see like a microsecond before that I was not in my head because I was I was I took my mind off on for a split second and I saw the knockout there I seen him dip to his left and I'm like next time he did so I'm I'm about to get it so I started to talk to him and I was like like I got this and I took my mind off of him and he hit me with that fucking spanking but what it should have said was stay sharp yeah you know stay is stay focused like that's what I was saying in the fourth and the fifth round after that kick landed I was like stay sharp stay focused saying that to myself because that's what Rob would tell me he wouldn't tell me to you know look for the knockout what was the thought process when you're gonna face a guy like Barbosa that such a dangerous kicker was it a lot of faints plus pressure like what was the thought process about getting close to him yeah with a guy like Barbosa he throws everything so hard is so explosive I knew I was gonna have to eat some of that and just keep pushing forward and just not take my eyes off of him even when I got wobbled and I was wrong I just try not take my eyes off of them you know with with a with a guy like that that's such a great athlete which is what I considered Barbosa as you know Rob had these three things he put everybody in an athlete a competitor or a fighter category and Barbosa was like epitome of an athlete but with that you can't show him no you can't show him that he's doing good you know what I'm saying mm-hmm so every time he was throwing I'm just like walking it off that fucking switch kick is ridiculous he's got the most ridiculous bitch pick in the game so Marc Telegraaf a who's seen some of the best of the best fight in Thailand in in real you know in life and like right there in person he said I've never seen a guy with a faster switch kick he was even the top the the most elite of the Thais he was that's the fastest way dead tired I'm up beat the hell out of a foot and still thought I was like how is this even and - even in the third and fourth round Wow and some of it I'm kind of like looking while I'm in there I'm like what is he doing that can make him do that you know I try and steal a little bit from every guy that I fight especially like what is he doing that's allowing him to be that goddamn fast with it but you know I prepare right I prepare with a lot of high-level kickboxers that you know they got that style that kick and they just can't get fuckin a block off if you let him yeah you're gonna get something from that right like the little indie CEO is calls it the rub and you fight someone's real good you get that rub from him from him you just realize now oh those kids can come at you that fast yeah yeah I mean and you get that in a lot of different ways like like with Tony you know Tony had did a lot of things in there that I didn't expect and I didn't you know didn't really plan for there's only so much planning that you can do until you get in there and you need that experience to rely back on and I feel like that's what I'm building up at a young age even it's possible for you either rematch with Tony with Tony now coming off of that very disappointing fall you know when he was which is crazy I feel bad for did you say something - this is very important and I actually have pictures - I'm gonna send him to you right now Jamie so we could put it online because everybody was repeating the the thought that he had worn sunglasses and that's why he fell down that he was wearing Sunday yeah he misspoke and he said it - I think he said my prescription sunglasses to Ariel Helwani I think that's what they were saying the the square was that he wears it I'll send it I'm gonna send it to Jamie right now but it wasn't he was probably find it damn it Tony loves those I know I know he doesn't love the okay I know where it is he does love Tony's a smart guy you know I don't I don't hold that against time it was probably something that was already injured in his leg and I feel bad for the guy I really do I don't think he'll ever be the same coming back off that oneness but that's a big you know I hear detached it yeah text him from it long yeah I mean that that's huge especially at 34 to try and come back off that that's it's gonna and it kind of sucks for me too cuz I think I fought the best Tony Ferguson that you're gonna see period really you think so because it was before that injury yeah I don't think he's gonna be the same again after it and he'll come back and he'll still beat great guys you know he's still he's still gonna do very good but you know I don't think it'll be the same and you know damn it I got this photo in here somewhere I'm gonna find it I can't find it I'll send it to you later but in the photo he's wearing glasses he's not wearing out wearing prescription sunglasses he said he misspoke and said prescription sunglasses that's why Dana told me Dana's ruthless Dana goes everybody who wear sunglasses should inside should have that happen this is after this huge fight fell apart is what probably yeah but um it wasn't he wasn't wearing sunglasses yeah I mean I just want to clear it up for Tony like I said I mean I feel bad for him I really do I think you the good news is I didn't come back from that injury that's an injury you can come back at 34 especially with the way he trains I mean I think he I think the body can come back is just I don't know if his mind will let him be as free if that was one of Tony's biggest assets to the stylist he was I mean he just does whatever the fuck he wants you know and now when he gets back in here is he gonna be thinking about his knee even if that's in the back of your mind it's still it's it's limited on that type of style that he that he likes to fight maybe or maybe you just fucking his head right now you never know it's the money to be made well he will be out for quite a while I would imagine he won't be able to even really train hard for six months yeah at least at least yeah he's at least a year also uh you know what I'll let I me I when I look at that and I see that fight and just you know how much different shit could be now you know had I went into that fight healthy especially I think the the entire division would look different but I'm a correct all that and a little let me let me get my hands Oh could be first well it's interesting me you're in the running now for sure and before this fight I think you were a slight underdog in the barboza fight yeah but after that domination I mean you you for sure moved up and you're in the running now a hundred percent so you got Poirier who just looked real good against kg and won that fight after getting his legs chewed up and then you've got but you know Poirier of course was knocked out by michael johnson and then you've got you coming off the loss to tony storm the gates with this fight and then you've got Eddie Alvarez who look great against Justin cagey that it's very hot yeah and Connors I think that's the x-factor is what's happened with Conor yeah I mean dust is out there but I just don't see no I'm speaking as it from a fan you know yeah I just don't see no upside to that you know I mean to you fighting him no no to him ik Abib I mean they can make it happen and can people go out there and he'll smoke him I mean it would be real here but uh I just don't see many fans getting behind that just from what does dust and bring to the table that could be been already seen this is the big fight right now I mean just being completely honest the big fight right now is khabib and con 100% sure that's the big fight whatever take five or even Madison Square Garden I mean they they can make that happen I don't think mike has ever letting them I just don't think they're gonna do that they don't play games men then athletic commissions a different Commission and they're new to MMA and I was embarrassing for them I mean him throwing the fucking dolly and the fact that they let them get in there with all his boys and the whole thing was just so thuggish she didn't I think in Bellator happened and was that in New York in New Jersey what thing happened in Bellator where he where he went over and slapped Godard and all that you know people they call people bitches and hoes and it was that I want to say that was in Ireland or England was it in Ireland I think it was in England I want to say was in London wasn't that the belt or London card I don't know but that Goddard thing's crazy yeah yeah I felt like that happened on on the East Coast too but I mean if that was one either way it's like he just keeps fucking up with this kind of stuff in and you know no one's saying get rid of him he's just he's worth so much money it's really fascinating what I was saying is imagine if Rey Borg and him switch sides if rape who showed up with all his boys and was screaming and yelling and threw a dolly at the wisdom deal it's done yeah rape all daily what Paul daily must be at home going that we just can't do you know sorry until you get to that stratosphere yeah that Conor McGregor it's like there's so much money to be made that's the problem it's like the rules get bent Paul Paul Daley was did was throw a punch as he will Josh Koscheck after it didn't even connect yeah actually been sorted out yeah and you even had guys like like will Brooks kind of got the hammer put down on him didn't he after he got knocked out and then pushed the ref I think that was that well Brooks I don't know you looking at me funny on I'm thinking right it was somebody you know he got knocked out and then pushed the ref right after and it's like they put a lot on I know it wasn't well books I'm sorry it was a mmm I know who you talking about god damn it who was that kill me sorry yeah but you know and they held them against him and he was concussed you know you know you barely know where you at that's what it was yeah see a fighter - he's a very good fighter yeah and what people don't understand is that once you get knocked out then you come back you really don't know what happened you're really out of it yeah who knocked him out who thought it was dos Anjos right yeah yeah was dos Anjos so Los Angeles Walter wait debut right no 555 Julia yeah but again he was a great fighter on me it's just certain things that uh we just can't do Joey meaning people of colors no boy do I think it's people with that east there's a level to the game where you are so valuable yeah that you like if Connor McGregor does a pay-per-view fight especially if they do you heard all that crazy nonsense they're gonna do with McGregor like no shoes and you can clinch but no kicks and no takedowns no some if they ever did that they're gonna do just printing money yeah I mean water percent what's so hard for them to not take that money but I mean and I don't hold that against I mean I always said that about the UFC do you see about the green and I understand that in this that's kind of where I'm coming from it from but you know it's just consistency yeah well you I think you just have to realize as a as a as a black man in America really like there's two ways to approach the situation you need to be the victim or you can just say it is what it is that some circumstances you know I people just don't support other black people the way to Irish support the Irish the Russians support I mean I'm just being real with you that's reality as white people in America don't support white Americans away the Irish support Conor nobody does 100% I mean it's an American thing I mean for you in Vegas when he was fighting when he was fighting Mayweather did you see the fuckin the people that were in Mandalay Bay which wasn't even where though oh yeah it was taking place the entire place was flooded with people singing together at when he fought Dustin Poirier at 178 they kept me up all I was on the undercard of that fight it kept me up all fucking nigga in the MGM yeah they were running up and down the halls of the MGM Lee yeah the security couldn't stop him I mean the crazy day rapidly but that's that's what's gonna I mean obviously he got a great performances on top of it or sure but that definitely helps you know I mean yeah when your first fight in the UFC debut is in Boston Nick going crazy for you like that yeah you just don't see that much in a in a said really you talk about Floyd Mayweather really how Floyd got big like that is he had to go against the Mexicans and you know he had to get them to really hate him right in order to get be exactly yes but it's also his style whereas Conor style is very different cuz he knocks guys dead it's a different style you know like member when Tyson was in his prime you knew no one was gonna beat them it was just you were waiting to see the executions where you were just a little boy at the time yeah my pops was a huge 92 yeah see Jesus Christ Mike I'm a huge boxing fan so you know I go back Larry a huge box fan yeah just so does the UFC actually so that's great year after you were born it started yeah man but the the Tyson days he was the biggest paper he draw but it was really just you were watching an execution and if there was also like people were thinking like man is this can be worth it how long is this one gonna last but but he's still but he still he was he had to be the villain a little bit you know and that's the every and it I mean it sucks to say it's just like every real big black fighter is usually the villain you know and that that's what Eddie Johnson was not but that's not America he's at me he's British yeah different you know he's holy Africa so lead over there yeah it's a totally different atmosphere and I mean this was last time we had a really loved african-american fighter in America I mean they're out there I mean for short people Jones people love Muhammad Ali after you know but even broad shit for being cocky well for sure you know because he was so dominant but that's the culture though you gotta be cocky you gotta be you gotta be all those things like I even the way I I talk a lot of shit but that's just yeah that's just cuz that's the culture like that's what I do I mean this well it's also an effective mind like mind game strategy like a guy who's talking shit to you it makes you more anxious more nervous more emotions more everything certain guys you know there's certain guys that you can play that to like I said everybody's got like those three categories you know you with athletes especially athletes and competitors and you know they kind of you know get more shooken up by stuff like if I'm a fighter you know you talk shit than ideas you know fucking love it he likes it more me I like it a little bit more Conor you could tell he likes it a little bit more it gets my mind off the actual fight itself because that's what we grew up like talking shit you know so it's some guys though it rattles them you know the best I've ever seen the best response to someone shit talking rose namajunas yeah yeah yeah she's a full dark masterful she went like yeah like a month I'm a huge rolls fair she's so yeah she's dope he might be the best looking girl in the UFC and she shaves her fucking head never wears makeup she's give a fuck yeah yeah I mean it's crazy yeah and she's a mean and a phenomenal phenomenal fighter phenomenal yeah I mean it's just when she was standing in front of Johanna and she was citing the Lord's Prayer gangster you want them to get you and the boogieman light that's what the thing with uh you know people look at my style even of the way I promote it and all in the talk fights and you know talk shit or whatever but there's so many ways to do it you know there's so many ways to like entertain and hit have fun with it you don't always have to be almost smack the shit out of your mama and all that's right you know it's there's so many different ways you get you can not say anything it become off just as fucking gangsta is right you know the dude this screaming from across the room but there is a pressure right isn't there pressure on fighters to sell and hype fights to talk a lot of shit I mean you see and Kobe Cummington taking it off the deep end he goes he goes so crazy I don't think things let him go to Brazil like when I heard that he was gonna fight dos anjos in Brazil like no Kobe yeah I was thinking of reaching out and telling people like to call it bring your own water whatever you took me I guess he doing his thing he he still went in fights yeah so at the end of the day yeah that's what really matters is that he's won his fights but yeah I mean that's all about him he's got us talking hey yeah that - no dad - but that style on me is I should get played out and you could just you could just tell it when it when it's forced is not good you know I mean well he just goes he goes against people he doesn't have to like he was talking some shit about Jon Jones yeah like Jon Jones will smack you in your fucking face and there's not much you're gonna be able to do about it one day you might be in front of him and and what are you gonna do you know I mean just you'd not even fight in John Jones why talking shit about John yeah I don't make any sense I don't know a couple people even even females like he started I mean I guess he's he's just trying to get the noise running whatever I just think of so many different ways to do it that's that's like the most primitive way of you know kind of trying to sell yourself and sell a fight it's like there's so many ways like even me like I came up with a lot of to show that that I started doing I just like kind of came up with you know in the moment yeah just well before the the book the first big one was the Mike Piazza thing you know where I kind of hit him at the press conference but going into that mom my mindset wasn't like oh let me you know talk as much shit as I can about him you know or let me you know jump up and down and all this you know it just was I did have that I wanted to stand out not necessarily I want to entertain I just was like I want I want to stayed up sitting behind funny John Jones and Daniel Cormier I like I'm like a kid in the candy store you know like so I just I wanted to stand out as much as possible you know and do you feel like now that I've had a few these big fights right the chiesa fight was a high-profile fight and then of course the Tony if I was a very high-profile and then this last barboza fight was a real big fight do you feel like now you've like settled more into the fact that not only do you belong here you deserve to be here but you're more comfortable being here yeah there's a there's that saying like the fake it till you make it right like for real like that's not faking it like when did you feel like you would never really fake in it because you were winning fights I exaggerated it you know like I exaggerated like I was having fun with it but I was kind of learning on the job too because like doing interviews and stuff like that it takes some it's it's hard to get to your level like you very lightly I listen to your show all the time like you love it thank you but you are like very good at it you know and it takes a long time to do that I had to kind of learn on the job so yeah I would exaggerate a little bit too much here and there but uh the fake it till you make it thing like I think it's a lot of people and they like take it take it like negatively I'm all the time you know I always heard that not to get positive you know I read George st. Pierre's book and he talked about that a lot he texts me two days before this fight with Barbosa and he was talking about you know giving me some tips and pointers and all that but the last thing he said to me was you know you're gonna have that fear when you go before you go in there but once you get in there your body's just gonna turn on autopilot just fake it till you make it fake the confidence until you make it nothing that's how he approaches it interesting that's interesting what what it was is like I said going into that press conference especially I wanted to stand out and through the rest of my life in Detroit especially I was always taught like don't stand out as much as you can't like that's like I was like stay low keep moving chill if I keep your head now like that you know the folks business is them folks business you know you I always stayed on what I'm doing you know always kind of had a vision always had to go so it my opposite was to stand out so I had to kind of fake it till I and I'm not necessarily fake it till I make it fake it till I became it you know what I'm saying and I think it was right after the Tony fight where I was like maybe the two months it took me to get over it at that moment I was like man I really like do have that confidence too you know I do have like I don't have to fake it you know what I'm saying the Tony fun the Tony fight I mean your your your podcasts too I mean your Park has been huge to me I mean this and it's it's hard for me to really explain it you know when me just growing up like I didn't have a lot of confidence you know like people see me and see me in interviews and they just think that just that's how it was but I would lose a lot of my wrestling matches as a kid just because I thought that and this might alienate alienate some people and it might sound like off but it's just the way I grew up is the white boys above eight mile you know they got the money that they're working harder than you they're better than you so that was kind of like my mentality kind of even when I start wrestling it like these kids start wrestling here five I started when I was 16 and they just would beat me and then be like I couldn't even I wouldn't even really compete with them you know it took me to go to college be because I that was my first real exposure to white people like obviously new white people would never think it you know we the teachers and stuff you know but nobody around my same age you know what I'm saying so when I got around in there there's one school in particulars Detroit Catholic Central they were number one school in in Michigan at the time but they were so in Detroit every model is numbered I was born and raised pretty much on seven mile eight model is like the divider between the suburbs and the city these kids were like on 26 mile so they were like way like with you know rich rich soil so I just I don't know for some reason I just didn't have that confidence but when I got around them and I started living and kind of training together every day and I realized I'm like we all the same you know like he works as just as hard as like I can see him every day you know he's I see him going it's a class and I see him going through his Allison it that moment gave me the confidence to be like okay I can't compete with them with with other people you know I can't compete with right anybody really your podcast was like the next step to that you know that was me at like the collegiate level you have the first podcast I heard from you was the Lance Armstrong one and I was like this is like world level you know and when I hear I'm talking I never talked so candidly and I'm like oh he's just a normal dude you know I mean just yeah I guess in my head I didn't have that before you know and it's like we all the same and that really has allowed me to to go over to Ireland and compete to go down to Brazil and compete to fight the best kickboxer in the world and not had that and still had that same confidence you know what I'm saying I see what you're saying like you're just hearing people talk and realizing that they're we're all just human yeah yeah and all the same you see some superstar and whatever whatever their field is whether it's a musician or whatever you just assume that person has got to be like a different thing than you like this you know if you see Mick Jagger or something like that it's gotta be a different thing than me yes he's not the same thing as me yeah and and the thing with and I started that hashtag like 25 of life and all that being mostly because the way I grew up I didn't get to see many successful people you know I'm saying I didn't write it it's it nobody ever told me oh you can't do this you know I'm saying but nobody ever told me I could either and nobody showed you other people that were doing it right around you where you could learn from them I had no examples you know the only examples literally only examples I had was was the dope man you know the the jack boys you know the the pimps and you know you didn't really have much else to really look forward to so when I was I thought when I was 25 like bring him now I thought for sure I'm just gonna be in jail like that is that that's one of the most important points when people talk about people being able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and they should just get a job and they should just do this like you say that because you grew up around them yeah but if you didn't grow up around anybody doing that like you're feeling that you feeling the way you felt when you around wrestlers that have been competing their whole lives you didn't feel like you belong there you didn't have any of that success around you that's that is one of the most important things in life is surrounding yourself with positive people that's so difficult to do if you're in a bad place if you grew up in a bad neighborhood and you're surrounded by bad people very few people have the vision to see past that and you they have no examples yeah I mean you see someone on television again you're gonna think that's not me yeah I still to this day when I meet a rock star I still get worried about I still get weirded out doesn't matter how famous you get weirded out around other famous people they just don't seem like you yeah you know and especially when you kind of grow up in that environment and you know is you don't really you know you see a doctor on TV and you don't you just don't connect with it you know and there's at least for me like that's what I wanted to be I wanted to be a doctor first but I didn't you know I didn't live in neighborhoods we talked there so you know I didn't be the doctor when that did he was like some old dude and it's like he didn't really give a fuck like he's like you know your mother you know your Medicaid motherfucking like you know take your 35 bucks fuck off but you know yeah I think that is a big point of it it's just to have somebody to tell you that you can you know right so at least I tried and then to see people around you that are working hard that are doing succeeding and emulate them and and learn from them yeah people we don't exist in a vacuum we exist in communities and that's this is something that it's very difficult to people for people to understand if they're in a good community if you're in a good community or if you're in a bad community it's difficult to understand to the value of a good community 100% I think one of the biggest things is just that integration is like really important like and I'm starting to see that the more I'm getting out and kind of seeing the world and seeing the Hawaii things run and kind of comparing that to the way I grew up and it's just like there was no there's so much it seemed so segregated to me which is a weird term to use and in this day and night you know but it just did like literally the I remember because my mom she did a good job of keeping us in good schools you know so our school was on ten mile which was in the suburbs I went to South feel hot I remember a couple of times me and my brother we were trying to walk to the school so you had to walk pass through eight mile and policemen had pulled over three or four times picked us up in the car and took us back across and then dropped us off it's like you don't and it's like we go to school there you know what I mean like didn't believe you it's like we you know if we weren't also like the best looking kids probably but you know but I feel like that integration if it's just it's just really really important and I'm starting to see that the more I'm getting out and learned in the world is you know we all the same little girl all the same all the same yeah like in for sure but we're all just people you know and and sometimes having all those advantages when you're young is a disadvantage because the hungriest most determined people are the people that had nothing at one point in their life when they understand what nothing means yeah yeah and I mean and I think I tribute that to a lot of my success and that's what I always keep in the back of my head you know is especially going through college like such a rough like you know 20 bucks a week I survived all fuss and I was I was fighting full-time I was you know taking 15 credits I was wrestling still at the same time like and I just just on the hustle move super grind yeah super grind put nothing like you know I had like a 1996 thunderbird with like 300,000 miles and I was burning that shit oh yeah every day but I keep that in the back of my head even now like I don't I don't ever get comfortable I'll never get content what I think about that with having kids cuz I have young kids and I think my kids have never known like that kind of financial struggle like I think financial struggle in particular something that just to this day I still think about being broke and it's just it it motivates me like I'll I'll never slack off yeah is that I just I think if you haven't but also like when you have kids you don't want your kids to struggle it's like I to all my friends that are interesting all I've fucked up lives all of them everything went crazy everyone was fucking abused or someone was an asshole they're alcoholics or drug addicts and their family yeah yeah and they use it as motivation to learn the world and learn things and that's what I kind of did as a kid I I kind of took a look around when I was maybe 15 was probably like the the time that really clicked for me when I found MMA and I and I kind of saw that this is what I want to do that's when they kind of clicked I just like I don't want to be around like like the rest of these motherfuckers here how did you get started would you would you find a good gym so when I was 15 I just I saw a George st. Pierre and BJ Penn was the first time I'd seen a fight and you know there was no MMA you know gyms or anything like that I just went out for the wrestling team at the high school because I was already there and all that so I didn't start really getting into MMA until I came back from collar one year from college and I wanted to sign up for a Jiu Jitsu tournament and I never trained it or anything I went and signed up for the Jiu Jitsu tournament and the guys like oh yeah we did some fights on on the juicer most son it was like we do some fights on Saturday and there's nobody at you know for this fight that motherfucker right now like I never trade before I just wrestle so I was like yeah please say it was like Tuesday 18 yeah I just showed up you know no mouthpiece no I didn't know you needed a mouthpiece or cup or anything I didn't have a car yeah the dude I fought was like 26 and I wouldn't well they went to Walmart as I as I'm getting ready to step into the odd they got it I was like where's your mom piece and cup I'm like what like you know I prepare for a wrestling match I guess and they ran to Walmart grab me one I beat the fuck out did you have any striking at all would I follow TV I didn't really have it's a real training until I got into the until I got over to I mean I I trained hard with one of my coaches I Sean did say he was my first true coach and in Michigan and we trained hard and he showed me a lot of things he was a boxer so he showed me a lot of things but I didn't really have a real you know I'm still a full time student when I got the call from the UFC you know I got the call in like December and finals I got the call like finals week and I was like well shit let me let me go ahead bust out these finals and then you know I'm done with this shit and then the fight was like late January I think or so so yeah so I was like a full-time student when I took the was taking 15 credits as a med student so you really only had like a couple of years of striking at that point yeah yeah if that yeah and you know a lot of wrestling and a lot of you know I didn't really get it really good into striking it so I got over to Vegas and work with Julie Cooper that makes it even more impressive man you know that you've been able to make such a big leap in such a short amount of time I mean that's we're talking about like seven years that I mean that's really that's really crazy consistency I think consistency is the key like I loved actually I love this shit like I got the most fights in the lightweight division since my debut there anybody else and it's just because I stay consistent I keep my body healthy I keep showing up and you know the more you see things coming at you the the better I get you know that's definitely a factor but I think it's also intelligence the the understanding of your also like there's there's different kinds of intelligence - and there's intelligence of like how to get good things and some people just I don't know if it's a physical thing if their body works better or if it's just that they are able to see how someone does something and listen to instruction and then break it down and put it together but I've seen in little kids man when I used to teach little kids there was little kids that weren't even like physically talents all I think they were gymnasts they can do backflips and shit they did you crazy shit with their body there's some kids where you would show them like see this foot this foot it's got pivot and then you're it's all about your hips and they would see you and they would go okay and then you would see them breaking it down and then other kids fucking they just couldn't see what you were doing yeah they're throw their feet up in there their foot would never pivot they put all this pressure on the knee like woah don't don't do that don't do that you got to turn your hips your foots got to go with it and then some people just could mirror you it's getting jiu jitsu - yeah yeah for sure big time up in jiu-jitsu in and grappling especially you know wrestling it they just see it I think it's I think it's come like you say it's an intelligence yes you know there's people think it's just a brute nothing that you're doing but it's it's it's very you know at least from me like I approach it kind of like a science it's almost as a me CDE you know hey I go from here if if not that I branch off I have different systems for every kind of a situation that will arise but I kind of approach it like a scientist like I went to school of a Bioman like that kind of stuff interests me you know what I mean like there's art to it there's a there's a huge huge portion of it that's our expression yeah the expression part is art and I think it's one curious art forms fighting this or that there is you know and if someone looks great doing it that is like a form of art a 100 percent 100% I think it's I guess so irritate it whenever somebody says it's not their IQ solely you're like did you see belt or when Gaston bolaños landed that insane spinning elbows like one of the greatest spinning elbows of all table bleep rather you watch that shit about 80 times I just play it back like I'm watching a flower bloom watch a fucking eagle soar it's just but yes he lands us he just the dudes coming out of me steps and Bosch is that the / - just faceplant like that shit is just art that's art but even when you see like a really really high level fighter move around every one of our bodies moves differently you know every at work you know yeah you you you go back to you know being able to see somebody and emulate it but you still will put your own style on it you still put your nobody moves the same you know and I think that's what makes it a pure art form and I think MMA is more so even than boxing because in boxing I only got two hands it's a science you know it's the sweet science there's only so many combinations that you can even put together that but when you when you talk about something that's you know without limit then there's so much art that goes into it's like dance it's like it's like yoga it's like all these things that are really the true is for my art I think yeah I couldn't agree more you know and that's why I was mad at Meryl Streep yeah anything about mixed martial arts not the art they are the arts 100% they are and I think the most purest form of it - what else do you call arts if not that not something to understand what it is and one of the things that they don't understand is that it's so difficult to do and that you're you when you see the finished product when the person steps into the cage it competes that night you're not just seeing these brutish moves you're seeing their soul you're seeing how much focus where they are as a human in their life at this point where's the vitality of their body what what kind of martial arts education if they gotten how technically aware then how much did they think about the training did they if they're a wrestler did they only concentrate on the wrestling do they stay away from striking because they don't like getting hit and if they're a striker did they only concentrate on staying up or did they learn how to fight on the ground they absorb at all did they develop a full repertoire of expression with their body throwing bones and choking each other I mean and at the same time going through life through the whole situation you know he's got it that's the hardest part like at the end of the day I'm still a 25 year old here like I was feeling like learning shit and try it together yeah yeah like everybody else so and you know I feel like that when you're 80 man look at these 80 year old people who say well that guy should never shit the other fucking guys better today than it was yesterday if I paying attention I think they ought to go back and I think that's what it is to it at the core of it I always think that everybody else has their shit together just so everybody knows childhood 100% I think I have the same problem I think everybody has their shit together and everybody can see that I don't right like if they can see my flaws and it keeps me sharp though yeah like and it translates to fighting too it's like if my hand calls here for a split second I feel like the guy can see it you know enemy or when I throw something I mean I feel like he's gonna be there to block it or you know it's the best way it makes me stay sharp but uh it's it goes that from sometimes outside of life to you know well it's good that you think like this because clearly you're a very confident guy and you're obviously successful in your mixed martial arts career but to have just a little bit of that insecurity is fuel it's just like it keeps you sharp it keeps you aware you know like to be confident is good to be delusional is terrible yeah 100% terrible yeah everybody knows that one guy that thinks he can beat a guy that he's not ever gonna fucking be able to be yeah I mean there's a lot of people like give me that fight oh yeah yeah oh yeah that's why you don't see you know you never see me say somehow landed shit like oh I can't never be beat or you know or I'm all I can go out there and you know armbar Cain Velasquez you know or something I bet I'm not meaning to pick on it but I know yeah you know but I think you know the Ronda thing is there was a lot going on there man coaching wise there's a lot going on there what she just came along at a time when there was no one like her yeah you know and she was a real Olympic caliber athlete and her judo was at such a high level no one could fuck with yeah yeah initiated throwing people around until someone could fuck with her until she ran into someone like Holly Holm and then we really saw the holes in the preparation that actions the fact that she had you know movie deals going on they wanted her to do Roadhouse and she's scripts and this and agent meetings and all the bullshit man it's like fucking Hollywood it was like a Hollywood script yeah like this is what happens to you and this is how it look rocky when rocky went soft this is literally what happened and then all sudden you got this badass Holly Holm sitting there ready to fucking head kick you into another dimension and that's what happened and like you said I think I think most of it is just trying to stay aware and I get the delusional about it it is very easy to kind of slip into that and fall in today you know sometimes shit will hit you in that's what happened in my in my second fight that I lost to leonardo Santos and in in each fight I can always see myself losing you know and people ask me and they're like you talk about all this visualization that you do like sometimes I visualize myself getting hurt - in fights do you do that to see how you recover like how do you what do you do so it's not a new experience my barbells are functions been inhale kicks me like it's not a it's not something it's always the punch that don't hurt you then we worked you were texting before that fight and we were setting up this podcast you guys listen I just got a concentrate on making sure I do don't kick me in the head because because it has to be there that's the only fight that it wasn't there for me was Leonardo Santos because he was green a multiple time champion on the ground in jiu-jitsu so I was only really worried about his ground game I kind of just dismissed his his uh his stand up and I'm like it's no way this guy's gonna be me and the worst thing happened in the fight like the first minute he got me down and I caught all I got him off me in like 30 seconds or something after that I was like whoo there's about to be a cakewalk come buddies a run through this man like he don't you know I'm like it was 17,000 people in the arena I'm like we all just waiting on him to fall you know only him he was the only one who sought it he could clip me and I began but is how valuable was that fight for you I mean it was probably the one of the most important ones in my career I mean there's been a couple losses or I have always been the ones that I feel like I will look back and I say damn that was the one that really made it that fight in particular I think really made it because it it kind of drilled home some of the things that Robert follows was selling to me that's the only fight since I've been in Vegas well obviously since before this fight but that Robert Wallace wasn't in my corner and it was if I'm being honest it was save some money you know saved the 10% that he wasn't wanted in or whatever and I was like I'm gonna smoke this kill I got I'm like Rob just sit back you know you you watch it from all enjoy and I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna smoke this kid and I didn't have his voice of reason hmm to make me say this kid is dangerous everywhere you know what I mean stay sharp everywhere and I let my guard down and he hit me with a good punch but it was that one where I was like I never had Rob not in my corner or that voice you know and now I had to make do without it but you know no he was that voice oh yeah he was that but to go back he was just that voice of reason not to get delusional you know what I mean cuz because it is easy especially when you're young and you got though don't know hormones lining you feel like you to man like you know you covered it like shit I'm the man like you can't touch me but you gotta like have somebody like a bro bro you know you're very good but you still got to be sharp to these men that you fighting are very very good to do you think that sometimes someone can't tell it to you you just have to learn it yeah yeah yeah you gotta let those experiences and I think doesn't that's in all walks of everything you know and and that's kind of what I bring to a tool you like I don't want to just be just a great fighter you know I want to be great at everything like I want to be a chef and I want to be you know a dancer and I want to be a scientist a doctor or not like that's just the way my brain works I just want to be the best fucking everything yeah great way to think man that it's kind of interest on times but you know but uh you know no I disagree I need rushon the way you do anything is the way you do everything yeah well probably yeah yeah I mean I think I think there's something to that a few half-assed things me you can get away with being a great fighter and still half-ass things in your life but maybe you would be better if you didn't like maybe you would be even an even better fighter or better whatever you are but fucking tennis player whatever it is if you didn't half-ass other things in your life maybe you you would really reach your full potential 1% and I think that even even in the fighting realm you know that that's what a lot of this last fight was for me is getting back to making the fight first doing focusing on the fight before anything else and relieving some of the mental stress off me before I step into the when I stepped in for that Tony fight I was already tired I was already my body was already my brain was just overloaded and I was already broken down and you know I made the fight second or I made the fight last you know I put everything else before you know it we went race car driving the week on the fight and looking back on it out there I was like yeah do I think it's also important to have some recreation yeah yeah but you know that's that's it was too much a little too much it mostly cuz they were like filming and I wanted to make it good you know we had fun with it it all for like the countdown shows yeah yeah yeah yeah but you know shit how hard is that the press obligations and all the constant interviews and all that shit I enjoy it I enjoy them I honestly enjoy doing media for the most part is just you know uncertain it can be too much sometimes do they organize it around your training or you have to organize your training around media I usually organize it around my trainer and that's good yeah it's when when you hear that the training has to be organized around media obligations like oh yeah yeah that's not I mean maybe yeah I've heard of people having to get up at 6:00 in the morning and do a write a block of radio calls and share them yeah I don't like that yeah I don't like that shit yeah I mean I yet you had to do that but you know I still I just make do with it you know I mean I I think as long as you enjoying it and you just kind of go on with the flow is not a hindrance necessarily if you if you like fuck I want to fucking be your own one get up at 6:00 a.m. it's Reiter's shit you know then when you get to all I want to do is train the whole time you know as it could be a hinderance even more so right yeah I guess right like it's the way you approach something change like what that thing is yeah and it has got to be natural for you too you know I actually like like doing it so I think it's just something that you know if you if I can see myself if I forced it or if I you know was one of these guys that didn't at all then yeah I could see it being even a bigger hindrance but since I get it me it's fine just great well as long as it doesn't fuck with your training one of things I was really impressed about Saturday night is your endurance I mean you were you were fresh as a daisy even in the fifth round and that was a grueling pace you know and uh we didn't really focus too much on on too much conditioning you know I did a lot of long runs to kind of thin my muscles out a little bit I did a lot of like longer distant longer cardio stuff I kind of got away from like a lot of the explosiveness that I used to doing this yeah especially for the Tony fight Tony fight was all explosion it was all like big movement it was all like you know okay don't knock this motherfucker out for this fight and I realized like during them like you know I got approaches smarter mmm and and in that it actually became better cardio then me pushing myself too hard Brian what I'm saying yeah I'm you know I'm torn on that cuz I see guys preparing that way where they do a lot of long runs and you know that's a big Nate Diaz thing and his brother Nick and you know they do ultra marathons and triathlons and I feel like there's some real benefit to having that deep base and cardio what 100% but I mean is it's balanced now it's like anything else with life you know you gotta you got to be able to balance those really strong tough you know you can't explode every time you can sprint the whole time you can't run a marathon the whole time you know so I try my best to let I want to be as well-rounded as I possibly could be in having great cardio and understanding what that's like as part of that yeah it's it's hard for people to understand but you're not throwing a hundred percent of your power all the time you can't you can't yeah no you can't especially not with a guy like Barbosa who is in there the whole time there was some spots knock out on the hit and it's like guys normally will give up they'll quit or you know I mean with big shots and he's just steady showing the ref day I'm still in this thing I'm still moving and then he stands up and he can spin and we'll get you and you know you know he still got that explosiveness and uh you know you you can't go 100 percent right out the gate you you got to be can't be gotta be smarter you can't we're out we're gonna be smart yeah and and that's one of the things that Rob would always tell me and again that's one of the things I'm telling myself during the fight be smart be smart e Barbosa is also the I think the first guy and the only god stopped to people with leg kicks yeah yeah yeah vish is like yeah - yeah my shins on fire right now I checked a couple of over but did you bring in anybody that does wheel kicks or anything to get used to the timing of that yeah a couple guys a really good Taekwondo specialist and his name is I mean wit knows them flash shot off the flat and then uh he's probably the best at he's a little bit better than my balls and my brothers but no no I just on that not telegraphic portion of it because that's what really gets you hurt which Barboza's fiorina centella gravity but those Taekwondo guys they they can move a little bit different you know Chris Bank is another one that that uh like Willie brought out for for Wonder Boy because he's got that same style day that Taekwondo style of spinning is it's a little bit different I brought like three or four guys well it's the guy that when they when you train like that you're not throwing punches to the face so the kicks have to be ultra fast it's and there's also I think there's a there's is this is some benefit to learning like kyokushin for that and Taekwondo for that with when they take out those punches to the face there's something about leg dexterity those guys have crazy leg like Yair Rodriguez style like crazy leg dexterity yeah man yeah you're got the spar a couple of times before this last fight uh you know and he's another one of those I mean he he's got that same type of style and I steal a lot from those guys I kind of started picking it up when I fought a kid named James Montessori he's very good he was a champion yeah yeah for Korea but I mean he's just super underrated especially his kicking oh yeah but prepare for that fight I had to work with a lot of Taekwondo guys and right off the back I'm like oh this is a different style like it's it's like four different four or five different styles of kicking I think theirs is like wanted a better mixes of speed and power and non telegraphic and I try to blend that a little bit more with Muay Thai yeah and find the best style wow I feel like Muay Thai is absolutely the best but there's some shit that those Taekwondo guys can do that'll catch you off guard and if you know those other things you can do those things yeah one person like the wheel kicks it and that's what you see with that yeah I mean that the Thai style has that probably the hardest kicks and the most technical from it but you know you can kind of see some of them coming you know you can see unless you got a freak speed like like Barbosa you know but actually technical wise you know you can kind of see you coming a little bit more he was a tire is more effective because it's just more effective this chopping the legs it's just brutally effective and obviously in Taekwondo there's none of that yeah so those guys wouldn't if if you were seen like matches we're talking with no guys fight Muay Thai guys they get affiliated yeah you know rated for sure if you allow the Muay Thai guy to kick the legs the Taekwondo guys just really don't know what to do yeah it's good once they learn it then they have the Taekwondo too but it's a matter of whether or not like we were talking about before like if you're a wrestler do you really learn how to strike and you just try to take everybody by them right you know it's if the Taekwondo guys really learn how to check leg kicks they already know how to kick yeah they'll be able to pick up the thai style way quicker than the Thai guys are gonna be able to do jumping wheel kicks and shit like that that stuff is already ingrained in their wheelhouse it's in their synapses they know what to do yeah and that's that I think that's one of the things the beauties about MMA be as such a young sport is you know you still seeing guys evolve it yeah and and you know like it like me I'm trying to take that the best of those styles and make them great for MMA you know because they're certain you know you can't chop down a leg if a guy's trying to take you down you know but you can still chop the leg but there's certain ways that you can change that up and that's one of the beauties about the sport being so young is still finger now people ask me I said right next to an aerial show I said right next to to Demetrius Johnson and they asked me who's the best pound-for-pound fighter and you know I think people like expected me to say me or something or say DJ and I honestly don't think that he's been seen yet you know I think he's still like a 16 year old kid out there somewhere that's gonna find the best guy out there really yeah yeah really you don't think Demetrius is the best guy no I didn't meet you I mean the Demetrius does I mean he's great he does a lot of things but he gets away with a lot of stuff that he does because the guys that he's going against our 25 pounders you know they don't have a whole lot of explosive want punch power to really make you pay for some of the mistakes you know that like it's part especially as far as like the hop switching and stuff you know that's why I got like like TJ can get away with a lot more at 35 I think then a 55 pound fighter would you know TJ cruise a lot of those 30 fibers that can catch style leave an opening the consequences can be so much more devastating because they hit so much harder yeah I mean your legs are your shock absorbers you know if we if we not get the one with the leg or the Shockers or if your legs are in the air while you get hit by somebody that's explosive like that you going night-night you know the only thing that's eating all the the shock of your brain I bet Duane Ludwig would disagree with you if you sat down and talked to him because I think the idea is to present a very complex target and to overload the brain with possibilities I feel that you know and I not try and do that too I try and uh you know I've taken Duane's a couple too many seminars actually and he's a wizard yeah yeah he comes over to Xtreme Couture and does yeah some things so what you know I like your style shout out to Duane lovely yeah I love Duane stylin it's just a different style to be had but I feel like that's not even there's still not the best stop you know I don't think the best style has been Demetrius Johnson has a great style but I don't think it's the best style is yet hmm especially firma but out of what you've seen he's got the best I'll yeah I mean everybody's different what everybody's different you know the argument is Hammond John Jones the two are elements and I feel like John Jones as far as the level of talent no question John's faced for Shogun DC twice Gustafson I mean yeah Vitor Belfort I mean Jesus Christ you just keep going and going and going and going go over to share ya know he's got he's got the resume but I don't know I think I think George st. Pierre right steel you know George is a little bit you know behind the times now a little bit do you think so a little bit man fight I would never say that yeah yeah but but you know Bisbing is also from the same era I think um I think George George st. Pierre for sure I think is the the greatest fighter there's been I mean when you look at the resumes I don't think nobody else compares really you know he's got two losses to bench both those losses and devastatingly you know came back after four years and won the title at a higher weight class and he's never really been in too much trouble in a fight you know I look at this now he's one of those guys he's one of the very first guys he's really what got me into the sport because I saw his fight with BJ and I just I could see it I'm like of this guy is you know he's smart he's approaching it smart like a true athlete you know like a true artist let you athlean and there's they're people that do it too you know the Demetrius does too but I just don't think to the level that George does well again it's the level of competition that he faced I mean George George faced some seriously stiff competition not that Dimitri's didn't mean he fought Dominick Cruz he's fought some tough because I was really looking forward to demetrius versus TJ yeah I know they were trying to put that together but that would have been to one it still might be the one they might still do it I mean if TJ can defeat Cody or even if he doesn't and if he decides to go down to 25 he can make it he says yeah he says he can make it yeah I think he can and I think he can give some real problems following this fight of his life 100 for Shore I mean he's fast he hits hard he knocks guys out at 35 what the fuck is he gonna do to people at 25 he can if his body will stay healthy with that weight cut you know and you know as good as anybody that that's very difficult to do because you just feel weaker yeah yeah I mean that there's that I know the guys that he that he trains down in South California with the training lab and that man approaches it like a scientist for real he I think he's a mathematician over at UC Berkeley I want a genius guy i sat down with him for about we talked for maybe about five six hours it was mostly him just talking it me just sitting there absorbing all that shit that he could tell me about you know exactly he I mean he measures those guys to a tee so if he feels like who's training with him bill Shaw and the strength and conditioning yeah Sam called Kyle Vito if I'm saying that right Sam Kelby you don't down a training lab okay brilliant brilliant man he's he's one of the very few guys that that I think an MMA especially that really he trained a lot of he trains David Taylor a lot of the the US Olympic wrestling team mmm he worked with those guys for a long time it what you seen so I'm gonna add scientists get into the game now right when you realize and there's real money in it and this man is what 5556 does those Iron Man's you know where you got a like I think it's like something crazy like bike 120 miles and then you swim 20 miles and then you run a full marathon and he's doing it like 53 54 years old I'm like god I went over and trained with him before and he is his something is another level of like strength the condition is so if he says he can get TJ down to 225 I mean I would I would think he could do it and if he's confident in it then he could do it right Whaley well I spoke to TJ he was 100% confident that he can make the way and just well you got also realized DJ Demetrius just got shoulder surgery yeah so he's still rehab and from that you know and who knows how long that's gonna take I don't know how complex this shoulder surgery was but yeah so that's you know still interested in that fighting I mean yes it's a big one for for Demetrius Johnson especially you know he needs that extra little push over you know how Shawn getting some tips and tricks when we was doing the media tours together for you know not necessarily the talk shit but you know cuz he's not gonna be able to come out and just talk shit you know he's got a style it's not his style it don't work it's you know but to round out his game a little bit more let's say that because because and i'ma go back to the most well-rounded fighter you got to be able to promote too you know you got to be able to see people want to want to see you fight - right and that thing is a stress it's a stressor on you and you on your your training like you said you got to get up at 6 a.m. because when you do it you get more media requests so you get you get to have those interviews more and that's a stress and it's something that you Baron that your opponent don't necessarily have to you know a guy like Connor does a lot more media than than his opponent do of course it's a bigger stress and you know if you can handle all those stresses and still go out there and compete then if you shy away from that I got to take that away from you as far as being the best powerful fighter you know what I mean that's interesting but if it's not Demetrius and who the fuck is it other than George and George isn't really fighting it Jones it's for sure Jojo you know I think George is not really fighting right now either are you saying right right now when the sport was hard because John I mean it's up there I don't I don't think John took peds and people give me a hard time about that I don't think he did I think he took something tainted just based on what you sada has said about the levels pre and post-tests I think he fucked up and to somebody up man man I was rueful too that money but he can still he could still come back and be much bigger you know I'd like to say controversy especially now question when you black in America controversy is is one of the best things that can happen till you really well John when he's loose when you know like wouldn't him and Daniel were in that press conference and Danny was talking shit he goes I beat you after I did cocaine yeah when John's just himself I mean he's huge he's he's gonna be the biggest he could already been the biggest star view just from the beginning if they don't really suspend him for very long because back within a few months yeah it's entirely possible that he could come back you know and be the biggest still of all time I think he's gonna be way bigger especially after like I said controversy is a great one when you black in America they really well it's not just that it's like for John like how much how much more focus will they mean my fear is that he's going to somehow another sabotage again and that that this is not just this that these lessons aren't sinking in because there's been so many of them the car accident where the you know broke the lady's arm she's pregnant he runs away and then they slamming the car into the tree there was so many and then there's you know the first test positive and the second test positive like fuck the brawl the press conference fuck it's like there's so many things I think that goes back to you know how being delusional having the right team around you and something that you really listen to that's that you really truly listen to you know not just somebody that you just kind of alright yeah I hear you because it's easy to get that way it really is I'm sure like it I've approached it a couple of times you know you get that especially when you got that confidence in the thing that made you great in the first place it can be like a hindrance to you to you know and I think a lot of it has been or at least a lot of my growth in the past couple months has been me getting in my own head and understanding it and and kind of breaking it down you know smoking we help thank god it's legal now yeah I didn't start until after my loss to Kenard oh really yeah the first time that I did it but honestly it was probably like the best thing that you know because I was angry and the fight I was angry at everything you know there I was like coconut you know this guy I was like a ten to one favorite one at that fight that was the one fight with that I never saw much don't you smoke him so I just had this anger and the only way I saw my dad can idea what it was was alcohol so I kind of turned to that and you know that she's no good it's really it's the worst way to do it worst way to do it it just makes the delusions bigger you know what I'm saying it just makes you angry you're in and it just it just kind of compounded everything but honestly like what else what we it was like because that that wasn't like you know I had tuned it out for so long because that's what folks did that I kind of associated with being lazy and not successful in you know these fucking me - no yeah you know I don't wanna be's niggas on a corner right right like but when I did it it kind of opened up the anger towards myself you know I mean it kind of opened up my mom for the first time and I think that actually did have a lot of help with it you know I know I don't like chronic or nothing but you know I know what you're saying yeah I think that's what people are afraid of with it - is that paranoia I always say paranoia is just you looking at things realistic yeah yeah and even the possibilities of things happening realistically means some people for sure if they have tendencies to be schizophrenic in particular and then they smoke a lot of weed it could spiral them like anything else but it's not a good idea yeah do it too much of any one thing is not a good idea please as a way you have to you have to be able to balance you know I mean you can't just fucking sit on the couch all day but I'm glad that you're saying that there's a real benefit to it too there's some there's a benefit to it mentally in exposing that vulnerability and just making you aware of who you really are like maybe to other people yeah we all especially men I think we puff our chests up and we like to look at ourselves as maybe better than we really are because it's it's it's like a shield that you're like a false confident shield that you put up to protect yourself from your vulnerability but marijuana says not gonna fuck that won't just look at whatever the fuck you're vulnerable and stop doing that stupid like this is this is your problem this is what you're scared of really shit the weeds right yeah it can help you yeah and it kind of like that especially after that fight I remember it that really made me that really helped me to get over and not just get over it but to understand it and understand what I was doing because again you just don't you know you get that conformal maybe it's testosterone you'd ever get yeah puppies don't you know you don't give a fuck that's the part of it for sure you know it's just it's also think about what you're doing for a living man it's the most one of the most risky propositions you could do as a human being outside of war that that - that - and I and I took that into you know you you obviously you take that into consideration when you when you start doing something like this yeah I'd taken it to consideration every fight you know one slight one slip-up you could be you know bad news sure mom jury could take you out forever you know especially when they you was and when I was in my situation even when I was signing with the UFC it was like okay do I go and try be a doctor and you know or you know I was I was going in the biomat so I was like I was really that seemed more secure you know what I mean that seemed more like attainable easier or do I like like throw caution to the wind and you know at the time when I was 18 or 19 uh no I guess I'm yeah 19 you know that was like a hard you know Sam one of those ones it was hard for me to make but it turned out well I guess well it's you know you're gonna have more than one interest to that's also part of the problem there's probably there's a lot of people out there that like doing different things and you know you know you might be leaning more towards one than the other and you just gotta kind of soul search and nobody could answer that other than you that's why it's terrible when people tell people what to do yeah when people tell people what you need to do is get a good job or you need to you know go with something that's gonna be safe go with what's attainable go with that you know like man that's not right well nobody's different 100% I think that's the best I mean to go back just a Rob that's that's what he did so well he didn't he didn't tell me what to do he just showed me the truth no no you know I mean he just he was that voice am i it was like the conscious and I mean and it hit your show too like you do a good you do a great job of it and I mean I know you've heard it before like but you just are very truthful in what you say and instead of being like preachy because nobody listens to fucking preachy you know I mean rich is usually well I try not to be but sometimes it comes off ya be sound preachy if you don't know me but it's just honest yeah and that you know there's what you say about Robert when one of the most important things about it is that he shows you he's just showing you and you could trust him you know those those two things are very important someone who just show you things show you what's wrong showing and that you can trust he's not bullshitting you when as soon as you think that someone is bullshitting you or bullshitting themselves or being dilute you're like fuck man I can't because they might have good information about other things that's a real problem when someone's an idiot but also a genius like that that exists there's people out there and those people you get some fucking puzzle the other go okay how much of this do what he's saying is stupid and how much of what he's saying is genius and sometimes it's a weird mixture leonis i think that's one of the things that I'm learning especially as I'm kind of going forward and because you may get to meet so many people and so many people want to be a friend all of a sudden it's so me people everybody's got they want to tell you how to do your job like everybody want to tell me how to fight and everybody want to tell me like what to do and but some people really know what you're talking about actually though so you have to be able to you know I think you got to find that yellow bullshit meter in there and kind of pick it apart for me rob was that and you know he but the shit that he still says is is you know you mean you get information on how to fight from your yoga instructor she could say something you and that one thing oh yeah I had a girl named Yuko a little Japanese girl that was giving me privates and in yoga but the way she broke it down was like anatomy she knew the exact you know position that I was here instead of being here where I was losing my balance or I was losing some power or it was putting more strain on one area the other and making it harder and I'm just like this translate so well you know even when I do ballet it's like you know I can see when I'm off balance when I'm you know as I'm one of the things in in ballets as you spinning you know keep your eyes on there so you don't get dizzy so even when Purple's and kicked me I just made sure I saw four of them but I'm like let me keep my eyes on this motherfucker like he's like stay out of it but it all it all translate cuz it's all the human body it's all the same thing you know it's just different ways of expressing the way your body moves and what it does but it's the same shit it says it's only one it's like a giant computer and I would think that learning all these different ways to move would just enhance your overall understanding of how your body works yeah yeah and it makes you I think it like makes you more in tune with it too you know what I make it healthy you know that's one of the biggest keys I think it's just being as healthy as as possible and not you know tampering with that too much for sure and also flexibility I think having flexibility is so important they are a fighter you know being able to move your body like there's some people that just aren't flexible they just can't move in certain ways and you know I can tell from watching you throw head kicks in that fight like you're flexible yeah you don't have a lot of tension in your legs when you're doing that yeah I think tension is that is that is like the perfect word for really because that's what causes you to tighten - yeah like when you got one of guys it's difficult for him to throw a body kick and you see him kind of like lean and then you see yeah struck that I love Dan Henderson big family shit but it's the way you know whereas some people throw head kicks and you don't even see it coming yeah yeah I mean and also lean and grappling - you know you have to be able to have strength I think in every direction yeah that's one of the biggest reason why I don't live Waits's because you get so used to in the one uniform direction you have to be able to move I have to be just as strong here as I am Here I am there so do you get all your resistance from just grappling or from these these calisthenics and plyometrics and different grappling a lot you know yeah just pick guys up and put them down so that concessive you know there's a lot of body weight to so that's 100 percent exercise yeah now did they concentrate on like specific core exercises or you know do you do you have days where you concentrate on just using your legs or yeah different different days dependent uh we do we do do a lot of core stuff especially recently probably at the last year so we've been doing a lot more with the core legs is a huge one you know your legs carry usually much the whole way here on pills yeah yeah I mean I live in Henderson so it's like you know right a lot of hills but uh the legs is one of the biggest just even my movement like the way you move - a lot of times I notice how Abby - you know up on my the balls on my feet or I'll be too flat on all my heels so let's you know I think that came from wrestling a little bit the breast stances are different um but it's just rounding out me as a individual he's gonna round out me as a fighter which is just gonna make it bigger do you watch fights outside of MMA do you watch kickbox yeah what do you like to watch you love them I mean I watch a lot of the big box and fights especially barely I only got to see like little clips and pieces of the Broner and I was paying more attention to his arguments with its rapper kid that's entertaining this the week of the fight talking shit on Instagram I think they was just doing a thing making it mega media I think is bullshit because he came out to six nines song and his six nine kind of like shouted it out for your Broner came out two six nine song yeah game up to the saw it during the fight I haven't seen the video yet I gotta go back and go on going six nights Instagram he posted it hilarious so changes to now he likes Broner I I mean look at he's he was GoPro in a smart move did they pay actually you know brothers a he I mean he did his thing in that fight to outwork Jesse Vargas that that's hard to do I heard he beat the hell out of him at the after eight rounds he beat out the hell out of them for the last four so I have to watch I gotta watch it alone yeah yeah I wanted to watch your fight in Frankie's fight and and David branch man knocking out Thiago Santos like that holy shit branch is tough people sleep on branch cuz he lost his Luke Rockhold Luke Rockhold is a fucking be especially on top oh he got Weidman down on the ground by the way Luke Rockhold we fought Weidman had staff he was going yeah he was going through his fucking antibiotics he was two weeks out he's in like serious fucking IV antibiotics the whole deal he was really hurting man and that's no joke I mean after that fight with Tony I was out for six weeks I couldn't do anything I was I got staph twice but I got it once and they caught it real early when I got the second time I the second time barely even affected me because it caught it so early but the first time I got it I got on the heavy medication and man I was like dizzy yeah and I wasn't even training I stopped training after I got on the medication I just just hung around yeah and I was just like Jesus the first couple of days on the medication I'm dizzy I'm like I feel terrible it destroys your body I mean especially we talked to I mean he taught so many microbiologists that tell you what it does to the the Gov Flores I didn't know back then either I got it back in like 2000 literally didn't know what it was so I just took the medication just ate what I always ate right there's my vitamins like I always did and that was it but I was like wow I'm like lighthead yeah yeah no it's no it's no joke you know the body and it's that shit's here's a fuck kind of mean MRSA and staff and those fucking infections they scare the shit out of me man yeah anything from within you it's just those fucking little monsters just want to take over your body and eat it you know that's what it is is more than than there are of us I mean it's more there's more bacteria in your body there are human cells yeah I mean it's it's crazy to think about its grant its but it but it just it's all about balance you know what I mean it's all you you are you careful with your diet like do you take in a lot of probiotics and yeah ya know especially when they can't make very very careful maybe outside of it recently I've been going a lot more keto a little bit you know I still eat carbs obviously because I have to for to have that explosion still I feel like I just think you do I think you have the more carbs and you probably still stay ketogenic I think that when people look at carbs and they say like you know only have 25 to 50 grams of carbs during the day like that's great if you're not doing two-a-days and fucking wrestling and running hills and shit like your body probably needs more carbohydrates than that yeah I mean it definitely and that that's kind of where I try and supplement it especially before I train you know trying to eat more carbs and and then I kind of cut them back towards the the end of the days what do you eaten a lot of chickens a lot of because I can't eat fish or shellfish so a lot of chicken sort of yeah largely no really yeah yeah allergic to Lobster yeah shit yeah I mean I just convinced myself it tastes like shit anyway it doesn't taste like melted butter oh so good with melted butter like some grass-fed steak well they're all pretty fucking good - I love to cook - um I love good I mean I I think there's a real art to cook into that could probably be me and another life a chef Lou saying that yeah that's an art to it right yeah I would love to you know eventually maybe I cook a lot I love cooking it makes me feel good man I like I like knowing that I prepared a meal yeah there it's just it's a nice thing especially if it's healthy and especially when you you know I don't I don't get people that are I mean I don't want say I don't get vegan oh it better like I have a lot of friends that are vegan and you know I never kind of dump but the fact that they don't want to eat meat for there's certain people like my brother tried to do this - he's like he don't want to eat meat because he's like afraid of the animal you know artists feel bad for the animal itself it's just like you said it we've got more not us cells than we do us sales yeah like we're all the same shit you know I mean even the even the animals like we are the same though I mean they're the same as the plants I don't want animal cruelty I mean I think that's what most the the most noble aspects of becoming a vegan is to avoid animal cruelty and factory farming and I think that that in that way I agree with them the real problem with vegans is that there's a certain percentage of them that are just fucking idiots and it's just a certain percentage of any group of people it's not most vegans most vegans are kind people yeah yeah it's a certain percentage of them that are using being a vegan as an excuse to be a fucking asshole yeah that's what it is and they just they have this thing and most of them use vegan in their screen name those have like yeah yeah it's a part of their identity yeah and then they attack people who aren't vegans there's a few people that I followed I literally go to their Twitter page and just watch them attack people who aren't vegans yeah I mean it's crazy to watch it's just like that's all they do and like you say this is that's why I don't want to say like I don't understand because yeah that's just people in general you usually get that you're gonna get that at any wall show we're gonna be fucking idiots it's it's almost like and when I've said that like veganism is sort of a religion it's a it's a it's an ideology in the sense of the way some people practice it that they want to go after there's some people that are Catholic that hate Protestants right they think the Protestants are the enemy and then this is just I mean this is obviously something that went on for a long time in human history but I think it's just groups of people get real tribal and then you know the fucking Yankees hate the Red Sox and this is just how it goes and these people just decide that you're on the other team so fuck you and no one can see any middle ground yeah you know there's this guy from this restaurant antler from Toronto oh that I had on last week and these people are protesting his restaurant these vegans I seen that yeah and then I thought I want him to put a sign in the window saying something like no animals should die so that we live and it's not our right to take their lives on like and so they're like thick protests every until he does this but he's not going to do yeah so what the fuck are you doing what is this like where's this just a there's a there's a balance there's an ideological battle going on you know and they're not it's not doesn't it's not a thought well like examined objective thing in my in my opinion yeah but it's so natural though let you say this is it's almost like communities mm-hmm you know is if you have your your your thoughts I've got my thoughts and we are part of two separate communities right and it's just like what anything else I think that integration between the two and that balance is like the most key to everybody really it kind of will grow everybody you know the the the Bounty Hunter's can learn something from the vegans just much the vegans can learn from the others I think so too you know and I think that really the problem is when people don't want to hear the other side and they want to shout people down they don't they're not willing to listen and there's this common ground across the board and some of it probably just learned I think a lot about like how you grew up and I think it's important to like understand that it's like I said just to go back to my child it is just that's the way I grew up and that's what I understood but when I look at like my dad you know like my my dad didn't have his dad so and he was out the house by 15 you know he and I try and put myself there sometimes being a 15 year old kid that didn't have a place to go like what are you gonna do and only people you see around you is drug dealers and honest so I like a lot of it I give credit to him for sticking around for me because I would have no I hit people over Todd to hit right you know you know I mean and that's why people do it because those people that are doing that are just like you and me everybody's mom said we're all just human beings and we very genetically and we very but we very more by our environment how much love we get yeah yeah that that's it that's a big part of is like it's just the culture yeah it's just you know and and I think it stems from one culture being separated from others and not having that integration yeah then you get that like even more of a disconnect and then once you did even bigger than you know is it's all like a now he'll more insecurity which leads to more tribalism and it's the whole thing is just it's so disappointing that people still operate like this but I think people are opening up to that more now than before I just think it's a slow process yeah slowly but surely yeah sure that we still working at it yeah I mean look you know we were talking before about the the Rosa Parks picture out there that was not long no no no it really wasn't in it and and that be the thing with certain there certain white people too that just be like all right just get over it already and it's like come on like they didn't have to get over it exactly you don't understand sir yeah you don't you truly don't understand and you don't even like take the time to try right well they're tribal too they talk to other people that say the same shit and like yeah well and they'll just start rattling off statistics about the instances of crime in the black community and how the Asians don't do this but the blacks do it's like it's fucking cultural yeah if you don't think it's cultural you haven't been enough around enough people and it does not go back a lot of generations like you said was not very long ago you know my dad didn't have his dad he didn't have that person to teach him what not to doing what to do you know is that's a that's a that's a hard road especially for young like you go back earlier like young guys get delusional real quick you know they feel invincible you feel like oh I can do this and I'm never gonna get caught I'm you don't have that voice of reason to tell you right from wrong when you when you that kind of age right and it's because he didn't have his dad and then why didn't his dad because he didn't have his dad you know what I mean and that only goes back to three generations know what's crazy is you're talking about 1865 is when slavery was abolished so we're talking about a small amount of time in human history where they haven't been slave so all your isolation when you you felt as a kid when you felt separate from the people that were in the miles that were higher than yours think about that times a hundred yeah is if you were a slave yeah maybe a million an insurmountable gap between a slave that has no chance of ever not being a slave and someone who can go to school wherever they want and travel a blower abroad and do whatever the fuck they want and then the idea that some of these white people think that these people should just get over it what the amount of time is so fuckin short you're talking about we just have Black Panther yeah the life we just have it be avatar that should help leave it not I really think it was help it was a beautiful movie and it was a beautiful movie to describe even like when you say 1865 I feel like we so disconnected from even that and this is I've talked to a lot of people about this the difference between being call a black American and an African American you know I don't I hate being called an African American that's what everybody says no it's just to me it it makes you seem because you put me in France s the next to each other Francis is an African American you know he's from Africa he has ties to Africa you know who else is an African American Elon Musk yeah I mean yeah really when you're real but I think even more now it kind of like I just why can't we be black comes in so many different shades yeah you know what I mean it has this African obviously yeah so maybe black Americans a better way to put it but Africans have ties to slavery like we feel I feel we should have our ties in America like I should be proud to just be an American not be called an african-american you know well it's with every generation I mean it's it's gonna take a long time before we just abandon all this nonsense and just treat people based on who they are as a human being but my grandparents came from Italy and they were treated like dog shit yeah and my grandfather always talked about the racism that he encountered when he came over from Italy to America and they didn't think of Italians as white people now they think of Italians is why people hundred percent yeah but and and that Mexicans are experiencing that like you know if you're from Spain you're basically white like nobody thinks of a guy from Spain as being like you don't think of them the same way you think of Mexico but yeah but one day all that shit will go away yeah one day we'll get past this whether it's who knows how many generations it'll take but I think it's now because of the internet I think there's there's there's definitely like more hate groups that the consolidate and they get together and they you know they they live in an echo chamber online they talked you know they agree with each other you see it on Twitter and he's and Twitter's trying to stop that and maybe that's misguided because maybe it strengthens it but I think that ultimately his ability to exchange information is get gonna allow more and more people to compare notes and and and understand that but there's no there's no benefit to descry or des to to thinking of people as being inferior or superior or better or worse we're just all different yeah but we're all human we're all just human we're all the same I mean really you see that when you when you see people you know hey you can really see somebody you really know you really see them yeah yeah this we literally all the same but all different too because that's one of the beautiful things is that you you see you these little different aspects of individuals personalities but to want people in a group oh you know you're a Chinese guy why what the fuck you are you're this oh you're an African guy on don't fuck you are you're this no that's nonsense yeah there's a broad spectrum in each and every classification but at the at the end of the day we're all the same thing because we're all just people yeah what one percent I mean it's just when you talk about heaven like pride in in in it I feel like helps a little bit more but if I'd identify was like as a black American you know instead of instead of like an african-american it's just a super sign you know what I mean I write I feel like I said a little more you know I just look different you know what I mean like I'm up my I'm more integrated and it would give me more pride to be that you know what I'm saying mm-hmm and and I think that's still you we're obviously all the same and there needs to be integration but you still have to have some type of identity you know what I'm saying I know you're saying yeah I mean and I think that the movie in itself did a good job I just went about the black panther I think it did a great job in describing like the difference there differences between the the black community in the African and African community you know what I mean our African Africa itself in it because you get that you get that like anger you know what I mean mm-hmm like that's like the the stereotype is like the blight angry black man right but some of these stems from not know one where you're from and not having that core identity and I feel like we can just do that again here in America as black Americans instead of I hope yeah I hope what it represents is a it's a meter to register that racism is dying yeah and that that this is this is also people and there's a lot of like white people that really going way out of their way to go see it because they wanted to show everybody that they're not racist but I think that's good too yeah ultimately it's it's showing that this is something that people recognize is a stupid problem and we should get past it it took goddamn long enough grandchildren yeah and they're gonna be experiencing some of it and then there's gonna be something new comes out new you like god yeah we just now doing this like you know that's the way it's gonna be but for me personally you know it's just eight cuz everybody every kid wants to be a superhero like them you know so right it's like a whole lot of them you could be half vampire and be blade yeah yeah yeah but blade was like I hit man you know it goes back to what you see around me if I only see the the drug dealers and the you know in every you know there was never a black superheroes like yeah any portrayed us as scientists or you know it was a lot I just if you want those white get over it guys that doesn't register for you because they're all white every fucking superhero bad man even the Hulk is white at first yeah and I mean I and I get it from a lot of it means it's just it's just culture yeah you know I mean and this is not better or worse than one thing or another you know there there's Hawaiian culture there's there's yeah you know it's just culture yeah and it just that needs to be celebrated too because the more you celebrate culture the more you can integrate between all of them right and then there's the real problem I don't want those cultures to go away ya know I was in Chinatown in Boston this weekend we went in a ate dinner at two o'clock in the morning Chinese restaurant it's china town right Jamie that place was Chinatown they got like fucking Alaskan king crabs and a fish tank like how the fuck did you even get that here it's still alive all these fish on top of each other and they pull the fish out of the tank and cook it up for you I mean it's like but they barely speak English I mean this is their culture and I want that to still exist too you know I mean I just want them to be accepted 100% I mean and that's the beauty about it and I think you need to keep that alive you know there's two different spectrums to it there's the there's the the person it's just like oh just go ahead and get over it and there this person just like okay what you don't even have like they don't even like like I did it or acknowledge your culture you know I mean they just want to like just shun it or just not you know just put it in a closet somewhere you know that that's almost the it's the opposite but it's just as bad obviously you know a buddy man who lives on the Big Island about that he's a white guy and he lives in Hawaii and he grew up in Hawaii and I said did you experience a lot of racism against white people he's like no because I'm not a fucking asshole you can't be a white guy coming over here trying to push your you know mainland cultures like this is the fucking culture dude he goes if you just accept the culture the way it is out here he goes they're not racist they take you do it you're gonna run into a few but for the most part you're gonna run it to a few everywhere you go cuz we're bored but like you go back to it like people are fucking idiots in every walks of it but for the most part it's really not as are you good right I mean this is it's the it's the same way across the board and I've kind of realized that ISM as I'm getting older because before I just thought you know we just what we are you know I mean I've got family members that only will ever see Detroit they will only ever see those same blocks they will only ever see the same people and that's just what you think it is and it's just like so much now there's so much more and it's not that different like you think it's different it's different but you know what I'm saying it's not it's not alien mm-hmm it's just it's just different it's just different it's not better not worse one of the things that I really enjoyed about traveling so much with the UFC is you've got to see all these different call and you got to see all these different styles of life that these people live in and you know you kind of like put it all together and you you it just gives you I think it's one of the best things about traveling is that it gives you this more rounded perspective like if you lived in Italy you'd be like one of these people yes that's how they live they live like this you know if you lived in Dublin you'd be like this this is this is their style of living yes and it's important to acknowledge I think all those different styles too you know and of living and that and and I think if you really want to like cure racism in America and all that and it's just being open about it and just talking and you know people understand that other people's upbringing is and what they went through and what they do because that makes you understand it more if you try and just shun it away and just say if you even bring up the word black or white or anything like people get right you know you kind of see it sometimes people get tense and it's like just just just be honest about it just be open about it and that will make it go away it's not it's not you know shun it and know what you don't want to be uncomfortable they don't want to talk about uncomfortable shit so if something comes up that's a well you know as a black man do it okay I never had a slave okay super uncomfortable with being uncomfortable yeah like you yeah I think that makes you that more than so they're you talking to a human being if you really want to have a conversation with them you want to know their actual experience yeah you know and if their experience is as a Puerto Rican that came from Puerto Rico that fills disc a lot of Puerto Ricans feel super disconnected with the United States because they're not really United States citizens but they are yeah it's like a weird thing it's kind of like it's not really a state yeah but it's it's sort of protected by the United States and so they're disconnected and there's a like on the East Coast growing up with Puerto Ricans there's a weird they have a weird alienation you know and that's a if you don't want to talk to them and you don't want to hear about that from them that's fine but you're just gonna miss out on that part of what life is for them you know you're never gonna get it yeah and all the things that they bring to it and you know the food that they brain-dead but the different arts yeah you know I mean that the different styles of fighting that they bring the different dances like everything about the culture you're gonna miss if you try and just you know shy away from it martial arts is a perfect example of like all these different cultures coming together everything and there's one boiling pot you know yeah I mean that that's how me yes one of the most beautiful things about it is yes I can go over to Ireland and find a Russian and Ireland yeah and you know is it's different than going down to Brazil and fighting the Brazilian you know or something like that it's just sure but it's at the porv it is still it's fighting there's just different styles of of being able to do it but everybody does it what's crazy to me is how when you go to these other places like Brazil or Ireland or something like that like how rapid they are for their local pedia yeah well you're fighting someone who's Brazilian in Brazil I mean maybe it's relax a little bit now but I was there for some of the earlier as well and I made the mistake of flipping off the crowd before at the way is because because look down there Francisco train Aldo yeah so he you know three times Brazilian kickboxing champion monstrous that was one of at the height of his you know he's on a seven fight win streak he was feeling good he was you know kinda added his last run to he was he wasn't tough at a 185-pound to big big doer hit like a truck too but you know before the way is they they scream it you gonna die and I'm like alright you know I'm a shit talker so you you you talk that you know give it back to you I mean they were rabid for that what people were throwing stuff at me as I was walking out I gotta just threw my headphones in and just went to town but they loved it but every but a lot around the world a lot of the because I think they truly appreciate the art of what they do and it is a representation of the culture there you know sure with jiu-jitsu for sure for sure when they when they get somebody that's Demian Maia you know they're gonna stand behind that man that because he represents the art of it or just MMA in general like they they appreciate the art of it Russians appreciate the art of what they do you know the Szabo and you know this is so deep-rooted in a culture in Americans do too I mean for the most part is just we don't get as behind our own fighters I think is I think yeah we have a certain amount of loyalty but we're so this is such an ambitious country yeah hello win it hey you know we're yes the money we get somebody shy talks of shit and we like that's it well listen man you're doing all those things right now hello John do it slowly but surely you know I think this is a good conversation - because I think people understand you more now yeah yeah get a better sense of who you are I got a couple of deeper you know I got a couple layers of you you thank everybody appreciate it man I really enjoyed this conversation talk for sure all right that's it fuckers see ya
