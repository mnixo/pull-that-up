the girag an experience but the beautiful thing about boxing is that with everything wrong in the world and I hate to use this cliche this terminology but you know with life being unfair because I don't like to use that because because sometimes people nowadays for me they there's too many excuses out there there really are there's too many damn excuses you're in this country you got a chance to do something where you don't have in other places but having said that you can feel like life's not fair sometimes especially when you think about some of the things we just talked about in a day that's gone now it's not there no more but on a day of Lewis and those kind of people life wasn't fair that really they really had a right to use that same nowadays I don't think people who have a white black purple they don't have a right to say that to the extent that they did back then not to this day no no they don't they really list all the things longer they're messed up people still out there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but sometimes it's too easy to use that yes it's just too easy so but there was a time when life too often was unfair ruthlessly and yeah really unfair ruthlessly yeah yeah yeah and when life was unfair boxing was around to make it fair and I tell you how on one given night if you worked hard enough if you dream big enough if you were tough enough and you made yourself tough enough you sacrificed enough it became polished and savvy enough and and technically equipped to do things that you had then you learned those things and you just worked yourself to the ball no matter where you came from no matter what part of the world no matter what who your parents were no matter what your poverty level may have been may not have been no matter what you had what you didn't have no matter what people had told you didn't tell you all of that if you made yourself and took advantage of that opportunity got yourself ready and you were ready to behave like a champion you could get in that ring on one given night and make the world fair and have your hand lifted we call a champion of the world that makes boxing special and it's also I think in some ways there's a leveling of the playing field that a lot of these ideologies present to some people where they they go no you're not a freak you're okay you know this there was some silly article on fat acceptance the other day and it was talking and then they got papaya which is fine I accept people who drink except I've accept all kinds of unhealthy choices but listen don't lie to me just don't lie about the physical reality of what you've done your body if you reach 400 pounds that's not that's not healthy you're saying it's healthy you're saying it's okay no you're just not dead yet if you lost 200 pounds you would feel wonderful that would be healthier like if you smoked every day and you like look no cancer smoking is healthy no no you're just you're just but your body is dealing with it your body's processing it it won't be able to forever that is exactly what's going on if you're morbidly obese and for you to pretend any differently and to just go on about this fat acceptance movement and you know the big beautiful this and that and like no you're obese you've eaten too much food if you see a fat guy how come he doesn't get the same sort of treatment if you see a morbidly obese man in his underwear no one's saying he's beautiful because he's disgusting and he's fat and he's lazy and he's he's addicted to food we all know it but if it's a woman were so inclined to like accept just okay let her go she's fine you're wonderful you're beautiful you're a amazing like give her her space we treat them as if they're incapable of recognizing the absolute reality of their physical being I don't know how you feel about mumble rap but mumble rap is one of the weirdest things to me it's I'm confused it's bizarre it's bizarre what is happening I just I feel like I feel like I don't want to be that dude who doesn't get it right you know what I mean you don't get it I don't get it either I don't but when you start dealing with youth culture and when I was the age of these mumble rap kids there were older head saying you know the the the generation before us the cold crush brothers to the Big Daddy canes as they probably thought what we were doing was crazy so is that what's happening I don't know maybe everyone's like what the fuck is that it's like it's to the point with me where I'm like yo is that even a genre of rap right like I almost look at it I guess I don't I guess I don't have a problem with it cuz i don't process it as anything close to what i do right it's almost like if you said yo what do you think about EDM i don't know alright it's right where i don't even look at it like i can't listen to that and then hear Big Daddy Kane and think it's the same thing when we were kids listening to music right if you're you were listening to something that you enjoyed one of the things you loved was like good lyrics of course and when you can't understand what they're saying yeah it's also it's just so driven by it's like phrase driven yeah they just say whatever they learn over and over again yeah I don't know if like it's just cuz these kids are doing Molly or whatever yeah and they're just in a zone is a drug culture because that's happened before too you know one thing creates the other it's like chicken or the egg are these kids doing Molly and make mumble right where they don't mumble rap and they eat Molly right and it's all it's you know the 60s you know going back to the 50s and beatniks in that scene and jazz and heroin and what will created it you know what I mean that Myles and Coltrane makes some of those records because they were on her on or vice versa and it's happened historically is this just the drug driven culture I don't know because I it's I'm detached you know I'm detaching at night and you know I'm a kid who grew up you know listening to metal and stuff like that so I don't I'm not at a shortage for Alice in the Slayer I'll just listen to Slayer before I listen to that if that's my only option right then I'll listen to Slayer you know what I mean I listen to black flag I listen to Minor Threat that's what I'll do you know it so they're whether I however I feel about it becomes irrelevant when you realize that you have so much good shit out there so I don't need it's like with film like I'm not worried about a bad movie I'll just watch a dope movie right there's so many movies and just throwing them away right yeah and it's like yo I'll just listen to Thin Lizzy right if I if I don't feel like adjusting to that you know what I mean and there's other things that we might not get cuz we're not doing what we used to do maybe if we were out of the bar of the club five nights a week and you weren't married with kids and we were hammered maybe it sounds different right you know that it's it's time and play shit because I am baffled by this kornev or diet yes I'm baffled yeah I'm baffled by how many people are are clinging to it as a panacea I'm baffled by whether or not it's a physiological effect or whether there's a placebo effect going on I have a theory please yeah so my theory is that it mimics some of the benefits of fasting but allows people to persist for longer because it's providing some nutrition you know most if you look in the scientific literature fasting is like the cure-all for everything I agree I mean like you can look at any condition and fasting is the cure but time water fasting so you can't do it for two three four weeks the problem is try that for a year that will be the cure for life in that case the longest example is a year of water fest so most people are lost he was extremely obese fat stores anything about that was he actually is skin shrank - right which is really a which doesn't usually happen with weight loss so this is just a theory I have nothing - okay you know I don't any evidence but when meat is absorbed very high up in the digestive tract and so when you only eat meat it's a low residue diet and there's nothing left over to irritate or inflame the gut my theory is a lot of people who are benefiting from this have a really disrupted gut microbiome Alessio Fasano has argued that leaky gut is kind of a precondition for autoimmunity and this the carnivore diet is essentially like a gut rest or a fast and so I don't you know the out that people are benefiting from it the question is what is the long-term implication yeah I mean I I'm not anti Kido I'm not anti vegan I'm anti bullshit and one of the problems we have is nutrition is replacing religion for a lot of people so you find something that you identify with and then people start to try to say because they identify with that movement or like for example vegans they identify with many of them protection of animals not my job to judge their ethics on that sort of thing but then they kind of try to backtrack to find the science to support them as well and they pick and choose and this is guilty of all groups not just vegans this is also a lot of ketogenic diet sell its carnivore diet whatever have you if it has the word diet they're zealots out there who are going after it and I will stick up for I've stuck up at a scientific conference for the ketogenic diet you were we were having a roundtable about something different and somebody said well we know that the ketogenic diet impairs exercise performance and endurance athletes and I said I don't think that's necessarily true you know the the it's pretty ambivalent they are ambiguous as to whether or not it does it seems to be kind of individual but on the whole on the average it doesn't seem to impair exercise performance so it's kind of what you like but when you have people who you know like like a Gary Taubes who says well calories don't matter it's all carbohydrates that sort of thing on the carbohydrate insulin model obesity I mean the research is you're able to do a lot of hand waving about insulin and you know will you burn so much fat when you're on a high-fat diet which is true by the way you you burn a lot of fat but what they don't talk about is that it's it's overall fat balanced how much fat you store versus how much fat you burn and when you're on a high-fat diet you store a lot of fat you also burn a lot of fat the overall caloric balance is what determines whether or not you will have net storage or net deposition it's the same thing for high carb diet as well you know this idea that with high insulin it just completely shuts down all fat burning everywhere that's just not true now if you have high carbohydrate you will burn less fat but you're also storing less fat as well and again the net caloric balance is going to be what determines how much you store because you don't really store carbohydrate as fat for most people they did a study overfeeding women where they overfed them 50 percent above their caloric maintenance and they found that of 282 grams of fat they stored during a day in adipose only four grams came from carbohydrate 278 came from fat [Applause]
