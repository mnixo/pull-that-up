working and they refund it that's amazing we had to make it the first 30 pills cuz the way we had it set up was you know you any order you don't even have to turn it back so then people start selling it on eBay right well you can't be that on yeah it's like the IRS it's basically you're counting on honesty he accounting of it for oversight but I like that I mean I can tell you from personal experimental I to keep a couple of pills and I think honestly I like it that's well I think if you have a product and you believe in it you would want people to buy it more than once especially if it's something like a vitamin supplement sure so I'm just let him know you're gonna like it it's it fucking works it's a fascinating little you ever get into vitamins nootropics yes in college and I was sick all the time I was getting sick three times a month even if it was for you know a day or something and my mom said look you got to get started on a multivitamin do you think this is also because of wrestling like you just I think so yeah you're kind of in a good petri dish for sickness you're malnourished you're over trained you're not getting enough sleep with all the road trips and different time zones perfect perfect petri dish to get ill and I started on a multivitamin known as centrum complete which has less nutrients than dog food that's what my doctor told me but it worked for me those small nutrients made a big difference so when I realized Jesus I haven't been sick in a year then I really started getting involved and now I want some really good stuff you can't even buy over-the-counter you've gotta have a doctor order it it's called a sauna it's very powerful you know four thousand milligrams of iodine goes on us a na sana sana mm-hmm and it's a combination yeah something just happened some short quick blurb I get it too but we're back combination of a combination of vitamins and minerals yeah and it's you can't get it like GNC you cannot know and you know and again let me tell you okay most vitamins are ten percent effective ninety percent marketing we all know that about nutrition GNC type things the ones that really work are ten percent marketing ninety percent goes into the lab and making them now that very statement I just gave you may in of itself be the marketing that the people have put out I don't know but that's what whose sama is doing you can't mind you've got to order it they don't have enough to mass-produce it because it's so potent and effective but I have had a number of doctors with with extensive read and say listen this is the one so do you have to you don't have to have a prescription you can just or not yeah but you just gotta have a doctor's office call up and you use you know this office that were you they got to call it in for you you know that's something they tried to get going years back they tried to label vitamins as nutraceuticals and then they were gonna have it so that you needed a prescription to get vitamins which is kit gets a little weird you know I mean III would appreciate a little regulation so we know exactly what the fuck is in everything because right now it's a it's a little Wild West when it comes to things like supplements but I just think that that's having to go to a doctor to get some vitamin D that seems like that's I don't I don't want that yeah no I hear you but that comes back to my point that it's you know ten percent effective ninety percent marketing you know how many things that GNC are made in the same lab but they're packaged different whoever can get the word out more and and I can tell you you know I've tried everything at GNC on the off chance that something might work I begged my dad to take me there when I was 12 years old and whoever the most muscle of desire whoever the you know most handsome guy whatever it was that attracts you when you're vulnerable at that age that's what I'm paying my dad had put forty bucks down and buy me the protein drink for so I fall for it I mean people people always fall for it so you know yeah they don't have oversight it's it's trial and error but what's not yeah yeah what is it it is it is kind of crazy but there there were a few things that actually did work but they got rid of them very quickly there was one called mag 10 there was Sundays to have to go into that little glass cabinet with the key to open it up yeah you couldn't even get it out of the regular like a video gap right yeah you got to let him know like you wanted some porn I mean I mean that's your porn was testosterone pills and mag tender was fucking real they got rid of it really quick you had taken an absurd amount of pills I think was like 10 pills there were these clear pills but you would take I know who knows what kind of fucking damage it did to your liver but oh my god you'd feel like a fucking raging animal like okay great work Wow yeah I gained a lot of muscle on it man I gained like 10 pounds of muscle on it and like eight weeks and it was legal you could buy two GNC you could do like six to eight week cycles on it and it was such a steroid it was so obvious cuz as soon as I got off it my dick would just crash my body would crash I was like wow I was like wow this stuff even though it's something you buy at GNC essentially it's just like doing a steroid sure so so essentially they discovered something yeah that the government had it yeah yeah and they got it you know that's going on there's a drug out there right now and I shouldn't call it a drug because it's not but it's it's a natural product known as kratom I don't know if you've heard about this but it is absolutely an opiate it's absolutely a painkiller and a you know those drive-thru espresso places that they've got we've got a place like that in Oregon and the guy sells kratom and he makes 150 grand a year and it's completely legal the government has not caught on that this is a painkiller I mean you get a high you get a low you got a crash I got a buddy that's coming off of painkillers he got he got addicted to the vicodin and what he's doing is he's going to buying this crowd him for $10 a pill you buy his five it costs him $50 he goes every Sunday and when he shows up at 10:00 a.m. Joe there's a line waiting for this stuff it's a drug but it hasn't been found illegal yet and I'm saying that because the story you just told about being able to buy a steroid over-the-counter people are gonna think that's not believable that happens all the time the governor just hasn't caught on yet well ding I don't know that they should well I don't are they gonna be able to look at when Bunco came out with that clear stuff that de clear you know here right yeah it was like somehow another under tack touble you know how many more of those are possibly out there I mean how hard is it to do something like that sure well III wouldn't know but from what I'm told and I read about this stuff all the time is that if you simply get yourself a good chemist he goes in he changes one molecule one element and all of a sudden The Strand is something else you got your band list you changed one molecule it doesn't fall into that category they're looking for things in that category and they pass you know it's Olympic year and we see this every games where an entire country comes out looking different than every other athlete the whole country looks differently like okay guys you're all looked at that way this whole team has gotten this much stronger and more shredded and times have picked up in everything from track to pole-vault to to swim everybody's better from your country what are you doing and then 10 years later you find out and it gets added to the band list it gets really creepy when you start thinking about shit like cycling and you see all these dudes getting convicted and all these dudes turning I had a friend was a professional cycler and he told me everybody was on crazy shit I said they all are so there's no way you can compete at that level well you're talking cycling as the sure and I'm thinking we're talking about you know shooting up on and off of regulation okay so we're talking we're talking when I met Olympic cycling with you like the or any any high-level cycling Lance Armstrong type Tour de France shit like you you almost have to be on something dry heat yeah you know it's it's getting really weird when it comes to those type of shirts and what about what a guy gets caught and so then instead of just going yet listen I gotta take my medicine you got to bring everybody else down with you no he becomes the tattletale you know come on what's happening here so that's not the way it works you got brought down you got Chi gonna take your medicine yeah by Jose Canseco's uh that whole book and publishing and you know tell him how it was really going down you know I mean that really cost him people's love sure like for his whole life yeah that guy he ever read his Twitter it's not comfortable right now I never had well he's got some dark shit in there you know about what it was like when he had money and now that he's got nothing he knows what people are really like and you know it's it's pretty dark and in a lot of it the hate this guy gues emanates in the fact that he ratted out his friends sure well I think there's something to that you know I really do I mean I even as a kid nobody likes a tattletale nobody like style you know he was telling the truth yeah I thought I did see a lot of stuff that he did it with it with this book and I did find it to be pretty genuine I tend to believe a lot of people he's an admitted cheater how can you believe it well I think he's being pretty candid right now I do believe them well when we start seeing guys like Mark McGwire shrink down right after he's done playing you know and then admit that he was on steroids or you see Barry Bonds and how big he got and it's almost like man how how much regulation do we really need of the human body you know what is it what the fuck is wrong with what Barry Bonds did but he took something that made him stronger you know but shouldn't we be interested in stuff that makes you stronger and makes you healthier when you look at a guy like Barry Bonds like that guy was he looks like he was 30 years old he got better when he was older you know that's as a as a professional baseball player that's amazing it shouldn't that be something that we would like look into and say that's a good thing you know don't you want Roger Clemens to keep throwing fucking heat deep into his 40s like why would you want to stop that sure but don't mix the argument I mean of course we love medicine and in advancements and and that's wonderful but if you're talking about rules within a sport and you want to just keep it out for whatever reason but if that is the decision that we're gonna keep it out well then the guy can't bring it in and cheat and lie about I think that was the debate but I hear what you're saying I mean if it is making people healthier and better than good for them and by all means we should advance knowledge and technology in that area but that doesn't mean that it's okay for sport that's up to the governing bodies right well mean that's what's going on in California they just recently ruled on testosterone replacement surgery or excuse me testosterone therapy and therapy and also medical marijuana and they ruled positive on both those things sure and if you're you're doing testosterone replacement and you know that isn't that essentially the same thing and it's essentially the same thing as doing you know human growth hormone or anything anything along those lines you're doing something to stop the aging process you're doing something to enhance the the hormonal balance of your body well it's been deemed legal then so it should be an issue right well I look if it's legal or illegal is where it all comes into play you know I can tell you I went through this in California and they're acting as though they're just made it legal that's not true it's always been legal here they're they're commissioners to always recognize it you know I went to this in California like what was the official designation that they recently just owed on it they would allow a disclosure process here let me talk about myself because you know I was such an expert on this because I had to go through it I go out I tell him I'm on testosterone I say can I compete in your state while on testosterone that's what you got to do you got to get permission yes go ahead so I do it I take my test they coming back at least hey you're on testosterone well guys you didn't need a urine test I told you that well in advance in writing and you told me I could be on testosterone I go on we don't we don't like this but you made the rules and you told me I could do it so it just ended up in this really weird area where they said okay but you didn't disclose it properly and they started changing the argument just got really weird to where we could never narrow them down so they finally come to some resolution within their own body and you know in the state of California I don't want to turn on throw stones at them I want to be pretty diplomatic with them but look they are not transparent and for you and I to to experts and authorities in this sport to still not be completely clear on what their ruling was I think speaks to their lack of transparency and if they don't want people to keep stubbing their toe and breaking rules just make it clear so that we know what the rules are it seems like they're dipping their feet in the water to me they constantly do that so that they can then pull back out and that's not what we said yeah it seems off it seems weird well I mean they're in a tough position to it's a pretty thankless job to be the head of an athletic commission and there's very few guys that do it do it really well but um you know it's not an easy job trying to figure out what's fair trying to figure out what the playing field is especially a science and and and medicine advances you know I like the idea of a guy like Roger Clemens being able to play baseball because he's taking human growth hormone and doing testosterone doesn't bother me sure like it really sucks that this guy that he can't actually just say that he can't just do that especially in a sport like baseball where I mean what what how is it gonna hurt somebody means you're I mean even if he is enhanced it's he's not gonna get hurt somebody that's where it gets weird like an MMA that's like the we're we're the real questions in MMA is like I mean if you really have something in your body that makes you like hyper human you have like hyper human levels which people can do if they you know if they use testosterone placement or something else unethically sure you know I'll tell you one thing I admire about you you are oddly comfortable in your own skin you know you have no problem admitting anything and being a real open book and and moat and so I think that's one reason why you can't relate to Roger Clemens is cuz you know you're like look this is who I am and this is what I do but that's a very rare trait you possess that but not a lot of people do everybody's got their secrets not necessarily on this topic but on other things of their life will they keep it private I think this is your rare this is a weird thing where you know his sport does not allow you to do that to your body but I think it's a silly argument when you're looking at a guy who's an older man like he is like how else do you expect him to be able to do that do you know anything about how the body ages because guess what a certain point in time his body doesn't recover enough anymore he can't throw the heat but now he can he can because he takes this stuff isn't that stuff he doesn't that mean it's like good for you isn't it like good for him like shouldn't you be looking at it that way so it's such a weird fucking narrow band of like what it what is cheating you know what is what is legal what do we allow well it's gonna be a certain point in time are they gonna start genetic engineering and what do you what do what is everybody gonna do there's gonna be a fucking pill that take and it turns you into Thor you know what are you gonna do you gonna not take it oh yeah why would you not want to be like a superhero if I could give you a pill it lets you fucking fly through the air and become bulletproof you wouldn't take it of course you would take it it would be amazing now I like your argument you know and again it's Olympic your Olympics are my favorite sport I don't watch professional sports but I love every four year was when the games come around so you might hear me reference it a few times today but you know listen the athletes used to be done at 23 years old that was zamak 23 was it if you made 22 21 that's usually now you know look at the last games in Beijing we had Dara Torres she was 40 years old we're gonna have 40 year old athletes on our Olympic team this year vying for medals and that's a tremendous compliment to medicine that's a creminis compliment to technology and what we're discovering here in America and abroad and then not label it don't label drugs are labeled as cheating look at the fuckin advancement look at what it look at what's happened sure well and it's real interesting you know because the only time you're in hot water is if it's a banned list but you know that's junk science and it changes constantly things that weren't legal are legal that are legal aren't legal you know a testosterone replacement boy that's just got such a a bull's-eye on it but there's a number of performance-enhancing agents that are perfectly legal and you know you got to still be within your limits caffeine comes to mind as a matter of fact you know you want your caffeine levels as high as you can get prior to competition in my opinion you know I can tell you from my body that's when I do my best but you still got to be within the left and there's a lot of things ladies what's the legal limits like a cup of coffee yeah essentially you know if you report compared to nodos which is something you can buy at a local convenience store you can take two of them is that how you do it do you regulate it that way that's alright just because there's no problem right if you do that it stays in your system about four hours you'll pass it within that but you're fine but coffee can vary wildly it absolutely Canyon and there's there's people that say you know listen in and they'll block you an athlete a lot of fans don't notice when you go in the locker room you cannot have anything other than a closed bottle of water they want to see you open it and the reason they're just trying to protect you if you go in there with a coffee and I'll bring you in there five hours before your fight you come in there with some kind of a drink you could have something that you don't know about right but you know I mean the caffeine caffeine is just one that I mentioned but there's a number of performance-enhancing things and if a guy takes the time and gets surrounded with the right people that look into that because often it's overlooked but you know supplements diet vitamins as we talked about earlier these are there's a very important element and if a guy inundates himself in fines where his level should be and he's legal then he's legal good for him and so many people want to point a finger and say there's something wrong but but there's not and the science continually change continually junk science you can't get you bring five doctors in your jail you get five different opinions and you know what it's also assuming that nature is fair which i think is ridiculous there are some people that have fucking incredible genetics and there's some people that literally can't compete with them yeahbsolutely can't they just physically can't compete with them you we we both know guys who have been non athletes that have tried to so or try and they just couldn't do it there's guys that are born with freaked bodies you know there's there's guys that are without a doubt they're gifted genetically you know I mean that's that's not fair either you know should we round people up by genetically you know how will help what's their disposition should we I mean if you really want to look at like what's fair sure like it is not fair that uh you know you can get a guy like what's his name Jonah Hill Yeah right and a guy like Jonathan Mann who share a common man of exact John Jones there's no way you can tell me that those dudes have the same hand sure someone someone got fucked yeah yeah and the guy that you want to win is whoever worked the hardest right show the most dedication has the best skills and that is a fallacy some guys will be born with a better skill set than other guys will be able to learn over a lifetime you just start you know you see it with speed you see it with the ability to jump you see and it's just a natural thing there's some guys that will take testosterone and still have a lower level than a guy that was just gifted with it and you see it all the time so I get your point yeah it's not a fair playing field the idea is that your mind can allow you to overcome pit or to overcome the the disparaging genetics you know your mind and strategy is important just as important as being physical but that's always assuming that big strong people are dumb and guess what a lot of them are sure a lot of those big strong naturally gifted motherfuckers are also really quick and they think quick you know I mean look a gun like Mike Tyson people would always talk about how you know Mike Tyson wasn't bright my Mike Tyson was a fucking boxing historian and maybe he wasn't educated but he figured out the best style for his body he figured out how to how to break a man down he figured out how to put up a pace that other guys just couldn't deal with and if you could just punch faster than everybody else could that no one could fuck with him he figured all that's it that's that's there's a intelligence to that to get excellent at anything requires an intelligence that's what's really scary about a genetically gifted guy birds they could easily be really smart bert sugar just touched on that same topic with mike tyson and he said he is very smart because i'm not saying he's intelligent I'm calling him smart very smart and I don't personally know what the distinction is that he was getting at I think it meant you know some of the bad decisions that Tyson made around - have you seen Tyson by the way that the show you know he's doing this news I heard it's amazing do you know anything about it I've know nothing I guess I know he's up and tell stories I got to tell you one story so let me set the scene real fast Dana white went and saw this Dana got invited hema Mike her buddy so Dana you know he's backstage he's having a great time all it is is Mike Tyson goes out he's got a microphone he tells stories of his life and they've got a production so if he says you know Don King in a story boom Don King's face pops up behind him on a big movie screen so he's telling this store and he's - brings up the Robin Givens era where you know where he's beating Robin Givens and he's doing these horrible things - and he's gonna listen the one thing Robin never told anyone is that I was seeing her the whole time you know the whole time we were still seeing each other now he didn't use the word scene I'm sure you can fill in the blank but he's seen her the whole time so he says you know one morning at 1:00 a.m. I Drive over to Robin Givens house my mansion that I bought her that I'm not allowed to go to and I'm ringing the doorbell and this isn't all that uncommon because I do this a lot except today she doesn't come to the door so he says I'm walking around the house I'm looking in the windows about 15 minutes later I see her pulling up the driveway in a Bentley that I bought her that I'm not allowed to drive so she's driving my car she's coming to my mansion it's 1:00 in the morning she gets out of the car she brought someone home with her so she brought a guy home to see her into my mansion in my car that I'm not allowed to be at and when the guy gets out of the car do you want to know who it is and on the screen up pops Brad Pitt he was a waiter and she picked him up that night before he ever made it into the movies so Brad Pitt sitting there go hey man hey buddy you know I don't really know much about this I know who you are we just we were gonna watch some TV man and Mike Tyson says I could kill you right now and nobody would and Tyson walked away to the right they got this card he walked away but how great is that story it's a great story shit Brad Pitt right but he somewhere his production crew found an old picture of Brad Pitt you know some of them are out there reason the chicken suit somewhere in LA trying to make it it was one of those old school pictures before he ever got his break Robin brought him home so mike tyson's out verifying that must have been Jesus hey man let's be cool man isn't it crazy that someone can get married to someone just marry someone really rich for a couple years and you can just get fucking paid you can just get fucking paid if a girl can do that a girl can meet a guy like Mike Tyson trick them get Miriam manipulate them rope man ride it for a few years and then just hurry the rewards yeah and in this era of reality TV we all know when that's happening it's just the guy just like this Chris Humphrey really think he was in a real relationship I mean god bless him I hate to see that he got his heart broke but I'm watching it from my couch on a you know bi-weekly basis when the girlfriends forcing me I'm like Chris this isn't an actual romance man this isn't how this works do you really think you're getting married to Kim here I think he thought it was real the whole rest of the world's going you gotta be kidding me well he would say the insulting shit to her that you should never take from a mate you know I he said something I was on a soup with Joel McHale that's name oh yeah funny funny guy very funny guy and he's got this the sketch they're doing about Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries that he said why would you care you know I said something they're like on the air like why would you care in a few years from now no one's gonna care about you anymore anyway oh you know yeah and everybody clapped and we laughed and I cried you know for fake for TV well for real life I look at it and I go well man could you imagine saying that to your friend the way you hunt to move that would be to say to your friend if my friend said that to me I'd be like bitch what the fuck am i doing hanging around with you I would cut that guy out of my life instantly because I'm not capable of saying something like that to a friend and that's actress but no mean spirited but it might not even be accurate well who the fuck would have figured out the two de Velde what she's doing right now that girl's making sixty million dollars whatever a year I mean it's incredible with what he's gonna see that she's not gonna be able to figure out how to ride the tide maybe she can maybe she can to do but she already did sure look what she did I mean it's look she's no genius but there is genius and what she's done this genius in making a living by just being a person yeah oh absolutely it's very rare I mean you see it all the time America always has to have somebody it's usually some famous blonde she pulled it off as a as a brunette you know your Pam Anderson your marilyn monroe's well she also pulled it off with a fuck tape with a black dude yeah very powerful yeah you heard I don't know much about that wasn't the gentleman involved but you know Reggie Bush was that the last UFC was kind of Reggie Bush has my car report him right the second yeah yes literally in your car I sold my Barracuda and the owner that I sold it to sold to Reggie Bush well that sounds like that's his car you do know how a sale works well yes well it was my car I'm saying I should have phrased it better I apology you got me yeah I had a 1970 Barracuda I wish him luck with that fuckin thing yeah well you need to be clear you got a you got a lot of tough guys as friends and I see Reggie Bush rollin around that come and go take it back and honor you but now that I know it's okay I think fair sale and he's got the title then not only that it was enjoy Bush George hands with him and I don't change hand I have yeah he was he was dating Kim Kardashian I know this yeah why do I know this I have no not who the President of Poland is I have no idea but yet I know who Kim Kardashian was dating before she married this other fellow yeah and I'm doing my best to act like I watch that show but yeah I knew I knew it - I guess I should be ashamed as well well you are so good at promoting online and and and promoting in interviews have you ever thought about doing some sort of a limited version of a reality show not too intrusive I never appreciate the compliment now I never have you know reality TV is still pretty new and some generations they don't know that I you know I like it I'm a big fan but you know I got asked to do the Ultimate Fighter our reality show an hour in our industry and I just passed it just was you didn't want to coach you know I I would I love coach and I coach the kids team what I didn't want to do is go to Vegas for five weeks and now with the new format of live every Friday night on FX there it's a it's 13 week process that's what dominic and your eye are going through that's a long time it's a long time you know it's the little thing chunks of your soul sure in that place for example I have a dog I can't bring him but where am I gonna put him in Vegas is Damon gonna get me a yard somewhere you know I kind of too much to ask of any but I can't go 13 weeks with up little guy crazy forget who I was some of the smartest dog that's cute what kind of dogs oh that's cute it is uh can you say poodle I love dogs he's a rescue dog he's a terrier he's a mix I actually don't know what yeah completely is but long he's a cute dog is what he is three years so you wouldn't I mean you could get a place you could rent a place with the yard I guarantee you yeah let's probably some fancy high roller gambler type dude that would love to rent his house out to Chael Sonnen for a couple months all right well well there you go then maybe I will coach the reality show after all whoa you've saved that it would be fun to watch I'll tell you that yeah I appreciate that I think there's some you know I think that show picks up now the one problem I have with the show because there was some reality TV like for example Big Brother I got pretty into there was this crazy guy in there named will for one season if you ever watched it not seeing any nod so I'm assuming nobody so he was fantastic it's absolutely fantastic because he go into the dark room and he would just tell the truth you know I'm I'm gonna tell this girl this and I'm gonna stab her in the back on Friday and I'm not even clean what the bloody mess you know it was it was he would say these crazy things and then he would do it and then he won the whole show at any rate the problem the ultimate fighter is they put them in teams but there is no team and so you know they'll go have a the team will do a fight and if your team wins you need to win something you know on the apprentice with Donald Trump if your team wins boom you get a night out of dinner you know or whatever it is are you gonna go meet with this guy y'all get some money there's no team concept why am i cheering for my opponent I want whoever the toughest guy is well there's on my team or their team to lose and then I want the next toughest guy to lose I'm in this to win this for myself and it's really important that those guys start to get that and so they either need to do with the team concept or they need to have a team reward so there's a reason you would cheer for one side or the other this point there's no point so they're just just camaraderie for the sake of camaraderie right and then as the numbers dwindle down then all of a sudden hey you were on this guy's team now you over here and they mix it up and I'm a supporter of our show the last thing I'm trying to do is is put down the show but I mean from a critical standpoint I'd like to see a reason to cheer for a specific team or just don't even put them in team I think it's just fun because the guy who's the coach I mean be like especially this one right now it's going on with your AIA and Dominick Cruz what I like about is they're constantly talking shit to each other and it's just another way to try to win just another way to try to win with a team you know they and people love to be a part of teams man they like to pick team windows know I'm on Team apple you know and people love that i'ma only get droids I'm good I like Detroit a platform you know people love to be sure for you say soccer but I hear the ice cream sandwiches actually I saw have you seen that what is it then oh yeah mazie that's this big I love it I'm a joiner urinate Chael Sonnen Chael Sonnen it is healthy that motherfucker drinks water I'm sure Mike Dolce be Bible by the way just texted me yeah go right down there to the left Mike Dolce who's a fitness expert he was a former fighter and a professional bodybuilder I think at one point in time were power lifters something like that super smart dude when it comes to nutrition so he's gonna come on the podcast and I'm gonna have your diet straightened out carry mine yeah I need to address certain issues with you we're gonna get you on all vegetables from now on and do some animals last night would you eat I had foie gras and that's for the only for a couple more weeks in California I know but this place I went to it was called animal and I highly recommend it it's in Hollywood and it's just Hannibal it's every single craze they had veal brains they had they had you know pig sliced pig head I don't even what that is I only used to cook lamb brains you cook it on the grill what's brains taste it doesn't seem like a good idea to eat brains right I was okay it was really inexpensive you know was it's like peasant food it was peasant food and then it becomes slowly it became like sort of chic you know fascinating but you're eating organs and brains and stuff like that but it wasn't something best tasting stuff but fuck why is that says you come here take the do it right before it's about to get banned yeah I took Brian to this place Noir that's right down the street and they have they have full gua there for only two more weeks it's more the fuckers these silly bitches you silly liberals what have you done you got the best-tasting food you're gonna kill the duck that with do you really care if someone over stuffs this duck before you kill it did you even watch the videos they never see them Oh force-feed a duck they take the duck they stick its stupid head under this faucet they pour some grain down his throat and then they pull it off it takes five seconds and you think that that's terrible that's terrible to an animal that you're gonna kill and eat really it's it takes five to ten seconds it's not screaming at pain it's it's for a human it would totally suck to have a food shove down your throat but they they have a completely different capacity like absorb grains and stuff I mean it makes their liver swell up it's like it's not good for them but it makes delicious food is there a humane way to do it like five or 10 seconds a day if that you know it's really quick man I've watched him do it it's it's ridiculous they take the thing this is what we do we grab them by the neck and you stick its mouth on it and they get sort of used to it after a while they just they just kind of like stop there that they pump grain down their throat then they let them go and then they're done for the rest of the day they wander around eventually they gonna fucking kill them I mean that's why they raise them I mean it's a week we're gonna slowly regulate that away I mean it's not this is not real cruelty veal to me is far more cruel and legal and I'm more attached to veal because it's a mammal I don't give a fuck about ducks you know if you take a duck and you stick it in there and you fill it full of grain I don't feel bad I don't Ducks I don't really like them I'm not like a fan of ducks I don't know if a like any birds and I don't really feel like any affection for birds but animals I do so yeah we can do that for little baby cows and bend them up and feed them milk you keep them in the dark and they never get to move around yeah it feels illegal it feels a tough thing and I'm a veal I really like veal but if you see how that's the it is tough after that once you want you know you know I tend to agree with where you're at because I'm from the country I'm from farm I see and I see this stuff all the time people are just trying to to get by and support their families but I am surprised to see you take that stance I'm very impressed by that I didn't know you had an open mind I thought you were you were narrowed in I've misread you Joe what did you think I was like narrow like hippie style very liberal you know I heard that you moved in Colorado at one what's Joe doing there that's a I don't I don't really you know that's where I really learned to not like hippies when I lived in Boulder that's when the reality of the hippie truly set in you know it's like if you're if you're around hippies at least seven out of ten of them are not gonna have their shit together sure seven out of ten of them we're always going to need to borrow sugar and you know the car breaks down they need to borrow yours yeah they're just they just can't quite fucking get it together well you know the the Eco movements a tough movement because if you if you go all the way with that if you go all in you got to start killing people you're anti human yeah right because the humans the only thing that hurts the environment so in the craziest parasite of all time they're sucking all the fish out of the ocean they say within like a hundred or something years there'd be no more wild fish in the ocean I mean it's incredible so we're sucking all this foot and then we're throwing our trash in there so this is gigantic like island of floating plastic as big as Texas in the middle of the Pacific and it gets bigger every day I mean we're crazy if you look at us from like if you were an alien species and you were observing earth you'd be like oh there's one thing just fucking everything up Wow yeah sure if you really wanted to go eco you'd have to start killing people you'd have to shut down power everybody gets a bike either you take a bike there or that's it and hopefully you don't get stuck somewhere north you didn't build your stupid house somewhere where it fucking freezes in the winter because if you did well guess what that's just where you are that's where you're gonna be walking around now and I hope your food supply lasts I hope there's plenty of animals around you you got to make sure you keep them coming because you know you know if cars anymore stupid right cars are bad for the environment yeah I'm glad that you recognized that though you know because I hear this eco freako talk all the time like you know be real careful because you're anti human if you know if you want to go all the way with that and most topics that you get passionate about you know guys want to chain himself to a tree to stop construction gets pretty wacko it's like you know make sure what you recognize you're turning on us you're choosing us over a plant that you know make sure that you at least acknowledge that yeah well I do know my issue that I've always had with people who are not just vegetarians and vegans but are really kind of aggressive about it and the way they they fuck with you there you know and they you know hey man I just want you to reconsider I sway to think about what you're doing well you're killing life - stupid I fucking love plants they're beautiful and gorgeous and you have to kill acres of them every year just to keep your stupid fucking fat face alive all right that's an animal that's our law that read it rather that's a life-form that is like you're eating life you're eating plant life right you know you can't get by without eating life all right life eats life period so shut the fuck up I got a chapter in my book on this very time you really about cutting down trees and it's like listen the older and bigger the tree the better with me if you're gonna cut it down you know let it go let it make some sunlight and let a couple of new trees pop up but you know that's the way that it works and we use those trees we build our houses and paper and then it's a it's an absolute necessity but those are here for us not the other way around and you know you hear these eco-freak oohs you know of course they only come out when CNN or some local camera crew is there it's often about them not about the environment that's where real frustration comes in but no I hear what you're saying you know in fact we were talk about Kardashian a minute ago somebody just recently threw flour or something on her in England yeah she's pressing charges you know it's like hey there's other ways to do it you know one of the anything you do needs to be nonviolent if there's anything we learned from Gandhi or Martin Luther King it's you don't come around using violence to get the attention that's what you know bomber went off course when people were spraying people's fur coats with red paint sure you know I mean come on man now you now you yeah you assaulted someone and this very thing one of the resources of that animal's body is now you you fucked it up and ruined it but listening to your argument what you do that listen they listen to your argument and you have made that animal's death really kind of worthless now because they're gonna have to throw this coat away because you you spray paint in it like a fucking asshole and it's it's ridiculous again another one to replace that one so right the punishment becomes the crime I get it well the whole thing is stupid it's stupid to try to enforce your opinion so so aggressively with paint you know that's assault your your fuckin asshole you'd be an asshole no matter what side of the argument you were on sure you pick the side and you went full asshole with that argument well you you know you run out and try to assault Ted Nugent you know it's like that kind of shit you know it's like oh he likes to shoot animals well why don't you go down to the fucking want to go down to the butcher go go to that place where a thousand cows a day have to stick their head into a metal trap and a fucking piston slams through their head go after them go go what are you saying you know you saying that we should every animal that's ever lived should just live forever and take over the earth this is stupid right you got to eat some of them well it's the food chain it's natural selection there's no there's no way around it and unless you want wild predators roaming around keeping the populations down you're gonna have to fucking kill them so few people understand that they say they don't understand how important hunting is for population control they don't understand how important it is for traffic safety sure the people who don't live in rural areas don't I drove home once I had a gig in western Massachusetts and I was living in New York and you have to drive down I forget the name of the Turnpike but I had to go 20 30 miles an hour because deer would just dart in front of the car docked in front of the car I mean it was an infestation sure I mean I've never seen anything like it since I might have seen two three hundred deer and a knife driving down this road it was incredible maybe I'm exaggerating let's say 50 dude let's say 20 deer if I saw 20 deer I'd be shocked so a lot of fucking gern I saw them all those other three deer most people can't relate to that you know and that's where our votes come from is the city in this I mean you gotta listen to these folks in the country that are dealing with these acts yeah things those things can fuck your car up man real dangerous people die all the time there's a fucking wild video recent one of a kid who's on a motorcycle he's going 80 plus miles an hour and he hits a deer and somehow or another he hits it perfect dead-on so he doesn't even lose control the bike he just when he pulls his bike over and his friend comes over he's like dude you could have died you could have died did you just see what that he goes back in the deer is just cut in half you literally like the deer exploded on impact that is amazing I have not say that as absolutely I'm glad I I thought that's what you're gonna say no I don't the guy didn't even waver I mean he didn't even lose control is like I use my own arrow the bike I didn't have like a saw you're saying this yeah and at 80 fucking miles an hour jeez so one time eating saves a motorcyclist in Iraq yeah no kidding yeah that'd be just a tawny yeah to talk to a physicist if he was slowed down what would have happened what have you not cut it in half it would've been hit I don't know well because yes it's like 80 miles and I was like a bullet you know just beam to run right into that it's just probably just exploded well but the kid lives and I there's another video of a guy and it's another helmet cam same thing and another one that where a guy on a motorcycle hits the deer but he loses the bike and he was in it was he was wearing like full leathers with pads like racing shit where they have like those really hard plates and the money and he got up and he was fine and you know and he was like telling people look this is the reason why you need to wear all this shit because something like this can happen and this just saved my life sure but it's a you oh that's a video it's about 30 seconds in when he hits the deal Wow see that what was that was it no you're kidding no back it up a little Wow he does keep control that bike yeah well he's a good fucking rider too you could totally tell because he didn't lose it at all he's a bad motherfucker is when that deer hits him he has a little jiggly moment see that and see that a little jiggly moment going 80 fucking miles an hour he hits a deer this is a bad motherfucker well people why I mean did this go viral that people probably know what we're talking about here oh yeah a lot of people know about this like I got a bunch of tweets about it and so then his friend comes running over and they go back to see and it's just splattered well I sure am glad that guy's okay that that would not have been pleasant I love bikes but I can't do that I can't fuck with crashing no you know there's something about riding on something that your rider and the bike know I see that you see the deer I took my safety lessons and I was ready to get a bike and I saw one accident and two friends saw two two other accidents in like the course of like three days involving a bike wow yeah one of them someone like on a phone hit a car or hit a bike just fucking nailed it wasn't even paying attention guy goes flying off the bike another one a friend of mine was riding through the canyons he hit some some salt or some you know gravel or whatever the fuck it was lost his bike ripped his shoulder apart and then it was actually right around the same time that Frank Mir got hit too I got hit by a girl broke his feet his femur that means like on his honeymoon I think was the break on his honeymoon it was definitely make a shun I know he's on vacation you mother was on his honeymoon he sure was in Vegas I wasn't really see I thought it was I thought it was overseas like the Bahamas I might be I might just be adding that element I used to be a historian Joe used to not need to consult an Internet if you had me around I think I now that about so many shows I've I've lost track you thinking about Tito Ortiz Tito Ortiz was in Jamaica and he got hit by a bus I thought that should happen to Frank at that Frank was hit by a bus on a motorcycle and his uh his I think it was his his wife were they were hit by a bus well I think he was unlike a moped or some shit yep that I thought that was hurt yeah that happens man there's only so much data you're holding your brain after a while those stories get a little squirrely yeah Frank was hit I think like right in Vegas and some guy just fucking ran a red light slammed right into him broke his bat broke his thigh sent him flying through the air and it took a long time for him to come back you know he's a really impressive case of a comeback yeah you know he's gone well cuz it didn't go real smooth you know smooth at all you look at like the branded verified - paid upon Oh fine you know it's like wow like where what happened to the you know the the former champ right now what happened to the dynamic Frank Mir that burst onto the scene you know they're the one that beat Pete Williams was that crazy a bar guard I remember you know Frank Mir was a beast and so that that set him back man I was a pretty pretty grueling injury yeah he's one of my favorite guys I really like him I enjoy Frank a lot is his wife's real nice you know he's a local Vegas guy he's a great commentator Second Amendment guy he's very good at it very much little imitates better than the interviews that he cuts yes somebody does an interview and people are turned off by him they think he's putting out an attitude I don't say but I read in here about these things but he doesn't do any of these totally different persona when he's commentating and I like that you know if he doesn't if he doesn't see it he doesn't say it he's pretty fair he's a smart dude he's a very smart dude he's a Kindle with him all the time Scott guys constantly reading I've had some really heavy conversations with Frank Mayer and you know that's why he's so good at jujitsu he's got so much technique too because he's like you know he's like an encyclopedia for shit the fact that he caught Nogueira in that Kimura and broke his arm yeah the jujitsu world just exploded when that happened Frank Mir not only did it he did it when Nogueira instigated the ground game because he hadn't Frank Mir hurt and he wanted to finish him off when that just shows you what a bad motherfucker Frank nearest that's crazy that he bested Nogueira on the ground and Finn while dizzy while dizzy I mean that's if that guy's not underrated damn yeah that's really fuckin impressed oh he's got his positions for sure you know I was cheering for Frank in that fighters happened to see him win you know as a fan but I took no pleasure and seen though Guerra injured and I liked that that was that was a rough one yeah really hard one to watch but Nogueira's back somebody told me Nogueira's booked for a card coming out booked for a card come up against Cheick Kongo yeah again so we shook it off you know Guerra I don't know how wow that's amazing and then I mean how I had the fuck that would I don't know what they don't they used to use plates or what I don't know how they put it back together again yeah that was fast but good for them in mirror he's gonna go fight for the world title against those Santos who I will never underestimate again I under I thought dos Santos was dead in the water with Velasquez I thought it was a waste of a fight I couldn't believe I never underestimate those Santos again he could throw heat man he can throw heat you know and I was really looking forward to him against Alistar I'll star in him would have been a very interesting fight man you know because Alistar such a pure stand-up guy and Alistar is so good at incorporating leg kicks and knees and you know with he's got a real tight guard especially now that he's so big you know like kind of like sure punches everything over protects himself well he's a dangerous guy to anybody that has to that it has to end you know and force a stand-up strategy if you want to just go and box with that guy he's got so many other tools other than just boxing you know right and he's so technical with his attacks it's just it sucks that he you know whatever his issue was and he's saying I think that I got some medication that you know some doctor gave him the head testosterone and he didn't realize it and it fucked up his testosterone to epitopes hasta Rhone I don't know what happened I don't know the story behind it but I guess he's suspended for like nine months now so well that was interesting you know the whole case was interesting yeah you know let's jump off that topic as quick as we can but you know one thing about that he took a substance test he for two of them were surprised test no substance was ever found and he came forward later and kind of volunteered him it looks like I might have taken some testosterone but that wasn't what the tests show the tests didn't show anything he just said hey there's something with your TD ratio let's try to figure out why this happened the meteor what caused it well you here's what you got understand Joe so I'm really glad you asked us here's your T and E okay here he says Astros for folks that's a strong attest i'm and they're very close you know they're usually even a one-to-one some allow commissions allow four to one or even a six to one difference but the reality is most are one-to-one now if your testosterone went up or if it went down that gap is your ratio with the same set if your epi testosterone went up or went down that gap is your ratio that's why it's a very disingenuous test so when a guy has a tte that's elevated the media immediately assumed that he took a strong his T could have been in the gutter his epi was at the norm and that get he could have been unhealthily low now I understand it that ou designate there's no distinction it's extremely disingenuous you will never find in endocrinologist not one in this country look at this is a challenge you won't find one no matter how disgruntled you won't find one to come on and tell you that it's a it's anything other than a disingenuous test for testosterone and these Commission's are missing this left and right really and it's it's absolutely horrible you know in some commissions they'll they give you just enough rope to hang yourself they say listen you're allowed go ahead take testosterone but make sure you're within the levels like no wait a minute that's not how it works there's a testosterone level you need to figure it out through taking blood well we can't afford that well you can't tell a guy he can take testosterone but you can't elevate it so it's a financial issue as far as you have the accuracy of testing you have to understand this Allister was 14 to 1 a guy could be 100 to 1 and still be within the legal limits a TDE ratio does not pertain to anything and you won't find one expert now I didn't say a doctor and it said I said an endocrinologist not one expert to tell you differently really it's absolute junk science and they can issue it so you're in recognition that does this yeah yeah it throws off your t2e well his tea could have been up he could have been down his eco but he can be done but listen a guy has every right to manipulate his testosterone every right the question is how did he manipulate it did he use a legal substance or an illegal substance and alliser's test four of them two that were surprised showed no substance was found now I understand if you wanted if you and i's formula right here we're just two guys talking we can share our opinion but if you're a media member if you sit behind a desk you wear the suit you collect a paycheck at the end of the night you're branded an analyst by your affiliated network you can't come out and say that he took testosterone when the test didn't show that he was never even accused of that and you know from Mark Cuban's tax write-off that nobody watches those guys could have missed the boat anymore they took pleasure in coming out and outing him for something that the Commission never accused him up ESPN missed the boat everybody got this wrong and they were quick to say that always taken to us well not according to the test an HD net it was I don't think it was anyone other than boss who was a boss was pretty sure you know and he's got his his own thing you know boss at with golden Glory's very well the golden glory which I really admire with him but man don't let that cross over if you're behind that desk you've got to tell a story the way it happened and they didn't it's hard you know it's hard I've done commentary before for friends and they didn't like what I said you know and they got mad at me and I would go listen man I I have to say what I see yeah if I see you do you're doing something and then you get caught doing that it's because I mean I have to say it I have to just tell people what to look for that's what commentary is I can't pretend that something different is happening so that you feel better about it when you listen to it but then the million people here they're not getting an accurate account of what's going on like that's I talked we had this conversation Joe in a bar you and I in Boston and and you you told me a line and I've stolen it I've used it all the time because it's very accurate where you simply said if you don't see it you can't say it you can't go out and trying to hype a fight go this guy stand up looks great if it doesn't if it stand up look shot it will then it stand up look shot it's not your job to try to cover for them as an and I've taken that with me and now I'm behind a desk in the suit and and I took that one lot and I've educated other people to just simply with that one like if you don't see it don't say it yeah you have to let people know what your real opinion of it is while being respectful and that's where people don't understand like just you know if I'm accurate about something it's not disrespectful it's just it's just uncomfortable yeah it might be uncomfortable for you but to label it disrespectful you're not seeing what I'm saying I'm not saying there's anything wrong with you as a human I'm saying you know when you you've you know you might do a technique wrong you might sir you might have an opening you might it's not a disrespectful thing but you know to a lot of fighters like it's your entire identity is wrapped up in in what you do but you owe that to the viewer that's who's paying to hear you not the fighter you know yeah I can tell you I thought I beat Michael Bisping I thought it was pretty clear it's very close you had a different opinion and I never sent you a text or was upset with it you you have your opinion and when you're on the mic it's your job to share that opinion you know my opinion but I should clarify that my opinion actually changed when I watched it again when I watched it again I thought your takedown sort of want it yeah I preached you know I have it the same way and I'm pretty objective I'm not afraid to go yeah I pulled one out it's hard though when you watched it live you know quite honestly I honestly get a better view of fights a lot of times from watching it at home the experience of watching on pay-per-view is fucking great I mean they always get to the right angle immediately it's never like you know sometimes I look up and you know herb Dean's right in front of me I can't see what's going on or someone's in a post I don't I don't know what's going on in the BOK like when Alan Belcher and husam are Paul Harris went at it that it went up when they first went to the ground I didn't know that Belcher he instigated that position from the shot you know he's the one who pulled him into the into that position and I didn't realize that I thought that Paul Harris was diving on him because I couldn't quite see what was going on so you do sometimes get a better view of a fight from watching it at home yes sometimes you get hyped up in the moment too it's it's hard to an off topic but speaking of Belcher you know the Dana gives a fight of the night fight of the night easily was Alan Belcher horse is scary he's flat-out scary nobody wants to fight him because if it doesn't go well you're gonna sit out for six to eight months he's gonna rip you like yeah it can go really really bad for the folks who don't know anything about the UFC or jiu-jitsu and you just listen to this podcast Paul Harris is one of the weirdest like specialists in all of the UFC because all he his number one thing is ripping guy's knees apart it's terrifying weird build weird technique Hulk looking dude yeah sure I've eight and just built like a brick shithouse and just dives on your leg and buries it apart yeah horrific the way he wins people are screaming in agony yeah and you know Alan did a great job is happy for me I see the fire pail Horace went to because you know of his backstory everything is overcome he's a great story too but I'm a huge fan of technique and Horace's technique it's not just his physical strength his technique is masterful the way he laces up leg locks on guys the way he hit miss NZO I mean the way he laces them up it's like it's so pure there's no fat in that technique you know I'm a fan of that but I'm also a fan of a guy like Alan Belcher just figures out how to deal with it I love that I love that he just worked specifically with guys like Dean Lister and instead of saying well we want to avoid this he was like fuck this I'll go to the ground with this guy I don't care I'll go to the ground without man and I think he blew his mind by doing that yeah yeah he blew mine when he started going for the twister I was like if he taps Paul haar is this would be the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen yeah because he talked about that in his interviews leading up I'll go to the ground I'll put him in an ankle lock I was like sure how many guys said and then he went out and did it I mean he didn't go for the ankle lock but he went out and did it he backed up what he said good for Belcher you know Belcher's had moments where I watch him and go you are amazing yeah he's and on a bad night he's still very good but on a good night that guy's amazing good for Belcher yeah and he's had some tough times you know with his detached retina he had for a while which is very scary I know imagine I mean you're a professional fighter and you start to lose your vision because of fighting so they have to repair your eyeball and then you know you have to have the confidence and the courage to go back out there live and keep throwing leather and letting people punch you in that surgically repaired eyeball yeah he was awful long time I mean you know how hard you have to work to make up that ground of those six months you lost and now you get another four before you got to work double time triple time it's it's incredible just catch up how long does it take just a cat happy to see Beltre doing well yeah oh yeah just to get back to work they're not no improvement in technique no improvement and conditioning just to judge a catch up how long like does it take to develop the wind for a five-round fight - like for a real like your rematch with Anderson Silva that you're training for how long are you in like peak ridiculous hard training to gear up for a five-round fight you know the answer I give cuz it's Mike is a lifetime yeah it's a lifetime I worked so hard you know - he's 23 and finished wrestling to go six minutes and it was so difficult to go six minutes at that pace of a wrestling match now you know now 15 months oh my goodness it's so hard when you start to break into those 25 minutes I don't know if the human being is meant to do that you know the saint-pierre keeps taking a lot of criticism well the reality is you're asking him to do a monumental task which is to go hard for 25 minutes it's it's an impossible task to ask somebody and there's a saying in boxing that if you go for the knockout you will not win a decision and you need to make your choice now if I go for the kill you know Dan Henderson style and you don't get it and then you realize that Shogun's still alive and you got to hang out for 25 it's not gonna be frequently five minutes you know you crazy fight that one yeah you got a pace and a lot of people go well Dan Henderson's not in shape well that's not the case Dan Henderson is a human being and human beings get very tired when they go for the kill so you've got to plan it right and George does plan it right now if you want to see an exciting fight shorten the rounds and George will go crazy I guarantee it he did before so you think it's just a matter of the human body has to work too hard to fight it a high clip for five rounds you know 25 minutes is just too much there's no nobody sprints for 25 minutes how would you have it would you have it I always felt like it's kind of interesting there's two two schools of thought one of them is that MMA is more difficult than than boxing and maybe the rounds should be some in shorter lengths but then the other school of thought is but it takes a grappler a long time to get as a down to work so hard for a takedown and then only have like five seconds left on the clock that sounds that's ridiculous you need you know a five round a five minute round at least you take a guy down within the first couple minutes you have time to work you hold them down you finish them sure no you have time to work I hear you but you know the competitor is in no sport set the rules it's the fans its audience that sets the rule so it comes to mean if you you are a fan as well you are a fan as well so if you as a fan I mean taking yourself out of the equation what do you and just objectively with all the knowledge that you have what would you think would be the better format well it is how I would answer you professional boxing is viewed to be very boring so so they call boxing very boring out boxing so well that's not true boxing is fantastic go watch the amateurs it's three three-minute rounds they throw punches and flurries non-stop for nine months so boxing is very pleasing professional boxing where you're asking a guy to do 12 rounds at 3 minutes 36 minutes is on pleasing you know commentators have developed this feeling out process there is no such thing it's a unwritten agreement you and I are gonna go box you and I both know we can't go 36 minutes so I'm gonna stand around and move around little bit you're gonna stand around and move around a little bit once we get to round 5 now we both can do 7 rounds let's go ahead and fight there is no such thing as a feeling out process in boxing I've boxed for years there's such a thing as surviving a ridiculous time frame that's put on you of a half of an hour and so if you have a guy hurt but he's got a good chin and you go for it you're fucked you're screwed I mean that is insane that doesn't matter you're not gonna find exceptions to the rule but yeah the basic belief in boxing and I believe it too if you go for the finish you will not win a decision Eddie Alvarez is that name ring a bell he's over in politic Eddie Alvarez talks about this you know you got five rounds you gotta fight how are you gonna do Eddie says I don't train for five rounds I train for two and Eddie Alvarez was like thirty two and two we had an amazing record any finished guy after guy but he also had a totally different approach I'm gonna go for the kill if I don't get it yeah I acknowledge I'm in trouble pretty but thirty two men didn't have an answer for it and I really I really liked when Eddie said this he and I were Bodog together and I heard him say that thought ah that's hyperbole and I started wanna know he's serious he trains to sprint and finish you and he does guy after guy and when a doesn't work well he's got problems Melvin Manhoef I heard you bring him up earlier you know Melvin do the same thing he's training for three minutes yeah three minutes of fury well what that's one of the things the reasons I love k1 I love watching high-level kickboxing it's three rounds you know big matches are three rounds you know I mean I used to love watching those three round k1 fights because that's about all those guys could take the way they were going at it the clip that they were fighting at I mean if you go back and watch like jerome lebanner repeater arts they're just fucking swinging at each other and they take turns knocking each other down Eretz knocks down the banner with a high kick and then the banner starches ernst with it with a left hook both guys have just got fucking waylaid on each other they kick like you'd swing a baseball bottom it's just violent you know hey speaking of the k1 of guys that did what what's up with Bob Sapp now these aren't real fights he's going to do in these countries right is the opponent in on the gag like this guy that hit after the bell for five seconds no Puja task he's a gentleman he's a sport he's gonna punch somebody after the bell unless in the back you worked it out hey let me cover up and act mad about it I mean come on that whole thing looks sofa gay Z that couldn't be real Bob sack gets a paycheck I mean this is my opinion but it doesn't look good the whole thing was bad and I think what made it worse was when pooj announced he kept hitting him after the bell like come on PO you're not gonna do that unless you know this looks this looks awful it's like when Dan Severn and Shannon rich did their their work you know Dan come on man you're caught on this this is brutal this is brutal and your interviews after the fact are worse than the poor job you did in the ring at flesh you see that fine oh you didn't so do you know what a roundoff is from gymnastics it's a jump ring it's a handspring and you'll use it to Dan Severn hit one of those in the fight I'll just let you know that Shannon did something damn several hits a round off in the middle of the Ring he's no oh god it was so bad Joe he was so and then after the match they do their interviews and they're interviewed and severance cover up of the work was worse than the work is well I was just fortunate to get over on Shannon rich he's such a great competitor you know Shannon rich who has never won a fight Dan seven as a former multiple time world champion you know absolutely legendary in our sport I was just fortunate to have good enough training camp together Wow have you got a stop man you got a stop we've all been in the locker room as Shannon rich walks in and says who wants the night off all right Shannon I guess I'll take ya you know this isn't a secret in the industry Dan quit you know come on you got caught just call it what it is wow that's weird well he always did a lot of pro wrestling as well didn't he get horribly yeah I mean you got a stent in the WWE just couldn't use and they said look you got to go just yeah not entertaining enough he just didn't get it he couldn't he couldn't work you know if you watch a Shannon match and you see how bad he did it it was so bad man it was so bad this was the brilliance of pride you know and and I get heat when I talk about vandal and cro cop doing their fake matches but in America if you're gonna do a pro wrestling match both guys will sit in the back and they'll come up with what they're gonna do they call it their spots okay you do this and I'll do that in pride what they would do is the promoter would visit one locker room so if you're going to take on Vandelay or cro cop you know your promoter shows up boom here's your 10 grand and here's how this fights gonna in Vandelay isn't privy to that so when the guy goes down his celebration is genuine because he doesn't know that the guy got his locker room visit it's the same thing with crow cup that thought one leg Cemetery in one leg hospital no crow come up your legs aren't knocking people out the promoter visited the back beforehand that's what's not gonna and then I made this public I added these guys cuz I don't like either one of them well it did were absolutely some legit knockouts for sure like for sure laying cro cop oh yeah I remember that fight I'd enjoyed their first fight too when family one way I think they call it a draw the draw handle it one you know per our scoring system you know but as soon as I said also be good Ridge and call me all these guys going yeah he's right well they had to be toccata it's like yeah I mean come on you know everybody's Akata and call me they'd have to put on your Colombo rain jacket to figure this out you know excuse me excuse me how come I'm 2200 in Japan and can't win two straight in America they uh they offered any afford by a no-name Jap it to lose or to win up to to beat tokoro they were gonna have it set up so but meanwhile it could have been a double cross where he goes there and he thinks tokoro is gonna lay down Karl beats shit that's what we call the screw job finished Jeff the Montreal Screwjob that's that yeah there's a word for it in the professional pool - I think it's a double dump I think you dumped both ways I see what it is yeah because pool is a real hard problem with that like I like say if I if I'm a pool player and you're a rich guy said listen Channel I got a fucking game and I can't go wrong here buddy I am I am robbing this guy come on let's put up 500 bucks so let's make some money and I go to em and I go listen let's here's the deal I'm gonna lose and we'll just fucking split this 70/30 and cut it up right now we got ourselves a big chunk of cash Wow and so there's no real match going on in the first place sure they had already decided they're gonna dump and they were gonna split up this guy's money that's him and a friend got together and they pretended to be rivals so they could gamble yeah and he would dump to this guy I can't fucking make a ball I know what's going on sure I just got hustled typical digs town hustle you know the two of them get together after this show and split up half their money right 70 percent whatever they you know agreed upon different guys were sharing food deals but it was always a big problem to the point where they had the only time Vegas allowed them to gamble on pool ever they they set it up so it was one of the big tournaments and all they did was make it they found who's the number one guy most least likely to wait 41 odds okay we're all gonna let that guy win we're just gonna gamble all of our money and fucking and pay right allegedly yeah alleged well that's unfortunate that happens I mean I can see where that would have with that is unfortunate because in in some weird walk of society that is sport that does involve timing and accuracy and training so it's unfortunate when guys but I think I get it I mean I I guess I understand that I didn't understand rule I can understand betting on yourself I can understand if you're some wild motherfucker like Bernard Hopkins says I'm gonna go bet $100 hundred thousand dollars on myself you know because that's how much I know I'm gonna win this fight I like that I don't like the option of doing it the other way betting on your opponent on your taking a dive now that's that's possible the fact that you could get your friend to do it the fact that there have been unethical dumps before without a doubt so no doubt about it I mean we all know of them you know I don't know if you've ever bet on a UFC fight but I don't know if you if you have it then you want to know this but the way it work and a lot of gambling halls you would imagine well if I show up it's four to one odds and I put fifty grand down I got 50 grand at forty one doesn't work that way if you go to bed at a sports book in Vegas on a UFC for this isn't the same for for everything but for UFC because there's not enough money coming in you could only bet X amount at a time then they reset the line and then you gotta bet it again I went in a bet on to the number well I bet on Henderson when he fought Vandelay now this was a number of years I think 2006 could have been 2007 and they'd only let me about 500 Henderson was a three-to-one underdog so I'd go 500 500 final and I you know I got to my $3,000 limit and I had to go to three different casinos now I'm quite sure with the influx of the sport that it'd be closer to ten thousand but I'm quite sure it's not over how confident were you though that's pretty fuckin badass just going to casino to casino I think it was good you know and you know that's what vani I mean nobody could beat Vandal he had that reputation like Mike Tyson was hanging on to for a while you know but you're talking about Dan Henderson you're talking about one of the baddest dudes to ever live he's a fucking tank he's something else man and I know it's gonna be a good fight - I didn't know was gonna be a walk in the park but you got a bet on your guy yeah well you know Henderson is a fucking tank man he's a tank he's one of those dudes where you you pat him on the back and feels like there's something wrong like why are you so dense like what the fuck is this he turns around look at his teeth and you know gives you some insult of some sort there's something his way of saying you know some mean-spirited knock that for some reason is charming when he does it that's how I saw it was would you get another fucking tattoo my mom he always he always does something mean as his greeting this is my favorite Dan Henderson story we were in Caroline's comedy club in New York and there's a sky that was heckling he wouldn't shut the fuck up and I go listen man if you don't shut the fuck up I'm gonna have Dan Henderson come over here and hold you down while he fucks your girlfriend crowd goes nuts and Dan goes why would I hold down when I could just stare them down fucking place erupted the fucking place erupted and it was like one of the creepiest things I ever heard a man say to another man ever like you can see the dude the dude just wanted to crawl out of the room and just just hide somewhere yeah the Fila looking over at that fucking Savage after he just said something like that to you like Oh change let me get out of here well in Henderson broke etiquette you know there's an etiquette amongst men if one guy's with the girl and one guy's not you you're always wrong you let him slightly let him look like a hero yeah it comes back to you someday well I think in that situation it was there was 350 fucking people in that crowd that guy was a jackass he was drunk Dan Henderson was there and he's like I'll shut this fucking dummy up right so I like it's a be essential yeah essentially like trumped my my heckler comment like I I'd shut him down and then Henderson came along and put the nuclear bomb on top of right he put the H but the verbal h-bomb verbal each bomb that's good work by Dan it was very good work on the spot like that the best line you could have ever written sure you can't write anything creepier than that yeah why would I hold him down when I could just stare him down that's that's like a guy has to think like that in order to have that thought in his head in order to be able to to say that verbally I mean if you're gonna be a writer and you're gonna come up with that it might take you six hours alone doing cocaine and drinking coffee to pretend you're the type of guy that would think that way to have that line come out of your characters mouth sure took Dan Henderson one half of one second sure he just waited well is the same guy that volunteered to fight Dos Santos yeah weeks ago move up arguably to wake Lucas truly he's he's a middleweight yeah he chooses to fight at light heavyweight yeah he doesn't like running away right it's a truly be going up to wait yeah anyway he's great sorry about something else me he's an animal this there's not those guys they almost all come from wrestling the guys like that Henderson stock there's there's guys that can push through pain and then there's wrestlers there's like there's another level of mental strength of the ability to endure and what you were talking about going through when you were a kid like being malnourished - fucking you know traveling on buses and wherever the hell you're going to these giant wrestling meet stuffs Lee and not getting enough sleep and how difficult any how to do schoolwork as well and how difficult all that is that the the mental toughness that wrestlers develop from that ridiculous first of all from fucking cutting weight all the time just to be able to people like to feel good when they compete they like to feel great and charged up and confident I had so many friends when I was wrestling that would be like this kid named Mark Collins he was a really good wrestler really really good but he would he would cut down to like 118 pounds he was a little guy anyway but he would cut down like really maybe I'm exaggerating maybe was like 127 sure we were in high school I used to be when I wasn't winning team they used to be but he the fucking guy was never happy he would always just have this dour look on his face life sucked he was just walking around is always hungry and you know it stunted my friend Steve's growth my friend Steve all of his brothers like six foot to six foot one six foot three big fucking guys he's five six cuz all throughout high school just fucking dieting going through regular wrestling and then going off to camps and never never allowed to like actually eat like full meals for a normal long period of time and grow like a normal man it's like he essentially grew up impoverished all right you know yeah and it's tough you know you talk about how hard the weight cut is and for us for our sport of MMA it's a 24-hour way I mean you weigh in the show starts 24 hours later in wrestling it's a one-hour weigh-in and not only that Joe the national tournament the whole reason you wrestle is a three-day tournament with three weigh-ins so you weigh in you do two matches you cut weight that night you weigh in again you do two matches you cut weight that night you come back for the championships up ah yeah so I mean you're talking guys that aren't sleep and they're they're just they're cut weight non-stop boom time to wrestle I mean how'd you know how do you do it and it really is where the rubber meets the road sometimes the best wrestler often that had the best season 35 and Oh will not even place at the national tournament because you know where he used to weigh in have 24 hours get on the mat he'd win a duel meet tournament style one hour way and you're on the mat next morning weighing again and so is that like indicative of a star I love competing like some guys like Frankie Edgar don't cut any weight at all other guys is this is that the case in wrestling as well like some guys would try to cut the most amount of weight sure but other guys would think that the best way to do it was be entirely healthy and just be natural and deal with a guy yeah large yeah you see that all the time you know and there's some guys that when I got a little bit more speed this guy you know he's gonna come in the ring at 2:20 I'm gonna come in at 204 but I'm gonna be a little bit faster than him and that's where Dan Henderson's made a living yeah you know Dan Henderson's beat multiple heavyweight world champion one from Big Nog - yeah phaidor this is what those are heavy weights but when he'd do yes he absolutely did but that was the rematch he fought him in a tournament call ringing of rings okay so that wasn't really MMA like you weren't allowed to do certain things like strike on the ground there was some stuff that was held back and you could strike on the ground I want to say baby palm you know open palm I definitely know soccer kicks or pride rules but yeah I mean it was considered I considered MMA absolutely folk gilbert-knight vogue cuz when you're on your feet could do everything right it was something about with the takedown I believe was an open palm to the head isn't that crazy when you see like oh bas Rutten style Pancrase fight sure what a weird fucking hybrid of the just for folks who don't know you were allowed to kick with you know yeah these like boots on that had shin pads on them but you weren't allowed to punch the face instead you could slap people full blast right and bas Rutten figured out a way how to pull his hand back way far and when he would throw I can't even bend my hand back the way he would do it and he would essentially be punching you with his palms yeah the palm strike yeah he got so good at just punching throwing like punching techniques in the palms where's everybody else had kind of like they hadn't figured that out yet and they were slapping each other yeah the boss was a master that I loved watching boss's old fight yeah well some of those were Fugazi to you but you know some of that Pancrase stuff you'd want up in that wait a minute yeah come on no doubt no doubt there was definitely some some fixed fights it's weird that some guys don't want to admit that but now I think they should I think they kind of owe it to history you know we know that there was a lot of real fights for sure but there was also there was no question about it there was some that are a little funky you know but that goes back to the point I made earlier that both guys aren't necessarily in on it in Japan right okay crow kapa those guys really think they wanted if you tell them they did it I mean you're talking about really hurting the guy's feelings where he get there you'll get fighting mad over that you go hey listen what fight century history what will come out and and show itself for what it is but you know what fight that's really hard because I don't know all those guys name but croak up fought one guy that war pro wrestling mask he is a pro wrestler he wrestles under the name of aa ghost Carlos yes Alberto Del Rio is what his name but of course you already know that that's what he comes out and says he very funny guy and he's talked about a lot yeah they brought me I don't anything about I gotta fight this crow copies official he's gonna throw a head kick and I gotta make it look real you know he's talked about cro cop would you'd be stunned to hear that i I believe I believe cro cop did not know that these were fake now I didn't have that realization when I first outed him I had I came to when he responded that you know what he's either an Academy Award winner he truly doesn't know and then you started to hear from some other guys where they go lucky you didn't always know the promoter come to your locker room so that wrestling guy when cro cop kicked him though he really fuckin kicked that guy in the head yes the guy sort of like just took it yeah and the guys just got to go down and boom the referee bleeding the referee was coming this could be is that the same guy yeah if it wasn't if it was fake what a fucking great touch sure has the mask if they had like a little blood packet there and what crocotta slaps it blood comes out and what a great touch that would be but you know you see a kick coming okay this is the one i got paid for you take it it can move cause a kick I had a buddy that went down he was by no means doing a dive he was just ready to quit he was just he just wanted out of there so you know and fighters will do this a lot where if something's not going right and they got it's time to go home and you know they'll usually the rear naked choke is the big one for hey get me out of here but so my buddy decides that he's gonna go down on a fake knockout so we're info dog in Costa Rica Dan this guy named Dan Stevens the big Viking guy used to fight in UFC a couple times named Kristensen is that what his name was anyway Dan throws the punch my buddy Jeremiah goes down the punch missed Jeremiah goes down but the referee Troy wah doesn't catch it in time so now my buddy who's out cold will doubt dan Kristensen is going to come down for the finish because the ref hasn't caught so my buddy who's pretended it has to come to life you guys to come back to life they likely their TKO so when you watching the replay like Maire thought you were out call how come when he it was pretty bad but you know you see that stuff all the time and that's not to say the score uh sports Fugazi that's just that's competition what you're trying to do what I'm trying to do when I'm fighting is make the other guy quit what he does has to do when he's ready to quit is make it look like he got you know that's just part of it and nobody wants to talk about that in fact one guy did one guy talked about in Ohio and the ohai I can't think of what his name was a former UFC fighter Rashad kicked him in the head Shawn Salomon that's what his name is Shawn talked about that if this wasn't my night I gave him an arm and I tapped out and got out of there he was very keen on trouble for he got in Canada because they they thought he was throwing a fight and he but what he was doing was he was letting people into the psyche of an athlete who's breaking he's breaking and it's an ugly deep secret and we've all done it as athletes whether it's in practice or in the ring and we're greatly shameful of it so what he did is he just let people have a good look this is what happened I broke down mentally the Commissioner comes out and suspends enforcement obviously you've never competed we can we can see that yeah that's ridiculous that is what exactly what it is when a guy gives up an arm he's trying to save himself and just saving a little dignity I got caught you know yeah that's that that is an issue the the real issue of people regulating athleticism when they don't understand the psychology behind being an athlete especially a combat athlete you know like there was an issue that I had and we'll we don't name any names here but it was when you you someone had questioned you about you fake tapping against polo philia pala Salem and you know and my take on that is to for you to ask a man what he's thinking right then in the middle of an incredibly emotional situation where he's losing a fight he knows it's over he got locked up in it and he's thinking there's gotta be a fucking way out of this there's got to be a way you want to win so bad you say something that you're ashamed of later and but to say that that thing that you were ashamed of that you did represents your character or your sensibilities or your honesty I think is a bit disingenuous just to be judged in that moment yeah in that vulnerable awful devastating moment yeah is not right it's especially for someone who has when you have competed at a high level for a number of years like you have it's almost like you could be considered like almost like a slightly crazy person like your fanaticism for victory your your need to compete in excel it be it the only way to get really fucking good is you got to be a little crazy you just have to be and you've got to want to fucking win you can't be happy with any any other result you cannot be hat or you won't achieve your full potential and that sometimes equates to people fucking up it sometimes equates to breaking it equates to mental lapses it affects to a lot of different things you know I had to respond to that I had a person again let's make sure we keep on one name but he wanted a response to it I'm going geez you know if I'm to be candid with you if I get tapped out in front of a sold-out audience that was aired on live worldwide television and I then lie about doing it the only person I'm lying to myself you know that's it the only if I'm trying to fool so if I'm in denial you know in me I could be anybody could be jailor I could be you know Fighter X but if he's doing that if a person look the only person you're lying to yourself did the guy fall at file a complaint with the Commission well that's within the rules you know you know what did the guy do if you can if he's forced you to make a ruling go ahead but you know to like you said and let's also not forget when you file a complaint how much of that is gamesmanship because you're trying to get a rematch anyway and the whole game is about making more money I'll tell you what Joe in my entire career I couldn't name one person that's ever filed a complaint I know they've been filed but I literally couldn't tell one guy that said to me and I know some guys think hey listen there was a misapplication of the rules I really liked a review and I understand that but I again I couldn't say it stayed a case for you but you know there's there's other things like the First Amendment I've got the right to say I didn't tap in any single fight that I want okay this second one fight ends the marketing for the next fight begins and if a fighter chooses to do that he's got everywhere there's nothing within the rules of a commission to say what a guy's gonna say in his post-fight interview that's that's silly so you will say you're essentially admitting that you will say untruthful things just in order to keep the hype going and that people should not miss it this is a blurry line yeah for me no wrestling blurry line now I'm not saying that for me but I'm you know if I'm saying me I just mean an athlete in Joe but it could be any sport but first off an athlete is not under oath right so he can come out and say but everyone he's just a person and secondly if one competition is it could be baseball or fighting or whatever the the the the makings and the matchmaking and the shuffling and the politicking for the next event begins yeah and for somebody to come in and want an answer for that and try to attempt to regulate you is beyond inappropriate I would I would want to say it's illegal again it comes out to first and that way I can say whatever he wants in a post-fight interview or post match interview or game or whatever is I want to take myself out of this now right you know person in general come on you can say whatever it was especially if you're especially if you're considering that part of you as a as an athlete to be sort of performance art you're you're actually you have an act I mean and that act enhances your overall brand I mean when you go out there and you talk a bunch of crazy shit whether or not you believe in him people start talking about you it becomes monetarily advantageous to do that you make more money that way Brock Lesnar like a perfect example you know UFC 100 all of his fights you know Brock was always fun to listen do you want to know who else is fun is Quinton Jackson yeah you know Quinton finishes a fight we all sit there in the living room wait wait wait Quentin's about to talk and he says something funny whether he you know gives you a hard time or like on black crime inviting people to an after party you know it's funny and that's that's part of the show that people paid for so that's not to say a fighter or again any athlete has to do that but if he chooses to he's got to be considered outside the scope of our the regulatory body I mean you talk about them overstepping that's that's beyond inappropriate well I certainly think you should be able to ask a guy after he's fucking taking a shower and tell us what happened I fucked up I said I didn't a bloke I was just losing my mind in there sure but but even if he doesn't if he wants to take it to the grave yeah let's not forget the guy doesn't owe you anything he's not her subpoena he owes you nothing including the truth if that's his choice so for a government official because that's how this started you were done governor for a government official to get involved and act as though he's going to suspend her up hold somebody's license because he didn't like something that he said in the media isn't appropriate I agree now what happened to you I'm uh I'm fascinated I'm fascinated personally by big leaps and development I'm always fascinated when you hear about a guy well yeah he was a blue belt and then something happened he went under a few seminars and before you know he's fucking killing everybody at the Mundy house you went from UFC was at UFC 60 that you fought Jeremy Horn yeah you were having some tough fights man very impressed that you know that by the way good job I think you see a lot of shows um I can't remember when my fucking car keys are but I'll tell you a random UFC I have no idea where I put my cell phone but but you um you fought Jeremy Horn and then was something happened between then and when you had a resurgence which was say what do you what do you attribute your resurgence you like what year do you think you know my start I know where you're going with this and let me jump ahead you know what you're saying is hey I had some major submission problems and all of a sudden I started submitting something not just that man you became a more confident guy you I don't want to say undermine your confidence before cuz I didn't know you I meant I mean the way you presented yourself I should say you you got way better at marketing yourself and you started fucking dominating top flite it's like you hit your own you had a personal wall and you got through that fucking thing you got through that fucking thing and you made a big leap you know and when when you fought Nate Marquardt I think that was the fight that really opened up a lot of people's eyes it's like whoa like channel son is a motherfucker I remember me and Eddie Bravo had dinner after that it was how about that power double goddamn it's like Nate could not keep you off of them and we were we were thinking about it it was like wow what a nightmare but you had you had figured out a way to get all of your potential out inside the Octagon what happened I appreciate that and you know you don't know in training either for me I had a fight with you should know comm he's ranked number two in the world and I was just one of those guys that was kind of looked at as a top 10 that was right before I fought in eight more couldn't it gave me a lot of confidence but here's what happened Joe I I have never lost a round of fighting and and when I say that sometimes a guy laughs can because I've lost some fights but I've never lost a round I've never had a fight where a judge ever scored a round against me until my last match with Bisping so at the point of your story though I sit down one day and I'm looking at I'm a sherdog.com I bring myself up I'm looking at my record I've won every round I've ever fought I've never been in a tough fight I've never had stitches I've never broken it I dominated everybody and I've lost eight fights and I lost all of them by submission and I lost all of them in the second round and I'm staring at that on the computer I'm staring at these numbers like a CEO would his spreadsheet and I'm saying there's something going on here and it's not physical there's something going on that I can dominate eight minutes of a fight seven minutes of a fight nine minutes of a fight and find a way out time after time after time in the same round with the same move and so I find I wouldn't got I wouldn't got help I wouldn't got professional help and I sought out a doctor ed versed egg I hate talking about this because this was a real seat was a real turning point for me is when I went in worked on sports psychology got hypnotized I was never the same I was never the same in practice my attitude was different controlling my diet being disciplined falling asleep the way I approached battle the way I approached the second round everything changed and it changed to the point where I hate to say what I just said and now it's too late because I felt like it was my secret I discovered so and I don't want other people to know I'll write about it someday in a book I'll talk about it you know what I'm retired but I'm not gonna tell anybody because it's competitive edge and when I started seeing a sports psychologist when I finally came clean you know I was like being an alcoholic before you can get help you got admit you have a problem and when I finally admitted I got a problem when I finally said it when I finally could ignored and look somebody in the eye Talent this is what's going on I'm finding a way to lose as opposed to win I work harder than these guys I've been at this longer I've I'm losing I know how to stop submissions I'm finding my way into him I'm finding a way out and that's what's happening I had to acknowledge that and once I did it I never lost again I lost the - Paulo which was you know the controversial one I lost to Anderson after dominating I've never been beat since since I saw this doctor that's incredible Joe let me ask you a question are you ever allowed to give a shout on the show like do you ever say hi to anybody like if I was to say hi Britney because my girlfriend just text me is watching the show and I mentioned the name Britney to earn myself special points is that gonna pick you off because I want all I'm gonna say Britney if that's gonna be like a cheap plug and you're gonna get mad I'll do it hello Britney thanks for tuning in thank you that's a beautiful storm and I knew they must have had been something on the mental side because you know I remember as you do that the ocean okami fight was an excellent performance and I remember being real impressed with that but even more so impressed with the Nate Marquardt fight because you know I knew that you should was a grappler I wasn't surprised that you were a stronger grappler than him but I was surprised that Nate Marquardt just couldn't stop you from taking him down he just could not stop you and the way you were doing it you were rag dolling him supporter like Jesus like this guy's a fucking nightmare for a lot of dudes man and we started like then we started doing the matchups you know you start thinking in your head what about handling it but when you fought Anderson man whoa that was that was a crazy fight man for four minutes or for four rounds and how many minutes into the fifth round four minutes and 31 seconds but who's keeping track four minutes and 31 seconds even of a five-minute round motherfucker what was that like what was that like when it happened it was devastating I'll tell you what they I had no idea what's happening in that fight none and when the fight was over I was devastated and they the I came to and I said to the ref you know the typical thing like a doofus what happened right the referee Josh Rosenthal is a fantastic referee simply says you tapped out and he looks at me for a response like I was gonna argue and I simply say I believe you now I knew that because ESPN zoomed in on that and showed up that's all I said I said I believe you and that was you remember what happened when you when you were did you think of tapping and you went out like what happened no I remember fall asleep you know it's a very weird experience if you've ever been it and I know you practice it so you have been but it's a very weird experience you know when you're actually going to sleep and you but you're trying to stay within reality and I remember having a dream thinking well if I tap I could get out of this now let's not tab if fight was over and you know I see you had already tap you and even I heart attack if I hit his foot and I didn't fully know what have when it was over and I came to I didn't fully know what hey I was just happened yeah most people by the way who have never been choked out will never be able to understand that and they'll call like fake tap and this nap but unless you've done if unless you've been choked you really don't understand how confusing it is sure there's a lot of guys who don't they don't know what happened right when they wake up yeah it's a mess and I'm one of those guys I was with the other people where I would always see fire school what happened after they got knock does it come on dummy you know what happened no you don't use specially from a concussion yeah eventually from chaos absolutely don't know you know so aside from being choked you know don't forget I've got fatigue issues I got blood and Vaseline in my eyes I got exhaustion I got anxiety I got exam I'm a normal human being I feel every emotion so many people say to me oh you're never scared yeah come on I'm a human at all but you know so wet so I lose the fight we go in the back and they bring me that the fight of the night check they pay you immediately if you get a bonus boom here here's your check and I remember thinking you gave me that out of sympathy cuz that was such a boring fight you know nothing happened you gave me that a simple I'll take it you know I'm fighting back the tears I'm just devastated you know I'm absolutely devastated by this defeat and later the fight gets named not only fight of the night it was called fight of the year we won the award from fighters only magazine which puts on the award show there for fight of the year so it ended up being a really good fight but my point that I'm trying to get as that's how out of touch I was with what was happening in the ring you know at one point my cornermen told me it's round for when it was round fiverr he told me it was round for when it was round through whatever it was the coroner had the rounds off you know the instruction I was getting was a little bit off and I just didn't fully know what was going on and in this next fight I'd like to you know as I visualize and plan for it that's one of the things I'd like to be a little more aware and a little more in touch with what's happening but it's hard it's hard in the octagon man a lot of stuff goes out the window you get hit you get kicked you get it's tough it's tough to stay focused how tough is it to describe to someone who's never had that experience it's almost impossible you know I almost can't do it it's like when you know an executive director comes at you and wants to know that we're talked about earlier hey why did you do this and you're kind of going you know I don't really know how to put it into words and I don't mean this condescendingly but obviously you've never been in that spot because it's one of those indescribable feelings and when you have victory that's also an indescribable feeling when you make that walk in front of 17,000 people scream and cheer and booing whatever it is that's also an indescribable feeling so it's a very unique sport and you know people will always ask me on game day are you ready are you excited and are you scared you know you'll get these questions and the answer is no but I can't tell you what I am either for all the human emotions that have definitions I don't know how to describe what it's like on fight day it's a combination of many things and if we're gonna be truthful most of them are unpleasant it's a very stressful situation you know you're walking into battle you've prepared for this and it's all on the line and it's on the line in front of everybody and there's a great relief if you have victory and a great despair if you have defeat absolutely proportionately you used a very interesting word there that surprised me that you you you said relief you didn't say happy you said relief and Joe you could not be more correct I I had a fight with Brian Stann after I was out for 14 months dealing after the Anderson loss I had to deal with the Commission I did go back and deal with these guys I got this suspension I got everything puts me out for 14 months it was eight days later before I was back to myself emotionally because all I was for that week plus was relieved it was the ultimate exhale of my life it well I wasn't happy I won I wasn't excited I was relieved it was over I was just relieved that I made it through you know from the way into the process to the licensing to the battle I made it through and got out of there that's very interesting that you used that word well I used to experience that relief from Taekwondo tournaments which in comparison to MMA is absolutely it's benign I mean it's not not even remotely as draining as physically demanding as scary you know all the above but I still would get a great relief when and when I was when I was done you know I'd go through a tournament I'd be over I could rest for a couple weeks I wouldn't have to think and then when I finally stopped competing completely it was the weirdest feeling ever this weird feeling of not worrying about six months in the future like don't have a drink now because if you do what if you wind up getting drunk and then you can't train as well tomorrow and then six weeks in the future you're you're off and you lose because you fucked up and you slack it off there was always this impending doom cycle with MMA it's got to be a hundred thousand times that no no last time I try to sneak out of here to go to the bathroom you may dance but you you go to urinate don't tell any but it embarrasses me I just sneak out like a little kid I'm sorry so don't mention it I won't say I'm gonna run out it but I don't want you to tell if I won't talk about it are you gonna snap okay no Joe I want to tell you this though okay when I come back yes cuz I don't know what our timeline is but I have a story that I want to make sure I tell do you know who DB Cooper is yes I do bring him up when I come back okay I will do powerful Chael Sonnen is he making a poopy I don't know what he's doing I'm not I don't ask a man asking man what kind of movements he's doing so that that note that Samsung Galaxy Note or whatever oh we're talking about the giant sofa yeah a Z it's uh it's no one's seen it it's pretty much maybe this big is 5.3 inch 5.3 so it's a mic it's it's like almost like a small Kindle or some small tablet and it's a phone and slips into your pocket and it has a crazy processor really ridiculously fast giant screen you can draw on pictures like suck it what's stupid you could take pictures and like you could draw to me when you watch web pages on it it's incredible it's the best cell phone web experience ever there's been a lot of talks that the iPad is gonna have a smaller version like a 7-inch version less phone I don't give a fuck yeah they should make a 5 inch phone yes make it stop it's we like big shit I use my phone half the time to look at my email half the time too you know I mean between 50 and 60 percent of the time is not making phone calls it's doing other cool shit getting online you don't think a pocket things gonna be a pain in the ass I bet that note is just a pain like having an old tree oh well I'll get or something I'm glad you asked this Brian because I've recently gone back to the fanny pack I got a new one I ordered one from roots because Andrew Dice Clay had it when we were doing the podcast with him and the other day remember though yeah you got it yeah I got it I did get a little jealous of his fantastically designed fanny pack I was like that's a real goddamn fanny pack so I ordered one online and two days later I got it I'm very happy so I carry that note around gladly inside my fanny pack I'm bringing back the fanny pack strong by the way shout-out to Chris Leben there was photos of Chris Leben in Hawaii wearing a fanny pack way to go Chris keep on rockin in the free world you know you bring up Chris Lee but if I can jump in here real fast I don't know if I'm interrupting something but I threw it an event I threw an event it was like an after-party with jail it was a colossal failure nobody shows that we got 18 people we got this whole bar to ourself you know we get drinks we got a DJ with it's a massive failure so we end up turning the radio off and we all just end up sitting down and talking about of the night it couldn't have gone any better I know everybody okay this guy's on is you know it's honeymoon this guy's wife bought him presents these these guys it's their anniversary these I know everybody in the room I know him by name I know what city they're from we spent about three hours talking and I'm telling them stories I'm telling them stories of UFC behind-the-scenes stuff you know and I'm running out of stories don't like tell us another story I'm like you know was great stories is Chris leaving the problem is he never answers his phone so they're like call Chris you know so I'm getting peer pressured here so I'm calling Chris on speaker I call him he answers his phone I leaving its Chael I'm at an after-party you're on speaker I got about 20 people here they can all hear ya I've been telling stories and I'm out I need you to tell one and he's like you want to tell him a story why don't you tell about the time that my mom hit a deer loaded in the back of her hatchback forgot about it for two weeks that her and my uncle come over throw it on the kitchen table cut it up with chain saws I've been in my room I've been punished cuz I got sent home from school on a detention so they make me sample the meat to make sure it's not rancid and I end up in the hospital for three weeks with e.coli why don't you tell him that story he doesn't miss a beat he just rattles this story on him he puts this whole party on its head people nobody left they are in shock including me I'm in shock wait a minute your mother I gotta go Chris I gotta go thanks Ann I just hang up the phone and because he did that for me because he told the story to this disaster party that I threw I've always been grateful and indebted to him I Kris I owe you what you know you saved me so there's my shout-out to Chris Lou but how's that for a great story that's a fucking great story oh shit what a childhood Wow oh he can go on and on but Chris has some other great stories you know how some guys have a rough man that's rough Wow that sucks yeah Chris is uh Chris Chris's aunt and uncle greatly raised him so he goes out on what'd he call it jet skiing or whatever whatever you do on the water scheme and he's out with his uncle and and his uncle is drinking and they tea bone above and his his aunt the uncle's wife is back on the shore Sunday that she doesn't go out with them they t-bone a boat and they hurt the people so the people the the wife goes over and they're helping the wife of the other boat is going over so you get the husband and the wife on the boat and you know she's not that bad but she fell over and her boat doesn't run anymore so the uncles tell him listen listen I've been drinking I don't have insurance but I really will make this up right with you if you just don't call the police so as a matter of fact here's my name here's my number just please call me and let's settle this oh yeah anything just guests ashore I got to get the hospital on my leg looked at they pull up to the shore the the ant stands up because she sees there some woman on the boat she wants to know what the hell's going on so she gets a little bit closer and she sees this woman is holding Chris's uncle's a piece of paper with his name and number on it she has no idea she's been tea bushes no idea they've rescued him taking them to the hospital and it's her husband's fault if she sees the number with his name on it says that's my husband bitch and slaps the woman who's on her way to the hospital because she got t-boned by the uncle so this is Chris's childhood so hey you know you like the Chris Libre so I could go on and on and on as a matter of fact I bought for $100 I bought a bunch of Chris Leben stories but they he started telling people that these were his stories that's not your story that's my story that didn't happen with your uncle my uncle did and I got the idea from a Seinfeld where Kramer bought a bunch of Peterman stories so I paid Chris everything he took the money and then he still was trying to claim this stuff happened to him so really what got for me how did you keep this story straight in your head why just because he's got three crazy stories and stories you buy I bought them all like damn it we went to Japan together it's a nine-hour flight and so he told story after story so I bought I said I'll give you a hundred bucks for the story but he don't know how it worked he apparently thought this was some funny deal where he takes my money and goes buys a little Saki and sushi those are now my so he didn't get the gig he didn't get it so he double-crossed me he took the money and he took the stories back I got nothing I'd write my own book storage Chris Leben stories would have been better oh that's fucking hilarious I've never heard of anybody buying someone's stories before yeah paid $100 for okay that was a lot of money but I only got $1,000 for the fight over there holy shit that's funny oh my god that is ridiculous now what the fuck was it like going to Brazil you went to Brazil recently you know after all the shit that you talked about Brazil and ministers of Minotauro and then oh no Garib brothers okay nothing's funny thinking that a bus was a horse that's funny you say that because good for you because sometimes when you talk about Nogueira people forget there's two right there are brothers you know you need to be specific you know every time at the big one or the little one are you talking about the fat one or the bald one we're talking about the one that used be good or the one that never was and it's important that you say that so good for you for saying there's brothers because a lot of people I just think it's the same guy filling it but it's actually - what was it like when you went to awesome you want to know why I had a great time is really Brittany got to go you know we go out with Dana and we were only there for four hours and you know first off Rio's beautiful I've been to Brazil before in fact I was at Abu Dhabi one that you were at I don't know if you would have known who I was back then but when when I Eddie beat coiler what was at 2003 I believe in southpaw in fact I was there Ryan Parsons was with us at any rate I've been to Brazil before you day with Matt and I loved it there yeah I wrestled myself I lost to Kakariko mr. guillotine remember that guy yeah that's wrong anyhow Lucha Libre speed up the story so we get there and we've got our own security detail and it's tight I mean these are these are some bad-looking dudes and I'm surrounded with tough looking guys all the time this was a whole nother level man these guys got the scars these guys got the bullet holes these guys got the the stitching and the whole bit where you gonna do anyway we're with we got this bad team now I've never been on a helicopter but I love carnivals I love rides so we go everywhere by helicopter which apparently is extremely common in Brazil it's like the number one heliport country in the world so these are good helicopters with pilots are very reputable and next thing I know we're up in the air so this is the ultimate carnival right now we're there on a gorgeous day in Rio which is a gorgeous city and we've got it from a bird's-eye view I mean I would take that whole trip all the risk all the danger everything that I had to go through for that 15 minute helicopter ride I'm a Catholic I went over this church that's like one of the wonders of the world it's not it's not quite as you know 8th one of the world like the pyramids but it's close where you look at it go how in the heck did you build that hundreds of years ago up on this cliff there's no roads up to it you got a walk it's just just incredible well there's a lot of speculation about the history of Brazil that's coming to light recently I think there's some Roman artifacts they found some really ancient stuff and some there's some dispute about they found some offshore wreckage like that so they they're now thinking that maybe the Romans had even visited Brazil even before the Portuguese a pretty amazing country when you stop and think about the last read the history of it yeah you know please I've been feeling when you asked me what was it like you mean how were we received yes there any threats and you know the way I like to tell it is that it was it was a scene man it was we were we were we were down in the trenches over there but you know the reality I really liked it there and it's interesting everybody knows who we are there you know if I want to be famous in America Joe I got to go to a fight if I go to a fight I'm a big deal if I'm not at a fight I'm not I'm just regular guy which is just fine but I mean you know sometimes people lose sight of that and in Brazil they all knew who we were you know they definitely knew Dana and they all know who I was and I mean all them from the bus drivers to the people to the people work in the desk to the cops everybody the people at the airports and here's how Dana described it to me goes chill everybody watches a playoff game for the NFL in America right everybody watch that cookie everybody watches that playoff he goes okay that everybody is 15 million Americans he said in Brazil 80 million Brazilians tuned in when Vandelay or rather when Anderson and Vitor fought so those are the kind of numbers that's how inundated people are with this sport and that's prior to us bringing them this new Ultimate Fighter with Vandelay and Vitor that's airing so what I'm getting at is this sports huge over there and and until you're there you don't realize it and so at any rate you know I'm getting recognized left and right and that's fun that's fun for my ego I'm having a good time you know I'm somebody and they want to talk to me they want an autograph they're all very nice now I didn't really have time to exhale and enjoy this because I've got so many death threats that are very legitimate you know guys not only tell me they're gonna kill me they're telling me how they're telling me when they're telling me the the lake they're gonna drag my body into you know I've got this security team because the UFC's been warned you know so I'm on edge constantly and I see some kid it's not the kid is that is this the gut you know I'm constantly looking around I'm only human that's how my minds worked so by the time we left the experience was great looking back at the time I was there you're on edge you know you're looking around who's the guy who's the guy you know my dad had a real basic rule when you thought you were in trouble don't let anybody within arm's reach if the guy comes with an arm's reach hit him don't wait for this first punch crap if you feel you're in danger and it gets within arm's reach you strike first and get out of there everybody's on you like this so I'm bacon I'm going against the most basic rule my own father taught me when I'm seven years old and that's let people in close when you're scared so I've got my back up against the wall you're not following his second rule but the first one's completely completely broken but you know we had a good time we you liked the fight was supposed to take place for people who don't know the rematch between jail and folks who aren't following MMA a lot of people that listen this podcasts aren't even MMA fans you after after the Anderson Silva fight you said a bunch of crazy shit about Brazil about you insulted them quite a bit and then they were going to have the rematch in an 80,000 seat soccer arena in Brazil but unfortunately because the UN is having a visit there two days before there was no hotels it was logistically almost impossible to bring that many people into an eighty thousand seat arena here just it wasn't gonna happen so it's been moved to Las Vegas was that good it was it were you happy when it was moved to Vegas you know if I had if I have to answer you yes or no the answer is yes but there's also a tremendous no and the know is simply that I was gonna get a be part of history and the current record is Toronto st. Pierre versus Shields 55,000 live we were gonna do 80 to a hundred thousand live and that would have been very hard to beat so I could have taken that record for not only currently but but maybe into my future years and past that story down to generations and you know again that's an ego boost and and there's something to be said for that if we're if we're being candid that I'd want the other side of his G's I don't want to fly 14 hours anywhere while I'm cutting wait now somebody has to anderson did it the last time and we fought in california so in fairness i'll go out there but how much does a person cut you know i don't know he probably weighs about 220 i've been still meaning he looks as big as me I'm I'm right around 220 he's a little taller so it's hard to judge but you know looking Anderson lives in California so he flies two hours to Vegas I'm an Oregon it's two hours to Vegas if we both got home-field advantage what's the difference in that in that aspect of it yeah the cutting weight is oh it's a very strange aspect of MMA isn't it it's really almost like an art and a discipline in and of itself and a battle you know they've got you you could be a black belt in cutting weight or you could be a white belt and you know to compare to being like martial arts like you said it is some guys are skilled in it some guys are experts you get your mic Dolce's they got more secrets than you could imagine to get weight off yeah and other guys aren't other guys starve because they don't know what else to do or they miss weight you know we see guys miss weight to and that's a big deal when you sign a contract that's part of it you got honor that how much of your thought process would have been dedicated if there was a fight how much of it would have been just too worried about you're worried about your safety constantly worried about your food being poisoned worried about someone fucking with you I mean what would have been like to compete under that sort of an environment the if folks who don't know I've never seen a crowd more nationalistic than Brazil it's amazing how patriotic they get it right that's the way you should be they get it right fucking get it right back your guy well I thought they do that in England but in England they also when when a fighter wins the guy wins they they applaud his skill even if a guy beats a hometown guy you know I've seen it in London I've seen them applaud when a fighter beat a local English guy and they were talking afterwards but man it doesn't happen in Brazil Mike Pyle won he beat Ricardo punch they were all together chanting some sort of gay slur yeah Portuguese gay slur no I'm aware you know that's unfortunately that happens you know you don't want to behave like a savage or uncivilized oh man we are on a society here and if you're a fan you buy a ticket you can share it boo whoever you want but that's where it ends don't touch a guy yeah I won't touch I don't like all the fans I like most I don't like them all but I never touch one but the same thing goes for them if you're a fan you don't reach over that rail and slap at a guy and throw your drink on I mean that's it what do you think it would have been like though if you had won in Brazil in front of 80,000 it would have been a scene I don't think they could have controlled it they swore that they could they'd have presidential security there they were planning to have the president of Brazil there so they'd have their Secret Service's like guys you can't do it you know there was just a soccer game there was just a soccer game in 73 people were trampled to death you know you can't control crowds when they decide to storm you just can't it's displaced responsibility I'm a sociologist I've studied this I've written papers on displaced responsibilities you can't control that especially when I'm the main event and the relevance to that is it means the beer started pouring five hours earlier so now you're not only talking insightful crowd you're talking about a drunk crowd and what I'm referring to is if I'd be to Anderson up I go into Brazil I stomp their hero and then I'm gonna do an interview with you and it's not gonna stop and I'm not gonna apologize to any one of them so how they thought they were gonna control that I don't know but you know if what did you think was can happen I think they would have I think it would have been bad I think it would've been very very bad and I and I would not have backed off one bit why is that because I'm not gonna change you know I'm gonna dance with the one that brought me I'm gonna be aggressive I'm gonna be in your face I'm gonna get my mind right my approach right I'm gonna do my job as soon as Bruce Buffer gets out of my way and and that's it and I can't change I mean I don't know how to change this is what I programmed to do and you know I hate to talk like one of those maniacs ought to give him my life Bubble Boy but Joe I swear to you hand to God I did give him my life to win that championship if I had to whoa I mean let's this is I have got a rock I signed the contract you're a little Brazil to do the fight and oh yeah my heart I thought I'd I don't know how I made my mother promised you wouldn't go you know my mother doesn't get it she's an older woman she's got a ruby or a diamond on every finger you know you don't go into South America like that let alone a fight it was just one of those deals but look this is what I'm gonna do Wow that's that's a crazy stance man that's a crazy mindset into I I don't know that I'm proud of that I don't I don't I don't mean to sit here and sound like a big tough guy that's not really what to do I'm just trying to be candid but you know this is what I'm gonna do it worked my whole life for it and if this is how it ends is how it ends but I'm gonna get that before I go you can't really discount the amount of a boost the hometown fighter would get from a crowd like that or the amount of shock the the opponent would get from 80,000 people bullying you and you were ready to jump right into that well that was one of my favorite things you know some guys beg for applause I've seen some fighters it hurts their feelings you know John John's gosh she hates if anybody boos and I'm on the other side of that man I'd I just I like it like it I love it when they cheer - you know I'm not the guy that feeds off negativity but I do feed off of it you know if a guy will pay three and a half dollars for an overpriced drink at the MGM and throw it on me that's a compliment to me you know if I've incited him that much he's a fan how long does that happen it's happened a few times you know where they've thrown something I've actually never had a drink I had one guy so mad he took his own hat off his head and threw it at me he missed but you know you get the point I kind of thought I always wanted to hand it back to him but it's one of those deals but you know they get so insightful but you know don't forget the other side of that coin not only they upset with me but they're cheering their guy you know if you want to ban your guy you're a fan man you work hard for that money you took the night off you know you talk dad into bringing out to the fight be a fit don't touch anybody but be a fan even if that means to boo so what that's interesting that's a very interesting point of view I would prefer people not boo cuz it's kind of kunti and it's disrespectful for someone who is doing what is essentially the most difficult sport known to man and and doing it for your amusement and just because it doesn't go the way of the fighter that you like you're gonna boo and hiss and say stupid shit that shows a massive level of immaturity that I don't necessarily think we need in this world sure I think it's it's 2012 and stupid asses need to catch up that's what I think sure I think when I hear people boo at a good fight I'm like that can't be anybody other than a fucking moron right you know and I hear that I'll hear that a places and sometimes I bite my tongue and sometimes I don't but when sometimes people are booing a good fight a good positional battle or you know a good they don't understand it so they're booing or it goes to the ground so they're going it's just it's so it's so stupid and disrespectful meanwhile st. dumbfucks will sit there and watch baseball they'll watch a live baseball game one of the most boring events known to man something that you could never introduced to another country in 2012 you could never bring baseball today with the Stig game you look at football and people just adored in this country and good for them but you know in a four and a half hour NFL game they're seven and a half minutes of action if you start the time and you turn it off I'm going you know I can't I can't play along that that's exciting you know I don't know I I don't know that I have a didi but I do for that you're gonna do and then you're gonna take a break and then these these big large but they're all muscled up and they can they run to their mailbox they gotta stop at the neighbors kids lemonade stand they're so out of shape you know these guys they played for seven and a half minutes you know how many times they're go to the water bucket what are you doing guy how are you possibly tired missin you're doing your show for several hours I don't know if I don't anything to drink you know what are they there I don't get it you know and some people cheer these guys it's like you know good for you I know I'm the I'm the minority I'm the one missing out my life would be better if I could really get into sports and have something to do I was on today because I'd have something to do you know are you fishing I used to have to count down ufc's which were five a year you know six a year and then pride would do four or five you know I would count those days down literally count them down me and my dad would be Titanic Abbott's gonna fight this guy we yeah let's not miss it we're gonna have a party and you know what I'm saying this if I can if I can get in that same passion for other sports I'd have a better life I'd have hobbies there's something to do like my friends is sit up and they watch SportsCenter it's somehow they're entertained by that I don't get it's good I think you're better off without it I don't I don't think it's bad to have one or two sports that you're into there's not nothing wrong with that but I know guys who their whole life is just following other people doing shit mm-hmm no I hear you I hear you that happens a lot I can't get behind football I appreciate it I respect them as athletes some incredible athletes in football but to me it's just I don't care what you do with that ball it doesn't mean anything to me yeah no I understand you know I mean I was on Jim Rome earlier today and it's like you know Jim how many times have you had to sit here and interview a golfer or a tennis player or a nascar guy could you imagine being a NASCAR you push your foot down you make left turns all afternoon long and somehow that's a that's some meaningful event to society and I'm scratching my head going you know I wish that I was one of those guys that enjoyed this but I don't get you're making left turns all Sunday afternoons whoa what damning appraisals of America yeah and I don't understand you know I'm talking to Jim Rome and it's like you know Jim good for you you finally got somebody you know you're welcoming he is very welcome he's an absolute Ally to the UFC you know he ain't a white went on a rant one time was great against the ESPN where he was mad ESP out and then he finishes by going away the only thing good as Jim Rove you know he did he made sure to give Jim that property because Jim deserves it he's one of the those leaders that came out and he embraced martial arts and UFC in it to be specific yeah good for him I'm glad he did that no I want to tell you this story can I okay so I wrote this book the voice of reason which comes out tomorrow let me get myself a VIP pass to enlighten thank you very much VIP pass and layman hits of bookshelves tomorrow it's available right now to amazon.com this isn't a plug for the book that was the plug I'm done okay I want to tell you a story and I've only told this story twice in my life so I don't know if I'm good at telling it I told this see when you write a book these days you don't actually have to write anything you talk it all out it all goes into the you know stents of whatever they call it and then they they go back and they they type it out for you so I tell this story and I know who DB Cooper is okay I know who DB Cooper's my whole family knows and it's it's been like a family secret or or however for a number of years so you know who the guy is I know who he is he's alive and well and a lot of times over the past few years somebody will be on their deathbed you know this just happened about four years ago guys on his deathbed and he comes out designed DB Cooper and he tells this whole family and they go to the media and the media jumps behind it says well it must be true because why else would you want to go down as a criminal on your deathbed and I'm sitting there and I told everybody that would listen when they look into these facts that this guy's putting out I assure you that won't be DB guy told everybody but I never told him why I never told him how I was so confident it's a big big world wide news DB Cooper case finally saw and then they unraveled it sure enough it was if I told everybody that wasn't him Larissa's I know it wasn't him as I know who DB Cooper is my whole family knew and it was a secret and my father passed away so now the seat now now my oath to keep it a secret has also passed away I don't feel that I I can't reveal there's a line he's alive and well I know exactly who he is so I tell the story in my book you know there's a lot of things that happen in the DB Cooper case and so I need to really make this shorter I could take up your whole a whole show with this but one folks who don't know who DB Cooper's once you explain that very famous well he's the world's most famous hijacker and I believe he's the most famous one because he was never caught but - he may have been the first hijacker you know I want to say this happened like in the 70s and DB Cooper hijacked a plane he makes it through security or security is totally different back then gets on board he's in a cheap disguise he orders the plane be touched down says he's got a device you know a bomb a bomb in his in his in his bag shows it to a flight attendant they touch down there he is brings in my part that now that's a sketch to pause of course nobody knows what he actually looks like but that that's the sketch deposit if the viewers can see that so in any way they touch the plane down they bring him his 200,000 in cash and unmarked bills and they go back up well while they're up he parachutes they don't know he's got a parachute now where the story gets interesting is he was never found but the money wasn't either no sign of him was found his parachute wasn't found his body wasn't found and one of the things that was a problem is where he jumped was a mass forest I mean miles upon miles hundreds and hundreds of thousands of square acres of nothing before so basically what any expert oh say look he didn't make it if he even made the fall he would have been eaten by coyotes or bears there's good reason why we never found his body and it's not because he made it out of there alive okay now you need a couple of those details so how do I know well a family friend and I put this all in the book I put all of this in the book and the publisher didn't use it and the reason he wouldn't use it is because I won't tell the name I tell the whole story I'm about to do that for you now but I don't reveal the name he goes with it without a name I can't use I go wait that's ridiculous I can touch on every single detail you know my poster going hey I don't think you know who DB Cooper's I think you should I think you should google him you know there's movies made on him Prison Break just had a character pretending to be DB Cooper folklore has been made out of this guy well where this guy jumped was was government land but that land backed up to Indian land and this gentleman was part Indian and he grew up in this forest this is where he spent his summers months after months they would go out and camp in there you know in between school breaks from the time he was a little kid all the way on he knew right where he was jumping and if anybody could have made it it was this guy now my dad grew up with this guy he was a family friend and back then parachuting well much like now is very uncommon if somebody does it you go tell all your friends I found this parachuting class I'm gonna do they take pictures and they showed up this guy was taking parachuting lessons he didn't tell anybody and he started taking motorcycle classes and I wasn't telling me but he was racing these bikes that's why that's what my dad personally believes though he never got the started that heap that he parachuted had a hidden motorcycle and rolled it out that's my dad's personal theory so you know all this stuff comes down and and many years later the statute of limitations is up and all of a sudden this guy starts collecting a pretty good assortment of toys from shotguns to four-wheelers to motorhomes my dad's known his whole life he knows what the guy does for a living he knows what his wife doesn't he what the heck's going on here you know how come where you getting all this money and the guy says why I'm an Indian and and when you reach a certain age you get some Indian money and there's some truth to that there is Indian money that's given out if you're if you're a native living in America but you're talking about like $1,800 a year when you get older about three grand a year this guy came into a wide assortment of money well the sketches came out of DB Cooper and it's a spitting image of the guy that picture that we looked at yeah it's just wow there was different ones of him in the disguise with the mustache and the whole bit but it's did they're going hey wait a minute this looks just like you so uh you know one night my aunt asks them there they're at dinner they're all family friends my parents are there my aunt and uncle are there this guy and his wife are there my aunt looks across the table of flat out says are you DB Cooper and he said no but the way that he said no told everybody there that he was and they never brought it up again ever now is it came out and my uncle asked him a little bit in private hey you know that other night we were having some Chinese food and you well my parents and uncles weren't the only one that thought he was the government did too so the FBI had visited this guy that he even moved away for a while went to Arizona and then slowly came back but you know he was talked to by the FBI thought he was DB Cooper as well so when my dad was on his deathbed you know we he and I had a you know you asked me whatever you want I'll ask you and I'll tell you how the story really happy you know it's a bit of a fun moment between father and so everybody leaves the room say hey that won't really happen that night when you came in this way I'm smelling like bourbon yeah really happened that day the principal called and claimed that you and your friends are so we got to go back and forth and I asked him flat out is blah blah blah DB Cooper and my dad said well all the evidence is saying that he is your uncle believes that your aunt believes that your mom believes it I don't think he had the courage I don't think he was so my dad's final ruling on his death that was no he said he wasn't but he's DB Cooper I know really absolutely there was another theory that DB Cooper was a serial killer that he's a guy who had killed his family I believe so you find that what are you looking up Ted Cooper's is this some chick who's claiming how is he looking this up so fast it's like you or I have the thought and he's got it on the screen fingers that's that's very impressive a few years listen I can't put in a book if you won't say the guy's name my father's story I can't you know I can't do it I can't do it it's pretty goddamn good story that's one of those rare folklore type stories yeah it just gets passed on and on nobody jumped in Washington State you know the jump DB Cooper high ne jumped and watch the guy lived in Oregon that's where he went so that you lived in Oregon most your life yeah I'm still there Bigfoot yes or no well absolutely yes really yeah but you know the Bigfoot makes it sound like you're some conspiracy theorist I believe there are Sasquatch I mean I believe this because people that I believe and trust including a doctor has said look I know where they are and everything yeah he says it's very hard to get to and he's got this plane it's got this big grand plan he's a survivalist because this whole plan lined up about about how he can get to him and his personal belief and you know it's just a theory but he lives in that part cuz Bigfoot's supposed to be from the Northwest yes he lives in those hills where all these Bigfoot stories come from and he's like look it's not a Bigfoot like it's some wild monster living out there I believe there is a pack a family of Sasquatch they just haven't been discovered we haven't photographed and learned about it I believe there's an entire tribe of these Bigfoot Wow well how come no bodies no nothing no good pictures all the pictures are bullshit all the stories have holes in them Oh tremendously tremendously you never watch Finding Bigfoot oh yeah I do I'm embarrassed to admit to you that I think there is a sasquatch you know because I know the kind of people that that well I'm asking because you lived up there and that's where most of California talk about the bodies but the truth is what bud is you ever find you know bears are out there they're out there do you ever walk through the forest and find bear carcasses for biota you know you sure don't in to your point there's a number of hoaxes there's a number of guys dressed up in a stupid outfit that you could buy any Halloween run through what his buddy records and they stick it on the Internet I get that there's hoaxes but there is some pretty good footage you know you said there was none there's a very good footage as a matter of fact I've done a lot of work in the movie business and stunts and stuff and this topic comes up on Hollywood sets and these are the best guys on earth for designing things to look like humans and they've said that there is one video where as he moves the muscles in the body part move and stunt coordinators and makeup and costume people in Hollywood say there is no costume created to do that okay they don't all say that some of oh you I would love to hear what you some of us who do say that and I think they're idiots and I think if you look at that that's a man in a fucking monkey suit oh it's not even a good monkey suit and the man who did it Satur s'en look up the Patterson Bigfoot footage the guy Patterson was a con artist not only was a con artist he was arrested for writing a bad check to buy the very camera that that video Oh God him and another guy conveniently I was looking for Bigfoot be embarrassed you know if you if you break this writers because I've looked into this I believe find it fascinating I believe it's very possible you know one of the reasons why I believe it's possible because Jane Goodall said it's believe it yes yes it's a kind of monkey suit bro that doesn't even look good it looks stupid look at his big fat stupid fucking surety as on big hairy fucking shirt and big stupid looking shoes that's a terrible monkey suit and he's just hot she looks good to me but there's other ones Brian that have been leveled see that's the that's the footage of him falling down some people have set it through computers there there you go there you see it better that's a better video of it no no what we just saw back then you would just you just had it in the middle it's better I do want to be clear before I become the conspiracy theorist oh that's what it is I'm sorry the beginning of his soom there's one monster I I believe that there's so many ass fucking legs well I got it is not that's so stupid you're making a pretty darn good case right now does that shit I'm gonna have to say come on look how dumb that looks it's got tits too what's that they have double d's is that is that what gorillas have get the fuck out of here bitch that's fake that's fake as fuck I have a good fake meter and it just looks at that thing I look at its big stupid looking shoes that he's wearing those aren't feet get out of here that's a fucking monkey suit it's not even a good one they took a video of a guy the guy just so happened to be out there looking for sasquatch and oh yeah I fell off my horse and immediately while I had my camera ready we saw the Bigfoot just roll it along not a care in the world now let's make sure in fairness that if we dissect that video and we decide that dice that videos garbage that doesn't make the whole theatre people not I do not not believe in Bigfoot and one of the reasons why is because we're the area where is this most Sasquatch sightings are is right at the end of the Bering Strait and between Laska and the northern coast of the United States or the excuse me the northwestern coast the United States that's where all of the Sasquatch sightings the huge majority of them were for a long time they started spreading out all throughout the country and who knows how many of them are bullshit yeah you know the number is weird but the American Indian had to the American Indians had over 200 different names for sasquatch or 20 some some of the to something with it to a bunch of them they don't have like a lot of mythical animals this was a this was a real thing that they thought lived amongst people and it's a real animal that used to actually live oh if you follow the Bering Strait in Asia it's called Gigantopithecus it was an 8 foot tall like pronunciation you're AB a huge Bigfoot it was essentially Bigfoot it is the exact animal you know now I want to tie this school of thought that you know I said yeah I think there's a sasquatch you say and then we both agreed on this video we have different opinions of the video however if we prove the video one way in my favorite or you're it doesn't it doesn't prove the answer to our our original thesis which is is there Bigfoot and you see this this flaw this pitfall is we like to call it in human thinking when it comes to alien encounter how many times have we seen somebody that says hey guess what I was abducted by aliens and I was given a special power in fact to prove it I'm gonna go ahead and make that light turn off by sitting in my chair and not touching it and that will prove to you that I was abducted by aliens and given this power so now I sit here I make that light turn off okay I've got a power to turn that light off but having that power does not prove that I was given that power by being abducted by aliens but there's a pitfall in human thinking and often times if you can get people to believe one thing one way or the other they can then connect that to a completely isolated and separate incident which is which is what I don't want to happen with the video because I'm realizing right now I'm looking like a real doofus after looking at that video yeah well I don't need to get my my evidence together and come back that video was actually not only was it proving a hoax but the guy who played Bigfoot wound up confessing so yeah or is it that's the conspiracy that could be they could be just a guy look any time there's some sort of a serial killer people will come out of the woodwork to collect like the DB Cooper thing the same thing bullshit there people are crazy absolutely but that just stinks to me I look at it looks stupid I hear people experts talk about I'm like bitch what are you talking about that doesn't even look remotely real it just it looks dumb and the way it was created is just the odds of this guy finding it no one else has gotten a good photo of it but that doesn't mean that it can't be real if you fly over the Pacific Northwest and you see how dense that part of the world is people I don't think a lot of people really truly understand the amount of acreage of really almost impassable rainforest you deal with in the Pacific Northwest when you fly over these areas where these people are talking about sightings and they don't just have sightings by the way they also have real sound effects these sounds that are some sort of primate that's screaming out and they've sent these things to experts you know people were to try to detect hoaxes you know and these people that have been on a camping and hunting trips recorded these things and these are primate noises they don't know what the fuck it is but it's a primate noise and one of the guys that I think is a real credible guy that has had an encounter as Les Stroud you know the survivor man yeah that guy was staying in Alaska he was doing one of those survivor things in Alaska and he said that he was asleep and he was inside his tent or trying to sleep and in the middle of the night he heard primate noises he heard primate noises in the woods near him and he got out of his bed to try to look and he heard just something running and crashing through the trees when it heard him and to this day he has no idea what the fuck it could be could he said it couldn't have been a bear he goes it was very clear primate type neither something along those lines something there's just not a bear and whatever the fuck it was he said it was enormous it might be possible if there's it's there's enough dense forest that there might be just a few animal I mean try finding a fox good luck sure go try to find a fox good idea the day I was driving in Studio City I saw a coyote this is motherfucker just wandering around go try find a coyote in the wild go just go go look for one and there's millions of those cunts coyotes are everywhere to live in the Pacific Northwest to be a primate it might be possible well we tell the theory of evolution so your talk about a sasquatch your talk about a derivative of a human so you've got to assume that they're a little bit more intelligent than say coyote if it's hard to find a coyote is gonna be very hard to find a sasquatch if it's true I mean I'm just fueling the fire I don't want to come home for the guy I believe it because the guy happened to trust just says look I think it's true and so I'm choosing to believe him more than I believe the evidence how many people do you know that have seen one me at zero zero you have a zero even the guy I trust has never claimed that he's seen when he just said look I've looked at the others I just think they're I think they're they're Jane Goodall she's a monkey expert she said a hundred percent really hundred percent son so that way shaking your head you don't think so no what do you think what's the numbers I think the whole thing's bullshit that comes an alien encounter you get people used to work at the Pentagon and NASA that kinda claims aliens you know of course oh and and again it's it's a flaw in human thinking because the guy works at NASA what NASA's got 3,800 desk you don't think a crazy person can get it that's there every now and then the same thing goes for the Pentagon I used to work at the Pentagon the Pentagon's never employed a madman get out of here you know show me Nate don't don't give me a pitfall on human thing I actually cover this in my book it's on page 92 in the voice of reason I talk about human pitfalls and it's why we're able to believe such outlandish and crazy things do you remember a year 2000 y2k we all went into a I stayed home with water ice water and canned foods I stated as well I didn't have my supplies I should have I was a college I didn't have money for what for the water canned foods but yeah you know we all buy into it and it's it's this hysteria with no evidence yeah and it's real loose evidence 2012 December 21st end of the Mayan calendar yeah except recently they found newer versions of the Mayan calendar that they had never discovered before that were more complete that go far past December 21st ten year ten more years of money-making yeah you know ballin you got ten more years of pollen son I failed you know thank you for that line you finally contributed today's show besides setting the whole thing I'm nice pipe it over there you look like an intelligent guy you just haven't said much today I'm do you think he looks like an intelligent guy I was really saying Chael Sonnen he knows how to read a man right up right up until that he got all these wires me I know he sigh I know he's done something today that we couldn't he's got an odd form of intelligence it's true what would you describe it as well I wasn't meant by that my encounters that it was 10 more years for the people that are behind the whole thing to make more to say oh we said 2012 there's what books there's fucking products there well remember that one when we had Pinchbeck in and he's like convinced that something's happening it's like any time you're convinced of anything I'm like what you know it's gonna go down you come to me falling apart right before our eyes I can't rebound a long time exactly yeah they kind of flexible isn't there a bunch of people like fucking with it right now and trying to put it back together again you think they're not gonna be able to figure out why are they figured it out in the first place and do you even barely understand it because I barely do watch the stock market scroll across my screen it might as well be Mayan hieroglyphs right I don't know what the fuck that means do you know what I mean that stuff means no yeah and yet the ones without us yeah no the bottom line is relaxed you know it'll it'll work itself out yeah things might get tough but how spoiled are we anyway you know I always hear these debates on education it's like well look when my father went to school that wasn't all that long ago not like great great my father just my dad when he went to school in high school if you went for four years you graduated that was it there were not standard-setting you must pass this class you gotta have a home for any kind of geometry Nia if you show up for four years you'd get a degree and you know back in the olden day there was no first grade second grade third grade they all went to school together everyone in the neighborhood showed to the same school in the teacher taught them all and those are the same people that have now built our bridges and our churches and brought us technology and evolved into Steve Jobs and Apple and Microsoft and Bill Gates and these wonderful things so apparently the education system doesn't necessarily need this great revamping I mean before we even had textbooks and computers people were learning and people were doing great in this country so you know we've gotten so spoiled and we've turned weak you know we become feminized and our masculinity is gone and a lot of things such as having grit and digging deep and if the economy sucks and you got to find a better way and you got to cut back then that's what you got to do but grin and bear it you know you don't go build a hole in a cave somewhere and wait for the end of the world man up well one of the issues with you know trying to get by in today's society and bringing your kids into schools is that there's a lot of fucking people out there that have done a real shitty job of raising kids a real shitty job and when you put your kids around them your kids are in danger and there's liabilities and there's all kinds of bullying and stupid shit that goes on and crime and if you can't figure out a way to get your kids out of those situations they never even have a chance to let the system work on them a big part of what school is is sending your kid is some sort of an awkward fucking prison that they're stuck at for many hours a day especially if you lived in any sort of economically compromised situation any sort of place where there's a lot of poor people any place where there's a lot of people that are down and out and there's a lot of fucking shitty parents and you got to go to school and deal with gangbangers and all kinds other craziness while just trying to stay alive trying to stay healthy fuck learning good luck half this country good fucking luck trying to learn something in public school and how much energy is our politicians putting on that how much does anybody changed budgets where they're enhancing school budgets and and paying teachers much more trying to make it commensurate for what it's worth make it commensurate rather for what it's worth like like like like a doctor like having a good teacher is just as important as having a good doctor you're having someone that develops the way you fucking think about life not just shows you information that you need to memorize for some stupid fucking test that you're not gonna absorb anything out of they they show you how to think they show you how to live your life they show you good examples of people who have lived quality lives and they get you to think and pattern your thoughts in a certain direction and most kids aren't even getting that today most kids are getting a fucking experience in public school that's what the problem is sure people need to man up absolutely fucking for sure but that comes it also comes with having kids and raising your fucking kids and being a man in the first place raising your kids properly incorrectly well how many people are doing that man it's a small percentage it maybe thirty percent let's put a number on it let's go crazy and say it's thirty percent that means you're dealing with 70 percent possible fuck-ups and not every kid that comes from a fucked up household becomes an asshole but goddamn a lot of them do how many times did you have to deal with kids in high school and college even they were just a fucking mess all the time and it was always because of the way they grew up it always cuz their brother fucked them over their parents fucked them over nobody paid attention to them and that poor asshole just gets jutted into the school system and has to fucking figure out his own way to the surface of the water that's the problem it is partly because people a week and sissified in this country but it's also because the system is run by cunts the system is run by a bunch of greedy cunts it don't pay attention to the most important resource this country has its children the most important resource you want have a great powerful country you got to have a smaller percentage of losers and how do you have a smaller smaller percentage of losers we have to go into the fucking places where there's the most losers economically and help those fucking kids Joe you were on fire right now it's true right going I'm a sociologist is what I got my degree in you are on fire right now you're saying this in a simple manner but this is actually very deep you know the first time I ever came to one of your comedy shows you know I went through school I wouldn't got certified smart I sit in on lectures I've written papers I read every book and get my hands on I left your first comedy show I've never thought more than I than I did at your show I thought I can never tell him that or he's gonna go you're listening to it a high comedian you know I'm gonna look like a fool by telling us but I couldn't disagree with you more but you know when you say very simple things like marijuana's never killed anybody and 14 people died last year because coconuts fell on their head we're not 50 we're not making coconuts illegal I can't help but look at that and have to think and rethink my stance you know and I'm like I don't I don't want to agree with Joe I'm on the ride he's on the Left I don't like this but why don't I like it cuz he's making a damn good point and what you just said could be two or three chapters in any sociological book you were right on the money well I mean I'm not on the right or the left I'm on the right about a lot of shit I'm on the right about guns I'm on the right about punishment I'm gonna write about a lot of things I'm on the Left when it comes to people having fucking freedom you know your libertarian I'm much more of a libertarian than I am a liberal you know there's a lot of social I believe in a certain amount of social Darwinism you know I think but I don't think it should ever apply to children you know I think if you want to be a fucking loser and you want to go out and your life and fuck it up that's one thing but I think a tribe protects its children you know and if we are anything in America I think we're a tribe we're a community we're one gigantic fucking tribe and if we have any kids that are out there that aren't getting taken care of then we're failing we're failing so that's our foundation so it doesn't matter what the fuck we do at the very top of the apex with you know traveling to the fucking moon and working on the Star Wars program that doesn't matter if our foundation is full of shit so the very way our society is constructed it's to let you know that the people running it are fools it's like a road map to retardation you see real clearly connected dots oh you're just a bunch of greedy douchebags this is it real simple again that's sociology you're not talking psychology talking sociology ring if you were that I'm completely with you if you were the president how would you fix all this chill son and how'd you fix this world well that's such a deep question think about that a lot you know Irene I ran for office I know you did all that mistakes man I you know I ant you I want to be President as Brian Stann and he got the resume if you fucking do it he literally could become the President of the United States I vote for him heartbeat yeah absolutely and you know he's got a guy that corners in Maine John bars John bardos help to get Newt Gingrich elected he's out of Georgia Brian's out of Georgia and and that is it to brag on Newt Gingrich what I what I'm saying is Brian has the people around him that know how to do this I mean this guy's an all-american from the Naval Academy is a war hero he's a sports hero and he's as squeaky clean as they come yeah but it's an intelligent or Capulet dog people love him you know when I make that comment if he could be present people don't understand oh he really could be real he should run and I and I like to throw these plugs out there so that the right amount of people pushing me that's how we got George Washington it's not a job he wanted to do people came to him he was finally willing to write so anyway I have no idea what we're even tell what would I do if I were the president you know you don't elect Brian Stann yeah what yeah I would definitely bring Brian Stann to see you happen at role he you know he would be somebody that you would listen to a true leader of men but you know look there's so many things that need to be done but the first thing that I do imagine if he has that page as a vice president you imagine I would quit lying and in every politician in the country from the state level to the federal level have all in the last four years which is two cycles if you're in the house have all ran on the same thing every one of them unanimously in the country all 50 states jobs in the economy they got to quit no politician has ever created a job ever unless it's a state job and don't bring up state jobs where you're taking from doers and given to non doers Kay you were you're taking tax dollars from hard workers and giving it to people that are you know in a state job and I'm not saying those aren't important but don't count that as create a job look if you're a lawmaker Joe you can do two things and two things only tax and regulate in neither taxation nor regulation is good for job growth and they need to come clean and just say that so you think state jobs are bad for job growth because they're they didn't come about organically yeah I just don't think you can count you know when you're talking about creating jobs what you've done is grow the size of government so now we've got more Big Brother we have more regulation more people looking what's an example of like a bullshit State job that they can create I don't think well okay let's look at the Department of Education let's look at the Department of Health you know what are these guys doing right you can't get two nutritionists to agree you know you can't get them to agree you there's so much done on nutrition you know there's books written on blood type you know some people need more saturated fats they love to do this whole thing about saturated fats that are do it right here in California you can't give out a happy meal if it's over 500 calories it can't include a toy they're coming down on McDonald's as opposed to telling parents hey take responsibility and regulation now what if your kids an athlete what if your kids you know wrestling like I had to do as a kid I need calories and I also happen to need fat so don't you want to have a Big Mac fucking I should be able have two Big Macs and if it comes with a toy and it helps me to pull through your drive-through opposed to your competitors that's called capitalism and for the government to get involved is beyond inappropriate you know you brought up Barry Bonds earlier at Mark McGwire and I don't care what those guys did either because I don't follow baseball but what I do care about is that government got involved they had a congressional hearing for Congress to get involved with sport is beyond we took inappropriate and those got you know that's what they should have said and if I was a congressman up there and my fellow congressman it's my turn to Spock I'm gonna say shame on you and shame on you - the fellow congressman I'm gonna say get out there and do something relevant and if people want to quit going to the ball game capitalism will fix that sport and nothing else exactly the market will dictate where that silly sport is and it's a self-regulating sport - they choose to agree on what is in the contract there's a reason why the NBA doesn't test for marijuana sure because everybody would be testing positive those dudes are blazed to the gills yeah so it's not like we're gonna eliminate all illegal aspects of any basketball game know they have shit they agree on and shit they don't agree on and they put things in contracts just to make sure that they can you know they can they each side enforces their point but it's it's a lot of it is ridiculous completely redo and congressional here Congress you're gonna sit down with the people that are involved at the highest level of our government and you're gonna debate the hit the ball with the stick game sure oh the guys too good at it he's taken some extra chemicals and it makes him really good at they hit the ball of the stick game and those little kids that are watching at home are gonna be real disappointed man you find out that that guy took some extra stuff that makes them better if they hit the ball the stick game right the fuck man no I think I think it's I think it's shameful I think it's shameful that Congress got involved in that and I think you know to call a congressional here and they call it on a number of ridiculous things they call it on the poor guy from BP because they got an oil leak out in the ocean now that's horrible and I don't want to see the ocean get a leak but I assure you BP who's making money doesn't want to see a leak either yeah they want to see that taken care of they want to get that cleaned up they want their shareholders happy well it actually turns out in the BP case that they had actually cut corners to save money and made a shoddy product that was a real fucking disaster that's a different situation that's a company that was you know there they're responsible for that we didn't build the the there there's two different ways to build that valve and they didn't build they took a shortcut to make it to happen make it happen quicker and they didn't they've been warned about that too that was a fucking tremendous disaster we had members of Congress calling to going on on shows and telling pundits hey listen we need to get the military out there now of course they don't say that the military's gonna do we don't have a what's the military they're gonna shoot it we're gonna shoot at the oil and what are they possible they were talking about droppin a new but Congress somebody was talking about dropping on nuke and closing that's how they're gonna close off the oil ridiculous you know and you imagine what that would look like and the British guy just dolphins and whales flying into this fucking sky right have you ever seen the video at the photograph of that uh the bomb that they blew off in the ocean Brian pull that bit better up its nuclear test Ocean Pacific something it was incredible I don't know what year this was it was a long time ago but the the the actual explosion from this nuclear bomb they dropped in the ocean the the water was so much bigger than they thought it was gonna be they set all these battleships around it like they were gonna monitor this thing and see what the impact was that battleships walk they get flown sideways it's like miles high water straight up into the air it's incredible while we're waiting for the video I'm gonna play so just a photo the one up game and I don't want up you I'm gonna come in second here but I wanna I want to relate I had a friend that had two two years in a military prison because when he was in Iraq during the war of 92 wait way back but he was in my neighborhood he shot a camel with a law and a law is a rocket launcher so they're out in the desert they got nothing to do a camel goes by and he shoots his thing so you time I want to see a picture I don't like that the camel had to give his life and you know as the rumor goes there they're quite coveted over there I know I don't say this to be disingenuous or denigrate but I've told you and you can even marry one over there whether true or not I don't know but it's it's that serious he shot it with a rocket launcher oh I don't want that poor camel have to die but I do want to see that if there was a video or a footage and my buddy had to do the guy in my neighbor has to go to military prison for two years I at least need see what happens when a rocket meets a camel in the desert what did why they put him away for so long two years of long extremely disrespectful I mean you're really talking about offending people in that part of the we can see we don't understand that I don't I don't get it either as a camel it was uh I watched one of those Anthony Bourdain shows those reservations shows where they cooked a camel they bored over camera cooked it yeah they slow-cooked it underground it's like whoa reading a camel how do you know they ate camels my guess was duck out there and there's nothing but camels you got to make do but it's like it was like a special dish that they would only have like certain times I was in trouble because I talked about the people on the streets of manouse and in Brazil eating monkey well it's true they do and it's like listen now before you think I'm making funny you might want to know we put in hot dogs right here at Yankee Stadium here in America movie some pretty weird stuff too but it happens to be a true story that they do eat monkey in Brazil do it that I'm getting at is they eat weird stuff around the world man right and I think I personally like it when I travel I like to try some of that weird I don't want some where the shade I eat pig intestines and Turkey but I didn't know that's what I was eating I think the mere word intestine is disgusting and I was pretty upset when I found out I did you never let snail-like s carbonelli yeah I've have had escargot on a cruise ship as a kid delicious my dad tricked me I don't like it I do like caviar now that I've gotten older I didn't like it as a kid but when the Russians come over like for a wrestling or a duel meet or even the Russian fighters they all bring caviar that you can trade with them try give me money I give you caviar but is it worth a lot of money their caviar Russian caviar is the most famous kind of caviar it's kind of like a Cuban cigar if you can get a hold of Russian caviar especially back with the USSR before the breakup of the Soviet Union it was almost impossible to get Russian caviar that's one of those we deemed it to be a little better than it actually is but it is it coveted if you can get it it says rush on the label you'll be the head of your neighborhood party it's like yeah like you said like Cuban cigars I've always thought it was weird that it's an acquired taste it's so expensive and it's an acquired taste like why would you want to acquire a taste or something that's really expensive that you initially don't like sure it tastes like salt you know I happen to like because now they've eased us into it because they they roll all of our local sushi rolls and a type of caviar real cheap that yellowy stuff you know I've learned to like it as I've gotten older there you go ladies and gentlemen I really owe some help people that great American loves caviar Russian caviar anything else when to wrap this bitch up bring
