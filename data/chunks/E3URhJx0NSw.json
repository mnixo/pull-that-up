all right here we go so what you said when you sat down was absolutely perfect that the timing could not have been better well tell everybody what you do Michael well thank you I'm a four AB lack of a better term of medical detective I've spent my whole career tracking infectious diseases down trying to stop him try to understand where they come from so we can make sure they don't happen in the first place but most of all trying to respond to situations just like this just like this and just out off the bat how serious is this is this something that we need to be terrified of or is this overblown or how do you stand on this well first of all you have to understand the timing of it in the sense that is just beginning and so in terms of what hurt pain suffering death this account happened so far is really just beginning this is going to unfold for months to come yet and that's I think what people don't quite yet understand what we saw in China I'm convinced as are many of my colleagues as soon as they release all of these social distances these mandated stay in homes haven't left your home in weeks and weeks kind of thing when they go back to work they're on planes trains subways buses crowded spaces manufacturing plants even China is going to come back again and so this really is acting like an influenza virus something that transmits very very easily through the air we now have data to show that your infectious before you even get sick and in some cases quite highly infectious just breathing is all that you need to do so from this perspective I can understand why people would say well wait a minute flu kills a lot more itself every year than this does and already remind people this just was beginning probably the best guesstimate we have right now on what limited data we have is say this could be at least 10 to 15 times worse than the worst seasonal flu year we see 10 to 15 times worse in terms of fatalities yeah yeah and just illness in fact I just brought some numbers we can serve ly estimate that this could require 48 million hospitalizations 96 million cases actually occurring over 480 thousand deaths that can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation so this is not one that to take lightly and I think that's what I can understand if you say was over 10 or twenty dos or 50 deaths just remember two weeks ago we are talking about almost no cases in the United States and now that we're testing for it and watching the spread as its unfolding those numbers going up astronomically three weeks ago Italy was just living life just fine now they're literally in a virtual shutdown in the northern parts of Italy and that's the challenge with an infectious disease like this it can spread very quickly and it also can affect people I think maybe to put this into modern terms this is something we think of often and we think of you know pre-antibiotic days you know the old-time medicine we have an employee at our Center for infectious research and policy at the University of Minnesota and she has a dear friend who lives in Milan Italy and she works at a hospital there and she texted us to this employee of ours last night and this was an email that came out yesterday from one of their physicians in Milan at the largest hospital there he said I just got a very disturbing message from a cardiologist at one of the Milan's largest hospitals they're deciding who they have to let die they aren't screening the staff anymore because they need all hands on deck and they have very small areas of the hospital dedicated to non kovat patients where they still screen doctors everybody else is dedicated to kovat patients so even if they're positive meaning that they're sick they don't and but they don't have a severe cough or fever then they have to work he says that that they're seen an alarming number of cases in the forty-something range rage and as he took horrible cases so we need to stop thinking that this isn't only an old person's disease that this is what's I'm gonna unfold not just in wuhan its unfolding in Milan its unfolding here in Seattle and this is what's going to continue to rolling Lee unfold throughout the world yeah where did this rumor come from that it's a an old person's disease is it just because the majority of the people that have died from it so far I've been older yes in fact that's the primary risk factor for Diana's being old and then having certain underlying health problems for example in China those men over the age of 70 who also smoked were eight to ten percent of them died sixty-five percent of older Chinese men smoked the case fatality rate or the percentage of people who die and women in that same age group is only about two percent in that case what very few women smoked now the challenge we have is that's the Chinese data but there are a series of risk factors that we worry about that if they overlay on this disease are going to cause bad outcomes and we happen to be right at Ground Zero for one of the major ones here in this country that's obesity we know that obesity is just like smoking in terms of its ability to really cause severe life-threatening disease and forty-five percent of our population today over the age of 45 in this country are obese or sevillio obese and there's men and women so one of the concerns we have is we're gonna see more of these what I would guess I would call very serious and life-threatening cases occur in our country because of a different set of risk factors and we saw in China now you mentioned that there's some sort of incubation period before people become sick they're still contagious what is this incubation period and how do we know about it when we call something an incubation paper talking about from the time you and I got exposed meaning I was in a room breathe in the air that somebody else who was infected with the virus was expelling out I breathed it in how long from that time period till the time period that you get sick and what is that it's that's what called incubation period so that's when case numbers can double or triple in every so many days in this case is about four days so and we actually have data there from people who are exposed one time or one time only and we know when they were exposed where they were exposed and how soon do they get sick afterwards so the chauffeur in the car where that an individual is sick or showing symptoms then the show forgets that four days later you know they were there one time at one time long and if the chauffeur does not show any symptoms he's still contagious he can also be contagious too or he and that's one of the things that's challenging here is you and I might get exposed to somebody who is totally asymptomatic no symptoms that virus that appear well that's not a very strong virus but in fact when it infects us it could kill us so we've seen cases of fatal disease that were exposed to people that had minor symptoms themselves Wow this is what's unfolding here and this is where I think is such an important you know I said why the timing is important because you know Joe we really got to get information out to the public there is so much missing from information right now and you know we're gonna be this for a while this is not gonna happen overnight I worry I keep telling people we're handling this like it's a corona blizzard you know two or three days more Mattoon normal this is a coronavirus winter and we're gonna have the next three months or more six months or more that are going to be like this and you know so far this thing has been unfolding exactly as we predicted it we and our center put out a piece on January 20th and said this is going to spread worldwide have time people said I had no it's just China we put out a piece the first week of February and said this is gonna pop probably the last week of February first week of March because what happens is it has what's called an R nought or a doubling time of these every four days so to to increase is doubling every four days so if you go from two to four to eight to sixteen it takes a while to build up but when you start going from five hundred to a thousand to two thousand to four thousand that's what we're seeing happen in places like Italy we're beginning to see it in some ways up in Seattle it's what happened in China and you know when people are confronted with that suddenly this low risk phenomena that ever talks about isn't so low anymore and that's we need to prepare people for now what can be done like what what can the average person do I see people walking around with masks on wearing gloves is that nonsense largely yes first of all let's step back the primary mechanism for transmission is just the respirator out it's just breathing in studies in Germany which just have been published literally in the last 24 hours they actually followed a group of people who had been exposed to somebody at automobile manufacturing plant and then they had nine people that with this exposure he said if you have any symptoms at all contact us we want to follow up with and they all agreed well they got infected and so in the very first hours just feeling bad sore throat they went in and sampled the throats their their saliva their nose for virus they did blood they did stool they did urine and they found that at that very moment when they first got sick they had incredibly high levels of virus sometimes ten thousand times that we saw with SARS in their throats meaning they were infectious at that point already they hadn't even had symptoms yet of really any nature they were coughing yet and and that's where we're concerned because that's the kind of transmission it's you know I always have said trying to stop influence Irish transmission like try to stop the wind you know we've never had anything successfully do that other than vaccine and we don't have a vaccine here so what's happening is that people in public spaces are getting infected and the way you need to address that is unfortunately if you're older over 55 you have some underlying health problems which unfortunately a lot of Americans do we have obesity then right now you don't want to be in large public spaces in trying to potentially get infected so you can take care of that part as far as what can public health do we reckon we can talk about this we're not gonna have a vaccine anytime soon that's happy talk well we you know we can close schools one of the big challenges we have right now if we close schools what do we accomplish in influenza virus when you we close schools and during outbreaks because it turns out kids are get infected in school and they're like little virus reactors you know they come home and they transmit it to mom and dad and brothers and sisters and so we closed school sometimes it's Christmas breaks are always great for kind of putting the dampening effect on flu in this case kids are not getting sick very often at all which is one of the really good news features of this disease into China only 2.1 percent of the cases are under 8 19 years of age why is that you know we don't completely know and and I'm going to come back in a second because they're getting infected it turns out one study showed that they still get infected with the virus but they don't get sick and we have that happen there's a disease called infectious hepatitis hepatitis A where we have outbreaks and daycares and the way we know I have an outbreak is because it's transmitted through the stool fecal-oral is mom and dad and the daycare providers all get sick and the kids don't symptoms we go in and test the kids they're all positive so some diseases will manifest my primary when you're adult but not as a child this one appears to be the same so do we close schools or not if we're not really spreading the disease because it turns out that if we close schools we own a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who are working in the medical carrier have kids to school and if suddenly we're closing schools for two or three months who's gonna take care of those kids one-fourth of the American population has no sick leave if we closed goals they don't get paid if they have to stay home so when you ask what can we do we have to really be thoughtful about what we do are we doing more harm than good by closing schools for example even though everybody will say oh we got to do everything we can or do we just tell people you know it's going to be limiting your contact as much as you can and that's really about what we can do and limiting the contact is that really gonna help it does because it's like putting rods in a reaction if you if you don't have as much close contact you can you know not transmit as much if I'm if I'm sitting in a room with a hundred people and we're kind of sharing air the transmission is remarkable right here you off the coast of California you've got your cruise ship cruise ships are notorious for recirculating air inside the inner cabins we've had a number of outbreaks that's why they're having these outbreaks on cruise ships and then you leave them on there I think the cruelest human experiment we've done in a long time yeah just leave them on these ships get them off right away should they get them all absolutely whatever I do with them well they can put them in quarantine of some kind of if they want and follow up on them but you're guaranteed they're all going to keep getting infected day after day it seems like we're not really prepared for something like this although the the CDC's been telling us for a long time that we should be you know we are not prepared at all in the sense you know I wrote the book deadliest enemies that was published in 2017 thank you thank you go get it no an Manik in a chapter 13 the title of the chapter was SARS and MERS a harbinger of things to come you know predicted this and then I wrote a chapter on there what a flu pandemic would look like if it emerged in China and if you read it it's exactly what's happened the supply chains went down China locked down the country it spread to other countries people all pointed fingers and you know it's it's the kind of thing where we hear it and here at Bou don't get prepared you know five years ago I gave a talk at the Mayo Clinic first time I talked about this I've talked many times afterwards and I showed a slide of Puerto Rico picture was for a recall and then I showed the map and then I showed a picture of a building in Puerto Rico a nondescript building and I said this is our next big disaster turns out that 85% of all the world's production of IV bags the Saline that we need desperately were made in these plants in Puerto Rico and all we needed was one category five hurricane to come through and take it out Maria came through a year and a half ago and the world went into a major crisis with shortage of IV bags now that was so obvious that was going to happen and yet we don't prepare that's so foolish I know I agree and that's what hopefully this is a wake-up call the business community I hopefully will wake up you know one of the other things we're doing right now Joe this is really one of the things that has been most concerned about this whole situation is our group has been studying for the last year and a half with support from the Walton family foundation looking at critical drug shortages it turns out that we identified a hundred and fifty three drugs in this country that people need right now or they die I mean it's on the crash card it's acute critical drugs one-hundred percent or more generic all of them basically are made offshore of the United States and large part them were made in China and India and at this point we have shortages anyway every day just before this crisis happened now these supply chains have gone down our group is actively helping the United States government try to figure out you know where they can get these drugs now just think of this if I came to you and said the Defense Department was going to outsource all this to munitions production to China you'd look at me and say come on you know what the US Defense Department has no more access to these drugs and anybody else they are beholden to China for these drugs six hundred ninety thousand Americans have un stage renal disease right now most of their primary drugs are coming from China and now with the shutdown and what's happening with this and this is what I talked about in the book why I was so concerned because we are at risk so even the situation is unfold it's not just about what the virus does to you it's about what the entire system is rigged up to be and what this virus does once it gets into it Jesus you making me nervous well but that's before we get done here we're gonna talk about what we can do to get people not nervous because this it's too late no no no what I mean is we're gonna we're gonna bring you around to take you know it's my job is not scary out of your wits scare you and your wits do we do about it sorry let me ask you something about sauna use one of the things that I read was that if you are in contact that 20 minutes in a sauna in a really hot sauna is very good for killing some of the virus is that bullshit yes Jesus Christ these people yeah there was a some Sun a fax thing that was being pushed around that it's great for flu and all sorts of infectious diseases actually it's great for it I mean it makes you feel good but we don't have any evidence that makes any difference an infectious disease why is so it doesn't have any impact at all the idea was that the breathing in of the very hot air 180 degree air for 20 minutes to kill some of the virus see if that temperature of 180 degree air got really into your lungs your lungs would be fry it you'd be dead well how so so so what happens is just from the time you breathe it in and what you mix it with the air there it's kind of like taking a cup of hot water and putting it into a bathtub of cold water and so what happens by the time you get done it's not that hot and so in this case your lungs couldn't stand even hundred and ten to 20 degree heat without causing real severe damage and so it doesn't kill the virus at all so it would the virus and I would be like just in your mouth or something like that even then no no that's unfortunate because that was those exciting I was reading that I was like don't stop using the sonic it's a good thing don't use for your skin and everything else but yeah but it's not going to help you with this one so how does it cool the air down what's happening in terms of your lungs right yeah what you basically is some mixture of you know when you breathe out you don't breathe all the air out okay I mean you that would you'd almost be dead you couldn't do the tidal volume so what happens is every breath well in other words you have so much air in your lungs already when you breathe out you breathe just a little bit of it out and each time you could bring more in out in and out and so when this mixes in the hot air like that or the very cold air you know in Minnesota when you're 45 below zero we have the same problem we don't freeze our lungs okay you know when we breathe then may feel cool and so it's just there's so much in there that it mixes with the other air and it ultimately doesn't the temperature your lungs don't change even if you're doing like some crazy deep breathing exercises where you slowly exhale all the air out there's nothing left and then breathe it all the way in I'm giving you my best shot at it it's not gonna make much difference sorry I've always wanted about like people that are in like Alberta and it's like 50 degrees below zero like how do they do that yeah well we do it all the time as well we don't anymore in Minnesota it's getting warmer there every winter but the problem right yeah we we surely know what cold airs like well so much for that myth myth number two well I don't say myth I should say rumor was that this was something from some sort of a biological weapons thing that was linked right because wuhan is some area what part of China that they actually do work on biological weapons and we've heard that loud and clear and let me just give a little bit background aboard in my career back in the early 1990s I got very involved and the whole area of bio defense and bioterrorism bio warfare it turned out I was involved with helping to an interview and get information from some of the Russian bio weapon errors after the Wall fell and Russia collapsed we had all these experts coming out who had been spending their whole lives making bio weapons and it became very clear to me this was really a serious challenge and as part of my work I I spent a lot of time in this area and I actually through a series of serendipitous events became a personal adviser His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan before he died on this topic I got really into it I wrote a book that was published on 9/11 of 2000 called living terrors what our country needs totals five becoming bioterrorist catastrophe and I think I bought eight of the twelve copies that were sold in that year afterwards and then when 9/11 happened of course then it became really prominent and then I went on to serve on a group here in the United States that was basically the National Science Advisory Board of biosecurity safety issues so I've had a lot of experience in this area and so I bring that to the table and I tell you there is no evidence whatsoever that this is a bioweapon or that it was accidentally released from the Wuhan lab today with the genetics we have on these viruses and how we can do testing we can almost date them almost like carbon testing you know so radiocarbon you want to know how old my block is or something like that this thing clearly jumped from an animal species probably the third week in November to humans and penguins you know the scaly anteater animals are very good source because we have coronaviruses just like those in these animals and it got into a human so you know we've surely had a lot of challenges with that but I don't believe that there's any evidence linking those two I want an intentional release or an accidental release or that it's an engineered bug is not my friend Duncan and I did a show back in 2012 ish somewhere around there with sci-fi where we went to the CDC in Galveston and we talked to them about that very thing and they said the real concern the real concern is just actual diseases it's not man-made diseases disease that's exactly I mean look you know we could not have crafted a virus like this to do what it's doing I mean we don't have the creative imagination or the skill set if somebody said okay I want to find a virus it'll take out a lot of people okay this what mother nature does it so much better than we could ever do it and you know whether it was Ebola whether it's this one or its antibiotic resistance any of these things I mean you know and regular and I were talking about the potential for chronic wasting disease to be a problem for humans you know mother nature's doing it pretty well in her own the chronic wasting one really scares me because there's so many people that have a vested interest in dismissing it I had our good friend Doug durin yep on the podcast with I don't remember the gentleman that he brought with it right Richard thank you Ryan Richards who explain the science behind it and there are so many people that are dismissing this because either they enjoyed deer hunting or they they want captive servants to be something that are still something that you could be released on private property most people grow and breed deer and then sell them to ranchers who want deer and their properties particularly large deer and I mean guys that I have talked to that are dismissing it I can see the chain of events that they want it to be not a concern but if you see what it's doing to deer it's terrifying it's a hundred percent fatal it the the DNA exists on plants for years they leak it out of their saliva they leave traces of it everywhere and in Doug's area there's some some near is somewhere near there there's like 50% infection range right I listen I think this is really a significant challenge I was involved back in the 1990s and into the 1980s when Mad Cow first emerged in England and at the time was asked to give an assessment when this was all this bovine spongiform encephalopathy another prion so these prion sir what causes disease and you know people want to dismiss it that people weren't gonna get sick well then we realize ten years later all these human cases started to show up that from those exposures ten years before and it took a while before those prions obviously changed in the cattle to get to the point where they didn't affect humans well the same thing is happening with a deer if you look back on the deer population that were infected 30 years ago and you look at it today the prions are constantly changing they're mutating and they're they're new strains and they're getting more human-like all the time and one of the things our Center is doing is we're looking at working on that very issue of trying to help people understand that the studies that were done 15 or 20 years ago looking at how infectious these might be for humans we're really well done they were good but they had different strains and over time these strains are looking to be more more like they could infect humans or they could even infect cattle which would be another huge challenge if that happened and so I think your points a really good one and we know today that they're probably at least 17,000 deer that were consumed in the past year that were actually positive for this prion and people went ahead native anyway so I worry about that too that's terrifying so these people have these prions in their system now but then currently they're not they're not making the jump to cause what is it yacouba's creutzfeldt-jakob disease which is what yeah it's kind of a we don't know that humans are getting infected one of the challenges we don't have a test unless you die and then that's the heck of a way to have to get a test or something okay so one of the challenges you don't know this until you actually show up with the signs and symptoms and so one of the things that we're looking at carefully is doing surveillance or disease detection among people that might present with this if it's going to happen I suspect the naturally occurring prion related diseases lights creutzfeldt-jakob disease you just mentioned occurs typically in older people over 70 if you sudden start seeing the 40 year old or a 50 year old or 60 even with this disease then you got to start thinking what else is going on and so that'll help best detect it in cases but then we've already failed you know then we've had ten years worth of transmission or more potentially before we get the first human cases like we did with Mad Cow and so our message has been right now hunting is really important it is a very important part of our society frankly it's the way we managed your herds thank God it's a huge economic boon for running the kinds of DNR's as such we have we balance the back as you know from sportsman on these licenses and so we don't want to stop hunting but we've got to make sure that we and make sure that people aren't getting infected and one of the things that our group at the university Minnesota is working on is tests now they're almost like point of detection tests so if you shoot an animal could you know very quickly that it's positive or not and then you'd know not to process that animal yeah and that's we need to get at well not only that the the prions what's terrifying is that how how invulnerable they are how ridiculously vigorous they are when Jacqueline you can boil them a thousand degree temperature for hours and hours and they're fine that's right when they're when they're sanitizing medical equipment that they've used on mad cow patients or whether it's cows or humans with these prions they've been able to do it three times so try to sterilize these things like the sterilization process you wear the what is the temperature that they do it for well they do it both temperature and pressure but it's in the hundreds and degrees and it's under high pressure and I've actually been involved with several cases where these very equipment you're talking about were accidentally used on somebody hydro occupant disease and they had to landfill it they couldn't they couldn't even sterilize it if that's what's insane like you can't kill these things that's pretty hard that's why you know we we want to make sure that if you're eating deer cervus right now that we have to make sure they're tested and I think the other point you raised is a good one we've been very concerned about the movement of this disease by serving farming yeah we've had far too many examples and Doug has shared that with you you know just the extent to which we see if you know state by state by state slowly getting you know picked off because somebody moved a trophy deer from state a to state B and affected it got out or others got out of the pens and then it affects locals ya know has that made the jump to bison or elk or any of those other animals yet not yet it's several kinds of deer you know but not not those mule deer so far there has been some cases in the West it's primarily whitetails right exactly yeah and then there's been a deer in Korea the type of drear there and and one in the Scandinavian countries one yeah I mean I mean different kinds of deer types there yeah yeah so the one we worry about right now is getting into the caribou in northern Canada right now the range of the deer that are infected in the provinces of Canada is right biting up next to caribou and of course if you're not a hunter you would know this but caribou obviously the herds are remarkable unlike you know white tails for that matter elk if you got it into caribou the it would likely spread very quickly and as you know the native populations the caribou are key they're key to their livelihood yeah so you wouldn't want to see it get in the caribou now I didn't even know that it was in Canada what parts of Canada has it been throughout a number of provinces I think there's four provinces now it's in its its in its skin spreading it's the same phenomena that a combination of deer movement with surveyed farming and then once it's in an area it'll keep migrating a bit and a bit as these animals move somewhere but you know as we know deer don't fly 4,000 miles every season okay so it's not that kind of movement if humans if we're gonna see a big movement as humans are doing it as our good friend Doug durin has been doing all this work to try to alert people about it and also they're putting up these testing places where hunters can bring it here and have the deer tested how much of that is available to people around the country though not nearly enough and that's what we need to work on is if you don't make it easy and convenient as you know it's not going to get done yeah and so we you know it's hard enough to convince people if there's really a problem because people don't want to believe it even if they know that there's you know CWD in deer in the area and we have some like that but I think the tide is changing more and more people are sensitive to it they have access to testing quickly but if it's gonna take your month and have to get the test back you know what it is well well in some cases they get so busy because you know unlike laboratory testing for an entire year where I do one twelfth and January one twelfth and February of cetera cetera you know deer season typically is very concentrated in just a couple of weeks to a month in the fall and so the problem is all the animals come in at that time so your lab capacity has to handle that huge surge all at one time and so somebody's it takes a while to get it back so these hires just hope they don't take a bite during that time yeah and we hope that these prions don't ultimately infect simple jump and but if they do you know I worry what will happen to deer hunting as we know it because probably a lot of people will you know not continue and we need that desperately for herd management I mean it's the way we do it well what they're doing in Doug's area is they're they're actively trying to eliminate a lot of deer and try to lower drastically lower the numbers particularly of bucks which I guess they wander more yep they do yeah yeah it's all really scary stuff because if they do make the jump to humans I mean it has made the jump to I believe mice okay well what happened was originally it didn't and so that was some of the data that was used to support it's not a problem right now these what we call humanized mice or mice that are basically much more like a human we're now seeing that jump occurring and these new strains see the strains that again were around 20 years ago or not the same ones today because as these prions continue to pass from animal to animal to animal they go through these a little minor mutations and they're getting more more and more like what a human transmissible prion might look like so in these my studies now that are really made to mimic a human we're starting to see that jump yeah and folks if you've never seen a deer with CWD you should go and google it because it's terrifying the idea that that could make that jump to human beings and people pouring saliva out of their mouths and their whole body just wasted away to skin and bones right that's what we're looking at I mean that's why it's called chronic wasting disease because the animals literally waste away we actually have a major resource and on our website free of charge open and it's all in chronic wasting disease so people want to go there it's wlwt's it'd wrap Cidra P dot you amend led you and you can go there and all these pictures all the time what is it again WWE app CIDR AP CID wrap up just Center for infectious ease research and policy said wrap dot um n that edu dot um and II D you and we have a lot of information there it is that's it right there Center yep and we've got a lot of information on there also about coronaviruses we have a whole Resource Center just for the corona viruses to novel coronavirus there you go hmm so for the average person that is sitting around reading these articles that say don't worry our readings are there's articles that say this is the end of humanity what would what could these people do like what what could they do and what do they do if they get infected well first of all neither those kind of articles are correct and we have to make sure that we get that message out to people that is Sarah we need Straight Talk right now you know and and part of it is it's so hard to you hear from people who supposed experts what's this going to happen or not happen you know and and let me just give you an example because we've heard a lot about well it's going to go away with the the chronic of the corona virus with the seasons okay when it warms up it'll go away well you know the other corona viruses that we have that we've had to worry about with SARS which appeared in 2003 in China and when that came out of China in February 2003 it took us a little while to figure out that these people really aren't that infectious tilde five or six of their illness and then they really crash and burn and mininum would die but what we did was basically by knowing that identify these cases in their context quickly and so if they had symptoms brought him in put him in these isolation rooms so they wouldn't infect anybody else and it took until june to bring out in her control that had nothing to do with the seasons MERS which is another corona virus that's in the Middle East it's in the Arabian Peninsula the natural reservoir for that is camels in China by the way stars it was palm civets and a type of animal food rodent that we got out of the markets there in the Arabian Peninsula we're not going to euthanize a 1.7 camels you know to try to get rid of MERS and there it's a hundred and ten degrees out and this virus is transmitted fine thank you I mean it goes from animals to people it goes in the hospitals there's no evidence that seasonal there so that's a good myth to expose right away this is not something that's going to cure up when it gets warm and it you know if it does it won't be because there's a model for it what will it be because how does a how does something like SARS run through a population and then stop being around anymore well it wouldn't have but had we had good public health had we had you know the same kind of transmission were seen as this corona virus where your infectious before you ever get sick where your highly infectious remember with SARS now you didn't really get infectious tell you're a six or you know six days of illness and you knew that you were in trouble and then you could isolate you and we didn't understand that at first and we transfer virus transmitted so that's why SARS stop murder stops because we don't get rid of the camels so it keeps hitting humans day after day but then when they go to the hospital we no longer allow those individuals to transmit to others in the hospital because we do what we call good infection control as soon as they get there they're in special rooms with special Mass and all this kind of thing and so in that regard these chrome virus can be stopped this one's not as I said at the top of the program this is like trying to stop the wind we influenza transmission you never hear anybody saying in a bad flu the seasonal flu year you know we're going to stop this one if you don't have vaccine that works you don't it's just breathing that's all it is so what's the best-case scenario here well I think as I laid out to you before you know this could be ten times worse than a really bad seasonal flu year and our grandchildren well it will hit you know primarily the older population and those underlying health problems but as I mentioned also you know we have a lot of people who have other risk factors obesity high blood pressure is another risk factor where you can have a really bad outcome with this and so we don't quite know what it's going to do yet I think you know we've been right on the mark predicting where it's going to be today I think from here on out I can tell you it's going to stay around for months it's not going to go away tomorrow we got to stop thinking about if we just get through tomorrow that's so if we're gonna go to schools we're gonna tell people not to go into public Rona cancel big events how long are we prepared to do that what are we gonna do we have to ask ourselves that I think the big thing is eventually enough people get infected or it'll be like putting reactors and the rods you know rods in the reaction I should say and then that stops it by itself but how so because if you're if two of the three of us in this room were immune right now to it because we'd had it and recovered and had protection because of natural protection then I couldn't transmit to anybody so that's what's going to happen if you had enough people will get infected ultimately then it'll slow down and stop transmission that way but that's the heck of a price to pay to get there is it safe to say they were fairly fortunate that this isn't something like the Spanish flu or something that's really ruthlessly deadly well that's where I think we have to be really careful just back up about 0.1% of people who get seasonal flu diet and grants it's mostly older or younger people okay that's one out of a thousand with this one right now in China we're seeing between two and three percent of the people die and some say well that's way too high it's not going to be that high it's going to be lower but again and they say that because we didn't pick up all the milder illnesses okay but on the other hand we have a lot of additional people in countries like ours that have even more risk factors for having bad outcomes in China and so Spanish flu the one you mentioned 1918 that was about a three to three point two percent case fatality rate now it did preferentially impact 18 to 25 year olds they they were the hardest yet group why was that well you know it has to do with your immune response again we think that what happened is when this virus got into you it created we call a cytokine storm which is an antibody response in your body that's out of control and it basically you destroy yourself and it sets this thing up to trigger it off so the healthier people had the more adverse reaction to exactly or the other group that has had a real challenge with that are pregnant women and pregnant women have a very unique issue one is course they have some constriction of their lungs just by the very physical mass but also their immune system is really at a heightened state at that point there's a part of that immune system and that woman says this is not all me get rid of this it's like a rejection of a graft and the other part saying this is the most precious cargo ever carry you know I got to make sure I don't lose it and when that virus got in between those two it started again that same kind of cytokine storm now the thing that concerns us about this what we saw in in in 1918 I mentioned just three plus percent this one could be as high as 2% so it's somewhere between a really bad flu here at 0.1% and it could be as high up here you know getting closer to 1918 like and that's the numbers I just gave you a few minutes ago from the American Hospital Association of you know 480,000 deaths here in this country over the next six to 12 months what can someone do to shore up their immune system while this is all going on well a couple things first of all just being as healthy as you can be you know wait wait you know I'm I'm getting up there right now or you know becomes more and more of a challenge to stay you know in good shape you know the more you can do to do that something you know about you know it's keeping and shaped is really important a second thing is if you're on medications like for blood high blood pressure don't don't miss them take those drugs because they're really important even though they may not appear simple you know you don't have any symptoms of high blood pressure or something like that and then I think just you know getting sleep and eating a healthy diet and that's about what we can do today to help get you prepared for this is there anything else someone could do like maybe IV vitamin drips or anything that's going to really boost your system no you know when you look at all the things that might be there and I'm happy and willing to accept any and all that might help but we don't really have any data that those substantially impact on your your immune system to make it that much better mmm it's not the case because not that many people do it though no I actually study has been studied and it's been studied I mean a good example is you know and I and I was one of those people who thought boy this is a great thing probiotics you know things turns out that we've studied this with the antibiotic resistance and does it help your gut etcetera and it turns out that the probiotic users were no different than the non probiotic users in terms of recovery from antibiotics no and the issue of if you're gonna kind of compete out the bad bug so by getting a good healthy gut flora there you would actually reduce the chance to picking up a bad bug and it turned out there was no difference the people how would they do a study like that the only way I think they would do a study like that accurately is it in fact someone that is the same person like you have the same person with no probiotics yep and then have them with probiotics what in in the studies that have been done are very close to that but what they did is they use two different groups of people those people used probiotics this group did not right and then they looked at all the illnesses and they got stool samples and everybody and they got a sample this is a group I don't have the numbers in front of you they're pretty sizable because I was disappointed I mean I was thinking saw myself yeah yeah so I mean I think though but I think the key message here is is that you know we're gonna get through this but right now we do have some real challenges before us what we can't tell people as it's all safe you know I I every time I hear people say the risk is law right now it reminds me of what would happen if the there was this huge low pressure system you know five days off the coast at the Gulf and there was ninety degree water between that system and the beach and there was no wind shear the northern hemisphere wasn't likely gonna knock it off but we tell the people standing at the beach that day we have low risk of anything well you know five days from now it's coming right and so what we need to do has helped us American population or the world for that matter understand we're gonna be in some hurt for the next few months and we have got to get better prepared how we gonna how are we gonna work where we gonna work we can't stop working we need when you ease on lights on we need health I need food so the a bunch of things people should do that's gonna boost their immune system that we know of right like get sleep drastically lower your alcohol intake drink a lot of water uh-huh take vitamins those kind of things things that are gonna keep your body healthy yep that's you nailed so it's not since sauna will help you a little bit because it does what relaxes you relaxes you it also boosts up your heat shock protein now if you're in Minnesota we'd say there's a two-part requirement that you got to go from the sonnet to the ice water there's a sign yeah he had to do a boat yeah people love that right we do it all the time well the Russians invented that yeah yeah yeah does that have you ever done that I have my son has a daughter have a beautiful Lake place open northern Wisconsin they got a son and like literally 12 feet from the lake and there's a spring right there so in the wintertime the lake actually stays open so we go right from the Sun and the hot tub right to the water and back oh wow even when it's frozen oh yeah it's well because it's not frozen right through the spring yes so you literally can go right into it so and then you run right back into the hot tub that's when you sleep well when you've done a couple of those rounds you sleep really well yeah yeah I would imagine your body's freaking out yeah I love the sauna but I haven't had any opportunity to jump into a lake right afterwards okay well we'll have to know it just not anyway yet have a nice covered yes really yeah that's the real feeling yeah well what else can people do in terms of all this hand sanitizer jazz and masks is that all yeah the hand sanitizers actually are a great thing for stopping a lot of infectious diseases they actually are really good they're good for your hands you know in terms of the skin they kill the bad bugs but the whole issue of using your hands touching your face at people all concentrate on yes the data is actually very weak that this what kind of virus is gonna be transmitted that way so I wouldn't tell you to stop using hand sanitizers but don't think it's gonna have a big impact on this book do you see that viral video that's going around that woman who was giving the address at the behest of the White House and she see that she tells people not to touch their face and then immediately licks her finger and I did saw page yeah I saw that I saw that well why is she telling people not to touch their face because you know well the the thought was is that there are receptors around your eye right here that actually for this virus could get in and then get into your body and you know the data we have on this is so sparse to say that that's the case I think the primary thing about hand-washing is legitimate but one of the things we want people want to do something they want to be able to fact they're doing so and so we tell them wash your hands often in to present this to prevent this disease and I feel like we're not being really honest with the people that the data and and we've looked at this very carefully really is about just breathing air and that's a hard thing to stop so keep doing the hand-washing but don't think that that's going to stop this disease which you asked about the man to stop other stuff yes yeah asks there's two kinds right basically the surgical mask which just fits over and the reason it's called a surgical mask is because it's loose-fitting just fits you know kind of ties behind you because weren't worn by surgeons so that they don't cough or drip into your wound and it was never made to protect you from bugs coming in so those little spaces on the sides that's not a problem if I'm breathing into the cloth right in front of my nose but in terms of the air coming in on the side they're not they're not effective at all so people wear them they look like they're doing something they're not now if you are sick they may help a little bit from you transmitting because if you cough then you coffee right into that cloth and it'll some little in bed in there or not get out around the other one though is called an in 95 respirator but for all intents person looks like a mask it's just tight face fitting it has the seal but you know the nose etc that's an apocalypse mask it could be I don't know what those are but that could yes I'm just saying that that's how I look at it okay okay well they're actually we use them all the time in health care all the time and they use them in action about 90% of them are used in industry so they're grinding things or asbestos etc you know they don't breathe in all these parts so if we have one of those that'll do something they're very effective they're very effective the problem is we have a big shortage you know right now we have hospitals that are down to just a couple days worth of these masks those respirators and it's because we don't stockpile anything in this country you know we don't have hospitals don't have the money to do that those Preppers right now are so excited yeah all the Preppers across the guy I knew it I knew the day would come yeah well they are they are Ann teaches and well you know but well this is really important because how health care workers go is how the country I think we'll see we're going you know they've been over 4,000 health care workers in China who are infected many of them on their job and a number of them died and if in this country we have a real challenge delivering health care because we're overwhelmed and then we have health care workers picking up the infection like we talked about the group in Milan and we don't have the protection for them I really believe that's when the public will say oh wait a minute what's going on here and and that's where I think the challenge so we really have to protect our healthcare workers they are the frontline people and and the biggest problem we have is a lot of these cases need intensive care medicine which we only have a limited number of beds for but this is really sophisticated medicine so when one of those people get infected a doctor and nurse work in intensive care it's not like you just took out another soldier you took out a special forces person you just can't bring somebody in from family practice wherever and put them in there and so we've got to protect these workers and I'm really concerned that that's one of the areas we've not done nobody stockpiles we have no you know capacity to make lots of them all of a sudden you know the prior to this event the hospital purchasing agent would go online click a button send me 5,000 of these no be there the next morning has anyone contacted you before this or since in particular and asked for your advice as to how they can better prepare like columns of like the president oh the president hasn't but I know a number of the people were working in the White House and they were contacted you oh yeah well you know I've served roles in the last five presidential administrations I worked for two Republican governors two Democratic Governors as you appreciate one dependent rasler I worked for two when he was governor Jesse oh and and that's right yeah and so you know I I've never had a partisan you know I'm just a private in the public health all right and so I actually served as a science envoy for this administration in the State Department last year you know I'm still in my full-time job at the University and so I've never been I mean I'm there to give the best advice I can and so I've talked to a lot of these people there at the CDC at Health Human Services etc so yeah we've given a lot of advice and do you think there's anything that you could do now that could help them make sure that we don't have these shortages of masks and shortages of medicine and IV bags and something that could be done - I mean you obviously you've laid out all these problems yeah when you laid it out in your book here the people could buy right now go pick it up on Amazon right video version of it as well there is all right do you read it I'd the book yes no you know you know I have think I don't know I don't read my cell you know there's actually a really good voice it's not mine well it should be you man drives me crazy someone else does it yeah no you know this is the challenge we have is today in this environment everything's just in time delivery I mean look at when you mean you go online and you whatever place your everything from Amazon wherever you back to throw the next day yeah people forget that we don't have that capacity today to suddenly make lots of things so right now all the mass manufacturers in North America are working 110% time but if they were trying to fill all the orders they've gotten just in the last few weeks would take him years and years with the capacity they have and you can't build build these new machines to make masks overnight so this is something that should be set in advance of anything like this any pandemic happening like long in advance we should be prepared you know think about the issue as defense you know we prepare all the time well in advance we don't build an aircraft carrier at the moment we think we're gonna go to the battle we look at what all do we need we don't do that in public health we've tried and so you know what stockpiling 500 million of these in 95 s would have been the difference between night and day and when you look at the price of one of those versus one airplane not even close if you look at the things like that it's like these medications I don't think about our own Defense Department employees are at risk of running out of these critical drugs because they get them from China I mean what a vulnerability yeah so what we need to do is take a step back after when we can start now but we're not going to fix it now is to say what are the key things that we should do vaccines you know if we had been serious about this we might very well have had a corona virus vaccine that whether worked specifically for this strain whether it worked for SARS or MERS but right after SARS happened in 2003 everybody was hot at Anu scene and then when it went away the interest waned is it something like the flu where you know sometimes when they come up with a few a flu vaccine it doesn't necessarily address the current strain yeah it could be and that's where a corona virus family vaccine may not match up right here now but it could and and the flu one you've really hit an important point there's one where you know we do have an imperfect vaccine but it still does a lot of good you know fifty percent of the people are protected that's heck a lot better than zero yeah if we had a vaccine right now that fifty percent of the people could be protected against this virus man think of all the lives we'd save so the bottom line message is we can't wait and tell the crisis to fix these things you know what we spend about point zero zero zero one percent of public health compared to our Defense Department and yet look how vulnerable the it's the bugs it's not a war yeah it's not a missile is bringing down the world economy right now and it's a darn virus yeah and so this is where I think that's what I tried to say in my book was all about that I went into what we needed to do in fact I hate it when people come up and say we're screwed you know my whole bottom line is what are you gonna do about it then and that's what I laid out a whole plan in here like these vaccines like the stockpiles of mass you know we should have a plan in place already what are we gonna do with our schools when they close are we gonna really close schools let's not try to make this on the fly you know I just mentioned if we close schools we're gonna really hurt some people and people may die in health care facilities hospitals because we don't have enough nurses or health care workers why have to make that decision all of a sudden we could have planned for that a long time ago and so I think hopefully this is a wake-up call cos you know nobody I think really believed this I got a tape you know the market today as you know on this particular day crashed badly and you know I think that up until 10 days ago the market didn't even think this was a possibility they just if you look at it was flying high on Friday I did a briefing for over 400 major financial investors around the world and you know I you know how I'm talking to you right now you know I'm not trying to be scary I'm just trying to tell the facts and make sure people understand it the questions I got from these people all remind me of a six-year-old who was afraid to have to go throughout a dark or dark hallway you know and and and I thought I actually said to friends and colleagues Friday night I said you know what Monday's markets not gonna look good because I could sear the fear in these people okay well we shouldn't be there we should be what are we going to do we have a problem you know it's like a forest fire whatever we got a problem what are gonna do about it financially how we gonna get through this you know where are we gonna go with it no plans again it's caught everybody by surprise I mean you are the one of the few people that wanted to deal with this issue you know we set this up several weeks ago yeah you guys saw it coming you know and and I think that's where the country hasn't seen it now they're getting it well I'm paranoid well I seek the advice of experts whenever possible and what what I was seeing was that there was a lot of weird misinformation and conflicting information a lot of people saying don't worry and a lot of people that were terrified I'm like okay I got to talk to an expert and luck yeah you were willing to sit down with us and help us out well you know and the other thing I think that you know I maybe it's a function of age but you know straight talk is so important today you know you know I'm so tired of having people say to me oh if you tell them the stuff they're gonna panic and I say well what's panic have you seen anybody rioting in the streets yet have you seen cars turned over smash have you seen people hurting themselves over this issue they're concerned you know they want legitimate information and so what you need to do is just tell them the truth and we have many experiences like that a few years ago when I was at the State Health Department Minnesota we had a big outbreak of meningitis a type of brain infection bacterial brain infection a number of high school students were very sick all of a sudden in one day they were in a hospital in this community of 20-some thousand people were on edge and so we had a big town meeting several thousand people showed up and I addressed them and gave me everything I knew about meningitis what we're gonna do about it etc and then towards the end of the talk I said and I just need to let you know about one on every seven cases of this dies and people looking said why did you tell of that and I said because they needed to know it two days later one of them died and you know what everybody in town was terribly sad very emotional but they we knew it we knew it you told it we knew it right and then they got on with dealing with it we vaccinated the whole town 20,000 people who vaccinated one weekend for this bacterial meningitis but it was because they had faith in us because we told them the truth and we said what we know and what we didn't know and so that's what we need to do here we need to just have Straight Talk don't tell him it's low risk that's like the hurricane okay you know I would be really bad at you if I thought you were a hurricane forecaster and you knew this was coming but you kept telling me oh it's low-risk don't worry about it right yeah once it hit yeah so that's what we need to do today is just say this is gonna be challenging and we're gonna get through it though we are going to get through it I hope this wakes people up to the value of vaccines - there's so many wackos out there to think that vaccines are you know a scam or they're dangerous or that's there's so many people out there that won't vaccinate their children I know and that's one you know what are your best shows beater hotels he's a dear friend of mine he's a I do too he's a dear friend of mine as you and you know he is one of the champions out there on this very issue I couldn't agree with you more I think that's really an important point that you know we got to get this idea these vaccines can be life-saving if we had one right now think how different the situation being we're in right now it would be radically different but you see the measles making it come back and directly attributed to a lack of vaccines you know what and it's not only the vaccines themselves but it's the prioritization of vaccines I mean well you know one of the real tragic stories right now in Africa is we are just finally bringing to a close this outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo far northeast part of the Congo you know 20-some thousand people have died from this okay bad been going on for almost two years and everybody talks about that and I understand why bola is a challenge but you know that during that same time period over 7,000 kids in that same area have died from measles because everybody was preoccupied trying to deal with Ebola and in that those deaths were totally preventable totally preventable so yeah I mean I I think that's you know I I have to say and you know this I'm already on this show so I'm not trying to thank you for what you do say about vaccines because people listen to you and we need every positive voice because we have so many crazy voices out there right now Center so paranoid and delusional and they want it all to be a conspiracy there's been an amazing medical innovation in in human culture and that's vaccines it's amazing what it's done and have there been adverse perfect effects on people of course everything everything that people do there's some people are gonna react in a bad way it doesn't mean it's not a positive thing and there's a reason why the cases of polio are so tiny there's a reason why smallpox went away it's because of vaccines absolutely and you know what that's one of the challenges you know today between the the anti science misinformation that's out there but then when they don't see it yes and the reason they don't see it is because we did vaccinate until we get enough people not vaccinated and then look what happened there's a famous photo of two twins from the early 20th century one of them has smallpox and one of them was vaccinated have you seen that I have I have I have it's alive to my photo very Kelly Jamie you'll find it because it's people need to see it that that that is the dirty up there is right there that's it right there that's the one one kid whose body is just devastated by what looks like he's like pebbles glued to his skin all over his body's face his hands and then the his brother right next to them with nothing and you know what's really important to note here is is that in that body all those things are very painful but what's going on inside the body is equally bad yeah and so you're exactly right I couldn't agree with you more that you know this is this is really an important point diseases are terrifying they're really terrifying yeah and when something like this can be prevented and the reason why people don't do it is because they're paranoid of vaccines and they get that information from some wacko website or some person who really has no business talking about it you know whether it's the people out there that think it causes diseases or that it's a government plot or that it's a medical scam is just trying to raise raised money it's just all that all of its very very disturbing but it's a part of people you know the human beings for whatever reason there's a percentage of us that lean towards conspiratorial thinking and they lean towards thinking that there's some sort of a plot against them or the governments against them and it's just you gotta listen to the medical experts you know and I hope that if there's any good to come out of this terrible coronavirus situation is there's a wake-up call if we'd had a vaccine for this or one that even worked partially yeah think how different we'd be and you know what we got new other ones coming like those we have to use our creative imagination you know as I said in the book I the chapter on coronavirus is the title is SARS and MERS a harbinger of things to come yeah I mean we don't we can use our creative imagination to say we should be funding these things almost like we pay for our fire department imagine if we had to go out and buy a fire truck and when the 9-1-1 call came in yes we need to do it now it's kind of disturbing that's chapter 13 though I know it was well actually would you do me a favor you're gonna really a bit like this okay open up up to chapter 13 okay and when you look at it's towards the end there when you read the quote that goes with it okay okay so every every chapter started not with just a title but of a quote and and I think you'll find this one quite interesting bioterror opening Pandora's box that's not it that's not the chapter that's not it yes chapter 13 you're closed okay we stars and MERS a harbinger of things to come let's look at the quote underneath these make me look smarter Rudyard Kipling am the dawn comes up like thunder water china crost the bay china china what you said you did you put that in there because it really thought that a lot of this stuff was going to come out of China was that exactly no it says this is exactly we're talking about why do you why China because they have this incredibly large population two million they've got this food supply that is largely wildlife that comes into these markets whether there's this incredible contact between people and these animals and the crowded nature of that society I mean I think one of the things that surprises people to go to China 15 million population cities are common over there I mean we think of the United States we think of LA in New York and that's big okay over there I mean in Wuhan a city of 15 million the entire metropolitan area is 60 million and so you have people crowded so closely together that if you add in the bugs coming from these animals and then the potential for this kind of contact where it spreads quickly China has been a you know a bacterial and viral soup vessel for a long time that's again why we have to protect ourselves here because a bug anywhere in the world today can be a bug everywhere tomorrow and particularly when you're dealing with a massive number like these kind of cities so these wet they call them wet markets markets yep so that's what it is a lot of it is wildlife oh it's incredible you know you know I've hunted my life you know I've always loved to fly fish I love the outdoors okay I could never have imagined the animals you know I've spent time in these markets I remember one day spending a day in the Bangkok hanging at island market and it was about a mile by mile half wild big I mean and these tight aisles every animal imaginal the humans and I swear to god there were some out of the movies I think that we're in there and they're all just right on top of each other and I actually have a picture that I show in some of my lectures there is a situation where there's all these chickens in a cage I know 15 or 20 of them okay a big wire cage and it sat on top of a wider cage full of ferrets and ferrets are actually an animal model from flu standpoint that they do really well getting infected with flu viruses if you wanted to create the perfect experiment that no no University you know research group would let you do is you'd put Birds and ferrets like that together and that's just common that's just common that's common and so birds and ferrets together the something that's infecting the birds could jump to the ferret surprise air could breathe it out and we could get infected Christ and so these markets and in the I don't know what's going to happen here but for the first time we really saw the Chinese after this outbreak in Wuhan really start to put down some markers on what they're gonna do to supervise these markets I mean they self to eat but I think this is a dangerous practice where we see it but you know what happens and look at Africa with Ebola right you know bush meat is still very important and there's so much of the world that that's their primary food supply and when they say bush meat it's basically everything everything from bats we think that was the primary source of this outbreak in West Africa was a human bat that was consumed to eat him all the time really yeah yeah so you know and some of them are pretty big bats you know they're they're literally 3 feet wing spans or they're big and so you know that's one of the challenges we have with with China we know that this is going to happen it's going to occur we think of the flu virus is the same way and that's why we knew doing better flu vaccines you know this could just as easily be flu pandemic the same thing like 1918 so these wet markets they just have all these animals hanging out and some of them are still alive many of them are alive and you know they'll actually prepare them for you right there they basically kill them and got them and so forth you got some pictures of bizarre Wuhan Westman there you go Market menu shows over a hundred wild animals sold as food linked with virus unclear exactly what it looks like it's pretty amazing yeah let's see some images whoa whoa look at that rip look at that list I know he talks yeah people are eating pika oh yeah absolutely dear crocodiles turkey Swan Seton swans how dare you kangaroo squirrel snails foxes foxes and civet cats were the cause of the SARS up ostriches I've had that pretty delicious yep I'm a hypocrite look at me just centipedes geese hedgehogs goats Jesus so yeah it's a pheasant right that's normal so do we have a video of the market I want to see what whoa that freaky looking salamander size of that sucker big it that's a huge salamander I wouldn't like for you first the pictures I was fine and dark yeah come on what do you got cages of turtles and cages of bunnies oh yeah see it wow this wet market is very very so and these are enormous markets well they're huge they're in the number of people in them is incredible I mean they're getting the Animus from they're getting them from the water'll area from rural areas yeah yeah are they growing these things and farming them or are they some cases bone some cases both like a lot of the seafood today is actually being farmed so this is really like a giant petri dish yeah yeah I mean it's almost you're looking that fish looks not not that fresh whoa what's all that stuff rabbits and rabbits yeah Jesus but you're getting them on the ground why you know if we can't stop that we surely can try but if we can't so that we need to stop the infectious diseases coming from those animals to us look at them all wearing masks that's hilarious that was I think with the outbreak was that that might have been those gigantic things a mollusk what is that what are those things can't tell those look like giant mollusks yeah they are right no because yeah I'm ones behind I think you're right like huge muscles Wow look at those suckers behind them Wow yeah there's a lot of people in China they got to eat that's where it gets weird right this it's like how do you tell them that they've been doing they've been doing this for who knows how long how do you tell them to stop doing it or is is that impossible and is it more possible to just accelerate our vaccine program and try to preemptively create something to to address coronaviruses to address various various differently what other what other viruses are we concerned about other than coronavirus I think I think it's both I think the next most would not even next it's don't it's a cold virus you might call influenza I mean you know there have been 10 influenza pandemics in the last 250 years and each one of them was a little different but some have been horribly bad you know back in the 1500s even there was a major pandemic that occurred where Spanish cities were described as normally almost totally depopulated and so these viruses pop out and that's why we need new and better flu vaccines and we're all actually working on one now but it's still a ways off but having those would really prevent the big calamities meaning you know some of the things are gonna happen they're not good but they're not going to bring down supply chains and threaten governments and so forth and so I think the priority vaccines we need to get are for those diseases that we know could is the flu injection the most effective way or is a mist as effective like the I know that did do the mist up the nose yeah turns out that what research we have and our group was involved with some of it the flu mist and the nose works really well on children mostly because they haven't been infected yet themselves they don't have any protection and so that virus really multiplies in the nose remember this virus is adapted not to multiply in your lungs because the nose is colder than the lung and so it'll grow here it won't if you swallow it it won't grow in your lungs if you've already been infected ones then you actually have some interference in your nose there's a little bit of protection there so it works well in kids who haven't been infected before adults not so well for us the injection works best and you know I'm happy to report that although I'm not happy to report being an old man now I can even get the high-dose vaccine over age 60 so so they are actually you know the best we have the high-dose vaccine is better yeah it's better than the regular vaccine in turn you hit a certain age yeah but when you get a little older you need the higher dose because your immune system starting to wane you know you can actually have an less but what we need and aware that there was yeah there's a high dose there's a high dose yeah there's a higher dose vaccine oh so where do you get it like where if a person's listening this and they like any doctor any doctor's office and they will usually say that too if you're old for you know 60 you can get this vaccine so they'll actually do that for you so yeah so run out get a get a vaccine because - now is pretty much over the flu season is waning I mean if you hadn't gotten it you should have had it a couple of months ago okay this one's waning now we've had a bad flu season really bad but for the last couple weeks the numbers are coming away down so what what can person do other than the vaccine to prevent getting the flu that's primarily yet again it's a issue of who you're around you know and you know your body's overall health yep and just keep healthy as you can and then I think the other key piece though is if you do get the flu and you have really bad muscle aches one of the things about in real influenza is not just sniffles you feel like you got hit by a Mack truck if after several days you still are really feeling bad really bad and you haven't seen a physician by then you should because that's when you get the complications occurring the bacterial pneumonias that occur subsequent and if you get those treated earlier than later you can actually do a lot to keep somebody from dying so you know if you don't feel a lot better in two days I mean if you if you catch it really early you can get a medication for flu there's actually a medication that will reduce your illness a bit but if you're if you're sick for more than a couple days not better you absolutely should see a doctor so you don't have these other complications and what kind of doctor do once you any family any family practitioner would know what to look for and whether or not your lungs are starting to fill up you know if they'll they'll listen to your lungs to make sure you're not going developing pneumonia and what would they do for you they would likely give you an antibiotic based on what you had because you are then this the problem with flu is it's not just the flu virus but then you get secondary bacterial pneumonia from the damage in the lungs and so they can prevent that a lot of older people in particular will die from actually what we call secondary pneumonia to having had influenza they wouldn't gotten the pneumonia if they had not had flu but then they do now we were talking earlier about probiotics do do is there a benefit of probiotics once you've taken antibiotics to Riefler --is-- your gut flora you know that's where the studies really at this point have demonstrated that it's very temporary in other words if you're taking probiotics you can get a boost initially but it doesn't sustain yourself over time and then the natural flora comes back I mean the gut microbes will come back as as they've been reduced but what I'm saying is is it beneficial to people if they do take a probiotic after antibiotics antibiotics do have a devastating effect on your floor yeah kills the bad stuff but it also kills a lot of the good stuff right yeah so is it beneficial for people once they have taken an antibiotic to take probiotics to sort of reflect an pereira yeah and that's what i'm saying is that it doesn't the data don't support that it stays in other words you get a short-term boost material but they don't stay around what if you just keep taking it even then they they just don't stay around your normal gut flora will come back and take over so the probiotics and of themselves are not giving you that long-term boost so you don't think there's any benefit to having even even a short-term boost well you know it's again I surely I'm not gonna profess to be the expert on probiotics right tell you that the data we have doesn't show that they have a big boost and and that they actually help you long term or short term meaning that it makes any difference now there's one exception to that where I would say and this is a very different thing than probiotics but we actually have a disease called Clostridium difficile which is a bad bacteria that happens when you've taken away too many antibiotics and and it's colonizes your gut because you don't have competing organisms there and then you can die from this there are treatments for that called actually fecal transplants yeah I've heard of that and that's where actually there you take it little capsules but it's actually drinking poop when purified purified bugs from the poop you're right but you take that and that's that's that kind of is what you're talking about that does have a real benefit and there is clear evidence that if you take those those fecal transplants as opposed to just probiotics or such that that can have a major positive impact on your recovery from things like claustrum difficile infection and so more and more institutions now actually are doing fecal transplants which you'd never thought that that would be one thing you do one day but after those have had this problem they're there life-saving there maybe we should change the name that would although on the other hand you don't forget it if yeah yeah you don't forget if it's a fecal transplant but that's what's gonna be yeah nerve-wracking to people yeah yeah you know once you're that sick boy it feels good to take it does you know have you done it I've never done it I've never had a problem where I've had to but but for the I've know people who have been desperately sick who have taken them and have really done much better much much better I want to ask you about Lyme disease sure Lyme disease is a scary one right and I mean so many of my friends in the East Coast have it it's really terrifying that that that part of the country in particular seems to be like really badly infected with these these ticks that carry this disease what can people do to prevent that and what can we there's no vaccine for Lyme disease and I know there was at one point but people were having an issue with I mean a good friend of mine her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine before they discontinued it what can someone do to sort of protect themselves yeah well Lyme disease in of itself is a fascinating story I've actually been involved with it since its early discovery in the 1980s and Minnesota Wisconsin was a big focus the Upper Midwest and this is a story that I think you'll find interesting is is that even though it was discovered primarily in the eastern part of the United States named after a Lyme Connecticut it's a disease that actually probably originated in the Upper Midwest and I tell you that because it turns out that there is a focus in northern Wisconsin in and east central Minnesota where there's Lyme disease there's another disease called anaplasmosis there's another disease but Visia etc that all seem to have a similar kind of tick human deer kind of component and back in the ccc days of the 1930s the white-tailed deer population had been virtually totally depopulated from the northeast and so they actually trapped deer in northern Wisconsin and took them out and de+ in the New York and Connecticut and so forth and most of those deer are actually deer that you know today their great great great great great grandfather came from Wisconsin Wow and guess what when you move deer you move ticks in fact I was involved with the study that the Wisconsin Division of Health did and a colleague of mine the late Jeff Davis we're up in northern Wisconsin as deer would come into the check station and they would actually measure the number of ticks that were attached to the nape of the neck okay and they had a lot of thing drawn and they asked hunters who were driving back to Madison and Milwaukee if they would be willing to check in at a station down there for just a second and then they were gonna count the ticks again and it turned out that as the vehicles come rolling down from highway 51 from northern Wisconsin get on the interstate 90 94 and go to Milwaukee or Madison the ticks just kept falling off by the time they get to Madison or Milwaukee the ticks are almost all gone well guess lo and behold where all the Lyme disease so forth started to show up right along the interstate corner Wow because the ticks were coming off and then they were getting into the local deer in that population and so it's exactly you said the ticks are moving they're moving okay they've moved and they're now infected so I think that that this Lyme disease issue is a key one Lyme disease is really an important disease it's real no question about it the challenge we have is is that there's a lot of people that assume that they have chronic Lyme infection and you know the data on that is just really really not there to support that these people are chronically infected but they do have an immune response likely that occurs where it sets up this trigger and so they're sick they actually have something but it's not treating it again for the bacterial infection it's the fact that this body your bone body's immune systems we've talked about several times today but starts attacking you site I think it's a similar picture we see with chronic fatigue syndrome same kind of thing these people really are sick they really do have problems but it's not something you can treat so when people I I have a challenge because when people take IV antibiotics at extended periods of time for Lyme disease you know the data there's four different studies not have been done where people have had what we call a double-blind of control well SIBO controlled trial where half got the drug half got a IV but no drug and it turned out all four of these studies and Lyme disease the people who got the gist the placebo did just the same as the people got the drug and I worry that we're using antibiotics a lot there and this is where I just mentioned earlier about claustrum difficile we actually had a patient Minnesota that died from the IV treatment for what was chronic Lyme disease and wouldn't have been helpful and so we need a lot more research in this area to figure out what are these people getting what is it that we can shut off so that they don't have this chronic Lyme disease picture knowing that it's not actually just you had a treat of more treatments that can help them with the antibiotics anymore and so I think that that's an area that we just need a lot more work in and the numbers are growing as you know yeah so we don't we don't know what's happening well there's a we have enough data to say your immune system is really cranked up our immune system is you know just like something yeah it's like rheumatoid arthritis a lot of things well you know we you know thank God for our immune system is what fights off all the bad things we have but sometimes that immune system gets turned on too much yeah and then it takes on us okay and and it goes back to the corona virus that's why a lot of these people are dying right now is this over vigorous immune response and Lyme disease is kind of that in Fame and sighting event where we have evidence now that you could be infected with the bacteria but if we treat you it's not like it's like every other bacteria you can really get rid of it but you still have this chronic illness that's occurring and what I think is hard is is that we see people who have this who are desperate to have somebody understand what they have and they end up going to people who take a real advantage of clinicians who charge them an arm and a leg for things that are not going to help them and what we need is a lot more research on what is actually going on and what kind of drugs can we use to reverse this immune system disorder I have a friend of mine who's a UFC fighter Jim Miller and he's he's got Lyme disease and it's pretty bad I mean he takes a stack of pills I don't know what he takes every day yeah what do you think someone is taking and what what benefit would they get from that I couldn't tell with I mean I'm not you know without knowing what's there but again more often than not effuse been adequately treated it's not that the bacteria still growing in him like it might be for a lot of it it's an autoimmune it's autoimmune too which is real I mean that's the other thing is I think these people just want to be legitimized and said you know I'm really sick right and I'm not it's not something I'm you know mentally ill about whatever but then we've got to figure out what it is that you have and so we really don't know we don't know yet we don't know wow but it's been around for so long I know but this is where we need a lot more research about this of in terms of what is it that's making these people like this and this is really important and is there anything they can do to eradicate the text you know that this is another thing you'll find interesting in Minnesota prior to the arrival of the first whiteman the Native Americans burned much of our state all the time the prairies from much of the territory even in northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota we had the classic you know pine forest firewood wipes room and with that it would open up so much of the forest that you'd have a very different kind of mammals population diro cetera cetera and with the suppression of fire what's happened is we now have instead of having these old-growth forests we have all this younger you know non pine or any kind of like the oak trees of the Upper Midwest are all disappearing because oak trees need sunlight and fires what kept they were very resistant to fire and so the old oak forests and so forth would would survive because of fire whereas today with no fire you know the Elms and the maples and everything else comes in and the buckthorn all that kind of stuff and takes over so so what's happening is in our state of Minnesota is we have a really good example of this as we're losing our moose and the big primary reason is brain worm it's rain more brain room it's a type of parasite that's common and whitetail deer but causes no problems in moose it actually causes a brain infection and it kills them and guess why is happening because the deer range has moved farther and farther north in Minnesota try to keep this I'm sorry that has moved farther in North Miller in Minnesota because of lack of fire because the forest is changing so now where they're only used to be moose we're seeing deer and moose and where that intersection is we're starting to see moose develop this brain worm infection because it's from the deer so the tick population has changed too and it's largely due to the fire lack of fire in many places in the Northeast never used to be like it was we had fire all the time that would clear out these areas and it was just a part of natural everything so so one of the challenges we have with ticks is they're here we're not gonna change how we live suburbs and you know trees and all that controlled burns eliminate a lot of them they do because what they do is they just eliminate the ticks but what they do is they eliminate for example the white field mice or all these different species that are important to the ticks and then they bring in different species that will will be there so I mean this is a big debate in Minnesota right now I mean we're losing all these moose to brain worm ironically the moose or population is expanding dramatically and I'll Royal why because there's no deer out there and so they're not getting brain worm out there so people have said you know the we're gonna lose our moose well so it's the deer so so fire actually has helped the most in areas in northern Minnesota where there's been a lot of fire the moose population is growing because the deer are not there because exactly those mammals those rodents and so forth are very different in burnt-out areas and they are and find non burnt-out areas well they do control burns in some states I got a I had a friend who's hunting in Washington State a couple of years ago and he said it was really weird because there's these massive fires in the distance that were actually being controlled they do it on purpose yeah which is a lot better than having the out of control fires where you have so much fuel yeah and you know if you haven't had a forest fire in eighty five hundred years in an area the fuel and there's huge yeah and so actually they do that in northern Minnesota - they're doing control burns and the prairies of course we do control burns all the time so but the problem with the East Coast is you're dealing with a lot of these sort of almost residential areas that have all these ticks yeah you can't then they're you can't there we have to find ways that's that's where we really have to have vaccines and treatments for these diseases Rock get rid of the ticks so what we have to do is figure out I mean wouldn't we have a cocktail vaccine for male Babesia for Lyme disease for yeah you know that's what we need is there any kind of an animal that eats ticks birds yeah birds will eat them but not enough no no no no they're they're doing very well thank you ticks do very well and that's another issue you know for some of the larger mammals as you know tick predation can get so heavy particularly in in in certain times of the year that the it really literally takes a lot of blood on these large animals even though they're so big yeah rabbit hold the other day online and I saw this one deer that was covered in these frisbee sighs yeah patches of ticks that's exactly what all swollen also and they're full of blood oh and it happens day after day so that it is a hit on them it's a real hit on them to pull up a picture of that just have freaked people out of watching online just they need to see this yeah yeah it's pretty amazing it's one of those things that when you talk about ticks and you talk about Lyme disease most people their eyes glaze over they don't even care it's not affecting me until someone in your family has it yep there's a guy that I know who was a former UFC fighter Marcus Davis who he put he had his wife got Lyme disease and he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to trying to help burn and do something about in treatments and all these different things for it yeah it's a it's a real challenge it's a challenge and this is another area again you know when you think of the amount of money we lose in just lost time let alone pain and suffering yeah what an investment to make it is I mean this this is the kind of thing this is where infectious diseases really needed a renaissance I mean well we do a lot here we pulled up a chart of the United States where they showed the areas that are affected by these ticks and what what percentage of ticks carry Lyme disease they've tested and some places in the Northeast this and the 60% Oh exactly yeah it is it's huge it's growing and it's ground I mean you've made me you and understand how wildlife has changed I mean look at to think that we have all these wild coyote populations in New York City now yes it mean it's amazing how the animals the city in the country yeah you know what the rats aren't doing the coyotes are taken out and it's it's it's a challenge I mean these are effect infectious disease issues too they're they're very real yeah they have coyotes in Central Park they do yeah absolutely then the Bronx they have them and it's weird it's weird to see because this is something just didn't exist before look at this that's very good that's okay yeah that's okay that's not not that's not the best I've seen but it's gross enough yeah it is it gives you a good sense of it though yeah dan Flores who has been a guest on the podcast before has a great book called coyote America that sort of details how this came to be and how these coyotes have look at that all over that poor deer look at the eye on the fawn yeah yeah they're disgusting yeah but the Coyotes about how when they got rid of the wolves and they tried to do the same to the coyote they just actually expanded their territory and they're sneaky very clever little animals adaption yeah just like microbes adaption you know is there anything else that we should cover no I mean I think I thank you for covering this issue an interesting disease as we can use all the help we can to get people to be aware of what's out there and what's coming and just keeping the message straight and we're gonna get through this but at the same time it's going to be a challenge you know today you have an underlying health problem and you're particularly over age 50 55 I'd say avoid big crowds if you can and that's going to be really important and know that we're gonna work on the critical drug supply to make sure that people aren't without drugs that save their lives every day that's gonna be a big challenge one more question how long does it take to develop a vaccine for this coronavirus well you know when I'm asked that question I don't mean to sound glib again but I can make a vaccine for an overnight the question is is it safe and effective hmm and that's the challenge we have right now questions about how do you make community to a coronavirus and what kind of vaccines you have to have that brings in all the different parts of the immune system so we don't know that yet so some of this research is going to have to be basic to that the second thing we have to worry about of safety there's a condition in humans called antibody dependent enhancement 8ee and it turns out that if you have no antibody or immune response you'll get the disease if you have a lot you're protected but if you have this in-between level and then you get the disease it actually enhances the disease immune response is really destructive and in fact there was just a couple years ago a major recall of dengue vaccine the type of vaccine we used for mosquito infection in the Philippines were kids who got the vaccine actually made just a little bit of antibody and when they got the real disease that made him a lot sicker and so we found with the 2003 SARS vaccine that there was an 80 e component to it when we made it in animals and so we're gonna have to really study this to be sure it's safe and as you said earlier you know we can surely make mistakes we don't you know we needed to I mean we can not - and so I think between getting the effectiveness and the safety data together were years out I mean maybe years yeah this is not going to happen soon yeah you know it's wishful thinking you know every time I mean I go back to SARS in 2003 and look at every event Zika 2015 we said Oh we'll have a vaccine for it in no time here we are five years later and we've no vaccine and so this is one of the challenges we have we have to complete the job you know it's like we start on something and then we forget that it's important because it kind of goes away for a while but only to come back and so this is part of that picture we talked about and this is what Peter Hotez talks a lot about you know we gotta finish the job on these things you know I worry that we'll get through this situation and then people say oh we're done and then we'll forget until the next one comes along and so so this is where vaccine research and development is really important how do they test for safety so once they come up with a potential vaccine how do they make sure that it's safe what you do it gradually first of all you put it into animals to see and you know enough about them how their immune responses what do they do then you put it into a few humans 30 humans you know they volunteer willingly knowing to see what kind of reactions they have well I would just take really bad people that are in jail and practice on them well I I don't know if that's doable here in this country without their informed consent so I'll just wrump can fix that anybody if we have a shot at doing that with any president it's try just start with rapists yeah so anyway the bottom line though is is that then they gradually work their way up to larger studies where you know if something happens one every thousand people you have to study a lot of people before you know the chance that you might find that right 30 people so that's why it's gonna take a while and you know they'll test it on more and more people and they're going as fast as they can it's not like there's anybody dragging their feet it's just that you know I joke in lycée it's like if the Iowa farmer wanted to harvest corn in half the time it doesn't mean by planting twice as many acres he can do that you know planting in April you still can't harvest October that's a good thing that's what this is it's gonna take us this long to get this vaccine well Michael I appreciate you and I appreciate your time and deadliest enemy people go out and buy it and thank you for informing yes and thanks for being here it means a lot to us thank you very much thanks thank you oh I'd love to I'd love to get a fish with you [Music]
