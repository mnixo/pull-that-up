it's something I gotta find something all right you gotta find a struggle it's very important to have a struggle gotta have something you got accomplished because you complain I've already oh we competitive it there's a little bit of that what's going on man you how do I turn the hip on over there which one is it Jamie check check check oh he's in my ears we're live what's our UI it's crazy how we look at each other when walking I know it's crazy let me embrace lean into you huh it's been a long time hey man what's up now where do you go now I don't know just try to stay alive keep moving no you're doing it I mean whose ass are you gonna work one day one day stand up you've called out somebody you called out a motherfucker we get in the crate that was crazy when we was doing stand-up like it was like it was like gunslingers what happened was there nothing you called him out there well that was a bad situation we had a he was stealing everybody am i bringing up the wrong shit no no it's okay Oh cuz I was getting try to be nice because the terrain we was just talking about off of Mike about how how would we would have been in jail yeah had there been social media we'd have life double life I'll be looking at you of myself in you had to kill colors well we were talking about everybody that like came up in the 60s or 70s the 80s the 90s everyone before social media the wild lives they lead you can't do that anymore you can't do it and what this comes as you came for all y'all just you know tune in we were talking about like you know Chris Brown I'll see Chris Brown he'll come on my house and he'll he'll he'll just sit there and go like what the fuck you know and I said listen you're just too talented for one cat's like him and Justin Bieber who've been who've been blessed with extra they look good they can fight they they're athletic and they sing like a damn stick a dance first time I met Chris Brown this is crazy I'm throwing a party in Miami and it's me and Colin Farrell Eddie Murphy you know anywhere if he was still in it this years back like to 2005 me I think yeah 2005 and so I'm hosting a party when in Miami the crowds going crazy with in the down like not in the VIP it's some kids dancing I think dance you know this year and so my DJ DJ our egos y'all man that's a new kid Chris Brown you he bout to be the next one I said yeah but he think he can damn cuz you know I'm not dad I'll go fuck him up this young know who I am I'll come down and fuck him up and it was like okay so I'll go down there now you know it's sort of my time and so everybody's following me I'm about to go battle whoever this kid is so I said yeah bro you think you could dance on I did like some kind of bullshit listen to me we're all we're all jammed together right he doesn't do a move you know what he does he does a backflip but the way he did the backflip and he's 6 2 he's standing in the middle of the crowd he jumped over the crowd did the backflip up here and came straight down and said what's up I said mom I got my leave you the fuck Avenger shit and I just said that do when he get on and then you know he gets on but then social media catches on and then it's just hard it's hard it's it's hard to live when you live when your social media not telling all the time you have this social media sort of makes you color inside the lines yeah or try to I try to yeah or like this it makes you took your artistry and sometimes does that mean tuck you crazy and tuck you crazy and you tuck your artistry in like I didn't know what a mean wasn't you know I'm you know you know shit I'm gonna fucking I was just catching on to MySpace and shit shifted so my daughter sends me a picture Rhianna right going to the Met Ball and by the time I got the picture whatever happened the picture was Rihanna and and in his yellow dress and I hit my daughter I said I love the dress is amazing I don't understand the pizza that's in it but me you know maybe that's a you know she's given a nod to Italy or maybe she got the dress forever she's like no dad that's a meme I said way that's a meme so what do you mean she says no there's actually not a pizza in the dress somebody crafted or fixed it there they made it look like it's pizza because oh because it's trailing behind her and so me I'm thinking well what the fuck does it mean this is know I said so this girl worked her whole fucking night to get this dress to go to the Met Ball which is you're supposed to be you know out the box and somebody puts a pizza on it and that's all you see is a pizza I said how do you compete with that how could you be Michael Jordan and kids run up do you say like the best thing on the internet it's one of the best things about the it is people being able to make funny it's the best thing but watch this so it wants his sticks that's what I'm saying Michael warning to somebody under the age of 18 heat a cry baby face you know fans do a mean cry right we go yeah yeah well we were talking about Jon Jones you had how John Jones fighting this weekend oh yeah John Jones is a wild motherfucker and that's why he's the greatest light heavyweight of all time because he's so pits part of it you have to have it we talked about going go be with Mike Tyson Mike Tyson back in the day you couldn't that's why when people say like why does Mike Tyson first of all he's a fighter he's not a tennis player but Mike was a WoW boy and to hang out with him you could understand like he was the biggest person on the planet and he had the demons you know I'm saying and but he's fun to look at because you see him in a club and he sees he sees some girls eww like cars like BMWs and crazy he'd take the girls out and go get a BMW I mean he was that crazy come on come on look at the beer and we open up the BMW dealership but he was wild but I say just like how we saying off it you can't have that type of talent in that area and not have this John John Jones can't you can't you can't drink milk and and almost kill somebody you can yeah there's got to be something about you that's out of control in the impulsive wild dangerous and that's what makes him so great everybody even talked about you look at the people on your wall you look at Hendrix you look at Elvis they have to have something because that's God fuckin with ya God's gonna give you something incredible but he's also gonna give you something to anchor that because I believe this is what I believe in and you tell me if you believe I believe in the yin and the yang of everything meaning like when there's absolute light there has to be absolute darkness to balance it out and that's with everything that we do it's sort of like we're not gonna get away with anything by anything that happens to you in life you have to pay for it like it's like the grocery store okay I got the career boom gotta pay for that okay I got the money okay I gotta pay then here come the family oh yeah I need that money yeah you you you fuckin I'm going I'm going I'm a recent released a story about you so it's all of these different things that you got to pay for and that's why you see these guys like that cuz you know like I said talking to Justin Bieber you know where everything that said some of this shit is supposed to happen to you it has to you can't otherwise the think of the success that kids had at 20 years old it's impossible I was just reading some shit about him canceling his tour yeah cuz he just had too much work I mean he's just going crazy I guess but he's made 93 million dollars this year yeah like Jesus Christ yeah I'm gonna take that 90 million I'm gonna go do a million but we can't be in his mind and we can't see how it is he grew up that way and grew up that way never had a normal life and you don't expect like I like I always tell kids who want to be in this business - please wait like even when my kids - just wait wait till you like wait you're gonna understand like I was able to be grown and have some grown shit happened to me and just regular life should happen so that when this happened I still have a point of reference to get back to because you know like I know you've interviewed everybody this business affects you in such a way where you'll see one person one day I won't say the comedian's name but I remember a comedian back in the day did like half of an HBO whatever and then the next week I saw him he had 12 bodyguards and they were pushing me back just got crazy got crazy crazy crazy and I see I won't say the names but they've been a couple of guys I never get this one to hit and I went up to try to say something to him it and for some reason he had a white suit on white suit on and these big shades and I went to talk to him and he said not right now man I'm rich just let me be rich and famous right now I don't want to hear your pitch about pitching summits man you think you could get away and as he said it I had to sort of like okay but that's you know that's what happens but you gotta be careful that tide goes in and it goes out and people come up and they remember they remember and they remember when you fucked with them and we see and we've seen them we've seen them but but being a comedian we get we get a chance to sit in a different seat because we sort of are our jobs or observational you know and we still all have our own demons but it's it's just different you also get humbled as a comedian yeah you got to get those jokes you're performing in front of a live audience it's all alive you got to work and it doesn't work back to drawing boys got assessed actors don't get a lot of that that's one of the reasons why they're kind of shaky yeah more shaky yeah right they don't get a lot of like that testing it live in front of people that humility only comes with that you don't and it's and it's tough I was talking to actor another actor it stuck I see I'm a comic who became an actor so I'm cheating do this and I know I'm a being st. Louis tomorrow you know that's a joke so I can you know I gotta get my thing off but just actors it's tough when you figure out a way to balance three careers you sing too I mean you could do anything you're a weird guy in that way you got a lot of weird talent yourself is he talking about Justin Bieber and yeah Chris Brown you've got some weird ability to shift to its I not only had but I've been fortunate in the fact that nothing's I've opened up like you know back in the day like you could only do one thing one thing I would never forget Keenen Ivory Wayans told me say yo what's with the singing shit yo you warned them of it I can't see you try to sing can you see them no this is real in gurbin Oh Jaime stop you too funny in the face - funny I see Wanda singing to me you finally that's porn ba stop so I was like fuck maybe I'll never sing you don't so I was doing of course to stand up you know doing the wireless shit and then it wasn't until literally I was throwing these parties in my crib and I would always throw parties for like musical guys you know so I threw a party for puff puff comes and big party it's like mm puff is there and it's all about him and I'll never get he got mad at me a little bit because I would follow him and I I would actually follow him with it with a camera because I thought that at that time puff was the biggest guy in the world you know you couldn't get in his party so the way I were getting this party is I show up with a camera like you're puff you need document document - shit what's up Playboy I said yeah let me get there ain't nobody getting this tonight and it wasn't back in the day with the you know with the camera phone I had the big fucking cannon that you put on your shoulder in the light and shit I said let me change the battery let me get all this shit right so at one point I told him we were actually in Philly he was throwing a party he said you'll Playboy this party's a million and a half dollars I said like what I'm saying he said it'd cost a million and a half dollars to throw this party I said oh my god I love it the party's amazing yes the mayor is here in everything I said but that's too much money as you come to my place in LA I'll throw your party for 400 bucks that will rival this party and he got a little mad cuz you know he was like y'all know I'm known for this shit don't front I said I respect you I said but la I just know how to get around so he gets to LA and he calls me early in the morning y'all play but make that shit happen as a setter I said cool I'm going on my phones and by 12 o'clock at my small house in Tarzana and God bless my neighbors that live there I'm no longer there I know that he wanted me to get out it was too much but the party's fevered pitch and I invited the right people you know the right girls were beautiful but not too tight not too you know just everything was great the guys went no hater is there you know LA you know me fucking not wondering that it was the right guys and he shows up and when he shows up he goes that's the girl on that TV show that's the girl in the movie you're a friend he's like we're all hanging out here so it's like you know it's all good and that's the cookie I said yeah yeah I said but look at the party I said look over there on the table I got Kentucky Fried Chicken but I put it in a nice plate I got coca-cola but it's just in a picture I said we're at 280 bucks right now and Counting I won't go over 400 and he had the most incredible time right but at that party was all musical people and I I did it for a reason at that party Missy Elliott of course she had her room everybody's going crazy with Missy Elliott I'm going to my garage and there's two guys a little guy like this and on tall guy had the little guy go she'll be you know it's like this all the time be I said yeah who you he said uh we didn't have tunes my name is Pharrell I said yeah I'm gonna hurt you that's how long ago this was wow so he's like can I just go and have a great time there was another guy standing on the wall green jacket like a green little jumpsuit nobody's talking to him guess who was who jay-z great party so hazy no one knows but and now the way I got into the music however is that all these different party was going on and I would have liked different musical people leaving me music in my little studio that I built I went and got this great studio built in them back in my house and so one day in comes his kid backpack on jaws busted who is it who it's Kanye his jaws busted for my car accident right Kanye and walks in and I said who's that I said what I said new motherfucker Kanye may about to be the shit I said what do you do well he produces but he also raps I said well anybody come to my house they gotta perform so I said yo man they say you you know you rap shit he rapped the most incredible free I don't know if it's free so it wasn't her I said I don't know why you aren't famous he did it with a broken jaw he had a little brittle jobs a little swollen I don't think was broken but a little swollen cuz it wasn't too long after that accident that he had right and then he goes uh I got a song dad you look you'll be good on I got the song I know you could kill I was like me song goofy face [Laughter] yeah shit cool so we go in the back one my stats got studio on the bed so he sings he says the song is gonna go she said she want some Marvin Gaye some Luther Vandross so I said I got it she says she wants some Marvin Gaye he's like what do you know what I said well I got to put the you know the arm be on it you know I'm saying I'm a real singer you know I've been singing he said don't do that just sing the song cuz it's hip-hop and I said ok cool so I but gradually sung the song I'm thinking songs wack he's not gonna make it so I went off I did a bad movie I come back about six weeks eight weeks later that song is number one my boy goes like you remember that song you said what shit is number one in the country and then that's how I got into the music so long story longer it's like yeah you can do all of the things and there's a lot of actors and actresses that can you just need those opportunities like in life when you're when your opportunity comes if you're prepared for it now you could jump into it and grab it and what I was told was by my god Breann who does all of my music he found slow jams he found gold that he found blame it on the alcohol he says you got to stop singing funny shit and seeing a real record and once you sing the real record and not say it's you singing it now you got a better go so now after all of those years the people that grew up with me what doing stand-up or watch it cutting date they're older and that a young folks is like you to Kanye man just like how you know the guys now going to Michael John so so as I get older you hope that you're blessed with opportunities and you know so old Sam butters sort of reinvent or reintroduce yourself to people who may not know who you are well it's also guys like you have other interests you have more than one interest you don't just want to be funny yeah there's a lot going on in there it's a lot you know but like like we all are like comedians we got a lot of shit that we want to get out and like I said being a comedian we have we used to have it's getting is getting crazier it's getting tough on us as far as you know everything we say you know they want to come kill this right I mean I did I did one I did Jimmy Fallon once eating that Jimmy Fallon in every organization want to get me what did you say I was doing a joke I'm singing you singing these funny songs about who let the dogs out and so we took who let the dogs out and put it in like a like that like a vaudeville or a show tune who left the dogs at whatever it was right but beginning of that I sort of ad-lib like I was watching these dogs in they were coming towards me and I was wondering you know who let them out and there was a pitbull there and you know you have to be careful because pitbulls can be cantankerous you know and then I go onto the song the pitbull community it was like Jamie Foxx says pitbull Seamus and then there was another thing where Jimmy Fallon was doing was doing some type of uh he was saying what was gonna be in the next show and I was doing a bad version of signing which I actually know how to sign I was doing a bad version of sign language I know sign look talking about it later you know all those types of different thing but as I was doing it as joke I didn't know that the person that he was talking about happen to be deaf oh no oh my god and so then you know so just all these things and I try to tell people I said hey listen we never mean anything bad we poke fun but we're not we don't mean anything bad but you can just you know we can't you can't kill us all right and cuz I gotta keep doing what I do you know so it's it's getting tougher well it's just what we're talking about about social media about people commenting on things that you can't read the comments there's just too many people yeah and people are always looking for something to be recreationally outraged at yeah in the comments to get that ass through the comment comment hit you right where you are sometimes right well it's good to a little bit it went there right when they're actually right like someone can say something ridiculous about you and if you know it's ridiculous it doesn't mean anything but if it's got a hint of truth you like but when somebody says something about your teeth you kind of look in the mirror house damn fuck I guess somebody hit me with the donkey then you know it's fucking donkey so you know but I tell people all the time don't read the comments that's the book don't your comments cuz it will make you start to change the way you do things if I read all of the comments I never tell another joke yeah if I read all the comments I'll never try another you know I got a movie that we just shot for a little of nothing called all-star weekend and if the jokes are like all the way out there you know and it's I got everybody in it you know and we're all taken we're all play different characters like I play a white racist white racist cop and how do you do that oh I'll show it to you I'll grab everything show to you but it's a Robert Downey jr. plays in Mexican Gerard Butler plays a Russian who loves gymnastics Benicio del Toro plays this crazy tattoo artists and we're all you know we're all doing our thing so it's like if you read the comments that'll make you tuck that in but this is some brilliant and it's it's a cool little thing - it's called all-star tweaking for a reason it's about two guys one guy loves Steph Curry the other guy loves LeBron James and all they're trying to do is get to the all-star game and it's sort of like this whole journey of running all these people so it's dope but it is some things where it's like oh you know you can see there's gonna be some some shit going on well Robert Downey jr. just from Tropic Thunder think about that you could never do that anymore you can't have blackface anymore yeah you know what I'll say this people have to understand where it comes from there are real people out there that really mean you harm like outside of us I mean there's some real people who really don't fucking like you whatever you are whether you're black you're white you're straight you're gay whatever it is there's some people who really don't like with the entertainment and it's easy we're easy targets what easy it's easy for you to jump on and Robert Downey jr. or Jaime 5 so Jo because it's easy you know when it's real things which you know whether it's politics or whether it's whatever a lot of times we we sort of we're not ready for that fight but it's easy to sort of pick the comedian I call Robert I said listen I need you to play a Mexican he says dude here's the deal sure why not fuck it sure of course yeah Mexican whatever but then he text back and said I'm nervous to play the Mexican I said wolf shit you played the black dude and you killed that shit we're just all you know we got to be able to care what kind of blowback did you get from playing the black dude none because we fuss before the wire too though it was like what year was Tropic Thunder I feel like I was like 10 years ago it was wild but but here's the thing we fucked with Robert Downey jr. like that's my guy right like I did his birthday party and my first joke was how dare you take all of these roles from black people you know anyway everybody's laughing so it's sort of like the entertainer's man we should you got to give us room you know I'm saying like to play in it I'll show you when I got to take that room you got take it you can't worry about ourselves Chappelle's was like you never asked him about his jokes and he's like yo man look you know people have said worth shit and I think he said something about Donald Trump saying grab by the pussy or some shit whatever but it was true it was like the one thing that you look at what happened with politics this year people sort of stripped away a lot of things you know saying regardless of what you believed in whatever person you voted for there was a lot of things that was sort of addressed about like maybe we were playing things a little too close like some of those politicians were afraid to say what Donald Trump was saying and they ended up being left in the dust because people a little like whoa what he's got a point in the sense that we're playing things a little too close so when you look at that as a comedians like wow you know that was that was good for me and it was good for me in a certain way of first of all it's great jokes - it's like it does say are we becoming too fragile when it comes to our race like black folk like I say yeah some people are racist and some people are perception is know what that means know the perception is okay the perception in America was the white man Donald Trump can be President the woman can't do it perception doesn't mean that if you vote for Ronald Donald Trump that you're racist I don't think everybody was that was a big thing sometimes it's perception I'll make I'll make it clear okay I do a joke in front of all black people and I said black people are very interesting people because we deal with racism and perception ISM I said because we're very nervous flyers all right we don't like to get home planes first thing we do when we get on the plane we see who's flying this motherfucker we look in the cockpit if we look and see a black guy we will stop and go eh how long you been flying you got your hours with you and it was the perception and don't let a woman sit next to him oh shit we good uh-huh it could be a bright sunny day is that how's the weather oh we're good and then as you're sitting in that seat anytime you hit a bump bump my breath will be straight same situation you go in in the cockpit you see that white guy with that salt-and-pepper hair and those aviators and its form here like this in a storm and I sat shit fly to shit through a hurricane so it's the perception that we have to talk about sometime does that make sense oh it definitely makes sense yeah you know there's definitely that you know like the the Donald Trump thinks funny know who had it said it best Alonzo Bodden you know Alonzo no I was a funny comedian yeah he said he goes not all Donald Trump supporters are racist but all racists are Donald Trump supporters that he definitely awaken that side but I will but I will say this like I said the perception gets us all - yeah you know cuz like my daughter it was interesting my oldest you know my oldest daughter like when when when the election happened and when you know the results came in y'all vote but you know I said well you know you got to get out there because their perception was she had it in the bag right you know so you got to get out there and be you know whatever that is yeah whatever that is indeed this is weird times for everybody you know because I think social media is allowing people to express themselves yeah everybody's expressed themselves and luring them forming groups you know they're just like you know they're progressive or they're they're they're liberal or they're conservative and this everybody has a voice is everybody has a voice there's so much voices I'll say this maybe you can appreciate this because we've we've lived we're living in tours we lived when it wasn't here and it's its discretion social media allows you not to have discretion you're able to go in and type whatever you want to say and that usually that's what we pay attention to discretion is this we're sitting at the dinner table and yo I said something that you didn't like but the discretion was I'll address that later right so now that you don't have any discretion anybody's voice can be heard not everybody how do you say it not everybody has a point that we should hook all of our wagons to write what I notice is that we will hook our wagons to the most extreme point and that maybe only 2500 people like when my homies with him and said maybe what they say men about sons I said how many views are to get eighty thousand views I says eight million people in Philly alone why are you just listening to those eighty thousand people so you sort of have to put balance in the way you sort of sift through it does that make sense it doesn't make sense yeah well the way I try to pour it out to people if you run into a room and there's a hundred people in that room what are the odds that one person is a fucking idiot 100% right yeah one person almost almost every room of a random group of a hundred people yeah Italy and I'm being very very polite one person that means probably a few probably a few but let's go with one one out of a hundred so that means there's three million fucking idiots in this country right just straight idiots right non fixable idiots yeah yeah so if you're gonna repack you're opening yourself up to that if you're gonna get your opinion swayed by people who just want to just want to see if they can affect you you just want to see if they can fuck with you touch you just see things change get you to change the way you're dressing and it's what I'm like that's why I don't like so I tell all of my artists and all my friends don't change don't read it because what happens is everybody starts coloring inside the lines and now nobody's dangerous anymore right cuz you remember back in the day on Madonna dangerous right gotta come out naked you know just dance into the Grammys like it's all good so what I hope will what I always say just don't tuck your art in dartium for the for the comments because we'll end up not having anything not having anything to celebrate that is that is good like having something so but somebody did a song that was dope or a movie that was doable got outside the box as opposed to what we love celebrating which is the crazy shit yeah well especially for comics yeah that's because it's one per if you do a crazy movie there's a lot of people involved yeah if you're on stage you say something fucked up it's just you yeah well I got I'm going back out so it's about to happen I'm gonna be passing out a whole bunch of gift baskets I'm going back out and I you know like how much time did you take off I've never actually taken off cuz I still do gigs like I got a gig tomorrow st. Louis you know private gig whatever but but it's just you know like I know like as a comedian you got to live like I just can't jump out there and just start talking or writing jokes like I've lived through some crazy shit so I got to go out there and talk about that you know had I not cuz the one thing I hate is the one thing that's tough for comedian is to become successful because we talk from a shit is fucked up point of view and I gotta have a little anger and I gotta have a little poke fun and if I become that what if I become what I poked fun at then I can't get it off that's why at my house people come to my house my daughter's ask me that's dead why is this room not there's nothing in it I said I don't want to complete the house because it gives me a sense of like I'm still trying to get on like I don't everyone I don't put like all the pictures nothing is like perfect in my crib there's a curtain right now that's torn open in my bedroom I just got to leave it like that I keep my house a little so that we call it the dysfunctional mansion I'll talk about that the dysfunctional mansion where there's always somebody like like the other night there's Odell Beckham in my house battle dancing Chris Brown I just just crazy shit happening at my house all the time so I could I have something to link my you know hitch my comedic wagon to so you you create chaos on purpose in a little bit of I just leave it slight disarray I I don't I don't remove myself from it I don't remove I don't get behind the gates behind the gazes of worship behind the gates behind the gates when you get behind the gates when you reach a certain point in your behind the gates you can't really see what I'm out I gotta be out with the people I gotta have people like I had a Abbey Tea Party right 3,000 people at my house counted Jesus people at the gate you know trying to get in is and as I look through the party there's Floyd Mayweather all-time yeah you know such a box I love you know got the fight coming so there's Florida's Fat Joe this little Kim is on stage performing and then I look around and I see some of the home he's like the real guys that was sufficed I just a nice party right here cuz I love it oh shit so it's all of these mixtures of people that I can still touch hang out with people from my from my community her name is unka she's like the unofficial mayor in our city's a little white lady from Germany and she's on the dance floor dance with snow it's crazy so I sort of keep it that way so I can stay loose so when I go out I got I got shit that I could talk about from the hood to the way so you're still you still managed to stay a regular person got to but how that that's a hard thing for someone who's achieved as much success as you have that is not a easy balancing act to stay normal because you must get overwhelmed by requests and people just wanting your time and wanted a hitch hitch themselves to you and but you got a look I think what helps me is the failures like doing a couple of movies that don't you know going through TSA they don't speak to you your movie is out come on through so or you just get the TSA goddamn Fox what you're doing baby what was that shit did last year dog I had to watch that shit on fire stick money so it's like you appreciate those right uh which keeps you regular keeps you humble and and you just gotta sort of look at other people and see how people in our business when they do get behind the gates you know you think comics that get that thousand mile stare and yeah don't worry I don't be funny no more yeah funny that's how you came up I want to be sexy now you know they they all fall into the sexy I want to say funny and keep the teeth goofy keep my head looking goofy hair like whatever it is because that's what I draw up on when I go out because people can sense it don't you think oh yeah yeah I think stand-up is kind of in some ways it's a like a mind-meld or a massive gnosis like you're connecting with the audience and if there's anything false about what you're thinking or what you're saying some of them at least can feel it yeah sometimes all of them but some of them can feel it and it'll fuck with the energy of the room but if you're in the groove you're really being yourself that's why when you see Dave on stage one of the things about Japan is that he's always himself yeah he can just be himself and so you relaxed as an audience member and slide right into his mind and he takes you on a journey cuz he's himself he's not he's not he's not disconnected by Fame and celebrity and that way he was genius how he passed up all that money just went to Africa yeah and just settled in and then came back and didn't do any scheduled gigs for years he would show up with a speaker and set up a speaker in a park in like Seattle and just gather a crowd around and start doing stand-up him see but that's what I'm saying it's like how do you find that he figured it out he did it well I agree with that because like I said if you success can sometimes be our our coffin especially when you're like I said when you when your comic even all the way down to the way I handle like like like social medias interesting like I mean you know and me just sort of brand-new on it and what people view like I was uh and this is sort of something but I was uh just talking about how people view you I went to the gas station and I put on these shades and then I took a picture unless I was cool I was I needed some just pick up some you know $14 shit whatever now put it on I took a picture with him and my Instagram blew up like oh shit what's this I read the comments like man we get to change that middle Ferragamo Gucci's what autos down ain't let me get any fire I was like wow he's just gas station chase but everybody thought they was you know something else and I was like now I want that I don't want them to think that I don't want them to think that I spent $2,000 on some shit cuz that's we always lose I fuckin shades anyway right so I actually hit my boy Dave oh and Dave Schottenstein I said listen I want to do i glass like what do you wanna do you wanna I want to do an eyeglass that cost less than $30 I said but what we're gonna do is we're gonna go through each frame and make sure each frame is tight like the dope like amazing cuz I told them the story about being at the gas station and they were like wow I think that's a good idea so we ended up doing this whole line I went through all 200 frames and we did this lines it's called a Prive revo right and everybody thought that it was something else 30 bucks $30 shades and now even JLo bella thorne and all these other people are wearing the shades because what we noticed when we did do that people embrace it a little more because we did a commercial that was that we almost made a mistake where we get clothes on and we tell people how much the clothes cost and people got turned off because the jeans were like $400 a jacket was 2,000 like what the fuck and we only know what we were trying to say was although these clothes cost this our glasses only cost 30 bucks so that story in itself I take that and run with that and say like I'm not the guy buying the high-end you know right stuff I want to keep it sort of cool regular you know saying yeah does that make sense it does yeah I know really rich dude who drives a pickup truck he's rich as fuck and he just likes to drive around in a shitty old Toyota pickup truck he likes it and when I do that cuz he wants to steal normal feel normal grimy you want to feel normal it doesn't wash its hands sometimes get dirt under his fingernails pretends he's a farmer and goodbye the whole fucking world but we had to balance both because I because because you know you know being me you know being urban I got a step out there and shine sometimes too I'm a boy has you know you know we we get out there we show a little bit of the success you know I'm saying just to let people know we still doing that thing I love the expression being urban when we hear was that like I'm black I'll tell you all time I'm an ni CCH nikka if I lose if I lose being that if I lose being that than I I gotta have that oh yeah yeah no I got it you gotta have everything yeah why not it's fun too right yeah it's fun too but I gotta I gotta have that part I gotta have always had that sort of like a ceilidh can't leave where I came from right that's that's what they try to snatch from me that's why we did we did the television show Chris Spencer and a buddy Lewis wrote this wrote this incredible script called white famous and white famous was about a comedian who's you know trying to become mainstream without losing is you know his black audience which is all these all of us we go through that right you know because the minute you started doing the you know the sort of soft movies and you know I think the problem with shining is when it defines you yeah the problem when when you just everything is flat like Floyd Mayweather in a way it's part of his persona it's part of why people root against him like Boyd is a genius yeah my opinion not just a genius boxing he's the greatest defensive boxer my opinion of all time but also a genius in that if you figured out a way where he has this style that's not appealing to a lot yeah but what is appealing is people want to see him get his ass yeah yeah and it never fucking house listen and you know Floyd's the homie Floyd comes by the house man and I don't want to put everything out there that he does he's super super competitive that's what's amazing but he also understands that yeah Jay Fox I understand what's going on you know all time they they want me to follow fox but that's what keeping competitive you know all time easy work like work please so he was sit at my crib and speak for like hours about the business of trying to turn these boxers minds on like yo get your money you know I'm saying don't you know get your money get your business get off and then he talks about what you said he says I know the reason that I fight Oscar De La Hoya on Cinco de Mayo is because they want to see the vo he he carved out a niche of being the the the the charismatic villain does that make sense yeah and he wasn't in the beginning he wasn't in what again he was pretty boy floyd mayweather and then he became money Mayweather yeah but how do you stay pretty boy what the fuck don't know I mean he might have been like Sugar Shane Mosley or something you know but not really cuz Shane had lost to a few guys like what Floyd did better than anybody is not get hit yeah yeah he's been hit like six times right right really hard like never is him and Zab Judah yeah Zab Judah but his defining fight was the Morales fight when he fought Morales god bless was amazing and he also said that that hit the Sugar Shane hit him with he'll tell you said I hid when Sugar Shane touched him he said that really she said shook nice about Jeff Fox about killing Jeff Fox I gotta kill me he says that's why I dug in you see the end of it you see the end of the round and the end around he did turn it but he's he got rocked in that fight that was one of the few moments where he really got caught cleaned by a world-class fighter yeah got caught clean twice so it'll be interesting his next fight coming up well Conor is not that level of boxer you know someone I forget who it was it said it I think it might have been his day lawyer yeah but but if someone was saying that he's got to I was Pat Miletich saying that he has to almost cheat within the rules I think he's got to like fight in the clinch she's got to like dirty boxing he's gotta be I got a whole figure out a way to tie him up and manipulate him and move his body around he's got to figure out a way to be good defensively too and he's got to hurt him those are all like high high-risk high-risk low-yield possibilities what if it sees fight the way I described it if you how would you expect the greatest figure skater in the world to do playing hockey against Wayne Gretzky hi it's not the same thing great freak show ever this freak show ever I'm waiting for that fight more than Canelo Alvarez versus Gennady golovkin even though that fight is a legitimate looking fight because there's gonna be some crazy shit some crazy shit these go be so crazy well also there's the mindfuck factor he's the Connors the only guy that Floyd's ever fought that can look at him and go if this was a real fight you'd be fucking dead oh no everybody else boy's been able to fuck up he fucks up all of them yeah you know like do you ever see that video with him and Robert Guerrero right before they fought they they had this this thing where they were doing photo shoots and they do a stare who's this who's is robert the ghost guerrero is a fighter that floyd fought maybe four or five fighters ago right and he just worked him 10 12 rounds shit up but he's standing right in front of me you ain't gonna do shit he's like you're easy work you're easy work he goes he goes I'm just and goes no one has to get involved you're not gonna do shit because we'll get right close to each other you're not gonna do shit you're easy work and you could see the dude was just there oh no like he knew yeah he knew the Floyd was right very well what Connor looks at him and goes if this is a real fight I'd fucking kill you I'll do your boxing thing it's a real fight I'll kill you yeah oh yeah he's right he's right yeah before he could say oh the same we'll do some MMA he said it a couple times next fight will do MMA he's not doing it look for one thing for it is he's smart yeah so he look he's got him on his his is his playing field so it's almost like you start to like I know but people start to go like his Floyd nervous I said I don't know but I tell you it is he's definitely allowing this guy to play through yeah and that fight is becoming bigger Oh bigger oh yeah bigger and bigger so it's like it's gonna be he's gonna be great and the one thing floor would always tell me though he said Jay Fox he said one thing they not ready for is the lights that's what you mean he said the lights when the lights are that bright and you look out and you see all you see Denzel you see all these that's a different that's a different thing because if you took I don't know if it was Hatton I think what's on my hat is in the lights man he said that's one thing I've been fighting Jeff I have been fighting under the licence always like this yeah so it'll be interesting yeah it is gonna be interesting crazy but Connor fights under the lights too we just never boxed anybody like that that's gonna be a totally alien thing when he gets into that ring he's got shoes on and he fills those big-ass gloves on his hands and he looks on the other side he sees Floyd just moving around yeah he's got there's gonna be a something in there it's gonna be everything fucking everything cuz you think about it both I mean they got it they got us I'm going I'm going early press conferences were amazing yeah I'm already booked I was booked in DC that night in advance I so already sold out to nut two shows that night I couldn't I couldn't cancel and you can't cook no I can't come I'm not gonna be there I'm not gonna work it either they wanted me to do something for it can't even do it that's gonna be I gotta figure out a way to not see it until I know what happened there's no way watch it you know I'm gonna have to figure out a way I hope the audience would be nice and not telling me there's probably gonna be people watching it on their phone while the show is going on no no like I guarantee you like if someone gets nah yeah what happens great yeah great man it's gonna be interesting listen it's amazing yeah I don't know that's what we starting where do we go from here we just keep moving keep moving you you obviously enjoying yourself you're hi I'm having I'm having a good time for a super successful guy you seem completely balanced today happy there there are there are things that you just cannot get away from that you you know you hide right behind but and for the most part I did some smart stuff moving off my whole family lives with me so I had to worry about you know my father my mom lived with me oh that's great yeah and I was adopted seven months so me and my mom near my biological mom you know are crafting our relationship now in in the latter stages of her life so you know that's you know but I didn't want but I didn't want no bullshit outside of that you know where someone is is is sitting somewhere watching me from a distance like you know that you know some mom comes in day and they've been divorced for almost 30 years was crazy why they live in the same saying under the same roof is hilarious there's a whole nother show Wow and he still dates you know say he's still getting it in over there and then she'll float over to his side of the house be like see the girl hey how are you who's this Wow getting some I just want to get something to refrigerate it some spoiled stuff that's kind of intense and then you hear that on my door I miss my papa could you tell her not to come on myself yeah I'm like my parents you know so but it's certain things that I but you got to figure out your happiness and the only way you figure out your happiness you got to try to see or foresee what's gonna be the problem so I get my family close to me so whatever problem we got to work out we work that shit out right here get my mom and my my and my sisters and my daughters close to me so they see daddy going to work like this still some work shit it's like nah we just not on the red car it's not just red carpet every day you know I got to get up I got to go you know I got a talk shit I got a kiss little ass here I got a I got to do a whole lot of shit in order to keep this thing going so you try to you know in life you try to see what try to foresee what's gonna happen it's still gonna be something it's just always gonna be something and just outlandish but uh you try to get a get in front of it that's an interesting way to handle it though to bring everybody close to you bring your whole family in your house yeah and not everybody can do that you know because you know it's like you know me growing up as an only child I like having people around I can't be by myself that's why I always would throw parties okay I would kidnap people because I just wanted people right now having my family around you you got to do but not like I said not everybody can do it because it you know it is interesting like my father who has a great story my stepfather has a great story you know he was on drugs or I had a situation about with drug bout with crack I ended up going to jail I wrote him one letter I said you get out you know I saved you life cuz I didn't like writing letters to people and like going visiting people in jail he gets out this is around just before 9/11 and then my stepfather was incredible in my life because he taught me how to play tennis so back in the 70s and then in the 80s he was like playing tennis I'm like wow I never seen a black dude play tennis he says you gotta learn sunny so people like Yannick Noah in Le nastasi beyond Borg Vitas Gerulaitis those are like heroes of mine so he taught me how to play play tennis so when he gets out he gets out of jail and make sure everything is cool I take him to the US Open and so there he is me my pops watching Venus play he's crying yeah this you know this is what this is how we got to live this is what this is what we need to do so he watches Venus play in a couple days after that it was 911 but you know he stayed with me then we mean since then you know early on I would just go by check the drawers make sure there's no paraphernalia you know wrong shit smokey we cool right look at don't do me no more than that and we've been cool since then you know and it saved a lot of money and we had young Saiyans I'm just right there hands-on but sometimes he was just being surrounded by loved ones is enough to keep them from doing anything stupid yeah it can and it was but it was bumpy at first weren't going to it because he wrote a little book and talked about it it was bumpy at first because when he first got out I did some shit for him got him this kind of got him car whatever he relapsed his car gone he's back in you know so it was a couple little things that we had to work out but now no to see him now like you know you know like you know we go to these different events or whatever like that his whole wall he old school he own him do this the you know this he got the actual photos you go go develop the film I got me a little film Dabangg so he put the film in to develop the film see and they put the film he got a whole wall and everybody these met you know all of his heroes and so like I said you know I try to try to look try to be ahead of the curve when it comes to the fucked up what about like what your creative time when you have so many people living with you and did you get do you ever feel like boxed in no that's you know like I know the best way to create is to have people's around because I could try that joke out on them and they don't know I'm doing that joke you know try this idea see how they respond cuz your family gonna give you the real don't get mad terrible yeah you made the answer you always got it to me having people around to tell you the truth you know like everybody my family you know they tell me is true for Vasu mmm that's sleepless I should have just stayed sleep oh really yeah so it's like you know having that allows me to create and then I have my own little space where I go okay let me get this now let me they responded to that and now let me put this together over here in a little space so you have like a little sanctuary I got a little I got a studio that's then I set up where I go in there and do all that shit you know but it helps well this is a man I know you got to get the fuck out of here you only here for an hour right yeah but it's been great dude listen you are you're an amazing person and I'm very I'm very honored to have you on here because you're one of the very few people that I know that has this well-rounded life but also is very balanced like you've had amazing success and all these different things but you're as normal and approachable as anybody I know when I come to you you know I got to be Y you because you are a speaker of truth and we've seen each other awhile but the one thing about your opinion is always going to be truthful so you know as us coming from a different time there are certain people that we want to have the real truth come from you rock Chapelle all these guys so we came up so when we're doing our art or when we're doing whatever we do yes always gonna be those people that you know rock with you but you want to get the people who have a really artistic real opinion does that make sense yeah no I know and if you hear them say you are kind of fuck with that okay if jr. says that's cool then I know and that's why you said it cuz that motherfucker tell you he'll tell you - that shit's back you know saying and then you hope your ass you know saying so you got to be you know you got to be on point with this because I know when I run into those guys like you you want to have that favor does that make sense I know exact what you're saying you got yourself to stay you got people in your mind right now then when you're doing your thing that you know if everybody's yelling like oh we love you but if that person say maybe there's so maybe that you go okay yeah you're saying people are gonna be a percent real yeah yeah so yeah there you go you're a bad motherfucker Jamie Foxx thank you brother you are - all right all right they told me to say Prive groove oh yes I'm calm preview you lose your clothes you never lose your glasses man and it's all I'm a 29.95 and there you go there you go ladies and gentlemen he's [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
