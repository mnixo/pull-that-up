Bravo is doing the jujitsu seminar today in I think in Whittier and Bryan Callen is in Utah pretending to play golf with his dad yeah he plays golf and he acts like he enjoys it just entertaining papa does he really yeah that's right I think he kind of likes it but you know he can't go just hanging out with his dad you go do things like that you do man yeah I mean chicks pretend to be in the football steak and hang out with you it's true someone actually get into this some I'm just being offensive so Bryan Barbarina and who's the other gentlemen something Edward Edward what's his uh do we have a fight card Jamie who put that shit up in the other screen and this UFC Rotterdam's reminds me of UFC 100 this thing is epic how dare you show up late Joe Rogan it's least that rest in shape yeah it's it's about as good a shape as you can get clipped Bryan barbering is the dude who choked out sage Northcutt a very tough fighter Leon Edwards that's right Leone God there's not a lot of Leon's left in the world is that's right man lastly you met dude that was a big name in the seventies right no guy always got the back one hook Bryan Barbarino is very good on she ground [Music] interesting do you see the fireman see that fire last night no where was it cuz I woke up my my my slingshot was all covered in ash is that crazy yeah it's out near Burbank is it really yeah it's already the biggest fire in the history of California what of Los Angeles rather yeah because it's in Los Angeles County it's the biggest fire ever in Los Angeles County I think it's burned something like 5,000 acres already and are people evacuating their homes and children they were in danger this night they evacuated in Burbank not all at Burbank but a good chunk yeah yeah damn I've seen any of the necessary coming home looking up the highway when you see the hills on fire really oh yeah and that's scary oh yeah it's kind of close to you no no it's not close to me but I can see it from some poster closer it's close to Brian Redman he lives out there look at that fast moving wildly she homes evacuated in LA and Burbank you know I talked to a fireman once man he fucking freaked me out he goes it's just a matter of time until one day it burns all the way the water when I went what and he goes yep just a matter of time one day Oh Brian barber even like fucked her oh no you better stay on that opposite hand yeah oh just kidding get his chin broke yeah that opposite hands that firefighter sounds like a no no he said there it goes with the right combination of dry weather and the right wind and he goes once it hits the buildings we won't be able to stop it you see those little burn all the way to the water now he was an older dude that was like super stoic that's why it made me shit my pants really yeah it wasn't like some dwarf man have you ever seen of the new papers on - oh shit dude he's under the chin yeah he's in trouble now Oh sideways sideways he's okay leon's definitely doing work yeah Leon almost had that if he maintained back control there I give he had like some Marcel Garcia style hooks goddamn he might have got that back that firefighter Hayden on our mysterious fuck he was all he was saying was he goes there's only so much we can do when a fire it gets out of control with strong wind and dry ground you know like this was right after I don't know if you around California in 2002 I think somewhere around there 2000 2003 we I got evacuated and we were coming home from fear factor were filming out in like North up on the five and as I was coming home for a whole hour on the right hand side the car the hills run fire the whole hour in the car driving position curse lien other you're like your old house like out there ya know but nothing I'm saying on the way home from like Tejon you know like Tejon ranch oh yeah yeah the whole right side of the highway was on fire for an hour that's how much was on fire I'm talking like 50 miles of shit on fire I got never seen anything like in my life and when I was taught I mean it was like Lord of the Rings type shit was crazy scary thought all the hills were on fire I mean everywhere the right-hand side and everybody goes like snowfall with ash saw dead guy so I dude got hit by a car was trying to run across the road yeah there's a fire shit out with his sneaker off I was like oh no you would know he wasn't close enough to the fire he was just on the highway but I think you know people panic both the driver in the fire can you imagine there be a worse way to go burned alive like I was watching Game of Thrones I'm on season 5 now when they burn homeboy don't say anything spoiler but it's been out way too long come on it's the best show ever forever gets better season 7 the way

yeah I'm just sure took his back and just smashed him how about he's doing better yeah he seems get sushi and shit yeah well he's rolling he's obviously rolling with his friend hey like he was in his guard working I asked Pat Milotic about it because that you know I didn't know and asked him he was just saying how you know trains in Iowa they're like so far away and if you wait for him you're gonna be there forever so that was like fuck this and floored his truck but their gravel it didn't go like you thought it was gonna take off I got hit by the train oh my god I know that is so crazy but doing better now yeah well probably because he's such a gorilla you know I'm sure that such a phenomenal shape if you look like this laughs you'd be dead yeah over he'd be over yeah shave me just a tough son of a bitch how much you have to know to be a ref Todd I don't feel like well if there's a sea there's there's levels to this game there's Big John there's 14 right and then it falls off like a motherfucker it's kind of like the light heavyweight division there's like two badasses than the rest well there's other really good ones you know who's a really good one oh shit damn so this is a interesting fight right because Leon had his back twice two rounds in a row Leon came close to choking him but didn't finish him Leon definitely won the fight but there was that one try and almost put him away it's not ten eight though is that I don't know man what are these new rules when are we gonna use them Universal and you're in Rotterdam hey we got two super important things to talk about one this is John Jones think people keep saying that John Jones because of this drug test he did a blood test and he did tested negative the blood test I can tell you he passed the blood test he'll do urine test here's the thing that the blood test doesn't test for that stuff correct I'm getting it straight from Nowitzki oh you talked to her you totally gonna flood test because they can talk about it because John has gone public with correct the blood test does not test for this t-ball stuff whatever the furball but the urine test does correct so they have to urine samples and then the results of the urine sample be will be out soon and then we'll know did you hear Chael Sonnen he said with toronto ball it's so old-school like if you're gonna do that you basically whoever's giving it to them has their black belt in peds so if you test positive for a Toronto ball you're probably stat they missed the good stuff cuz you're stacking out with a bunch of other shit slightly just can take some old school training ball and not taking anything else this is so crazy how weird is it so crazy because I know I did not if if this is true I did not think that he was a cheater but I thought that he was a guy who was fucking off and partying and got busted with some Freak shit that's in some dick pills because they tested those hand ability I never bought that narrative here's two options right there were two options when it comes to those dick pills those dick pills did have these steroids in them but do you know that why are you taking them because if you just take them and you're getting steroids too you're getting steroids and your dick it's not enough where it's gonna be a performance ain't like it's such a small micro dose of testosterone what the fuck is in those things I think it's a clomiphene right yeah whatever it is but I just I think John has some smart people around him they painted that narrative like oh yeah he's a partier was taking dick pills that makes sense why you would test pause for this stuff when I feel like the recipe wanna know were like not really well like this monster be taken I give you dick people down if dick people down in my day before to never happen if I can turn towards dick pills you know I'm like I like to party as much as the next set not John Joe there's levels to this party game got John Jones style well yeah obviously at kokanee system - he does like to party for really get that and then that's what you know Brian Redman called it because people that do coke that dick doesn't work that good so then they stack it well with with vitamins dicks like really and he was telling me about because Brian loves those goddamn gas station dick pills but he's like they're totally inconsistent he's like you'll get one you get these raging hard-on you get another one you feel like a homicidal maniac like you you get crazy aggressive I don't want them in my life no I'm saying but I see I just I never bought that narrator with John I didn't well now we know you know the the urine test from a is positive because that's what tested for that substance in the urine the blood test is irrelevant they were attention C button and then people that don't get that you see oh but he passed the blood test right you guys full of shit like no no the urine is the big one here I saw that zone doctor was posting that on doctor Hightower I guess this is chiropractor doesn't count yeah he was posting on Instagram free John Jones and I was like well this is not like smartest Iraq they're talking about the wrong substance the wrong test rather think like God we need goddamnit is it the fuckin do with the weed finally turning down you know that's it yeah my car was covered in ash this morning yeah yeah it's out there bro it's scary yeah but with John you gotta listen to what Jill had a good narrative on I think I don't marry our with Arowana he's just saying that's such an old-school drug like to be associated with that just pause for that and he's I got you know he said the same thing because I know a few things about P DS for God's sake he does yeah so he was saying that old-school drug they're missing the good shit like he got away with a lot of other stuff if you if that's in your system you just don't you know I'm saying it's like if you want a car you're not gonna just get a fucking 64 Ferrari Daytona you got a start we're at some other shit self a Civic yeah exactly oh yeah with one bad tire yeah the gamers levels to this for god sakes what do you think happen I think you just got caught yeah well I and I'm sure you could talk to the Nowitzki when I say going snitch that's a complimentary turn I don't dislike the guy think he's cleaning up the sport anyways yes he's clean up there 20 beers back there I would like a beer what my like old one too man the world's burning down studio we gotta make sure we have fuckin biryanis get some kegs going that's what I'm talkin about get a couple there was a funny picture that somebody put on Instagram a meme of two giraffes going at it and they're like this is true there are huge man they're fucking huge is this the first time I was just a fight pass contender series I hear this was very good fun yeah people dig it powerful cat Zingano powerful cat thing gone for sure fight again I think she was saying that she was having some like some issues yeah she's talking about right now it's time out what's going on right now I don't know Jamie in the other room beating this beer god damn it Jay she probably talking about it what is she talking to me she want to fight this up yeah well I'm not mad that Jamie table thank you crazy stuff so we can hear what she's talking cat Zingano photography oh it's her photographer take a documentary well I'll watch it oh GSP Craig this he's big right now I saw him in uh in Vegas thicker than a Snickers yeah he doesn't be thick but he's got muscle thickness right he doesn't he doesn't want to be light if he's gonna fight Michael motherfucking visiting I'm excited to see how the fight goes down I don't think as big as the draws everyone thinks though no I think you're correct I think a lot of people have past always zipping up his lip like he's not saying anything well maybe you should start talking too cuz I say make my both unions start talking chairs the Octagon goes back to Madison Square Garden yes if I did commentary what I said I'm only doing anything in sacks half from now on I'm wearing a bowtie - if you were bowtie I feel like people do involve just fuck this thing it's adorable no I don't know thanks man thanks bro thanks bro I'm thinking it turn it pink just a pink bow tie just all pink that cards stacked though it's a great card was on the car uh you got TJ Dillashaw hoodie garb ramp which is the best fine on that card that's good fine great fight you got and this might I don't know if this confirmed or not you might know Jamie you might know you probably do a fucking promo for it Maz Badal versa wonderboy yes it is confirmed yeah that's a motherfucking fight yeah I haven't done that promo for that yeah yeah there's some good fights in there look at that Johny Hendricks Bora chena Johnny Henry still fighting sliding back man yeah is that for us - hobbies brother oh it is yes damn that's right yeah good for him he's supposed to be badass seven no he better be if your brothers for us yeah I mean you better know some shit yeah you should know some shit dropping the ball man it looks like Thompson and Montreal cuz I was the first fight in the main card nice TJ Dillashaw and Cody garb rents a big fight man this is this is why this card so good so Bisbing st. Pierre it's a good fight it's not gonna knock your hair back but it's a fun fight we don't know who's gonna win that gar Brant Tillis all goddamn that's a tough one to pick and then his hope car brand saw back is 100% I'm sure I did it sound like it is you know I'm saying something and just hate I hate to see someone with a back injury rush it back because we kind of taking this time though yeah he's a smart kid he's around good people and he's been my suppose it been it's been a minute remember there's was fight a while ago and he even pushed you back even longer than people like talking shit to him but I think it's very smart and circulated definitely he's smart dude he has potential be a superstar fuck um and that's what's really interesting fine fighting the Dominick Cruz colleague our Brandt was just December 30th okay 2016 so that's interesting man so that's a long time while ago they get enough and he wouldn't Russia back fish being champ you really don't have to rush back so you got TJ so it's eight nose after that fight and Wednesdays back get hurt did it get hurt in training yeah cuz remember they're supposed to fight in that on that Vegas card right the July card I just hope he's done everything I know he was doing someone that Regina keen stuff yes since what a Germany did this yeah anyone over there and got that treatment he's a smart kid and he's young to that same thing on his side and he doesn't have a lot of miles on them right I bet he's gonna be alright and then TJ has the you know teachers doing a lot of his camp out here and he's making things up it's got such a good fight it's a good fight man and that gives plant and TJ's never slacked off from the time they were first supposed to be Skinner such a workhorse he's just in super shape and he's like getting better Qasim know what the hots are on that fight see me close it's such a good fight I think the big factor one of the big factors is Cody's hands his power power and speed lightning lightning and fast - but then there Cody's fast with crazy power yeah but I feel like TJ see Cody's takedown defense is really goodness powers really good knees fast as fuck but then TJ mixes that up so well and his footwork but think Cody's footwork against Dominick Cruz was ridiculous mantastic it's a really good fighting good I think TJ's gonna be better than he was against Dominick Cruz - you know I think - Dominick Cruz fight he was super emotional and he got real flat-footed and there was times in the fight where he was like loading up looking for a big shot yep trying to finish your mom can't do that - Dominick he's just not gonna be there see here's the thing Cody garment for stomach Cruz is cut is Cody that damn good where he just outclassed on a cruise or did Donna Cruz I mean off night or do they just didn't that match up right you know I'm saying I think Dominick is you know fantastic fighter but he's had some foot issues - you know Dominic's got that many fasciitis yep yeah well massive surgeries right he said both knees operated on more than once he's had a torn groin muscle that fucked him up he said something serious for a minute he also works for UFC yeah non-stop yep and now that Brian Stann retired I assume that he's gonna work more non-stop so you know what's coating TJ doing while you're working for the UFC I don't think you can do both and be as successful as you want to be right not to be I think stomachs so damn good and he's kind of you know he's so good where he can pull it off and still you know beat anyone in the world but to be like legend status see I don't think John well that's about example I don't think Connor could do could work for UFC tonight work with you on you see paper using be Conor McGregor and that make sense it doesn't make sense you know I think the big factor in that fight was the speed and the combinations of Cody there's landed more often they were just better you know like he was connecting on Dominic at Dominic was throwing things just a little wider and then Cody was just getting in with those shots like multiple times clipped him with also Cody my Lancer like god damn at 35 it's like a little Mike Tyson cracked and he's obsessed with being the best you know yeah very interesting fight he also speaks well all he cares about is fighting here's a him and Kevin Lee have the most potential you'd like your next breakdown superstars now I agree the thing about TJ those TJ has more weapons like TJ does more stuff like Cody although he does kick and does throw knees and does throw elbows he's so good at boxing do you see him like predominantly up like a boxing oriented stock gym wrestle tutor he's a phenomenal read in high school TJ though was like he'll mix it up more with kicks yeah TJ yeah exactly he's like he's more of a Swiss Army knife yes fucking Cody garments like that god damn machete if that thing lands yeah game over it's all he has ridiculous footwork good way to put it letting he's like a Swiss Army a lot of tools everything yeah it's like you know Dominick Cruz set the blueprint and then T J Dilla all downloaded brought to next level and Cody Garvin even download that right but man you say he brought to the next level of Dominic beat him it's true did he beat him though no I think is a draw me too I think is as close to a draw he yeah I just I don't understand those fights when who the fuck knows and you decide one guy's the champ and one guy's a loser you gotta pick someone though I know but it seems crazy it seems like in a fight like that that seems like a draw to me it really does what's up with some overtime for god sakes it's wrong it just I mean if anybody was gonna get it I get given the nod to Cruz cuz he he he definitely seemed to get coated fight his fight more and he connected with some good shots but Jesus it was so close you mean TJ yeah what did I say Cody Cody yeah yeah so goddamn close if anything can do it draw then just make him fight the next fight so there's a clear winner Dominic landed more like clean shots on TJ but TJ landed a lot of shit on him too and hit with a lot of leg kicks too had him limping do you know I got so like you said yet so emotional and for Wilder which is where I thought Dominic started to win rounds and I have to go back and watch that again me too but for them remember I watch it twice maybe three times for that it was such a guide to him close fight I remember being surprised - TJ didn't try to finish him with leg kicks because Dominic was wobbling so bad with my surgery - you know I felt fair in love and war go out and kick those knees go slam that plantar fasciitis yeah he was saying after the fight that that's what it was there was his feet his feet are just fucked up that'll because career well you know what it is it's because he came back after a long time off cuz the surgeries and once he got in shape he had to make up some lost time he went nothing went nuts and he tore the bunny just feet I hear that that shit apparently he's like have you ever had it no dude bro I had it for my camp against Mitrione cuz I again I've run I love to run I was doing so much roadwork I could in the mornings was the worst time I'd get up and you know take me 15 minutes just to kind of make my way to the toilet like my foot yeah it hurt so goddamn bad that wouldn't be a good thing for me today today I don't have 15 minutes today I've got I got you know the shits that you get like you got about 30 seconds notice yeah it's gonna feel like the proble time anymore the fucking problem sure yeah yeah if you have to wait 52 leglock she's a little high oh hi you can't do that honey you gotta get a scoot down I'm so condescending I call her honey help see what's wrong with that though it's rude is it honey if I was her really upset at me oh not me I'd find it flatter lock that triangle up baby don't lock it up girl sweetie lock it up like come on sweetie get that triangle sweetie bear yeah hook the leg leg hook the leg hook the leg oh we're doing work now you got the armbar yeah she's gonna crank on that girl dude she's got both here oh she's got that arm yes I'm saying that that foots in play those know what those feet are in play those we got that you know supposed to hook that leg supposed to control the position better hooking that legs giant man you know major people do it two ways when you control someone from a triangle do you hook the leg like this do you scoop it around on the outside or do you go underneath it depends right where you're at exactly I go underneath underneath seems like the move right because you can elevate their laughs yeah yeah some people don't like that though some people like to just hold on to the leg they like to rap I mean you know what man whatever the fuck you can do yeah exactly especially when punches are flying and you're not a key the battle fine whatever it takes to get that goddamn leg it's funny like so many people have so many opinions on unlike hand positions and chokes and stuff fell flooding games together bullets flying you know I want to learn from that that if you ever learned that go go choke that um talking about the broth will choke yeah do you know that choke not like Rothwell does yeah his instructor James c25 been Rothwell's jujitsu instructor once he finds he's white Hickson's guys he's a black problem Hicks and apparently this choke that this guy's got it's just phenomenal what's up with Rothwell do you piss hotter so he piss too hot I think pretty sure I feel like you did yeah did any news on JDS no he pissed hot for a diuretic this is like I mean what do we got tell your boy the constants just relax a little bit nope he's not can't do it Luiz cláudio there he goes Luiz cláudio apparently is a master that yeah no shit Lee showed the big man choking bitches out he showed a lot of people that choking they're like what the fuck nasty huh yeah I guess it's just somehow another the way he's holding it he's going into your neck into your throat as he's choking you with it it's just you know it's like people just develop the finest like application of one technique like they just get it down whether that's their shit didn't Roth will tap out Barnett with that yes that's how you know that shit Barnett's as legit as it gets grandpa way yeah you surprise him with that shit insane and you see when he got him like Josh Wilson he was like what fucked yeah just like god damn what are you doing it was nasty like he wasn't getting out of that and a lot of ways those kind of like old-school chokes like that's a lot of shit Josh Barnett sin - right hell yeah that's tough break your neck off I like Josh yeah how about I had a Goldberg um on firing the kid you know go break the wrestler and he was he's real he's like best friends with Brock I said do you think Brock's gonna come back and he goes he was going to until John piss hot oh my did you breaking my heart Goldberg oh my god oh my god right don't let that fuck up your sanity you thought the fires coming in fuck you said it had a fuck your Saturday up I can't

test is Nash tickle and snitch about it bro you got a direct line to him who I will he's gonna come on the podcast again after John we get the thing about John well I mean if it times out that way if not we'll do it before but I'm gonna have monsoon yeah kind of delay it though to that so we get the real fucking him for you know I'm saying yeah probably good idea it's so depressing to me because it felt like John returning the way he did like that's like a superstar victory he handled himself class and dignity after it was over I mean everything about it was amazing and then to go from that to piss and hot you're like oh no I was at Universal when I found out Jamie texted me he texted me and I thought you're fucking with me I thought it was I think that's pretty good Potter ride was fun I thought yeah I thought his fake news fuck man super fakeness super depressing you know I was thinking about what they saw with John being out and they got Connor write like Connor Nate things like looming in the air that's like what they got to do next is huge money fights on that there's not a huge money fight but Connor has changed the game for the better supposed to be the fighter but it's like you know with WME he's steering the ship yes like think think about it because he made over it because the numbers coming out they're saying it's gonna be his paper you've all time so he made a hundred million dollars right yeah so you're telling me if you're Kannan you're part of his team you didn't go hey fight Nate Diaz for how much five ten million oh and also we need your where this Reebok and look they're gonna pay you a hundred thousand dollars a year I think college you know you're fucking crazy well I'm sure there's non negotiables and one non-negotiable is the Reebok deal like you can't get around it but what you can disagree well it seems like you can't get around it right now everybody's wearing Reebok clothes well no you you can get this I'm not saying he's not not gonna wear Reebok but what you have to do is you're you're playing a different game now you're talking about the biggest athlete in combat sports and you're not getting him for the two hundred thousand you were paying a year oh yeah that's that's here you go listen I'm down to where Reba yeah but your it's a different animal now yeah well Reebok professionally sponsors him just like they do Paige Vanzant just like they did for more money yeah more but not to know like think how much he made to just wear those you know whatever he had on his trunks right that's a good point you know that fight if it really did get six and a half million pay-per-view buys like they were talking about Connor making a hundred million dollars if it got 5 million pay-per-view buys they got one and a half more than that so you see but that's that's up for debate cuz you know how that came about so I think Dana was sitting on on that soup cast or something and your eye is filming right and dana goes he didn't think he's being record and dana goes six point five mil and everyone's like dad you know in the room like okay I'm talking snoops like girl look and then your eye turns on the end goes six point five million and it shuts the camera off but Dana never officially said six point five but that's all get started so Espinoza from show times like it's gonna break the biggest pay-per-view numbers all-time but we're thinking more around for something Oh like almost five yeah so who knows the truth and who doesn't I don't know I like to go with Dana on this one I was yeah I was crunk I plasticity right now trending towards 4.6 million Oh domestic domestic domestic oh well then it's six point five yeah so yeah this is my thing with Dana he wouldn't just roll that up cuz he doesn't wanna look like an idiot especially what he did officially or not if he says that to you Ryan snoop he don't think he's being recorded but Dana that wasn't just like six point five everybody like she's not making that uh if it's trending towards four point six nationwide in America that's a hundred percent two million more overseas guarantee you that our Costas says that it wasn't a hundred dollars worldwide either those twenty five bucks in some countries $24.99 or yeah in the UK and in Ireland you know that's interesting but still you still the pay-per-view buys it's gonna be around six point five from while I heard it's gonna be six point five seven just do the UK have a history of pay-per-views like we do yeah Joshua's quite the same though that was a pay-per-view for the yeah over there but over here was it's free Frank it was HBO right cuz he's not biggest star right that you know we like trade a little bit yeah yeah makes sense yeah it doesn't make sense I just wonder how many people order paper I mean you know the whole the way they watch TV is different there I don't think they consume as much TV as we do with fighting if Connors fighting or anything Joshua was fighting they do yeah but I mean like overall England I mean it correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think they have as many channels as we do I don't think they watch as much TV as we did is 2017 sir that's not what I'm saying I just don't think that it's a normal part of their day the way it is our day I don't think people in England what like BBC find out I don't think they watch as much yeah I don't think they watch as much TV on a whole as we do they have some great shows no doubt but I don't think they watch as much TV on a whole I think that's more of a like it's probably fair to say a problem with our leads that come out of Shh yeah yeah it's a big problem I watched some TV there last will work out for God's it all president works it works out at all zero yeah watch this five hundreds of TV a day he doesn't believe in that he thinks your body is a battery you think Julie it's so easy to you juice you only have so many beats that's why he looks he's hilarious he's so fat I was definitely not healthy-looking this fights amazing by the way zero yeah but either way I think it's gonna break the pay-per-view number so but Connors changing the dynamics for everyone cuz now when you wanted to fight again you can't have them agree to those old terms he's a smart guy and feeling anything from Floyd you know when you when you fight Floyd you're fighting a different animal look at Bruce Buffer could he look more more bored he looks exactly might have seen too many shows you might have traveled to any airline miles dude looks super tired well it's Rotterdam it's been a long trip probably but easier for the fights man yeah you know yet that just does his 22nd things out and he's recharging some mind set things on it is you gotta be in there you gotta be in there watching there's rumors that he was going to work the whether McGregor fight but then I guess it didn't come to fruition who did it Jimmy Lennon jr. right he's good yeah he's good I thought you know what my won't complain about that whole thing is I thought that could have made the intros way better well turn the lights down let me hear the volume of the music I met Demi Lovato last night right now where'd you meet her lady she's at the Comedy Store god dammit the one night I'm not there damn she's very nice is she nice yes very nice um my point is she's sang the national anthem you never get the national anthem in an MMA fight why do they always do the national anthem at a boxing fight because boxing awesome and they appreciate America I think UFC is just too many goddamn countries fighting every night they can't we demo you're on the feet baby not too easy honey too loose she might be able to pull this off dude and it doesn't look good here yeah pop that head out you got to grab that foot from the outside just reach around oh no she's lost it god sakes it's all over it's all over you couldn't pass go yeah it's gone she can still lock this up she's got to get used to there you go he went right back into it yeah but she's just missing that one crucial step of passing the ankle and getting down locking down on the shin bone you know force that step but that's like your life depending on it like if you were drowning like that to be able to get your foot like this is so big that to not be able to get here this should be your whole life's goal is to get ahead of that foot and get on that shin that girl on top lives to be in a triangle let's just dive in her head in there I feel like so much of what you're seeing when you're seeing MMA is fatigue so much like that girl not locking up that triangle right there if she was super duper fresh like in training no adrenaline no weight cut she'd be able to lock that trying I have to know her background I would - I'm talking shit I hear ya sometimes fatigue but I think that most of was gonna try and pick the hotel high she is let's also she's punching that girl yeah a little Bluebell desk but you're you're seeing a lot of people just doing what they can do with their body at the moment for sure this is what they know well look at Shane Carwin Brock Lesnar Shane was exhausted I've never seen Shane and my life get tapped out from a head arm triangle ever he was done he was done and there's rods you don't have she's giving up the deep path oh that was so silly shit worked though oh my god she going crank on that chin I think you got a girl she's exhausted she's gonna tap she in tap going crazy come on sweetie body turn come on sweetie body triangle get that squeeze on oh she's got that she'd get she got it she's tapping she's tapping yeah watch this go and break that neck like a chicken bone I think she's gonna let her do it no it's gonna pop now she's gonna turn good pop her in the face turn right here keep going see this is fatigue man it's like in that scramble there was no urgency on the bottom she was trying to rest you cannot do that you have to when you when you get that opportunity you guys scramble hard well that that's champions don't you know they have rested in the transitions and the scrambles they're moving move like you'll get DC John Jones there's no fucking or TJ Cody there's no rest there I talked to chuck about that once Chuck Liddell was talking about how when you go down to the ground he goes once you're back touches the ground you got a fucking explode like your life depends on you know so many guys they get down the ground and they try to take a break they rest and he goes you're already done if you do that because you can't do that he goes once you're back touches the ground you got a fucking explodes nobody ever got a hold of Chuck and like canelo down this damage though guys don't really you know it's especially a high level like the top guys they don't rest their brandi was the only one that ever controlled chuck on the grounds radicals were forgotten god damn couture because she's beaten the shit up this is rough you might want to stop this fight I'd stop this fight this girls taking tremendous might stop the fight 10 sec just stop the fucking fight she's not protecting herself Jesus that girl took a lot of shots get harassed what Jesus she took a lot of shot girl the right it's not too excited she wasn't protecting herself man that's one thing that's interesting which the difference between back Seng and MMA you got way more of a chance to get stopped in boxing for your wobbly they'll stop the whole fight whereas an Emma made let shit go on way longer finish him yeah I want to see some longer like the Connor fight I agree with the stomping me too but for his experience yes the best of all time but in general they're gonna let you like Anthony Joshua Klitschko yeah cheese is crime een Joshua basically was flat out cold woke up didn't know where it is that and this is after he knocked Klitschkos down queer Street greatest heavyweight fight ever it was pretty much one of them oh my god once so crunked yeah I was pretty goddamn record for the British pay-per-view according to the promoter Wow 900,000 buys is the record somewhere it's somewhere no no that was the previous one that was David Haven where's the 1.3 million for the live airing of Tyson Fury quote here it says they broke it which was the day Pacquiao Mayweather fight but there's no I'm looking also for numbers that show official and then it never came out fine right so it's somewhere around 1.5 million from Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather which is what they and that's just interesting part 2 though I remember seeing some numbers like this for the Mayweather McGregor fight this German TV they like era for free I think they're you know 10 million people watching it there or something like that well it's the same like in Brazil when like cyborg fights or absent Silva there's no pay-per-view there right so it's like 90 million people watching 16 million they got 16 million to watch David Haye vs. Sudi fight Tyson Fury well Tyson Fury's very famous guy right Oh Benny wasn't that big now he's more famous did you see when he gave like a shout-out to freakin what's-her-name the girl the Irish chick Sinead O'Connor cuz she's suicidal have you seen that Sinead O'Connor live suicidal from a hotel what's she have mental illness something I would say so yeah but then Tyson Fury reached out to her cuz he suffers from it - it was like a call me I don't think she's calling him but he was like calling me you need someone to talk just gonna livestream banging her odd watch it nice imperious giant so seconds for 100m we got to talk about is everybody keep saying that you didn't tell the truth about your interaction with Nate Diaz because they're reading this transcript that somebody put up the conversation you had with Nate Diaz where you said I think you're off on this that's exactly I said because he goes you're wrong you're wrong you don't know boxing and then I went you went around and we're going back forth and that I go I think you're off on that yeah I think you're off on this or off on that and someone wrote in quotes we he teed off on you that those words are in my vocabulary to describe a fight teed off also I would never disrespect Nate like that in his face like that that sounds happy have you ever heard of me doing anything like that lady I would never do that and it's supposed to also what kind of bitch move would that be you to five nothing to do with that you brought another grown man yeah I would never brag he teed off on you has nothing to do with me that's disgusting no no I've never disrespect Nate so but so everybody out there is talking shit you're talking shit on a false narrative it's like some fake quote that someone they might have thought they heard that and that sound like was more salacious so they put that in quotes it's not what he said no it's fake news fake news all day yeah they wrote their own stuffing it's either like their vine for headlines like it's like button job talking shit to Nate and pointing down you know yeah and he's saying you know people are saying you weren't honest this guy can fucking crack yeah he's got a really odd style man because look at his last fight Brandon thatch was a kind of a while ago did he win yeah he beat that submission yeah I'm ready crack them they submitted them oh that's right undefeated Rob Rob 11 I know this is gonna be a good fight because CR BA heard Azad I love saying that name is a bad motherfucker he's a tough dude as tough as they come he's one of those weird dudes that like can you put your hand on the interview him he feels like would like Dan Anderson yeah like he looks like a normal dude but he's not there's a lot of tell no he's no walk amongst us they look like normal dudes do you put your hand on them me like yeah 2261 and Rob book it's an 11 and Oh mmm man that dimepiece picture um is this Amanda Liao yeah let's give me a fun fight I gotta stop doing these things when I'm coming straight from yoga class hot sweaty help put makeup on me man oh Jesus I forgot how bad this is boom boom I mean that's tough to watch has there ever been like a super fight that was that one-sided a super fight where everybody thought like holy shit I can't believe this is about to go down look at those people shocked and one person makes the other person look like they have no business in there and just over and like it just a career-ender complete total career ender such a bad idea for her to come back well this was a bad idea for to come back against this fucking power punching monster she just hits too goddamn hard you know I talked to Kat about it she's Kat told me cat Zingano she told me Jack wrote hit her yes she did yes she did she got hurt in the first round super emotional was finished her and then a man they gassed out yeah and Kat was telling me she's like nobody ever hit me that hard before whoa yeah it'd be a fun fight Shevchenko when Shevchenko caught Julie an opinion and armbars god damn torch dirt I thought it was like the next big thing and then chef Jade was like let's go check this out well she can do so many different things the thing about Valentin is she can strike she's got world-class Muay Thai shouldn't have that much hockey shit and they fought once and it was a super close fight man and people think if it was if it was a championship fight with five rounds Shevchenko gonna probably want to start come on late and win rounds she started coming on late you know what I was super impressively these two right next to each other like that oh that's fake fake news that's an edit yeah one of the things that I was like super impressed with when when I saw her fight Holly oh look at that touching each other's faces and Tim's one left I saw some Tim's young Jamie well you know what man she's Brazilian and she's gay she do whatever the fuck she wants I agree Rock those fucking Tim's I was just super impressed with her ability to control the interactions she's is that check right hook hurt her heard like footwork and like her technique when she was fight actually basically shut down Holly yeah I know surprising not easy to do I mean I don't know what Holly was going to that fight with us she was like on a Down but maybe didn't have such a good camp maybe wasn't at her past but if you look at how good Holly looked against Germain Duran to me how the fuck is Germain Duran to me not in the top six that she dropped she left the weight class yeah but she's back now no she's not yes she is no she can't be she ranked number nine I like that one she's back at 135 oh you're fucking right so she'd left 145 dropped yeah that you're right yeah she's not right because they're like what do we do with this chick well it's weird because it's like she abandoned her title so she didn't have to fight cyborg which blah so career suicides now no one respects you Yeah right yeah like I get it I don't want to fight cyborg either but yes can at least take the ass-whoopin then cut yeah I guess the argument is like you know she's saying that sir cyborg is a career cheater that doesn't work because she's passed every test that doesn't work you can't just keep banking on that especially you look at the way she fought when she fought Tonya avenger' you know she fought very professionally she fought very good she beat the breaks off that's a nice offer and she fought like it was intelligent like she was very technical the way she prota fiber ah I was like this is amateur cyborg yeah but you're sure murder her though for us for sure make it exciting but not if you if your cyborg fan you'd like that cerebral cyborg she'd be so tough to beat but also be the Mike Tyson of women fighting in Mercker for ice yes after her she just tell my zombie mom would not get help how tough was that girl she would not go away huh she would not go away so goddamn tough but I think she also cyborg she caught cyborg with a couple shots couple punches not a whole lot on them but yeah you got to make sure you should mind your P's and Q's and she knew eventually she's gonna beat her down she hit five all around but Jermaine stepping away from it like that the the real shame was Jermaine would have been a fucking very interesting very fun fight Jermaine is super technical and she's phenomenal striker but now Holly comes right I only in slide because I think Holly won that fight I thought I had Holly winning and also Jermaine also you know she had some suspect punches after the round like they should you can point from my probably won that fight so now karma catching up the way things work out life works out we got Holly beside work hopefully yeah that's gonna be interesting I that's a fight if isn't how it's got how is scheduled to fight cyborg if they scheduled a the rumor was on s Square Garden but the other scheduled yet I think that you know with Jermaine she was she came out in the first round and controlled it she controlled the fight but then she started to slow down yeah you know and I think part of it I mean who the fuck knows could be pressure could be you know whatever it is but that's when Holly clipped her with that question mark kick Remini she claimed earlier she's Schinder with that and then Holly dropped her with a straight left as Jermaine was coming forward I did the most damage and she got hit late the twice twice I felt it was her fight every - and that's why she should fight cyborg which is for capacity should be to Division champion she really shortly yes yeah yes it's dirty man yeah it is dirty um and then have Germain just step away from the title after that it's like oh come on this is crazy sumbitch stuff they definitely should have taken a point away for the second time definitely one that's what Holly should be alone would be the champ and I think I just think that like rounds were like Holly flattened her with that head kick and then dropped her again with that straight left I'm like those are two big moments in the fight the most anybody was hurt in the fight with those moments that should show in the scorecard I don't know what system they were using is New York the old York's like wait what happened I missed that and then you know especially with taking the points away because that was in Vegas or Cali yeah call you probably would have won that food how about the score cards for the Conor mayweather fight Hawk - hey ray he's Christ one wrong how crazy is that they're out of your mind employers like come on man one round come on first of all Max Kellerman owes you some dick pics or something doesn't least a dick pic cousin at the very least he actually he actually Conor McGregor would not land a meaningful punch when around what are you fucking crazy no he goes he won't land a single punch he this is bad for boxing he clipped him with a good left uppercut in the first round goosh and like Floyd allowed him to do that oh yeah if you know anything about Floyd he's not allowing someone to fucking hit him in the face it's so stupid him and Brian Barbarina should have a beach dad bod contest on the beach a powerful Afghanistan one of those fucking fold up aluminum fucking ham sandwiches I'm telling you man that dude is made out of bricks he had so fucking hard and he's literally like one of the like the densest dudes that Rob 6-3 tho tall dude I'm $85 more 25 oh by her design I used to fight 70 now is it fighting in 85 I just small 85 er yeah man maybe took this fight on short notice how tall is he would they say 511 510 he's built and then think of Yoel Romero the same way class oh yeah do them like that man but that's how it has to be done it really is that's the world we live it is what it is not fair not fighters don't occasionally eat lions it just is what it is you know that do to place tyrion lanister is not gonna kick your ass no matter how much he puts his mind to it it's never happening it's just not God er that's what a great name see the very first have her man he's been around for a long fucking time how old is he he looks 36 he's been a 40 with you 42 Jamie how the fuck - everybody 42 I would say is 36 I'm gonna say 30 sir sorry what is it 30 33 whoa what's eating well it's like a change up your diet home yeah I feel like then a natural reading girls are kind of killing it they're beating the American ones I feel like Lee where are you well we got weird old faithful my friends your your there I also enjoy them too I'm just saying international step in the game up for 53 first round 52 51 50 they have the clock on the screen right yeah okay Jamie's on the ball Jamie gets this even Locke did shit making good use that extra 15 pounds we had another hiccup on the fight pass what is he eating you talk about uh gets him so big but oh yeah it's like imagine it as much as you have to train to be an MMA fighter he's older sometimes genetics he lucked out I'll get dad by 33 there's something old oh shit I think it's just Wars you know Austria maybe Jesus Christ man relax he's just running low she's Australian Rob Wilkinson Australian this good good striking composure for who Wilkinson but by her design just throws bricks man yeah he's very dangerous very dangerous guy because he's throwing everything in every shot and if he can catch you inside the first round especially you know he's gonna hurt you you know the first round so dangerous hell yeah it's dangerous especially if I think I like that yeah but he's got to take these breaks you know when you sprint like that when you're that guy ooh yeah well a yes spray like that cuz the shorter guy drops fucking Wade longer and Ranger hey Rob for sure get the job out there though so you keep him back there you go it's always been his style though bajo de Zod has always been kind of a berserker that's 70 though it's gonna be way more easier than these 85 monsters and that gym against Luke Rockhold yeah I can't imagine this is the weight class he's gonna stay in I think if I'm looking at his body right here he's kind of oh we just clipped him with that right hand he's carrying around a lot of body fat I feel like this is probably a short notice fight fight a guess but I'm just guessing he's had a long career to somebody like I'm sick cutting weight good being right I can't perform at my best uh-huh dude start getting like kidney problems and weird shit happening with their body when their their bodies just shutting down from the weight loss well that's a kept DC out of the fucking Olympics I know man but also like with the weight cutting I think it's harder on females yeah I hear that oh that's so rough man I hear that a lot from that ain't no and some of them get big you gotta cut waiting with your thyroid and all that stuff nice takedown what's it taste the back didn't get the hooking right away though oh nice knee the body drops timing good timing Jesus try to go down you took him down once you just didn't get that hook quick enough this is that CR has only fought four times in five years Wow well I think you had some shoulder surgery it's got damn times what it sounds like I think you had shoulder surgery Jamie see if you can find that I said injuries any setbacks it doesn't say what yeah I'm pretty sure your shoulder surgery it looks like you can tell like he has a scar on the shoulder the front of children hmm you can also be out right there it could be some latent caveman genes I got some of those I got weird patches of hair that don't even belong there anymore do you yeah for humans I feel like guys who love testosterone and have more hair it's not fair to say you getting out on the top of your head though yeah not everywhere it's like you're bodging yeah I like your body is a shitload of here like well that's what you get yeah yeah yeah that's why I get super scared when I see those super hairy Russians yeah they freak me out too like the dudes that like their whole back is hair yeah just their legs like when I found our last gateways I like this show that went well sorry up here all over your shoulders yeah Chia Pets that's scary do you know whoa see art goes all dorset up son Wow he got the two he might have it here ah he doesn't know how to get out no see how it's just strange dude roll them give that J to roll son oh he's okay he's okay Wow he might be might get through this Wow oh man he's tough he's very tough oh man probably him flight from Australia to goddamn Rotterdam to get choked out like that it's probably long flight Oh see I don't want that wrestler I don't know I want oh that's so preposterous Pro lookup ruse Tom Qi EV look at that guy that was that big giant do the date Jake David hey fart how is he lying game that's value of ya holy look at that here yeah he's a straight-up gorilla he's a the only thing he plucks his eyebrows this is ruse Tom Qi EV he's a fuck I don't know if that's him that's another hairy Russian he'll feel like these dudes have crazy testosterone the fucking hairy like a gorilla most of them also have girls for kids hmm that's interesting this kid just be straight up was that real science and hairy backs but I feel like guys a lot to SAS drone not a lot of here Harry's fuck chest back and shoulders and usually have girls kind of makes sense it's science weird science dude I thought after our last pot get that so many people hit me up about Large Marge everyone remembers that bitch I wonder if she's dead she's gotta be Large Marge this was 85 so she's healthy she's in her deep in her 90s if she's alive she might be killing it maybe she has like a podcast the Large Marge what she died from Coke and hores like when Johnny Depp and started buying castles and shit I was reading about this chick in South Africa she's a student and they're supposed to put like a hundred dollars in her account instead or a thousand dollars in her account instead they put a million they put a million dollars in her account and so she went off for like a month I was just buying clothes and shoes and taking her friends on trips non-issue and then they found it out and then she screwed I spent 60 grand no they said yeah but in South Africa that shit that's a 60 grand your fuck did P Diddy at gold houses and chips showing up with designer clothes at school and they're like what's going on spot a new iPhone 7 Gucci shoes and she's lost and drunken tarps yeah Paul that we control showed up in a new kid how silly is the camel with gold teeth gold front spinners for teeth how's that work because the bank's mess up and you like God fucking I'm going sizzler and then they go no you're not yours money like you're fucked up there's like they would sue you for it and if they won in court then they're just like take it from you okay but some it's not a law or it's not our like it's a civil or something about doing the right thing getting money that I forget the word I just words reading I'm reading it like you're getting it you know I gotta return the camel with fucking spinners on it like that I own that thing man a man did you hear that Nate Diaz wants 20 million dollars for the rematch with Conor I see and he should get 20 to 30 million do you think that it's how many pay-per-view buys do you think that that fight would be worth 1.5 now yeah maybe one maybe more now mm maybe more now cuz let me ask you this Joe what what let's say Nate fought let's say Nate fights the winner of Kevin Lee Tony version and they're the main event pay-per-view how many pay-per-view buys does Nate Diaz do without Conor well not as many not even close not even close right but it's it's a big Conor thing but the big fight for Conor is Nate like if Connor fart Kevin Lee how many pay-per-views we get oh you know in he might you're right all right we right you look up all Connors rights he's never done less than a million ever you're right it's so he's the Floyd Mayweather MMA now we freeze oh god damn it fight goddamnit five passes of a bitch conspiracy thirty snoot a snitch its snoop cast okay hey fuck where we're sitting here frozen outlet I'm so we will oh my god what's Acrobat and Load oh no it's dead it's dead again we got a streaming issue some shit is going down or there's such a demand for this it's fucked up like Mayweather McGregor they don't how to handle the overcoat expected 50 people they got a hundred how dare you this is ridiculous yeah but I think Nate rightfully so chic if that fights gonna be the biggest paper you've all time I really do I think the trees can be because of fur mmm a fragment may for MMA because of the Connors right he's bigger than ever biggest combat sports Muslim I heard a bad that's the long flight back dust really going out like this kids tough man oh he's getting Rock'em Sock'em robot buddy stop it now it's closed certainly close oh hold up when you're sitting indian-style right stop it no man he's getting up he's getting up getting up with this ass work go ahead and stop it stop it now stop oh stop it stop the fucking fight come on look at all my god my god dammit like he didn't need that I mean the referee could collided with him and hurt him he had let him wait ahead bottom Wow CR shout-out to Afghanistan either do can crack man some sand the dude look forward to seeing him fight 2018 the way 2018 you don't want to do coke with that guy with the white suit or you do look at all those people I because poor guy the ref did that cut but with Nate I think that that fight that that that's the thing with this fight and that's why I don't think you didn't see it happen very soon because both Nate and Connor realize how much power they have and you can't just go from with the old rules anymore they like the the Connor is changing the dynamics of the fight game for the better for the fighters yeah it's a great thing it is a great thing I just wonder like how much Nate can actually get definitely cuz what they say I think report said between the two fights in around 2.5 million to fight him twice now he made two million plus to fight on both times both times so it's four million so four million total that's what I'm reading I did not talk to Nate I did not talk I read this slide so I thought I made - maybe yeah you might be right maybe I miss quoted that so maybe it's two and two or two and a half two and half either way so say made formula there's no way in the world you'd say hey Nate fight Connor in the biggest fight of all time trilogy Connors gonna get 40 million during it two and a half again mmm there's no way that happens both sides realized the magnitude of this fight and he made four million dollars in a year so how much money does he have left over you've probably got a million dollars plus just sitting in the bank doing nothing so what do you you know I'm saying so the dynamics have shifted towards the fighters for the first time now if you UFC how do you make this work with Connor because he's not fighting guys anymore four five ten million you can't when you have over a hundred million dollars in the banking the biggest star of all time what do you think the most Connors made in a UFC fight is ten mil pride you think so 10:12 milk max so now you think he can get like probably like thirty at least right that leap ends on how many pay-per-view buys otherwise why are you doing it what if he gets like what if Nate and Connor gets three million babe reviews it's not out of the question it's not it's a stretch when I stretch but if Nate can talk the right amount of shit you know people get excited about honestly right now for Conor what else is there that's even close the first fight in MMA what else the only argument is you can say Connors the only drone he can fight Billy from Afghanistan and still get 2 million pay-per-view bodies we're practically you've that Conor fight Paulie Malignaggi in Dublin see if I'm Conor and I have McGregor promotions I'm going wait a second I'm gonna fight this monster Nate Diaz you wanna pay me 10 mil on your with Reeboks or I'm just gonna go to Dublin me and Paulie sell this 70,000 state amount I'm just gonna take all of it UFC goes whoa some sort of it they must have both they have some sort of a deal for boxing too you know they have that Zuffa boxing shirt that Dana was wearing it might be because sceptical hippos like the shirt not get myself because I do bugs however McGregor promotions I would assume is Connors thing really you think he's in cahoots with the who do you have seen I would think he has to be I don't think he would make a deal with McGregor promotions I think he made a deal with what are you saying do for boxing t-shirt 25 bucks why does it say Dana White suited boxing tee does Dana would come with it it's false have a picture of him this is fake news I would imagine he has some sort of a deal but you don't okay so let's say of a deal think about this Joe so let's say Conor and Dana have a deal with the McGregor promotions mm-hmm like I your next fight we're gonna Co promote with you mm-hmm well how's that gonna work now so they need to promote this huge fight and Nate's like hold up if he's gonna make all this money like I know when we're in cahoots with him I mean for the UFC yeah no I don't think you'll cope remote for the you don't think so no but I think it would Co promote if you had a Paulie Malignaggi boxing match in Dublin in fucking Dublin see that you have been I want to see everything dude I want to see snails race Hillary dick is that the fight is the Nate Diaz fight that's the sign that's the fight but but is it the fight as far as a business because if Connor learn anything from Floyd you know that when you fight Floyd Floyd's the businessman he's gone promoting Connor has his own promotion now he's the businessman now so Connors gonna listen what are we doing here what do you want to do maybe if the UFC contract that Connor has runs out maybe they make some new crazy ridiculously oh that that contract doesn't matter if it's out or not game the game has changed yeah you don't there's no way you'd keep going with that current contract no way McGregor Sports & Entertainment Limited the notorious Conor McGregor and notorious why did you pull that up I don't do a fuck this company that it's officially exists and these things it's all Connor stuff yeah it's registering his name not I mean that could be like a t-shirt company I'm sure he's got something I mean must have some sort of law but also Dana White I don't know about that guys that doesn't mean but Dana White's not stupid enough to let Connor do all this and not be involved in it he's only right sure make your own thing man do your thing buddy there's no way hmm I know either way whatever he does interesting I know I would like to see him box Paulie while Nate just keeps eating tacos and going to Cabo doing tequila shots I like that flights gonna go away I disagree the fights around the year that you think it's all I don't know man I think it if Nate wants to just chill and just train have a good time the fights there in a year I don't think so I think if Connor stays active I guess he could be with Nate what's it how you gonna stay in the limelight yeah he's fighting Nate Diaz again they fought over two years ago Mike's not there Paulie Malignaggi in a boxing match in Dublin I on yeah ma legit possibility to get a win over a two-time world to world champion in the second boxing fight ever to boxing fights ever two world champions making Bank come on son ba let me say how much ball was stupid how much money do you think you would get for that fight though not nearly as many I got more money than you did fight Nate Diaz mm with a tougher challenge right so what do you think the pay-per-view would be for a Paulie Malignaggi fight would it even be a million bar for sure whatever can't see that's the thing Connor Connor could beat play fuckin the celebrity softball game right now a lot of people are gonna buy that bitch you know I'm saying so him fight and Paulie and there's all this heat people like God he did well against Floyd we could see it being Paulie I would say at least a million and if it's your own promotion what do you make 30 right 30 40 mil right hmm interesting in Jersey bring your balls Connor thank you all but now parting with anyone knows that like Polly but now Polly's talking shit to all the UFC well he should shut the fuck up cuz if you wanted to have a UFC fight you can go over there and get his brain kicked in yeah you don't wanna stop talking you're a boxer you're very good boxer just shut your mouth just just go after dishonor literally a million people in the world that could grab you and strangle the life out of you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it current sorry dude yes he's not what you want it you just don't get it don't talk shit you will give you a wrestler and he will punch your fucking face into pulp well yeah he's not a goddamn thing you do about No now goddamn thing yeah like you think he'd went towards Tony Ferguson what is Paulie way he's thick right now but what's his weight class like 45 right yeah 45 47 yeah how about you you give him Ricardo Lopez how about you give Yaya Rodriguez how about that I mean yeah you don't want that yeah God look at the Bravo just give him a guy that's not the top of the food don't give him Frankie Edgar don't give him josée Aldo you don't need to do that you know who he could beat up though who CM Punk you start seeing Punk try foxy him uppercut the fuck does imagine what max Holloway would do the Paulie Malignaggi in an MMA fight just imagine mmm just try to just try to wrap your head around the kind of ass fucking I think I think I think max went at him on Twitter like they did that actually would literally kill him he if he wanted to wanted to if you want to literally kill him I mean so would Cub Swanson so what a lot of guys how will they doing a boxing match again not so good not so good max has the best shot the max is amazing footwork and he's a good striker very very good striker is that excellent timing good discipline and his endurance is phenomenal Cody Garber it might have something to say even at 45 you come on fight Paulie it'd be interesting be interesting but Malignaggi is a legit world champion pro boxer sweet time yes he's a very smart guy he's one of the best Alice in the game - Paulie doesn't need to do all this yeah well that was one of the things that people were super concerned about him sparring with Connor like he did to 12-round sparring matches with Connor and kids when he did a 812 round pony around him and Connor was you know landing some obviously some fucking heart shots just from what we know when we definitely saw that one straight left that fucking clanged them that was right right dead center in the mug and you see the sparks flying but also to pause defense this was telling Paulie like dude let's say I'm retired let's say Cain Velasquez like a shop I need you to help me trim it I mean I need you come help give me some rounds that's not a free ride right there that punch fuck no that's not a free ride that is low space looking rough there that is your face getting crushed but here's the thing if I got off the plane even from LA to San Jose and Kane won some rounds at kingo's hey bro I need you oh five five happening I'm here to help you ain't no give me five five get one round the side coaches a lot of ego shit going on there I think Connors team brought Paulie and to fuck him up at the horizon and to go if he does fuck him up we're blasted out there just to sell the fight more yeah and that was the other thing they said about that is like paulie's like you never go 12 rounds like that he's like you never it's unheard of flying and go 12 never even in MMA I heard of someone get off plane going 5-5 well it basically gave him a practice fight that is smart like Connors part because confidence builder it also solidified him shit never fucking can box a little bit and Dana blasted out you know yeah I think it was good it was very smart obviously it worked obviously it worked yeah six and a half but you create an animal he paid a mammoth EDF see yeah but they got to what else the fuck they have what else do they have it's true versus covilhã I want to see the full video I want to give Pauly is full do you can I see the full video well you probably could get it and watch it but don't blast up because if you do that then you don't have a fight in Dublin hell man you don't say you can't because let's say Conor starched them for 12 rounds well then that fucks up the paper you buy somebody gonna beat him but what if you did what if Pauly's telling truth would have polished me getting to most of them see that's why we want this debate so you buy the pay-per-view on Tuesday that ass-kicking you saying like you can't that tapes out there but you can't release it cos him fuck up the fight maybe you see when security guards were getting in his face it's like relax dude I'm a fighter yeah you just come on I'm a fighter guy kicked him out what the fuck you that's hilarious yeah he's like I'm trying to hype up a fight then Paulie almost got in a fight during the when we're doing a pre-show because the fans were just fucking relentless though Irish fans were just harassing them and then the guy goes Paulie I'll kick your ass worse than Conor McGregor did and then find probably goes fuck this take this things off goes at them and so then Brian gets between them Brian the commentator with the shaved head and so he's like no no probably don't do this and the guys like do someone give you a worse beating than McGregor did you know you know his Irish accent Paulie can't get to us chaos security security sure game security earlier than that though I think about Pauling is he's not scary looking so you feel like if there's a pro world champion boxer you talk shit too that might be the guy huh right until you get fucking blasted in the face yeah but you don't mean like there's certain people who's that guy that's Paulie and then that's his the guy that's Connors manager but there's like certain is partly connor gentleman with businessman here fucking businessman hey this is this is the shitty thing if you're upon this is that this is the internet Nazi Polly's bring the spot upon himself but if you met Paulie he's a great fucking dude I like guy he's a great guy I mean he's just he's hanging himself because I kept I went dude you're responding to these trolls and you're I'm telling you meant from MMA's world they fucking to hate you man he fucked up when he wore the double diamond earring studs I'm not gonna lie to you I disagree yeah I like the Double Diamond Jersey Shore look it's not it's not 2001 you can't do that anymore maybe where he's from had fucking Brooklyn they just own that shit yeah from Bensonhurst right Malignaggi either got a good straight oh yeah but who's got the lasagna male in MMA man they're just murdered Bobby puts too much garlic in the sauce yeah dude look at the size of Struve walking around the cage it's like the cages up to his navel but also kids Cade how the fuck did no one put a basketball on your hand well do you hate money he's a Holland guy from Holland they don't even know what basketball is until he come over here to fucking Google that shit it's nice it's true taking you out of Colorado making you play cricket yeah I wish someone did mate we need a quickie star it seems your duns good breeding in Mexico come on over and play genetics ago everyone who plays cricket comes from a football background English football we don't hit each other do you need someone who plays cricket who's more physical he this homeboy didn't get enough credit I'm out m1 world champion and Bellator world champion yeah he's a tough guy Bellator literally cannot hold a heavyweight champion like when was the last time you even thought about the heavy look at him exactly it's bounced that's what I'm saying they can't hold them that's why I want row Nelson Bobby Lashley world title fight or they have doing an Indian Reservation why would you fuck what you doing if they have to do despy but you know why no I get you you know I'm saying all natural and also all day why not have Phaedra matryona for a world title fight so at least there's a belt right well phaidor you know in Mitrione was a changing of the guard for sure mate Rio knocking out phaidor it's basically okay this this rides over you know it's essentially over if he wants to keep doing it you know you know for sure but that's not convinced but like the people in the know that yellow Donnell fight you're right Fabio Fabio I was like that's good it's over Semmy Schilt old school so he's training with Semmy Schilt that's a good sign he was trained in Southern California mom good tall 15 first round finish his last fight he beat Roy Nelson did he yeah that's when Roy was like I see a man went to Bellator that's what happened yep was it decision Roy was a free yeah he be beat my decision but then Roy's contract was up me went with Belle to her well I can't blame him he's always had words with Dana you know it was got back and forth yeah I can't blame him it's good move for Roy it's a good move for a lot of guys you know it's a good fight coming up is Paul de Leeuw is fighting lorenz larkin that's a great fight it's a very good fight you know I mean Daley had that real close fight with the Bellator champ the foxes - no you got murked by Roy McDonald Daley got yes take it down and then yeah Lima Douglas Lima oh you're talking about Larkin yeah fucking got hurt in that fight but yeah yeah I feel like it's very possible that Rory MacDonald is the best Walter Wade on the planet I think he is he beat Woodley with lasar champ and he looked so goddamn technical did you see what Rory said about uh Robbie Lawler no he was doing like a reddit Q&A or facebook Q&A and then went hey um do you think Lawler was on Stewart and you fought him and it wasn't like ah maybe he was like I'm convinced - you us I know goddamn Rory why is he convinced I don't know you'd have to ask Gillian see but Robbie's always been like that he's always been like super resilient Robbie Lawler godsakes yeah I have no idea for what it is he didn't look any different than he's ever looked right he always looks the same I don't know why we fought that same way against cowboy I don't know what to believe all right I know right after that's Johnny's thing like who knows I was just be like who knows were like God I kind of make sense now I was putting all my Easter Bunny chips in the dick pills basket not me but I mean didn't have a baby thank you girl cheats on you just forget about it close my eyes and go to sleep and hope wake up in yeah I know it's real I know they're all natural natural he's just marking everybody yeah Robbie looked exactly the same when he fought cowboy and he fought the same way too like the third round was a rough round for cowboy he was coming on strong Robbie was coming on strong Robbie took the second round off he took the second one off I said the third round was a rough round for cowboy oh yeah yeah Robbie was saying it to him hard body shots good fight though very good I love Cowboys like how we got robbed like not actually have Robbie winning that one one in three if it wasn't a draw I would think that you I liked going towards the guy who's winning the fight in the last round to the way pride used to do it they also dis definitely won the first round definitely won the third round I think I didn't have it as a draw the cigarettes not ten eight and this is Sony's biased it's fuck were Tao boy yeah I got angry was that fight under the new rules it was right sure was yes Oh goddamn everybody's got to be on these goddamn new rules I'll taller these two this is a main eventer right we paid attention to three minutes of the last fights a couple of dad bods the horrible triangle attempts by the chicks and you kept calling them sweetie come on honey come on sweetie pie come on cutie just a couple tall boys here super tall you got to me you got a good point about that eat on my car the international fuck around exotica Jesus bump bump on it that guy's got a total Norman Rockwell haircut I could be in a soda shop somewhere I talking to a little kid with his dogs with goddamn Stroupe has on those giant basketball shorts that's true she wasn't find a long time it's been a while right fucking heart stopped for a second thing yeah he has like some serious problems right yeah a deaf heart surgery man then they thought he's gonna surgery yeah that to put like something his heart straight-up heart surgery sorry yes holy shit I thought it was just like like some sort of an illness that you know one I feel like you'd have some sort of surgery scar I don't see it over his heart and sometimes fake news Jamie sometimes they go in through the armpit when they do certain surgeries for the heart they're going through your armpit and through the side wall of your body oh and they don't have to open your chest I might be right and because he I know he had some serious shit going on because we had to say Amanda at the time oh and they're very satisfied Mitrione that up cut might land when these times you know what's interesting is Volkov it's like one of the few guys that he's ever fought that's pretty close to him in the reach depart Travis brown me Travis brown said oh you're tall cool suit Ram punch your skyscraper that was amazing amazing when the best knockouts ever might have avoided it how do you do that cuz remember you'll see when LEM fight cuz yet to do get to do something about it because he'll seems like too much of a risk yeah you had some serious yeah putting the rape choke gun against the cage how many times that dudes you run into those gods two cameras I've seen it happen once not a lot but these guys are so tall those cameramen better have their head on a swivel also powerful Volkov has a stingray tattoo on his back like Moana that's a Moana tattoo yeah you're welcome oh man what a great movies good move the rock can you think I get more talented Oh seats troop on the ground those trouble i'ma fuck the start is crazy hmm modified workout regimen dietary changes some lesser medication that's that word regimen that's one word that I really don't like saying blood pressure medication listen no promotions that I was talking about strong cracked uppercuts landing that were cuts trouble oh I'd be worried about Struve when the going gets rough in this fight he has to undergo another cardiovascular examination within six months or under maintain eligibility that's interesting stru will have it be required to undergo no catch up interesting well you know people that are really that tall they a lot of times have problems with their heart apparently it's just super difficult for you Great Dane that's a to pump blood through all that tissue no name the tallest grandpa you know go they're all dead they're all dead yeah yeah it's a real bummer but there are some basketball players we've gone over this

right he looks like a he looks like a mannequin man he looks like shit there he's been throwing dick for a long time but he's also probably had some super boring conversations with these chicks that's time to talk to 23 year old you want a brain we've had in the backend ground after meanwhile he's marrying these chicks he's paying a price bro he is I think it's like part of like what's valuable for his brains a well-read guy to like you know like he's not a mole there's that up to he's not a moron yeah this is a fucking good fight man great fight five rounds Jesus Christ they're super bloody yeah this is the second or the third this is the third boy that cheekbones fucked up on Volkov he got his last of worse because his wife was unfaithful Oh son of a bitch oh how dear you filed for divorce and says his wife was the unfaithful one see those are out I was talking about the ones from the Playhouse one basic on oh shit he's landing on him early in the relationship God how are you gonna cheat on Hugh you son of a power chair she this is my thing though let's say could you could you when I was a single man I dated a girl who was friends with Hugh could you marry a girl who dated Hugh Hefner it's kind of a red flag yeah seems like it'd be an issue right yeah it would come up if she ever talked any crazy shit he'd be like damn wait what did you say yes he dated a hundred-year-old man and why did she to be the magazine in 2016 are you shitting me no one reads magazines either you dumb bitch maybe she did it for the experience yeah maybe just didn't like it you know one of those bucket list things well it's what lady just has a strong dick game to Joe you forget about that that's you have never read row right maybe a big ol summer sausage for a dick yes Lajoie didn't you got to think that if you're a guy like you half not like all these years of doing this all these years of banging chicks like it's got to get boring after all super boring so you start fucking dudes like what do you do after a while when it's huge afternoon I don't know I think he like plays backgammon or something he has a bunch of kids though yeah instead of gang kids The Magazine tried to having no naked girls in it however about a year how dare you oh yeah let me get my fucking Playboy subscription because I want to know about the politics what are you guys you know if you're important to read articles Brendan mmm this is a good fucking fight man good I was like great like Volkov with some solid technique but so strewth oh nice neither money Struve is not a spring chicken but he's been around for a long time he's been playing for a long time I'm rethinking about that Travis brown basically I have a picture now Roy kind of over think about he fought Pat Barry he fought uh shit everybody he's been around for a long fuckin time so it's Travis brown done I don't know he's what he's lost five hours last six or six others I know that a you know Josh Parnell was super impressed with them in preparation for this last fight that Russian dude put the squeeze on them it doesn't matter though cuz when you lose five out of six you know like we don't care what you're doing training he didn't look I mean he looked good in the beginning in the beginning right moving around but he didn't look like you know he doesn't look like vintage Travis brown I feel like he needs to go back to Albuquerque but maybe you just didn't want to do it anymore it's posits the other thing you know Ronnie got married maybe just maybe it's just time to move on which isn't a bad thing like no sometimes everyone wants these guys to keep fighting but maybe there's more form out there he's a good guy - that's the other thing the bad thing is when you don't move on and you keep fighting and you don't want to pretty CH will need a body Volkoff turn it on lazy sidekick I got a piss so hard do it yes let go let me go this podcast has been brought to you by life it is gentlemen the smooth sweet relaxing experiences of life mmm it's a good fight so far Jamie you join us yes these are huge yeah they're giant um Stefan's troop seven feet tall and this guy's like not quite as tall as him but he's in the neighborhood I think Volkov is probably about six eight how tall is he I'm guessing six eight is four inches shorter so so yeah I think Struve is just seven feet so pretty close it's an interesting situation the heavyweight division has because you essentially have Alistair Overeem who's really looks like the only credible challenge other than Francis and gah know Francis and Ghana needs like a big win over somebody and he would have gotten it if he had beaten Junior dos Santos that would have been as big yeah it's because Francis would have gotten the possibility or the opportunity rather to get a big win over a real big name with Junior but junior pissed hot so now Francis has to wait for another opponent but he's the most exciting challenger but you still have Alistair I think Derrick Lewis is coming back who just beat Derek Lewis somebody beat Derek Lewis Oh Mark Hunt kind of beat his ass wasn't wasn't the best fight for Derek and then he quit retired after it's over and he change his mind point is there's only like legitimately like four or five real contenders that are exciting in the whole heavyweight division which is just great oh my god he poked him again Stefan Struve just poked Volkov again damn it too tall too tall to be fighting mark Goddard straighten it out there's some there's some downsides being too tall like you look like shitting clothes no snowshoes like cool you know like they're just too big no scuba gear everyone's rich ever think about that when two guys car you can get yeah oh you want gt3 not up in here you wouldn't fit yeah like that was the thing with Shaq he would buy cars and cut out the backseat Oxman giant ass see there's like certain cars you can have you think they'll ever be a super heavyweight division never there's not enough heavyweight it seems to me that they shouldn't have a weight clause it's just like the heavyweight division in boxing like when David Haye fought value of I think value of is 300 pounds yeah so you're saying there's just 206 and above to the limit 225 yeah like 225 I think this should be a 205 a 225 and then have at it fuckers yeah 225 on up I wonder why they don't do that but there's also you didn't get some slot like usually typically especially with the going stitch around these days if you're over 280 you gettin sloppy up and then it's bad for the product the mountain I can't pass him any test yeah including a math test he's doing nothing I bet he could like something like what are those stones called those big fucking stones Atlas stones he probably passed the atlas stone certification test that's about it it's about it it's just bad for them sighs I do picking up rocks and shit now if he hears this and I run into it was give me trouble I think you'll be okay she's fuck did you saw that did he howdy dying came with Thrones he get stabbed with a spear and then they brought him back to life with witchcraft well I didn't know right now they're trying to bring back life I don't know they fucking date it for god sakes last time I saw bro but you know where I'm at my god they're dead I thought you already passed it nah man well trust me it's worth watching I bet on the fan I'm I assume they were bringing them back though oh it's tough to avoid spoilers these guys are Rock'em Sock'em robot in this bitch Scoob looks more tired the thing is that bit hard you know man cardio is such a giant factor in fights dude in heavyweight in every every division but every really heavyweight yeah like sure oh there you go that's it when skyscraper falls down there you go that's it wonder how many more times we see screw fight how many more times gonna get Kay out how many times you've been ko'd I don't start flatline them Travis brown K Odom this dude just kayo them Roy Kalin rocky Odom I feel like it looks worse because he's so goddamn tall you know I'm saying like if a Burger King burns down we don't watch it if a skyscraper burns down we watching it - good point you know I'm saying that's a good point he killed steep a implied like kick then BOOM yeah he knocked out steep a it's not so heavyweights like that's what you do get like people get knocked out man yep this is true this is true how many people watch this you think boom that uppercut yeah over world wide how many people watch this nah man us this on fight pass just fight death how many people in fight pass this is the subscriptions in is it around 200,000 oh that it's more than that I don't know so is the only way this is playing on five pounds yeah yep right in Rotterdam it's like on Fox for 2-inch nice over there something it's so like that's a great move I'll get exhausted fire up oh god Bruce goes everywhere he just listen if you're if you want to keep that job like that's what you do you have to go everywhere they use that joe Martinez though - yes you speak Spanish yes good if Bruce want the ice really good I don't jump forever but if Bruce and he was in WC but if Bruce wants to take a break you can like you don't have to fly it a Rotterdam for one night you know it's one of the reasons why I didn't want get his knee operated on you don't want to take some time off it's gonna blow an ACL did you see the video simple if ACL out it's classic sad he's doing like a fucking karaoke thing and fell at the in Las Vegas man who the fuck they took Francis off the car didn't they yeah breaking my heart well the Junior dos Santos thing breaks my heart too because it was just a diuretic I don't get it they found a trace amount of a diuretic in his system that is not helping him that is not gonna help him fight you know I mean it's just not the only thing that could be is you could say that a diuretic might be used to mask steroids true I think they do do that correct right so this potentially he was masked something which I don't think so but also no one else wants step up the plate in fight Francis mm-hmm who wants to that guy's terrifying fuck all that short notice yeah what Alistair Overeem it was like nah else really good Alistair Overeem turned it down how stirs right about the fight for the title who else is there we got yup for Doom verse Derrick Lewis now Lewis Satan people in Houston shout out Derrick Lewis yeah person people with his truck um people this goddamn truck what well who else I mean I did when Derrick fights for doom if her doom wins he's got a real good real good argument for him being the next in line but if he doesn't or if it's not a good fight or if anything goes sideways you got out sir that's it who else is there Francis Francis hasn't have a big name of a big person yet if Francis beat Junior dos Santos you've got a big name in Fiddler yeah but it was so rough the potential Francis has is absolutely world champion potential 100% but it's just like do you make the fight right now who else is he fight the JDS was the mark hunt Francis Marc hunts find some random Russian who's ranked 11 in Australia they don't wanna take him off that mark can't mark up Francis makes sense mark hunt JDS makes sense give him a big name so he can starch him then he give him a title shot well JD s re fought mark hunt never jadiel kicked him yesterday but I don't know if JD s is the same anymore definitely not yeah he's still tough character yeah he pees broth well remember that super looking for he looked good against Rothwell great and I think that's when Rock will might a peat electric it's true and then okay Kane obviously we're missing Kane but the reason why we're missing Kane is we're not completely convinced that Kane's healthy know yeah we have no idea when he's gonna fight yeah I mean who knows God watch Frances first Cain but Cain's fighting steep a next when he's healthy that's the fight they're gonna make that's what they want to make yeah but man I mean that when he's healthy those are three weird words there's a kind of key is he retiring retire I thought it sound like the in hearts that I love you can never tell you said I'm sure we'll see every improved Stefan Struve when he's ready to return to the Octagon look at my bowtie yeah I just feel like a heavyweight so let's say Kane let's say Kane would get healthy so you have steep a cane necks which is amazing fight allister's went over for Brisa was awful Francis Alistair man or Mark Hunt so mark hunts fighting that uh is that is the mark unspecified that Merson cat what do you think about DC versus deep a love it I like DC's chance in that fight too he's got a real good chance DC was a murderer that heavyweight beat the shit just Barnett not losing any weight didn't cut a goddamn thing shorter than everybody threw him around like frisbees were straight-up goddamn though the put look after seven in both divisions it gets super suspect they see it says see it says champion Jon Jones it should just be a doc doc doc for now it should be needle needle needle oh is that too much just pills be like a dot dot dot dot we give the fights coming up so UFC fight not not Fight Night rock cold branch okay she was gonna st. Preux - how dare you personally though if I'm banking on baby yeah that's a good fight but I like a good I like rock hold branch two men I really do I like that fight Nunez Shevchenko's fun yeah that's gonna be fun oh you're doing that one yeah yeah I'm doing that one yeah I was gonna be in Edmonton as it is but now they have two world title fights on the card so they have the bantamweight title and then have mighty mouse to Mighty Mouse ready board yeah that's a weird one right because Mighty Mouse wants to break the record yeah yeah he had an opportunity to break the record if he fought TJ and a lot of people I try to teach a fight down and I heard they offered him good money and he still was like nah can we read board we said he wants TJ to fight someone at 125 pounds first so he wants to know that he can make the weight and me ain't get away with that but even TJ you know he was like I can make the whit I was on track to make weight just me you know I don't know it sounds like a lot excuse from DJ I love DJ but also him fight and raid Borg well he's really close to history I mean I get it and I get it I get it I don't because you want to be a star got a fight TJ fight Dominick Cruz you got a fight Cody gar Brants yeah you're just gonna stay beat like you know Ray Borges a monster has a great nickname tells Mexican devil for God's sake you know however missus was laughing but it doesn't it does nothing for Demetrius besides I guess breaking the record right but he might not even make the wait ray Borg's miss to wait a couple times there's a lot going on how many times were a board missed wait see we could find that I want to say he's missed it twice it's a tricky weight class it's like when John linacre was the the big thing everybody's thinking about him fighting for the title that he was just you know - great he just couldn't do it he just missed it half the time headline said Ray Bourque sick of fans so what sick fans were missing wait mmm-wa to say let me know when you find it jack but like Ray board versus DJ does it does nothing no one cares mm-hmm yeah yeah it doesn't no one cares what it does get him to that magical number for personal reasons it's good powerful lizard on his shirt um before personal reasons good for DJ why does he have a lizard on a shirt just lizards are awesome he's super into lizards I don't know man that's a good question yeah you know I like fancy stuff I've not put a lizard on myself and I want you to wear this future lizard maybe it stands for something it stands for our love Dan where the lizard frilled lizard for what would I do to explain it does today I wanna fight ya they fucked him over man he's got like some issue with his heart that is totally non life-threatening and he's in fantastic shape or he was before he stepped away and they were saying that he has like an irregular heartbeat like he has an extra heartbeat there's just but when there's with that stuff you know it's tough man because it's such a risk for the commission to Graham to fight let's say it's hard fucking exploded in range it I don't know man I don't think anything I think he's fine but I'm so fit what's he gonna do what do you do Dan like you're great you're great at Compton you got this gig we're gonna do stop doing that coming back and compete at 170 you beaten Woodley I think you'd come back at 155 okay let's do 55 doesn't he look very lean didn't like the same anymore true true knows who knows mr. Kleist won both those fights yeah see that ain't good though it's not good it's not good when you got a guy with a lot of pressure on them headed towards the title do you start looking for excuses they start you know if you lost if you talked on two separate occasions you haven't made the way that's like the are you grinning with khabib right we've been a long between those two fights he did who'd he lose to Justin Scoggins a Scoggins is no fucking joke tough custom where's he at these days 125 just it does nothing for me I'm a scientist I know this might even be pound for pound number one day are you he's still your number one he is now for sure of John was my number after Merck in DC but yeah I moved John closer to the number one position although I've seen I think they're debatable and they're changeable because I think Mighty Mouse wins in the spectacular way but against who begin to that's the big he's beaten you know it's not like that's the toughest division at all Wow he lost it pedro muñoz god damn who is that AA word those are to God mmm interesting but yeah one key though the only argument with Mighty Mouse is hoozy beating you know Levi so who knows 7a no god sakes yeah well you know why man there's a lot of like super technical guys in that division I just feel like there's no one meat Sahu dough was really green in terms of MMA I mean it really had not been fighting MMA that long he's fantastic wrestler but his MMA experience your lunch one two years too much too soon yeah but that's a Division I guys seven you know never know gets a title shot nope there's no like going on there I need to stop being a fatty that's a good well that helps me feel come for you to make weight report I'm missing Lee I need to stop being a fatty that's he's like fat shaming himself I'm not behind that so it's it's the co-main event them and then Nunez shevchenko yeah how many pay-per-view buys does that do any guess you tell me Neil Magny and dos Anjos who that's actually interesting how fel dos ángeles is back what do you think he could do it 170 you look goddamn good in his debut at 170 so this time I don't say this yeah he worked very good against Eric Saffiedine he did look good he looks thick as fuck guys like shredded in that pic yeah and that's how he looks and he's fighting to that pretty you thought of and that picture prettiest out of no comment shading angles dude I'll tell you the fun is fight on that card Jeremy Stephens Melendez Gilbert Melendez that's right nobody even thought about that that's the funnest that's a phenomenal fight it's good one that's a chaos fight yes so wait a minute is El Nino going down to 45 or as Jeremy Stephens going up it's 45 it says it there it's 45 so Gilbert is cutting weight down to 45 has he ever done that before do they still have fucking JDS and Francis on this card take that - here you take that down doers to him and be like what the fuck where what what wait is it does it say most positive it's 45 so he's cutting weight and he's going down to 45 that's crazy that's interesting boy I don't know he's never done that before and he's like he's got to be like 35 36 no you know 35 so he really is see it says 155 there hmm we'll find out we'll find out soon anything more to add Brenda Shaw before we wrap this bitch up I don't think so man it's been real it's been real we got back together and did one of these home even with a half a crew half the crew we have no conspiracies with Eddie Brian not droppin some old-school knowledge you're lucky because in Rotterdam I'm sure you had some gems for you yeah you probably explained the government to us here's the government system and then Eddie I went man I feel a little flat today and anyway did you say flat yeah and then just went off Eddie's full on these days apparently they were debating whether or not uh he's crazy with Korea is like what's happening in North Korea like he doesn't believe any of it and they were debating like why you don't fall off the earth is that what's going on if the earth is spinning so fast and we're going so fast through in turn how come we're not just flying off of it when you say debating pain who other dudes that are there with them it's like one of those things where you could find out about gravity you just do a google search and you know read some papers about how how mass works and you know how it works in space and what gravity is and what causes the force of gravity to talk it's all they've done experiments for hundreds of hours fake news to coordinate you know I think he's enjoying himself I think half the fun we don't think it really believes it but then he does but half the reason why he believes is because he's enjoying himself like he's like he's he's spicing up life with these wacky conspiracies like everything's goddamn everything nothin you never hear Eddie like look at something that's in the news and go wow that's probably we're just looking into it too much everything a unit Chester was Bennington the Lincoln Park guys like you know about that right like I don't I don't man I def definitely don't well the problem with that one is man like the guy's dead if he killed himself he's got kids and a family got six kids missed a road you know six kids that's a hard one tough pill to swallow yeah but also I think you need people like Eddie in this world I want I like that he's in the world like I don't want everyone to agree with all the news oh well I think it's fun to a certain point but that's one of the reasons why and he says did jujitsu genius it's cuz he marches to the beat of his own drummer I mean he really does he has like ideas in his head and then he's just like we're gonna make this fucking work but when you say drum it's not like your standard drum it's like a starship drum and there's that bailing of seven arms banging it while we're not sure if the eclipse is a real NASA I [Laughter] enjoy it Kalen it drives them nuts but I'm like I want colorful people in the world man how is almost as silly in the other direction Coran never believes anything is a conspiracy ever he thinks Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and he'll tell you about actually you should read Vincent Blio she's booked like yeah I have it sucks you didn't read it then I feel like we're in the middle you know yeah yeah like I'm like I could see that right no like I get it like I'll entertain it but - until we touch start time I throw this flat dime out any shit that doesn't really involve me where I don't either have a stake in it or I don't actually know what happened I don't have a dog in that fight either both sides yeah and I'll swing back and forth in my own head like I'm I don't convince myself my own self I like to say something I'll go very probably wrong about that yeah and then I'll start arguing against myself dude is well what about this dude I was convinced that Bigfoot was actually real for like 20 minutes just like you fuck not lately you've been a long time ago yes oh my I was watching the video of Bigfoot like the famous video and I was like what if Bigfoot's real and I'm just an asshole like what if this whole time I've been saying it's fake its fake meanwhile it's not fake and that poor guy actually captured on film the poor guy but see if if you sent me with a Bigfoot expert I'm not so closed-minded I'm just gonna shut him down I'm listening to it then like maybe till you realize there are no Bigfoot experts every Bigfoot expert you meet is kind of a lone it's full of shit I love them super nice guys but when you get like deep and I'm I had one dude on the podcast tell me he would cut his pinky off to find out if Sasquatch is real he's a grown man like I had a guy who wanted to follow the Eclipse through all the the states like drive with it he flew in dick before after you put the sunglasses on see that's why I said he's the guy the maintenance guy around my house tell him get the fucked out I can't have you around my kid but it's odd stuff over and over and over again the to the clips over these glasses I could look at a picture of the Eclipse and go I get it yep no I'm good I'm fucking good I'm good and then he's saying the next one's in like 24 years in Dallas okay I'll be there see ya I'll meet you there bro talk to you then okay he's like I'm gonna buy property on there and rent it out come up for the one fucking day - terrible business a super smart plan for one day - one day now fucking clean up you make those $100 you gonna kill it bro how much property you buy invitin price charge him double like we need it what they just gonna stand outside your house with glasses I'm going to get back in their car go yeah I was done that's it they don't need to stay the night for that and this is all in the Sun like is it the summertime summertime to dowse is like summertime on the Sun miserable so you might as well be living on the Sun summertime in downs like 185 degrees you go outside you burst into flames no one's gonna stand say you're fucking stupid house with those weird signs the only thing is who's crazier is that guy who follows the Eclipse oh he's boring as fuck but at least the Eclipse is real or a guy like any problem believes in Bigfoot flatters conspiracy theories Eddie's funnier different no I'm not saying Eddie like I love it Eddie's funny however I'm saying who's crazier yes good good question what do you think's crazy I don't know to pay the case-by-case you know like do you believe in ghosts no I'm gonna say it's right now but you chase big fun no you believe in ghosts Jamie no oh you're open to that yeah see if I'm ready right now go when you said you thinks I'd go look into it one of the guys I had on my podcast is named Rupert Sheldrake and he has a very compelling thought he thinks that everything has a memory that memory is not just a function of like your neurons and your brains your cells because here's the thing you have memories from the time we you were a child right from the time of your little kid sure almost every cell in your body regenerates every seven years where's those where those memories being stored like where are they in the neurons like where are your memories that you definitely have of your childhood or are those memories not really your memories anymore is it you remember having those memories so you have sort of like a rehashed version of it that you put put in your head and sort of almost like retelling yourself a story you know I'm saying yeah so you don't like there's a lot of shit that I know happened when I was in high school but quite honestly I don't really have a good memory of it but does that tell you the fact is that just a function of the human brain where I can't remember so much data because we only use what seven would they say that's not true that's that seven percent of the brain is something that people repeat over and over again I was in that movie Lucy it's a myth is it yes absolutely you there's different parts your brain that are responsible for different things frontal lobe all this there's not seven percent we use your brain you use your whole brain but why do some people's brain so I mean some people's brains like you know they can remember to tea when they were a kid like all these memories and there's some people is don't tell you about better memories for sure my memories are pretty good for facts pretty good I'm just being I mean I remember oh don't don't get me wrong so go there maybe stop smoking weed you can remember high school I remember massive amounts of data from school yeah what I'm saying is I don't have a real memory of it like I can remember getting laid in high school right I can remember when it happened the events yeah yeah you remember you remember scary events you remember happy events you remember sad events you remember big moments big explosions in your consciousness we say your brains you're designed to remember like negative things more so than positive things oh yeah for sure just give the dying yes yeah do what are you gonna remember positive things all day and pat yourself on the back being awesome hit in the head by a rock yeah something to eat you I think I think what we think as a memory we'd like to think of a memory like look I've got a memory of that fight I've got a memory of that combination that landed I got a memory of Stefan Struve crumpling up I see it pretty clear right now right but even right now it's sort of like a little shitty slide show even right now cuz you don't see it clearly but you also don't care I'm gonna walk out of here and I won't remember anything about really I know but it's just lost but it just happen just it's not important to me sorry I don't treat I don't store it away whereas certain stuff like my sadder my big appointment on Tuesday but you know I remember that stuff yeah no I get it I remember a lot of like I remember flashes of things me too and this is weird coming from me because I have a very good memory on paper if you think of the amount of things that I can recall during a podcast the amount of fights that I can recall during broadcasts and in the middle of a fight and all the different martial arts moves I have in my head and who used them against who and where and what but that's that's a different thing those are stats knowledge and statistics numbers numbers in memory and I and I have and I remember certain clips of it but as far as like my own life like I did two sets last night killed don't remember any of it we - hi dad it might be a problem but here's the other here's the other thing what is this highly superior autobiographical memory the detailed recollection of events that occur in the distant past hmm Marilu Henner has oh yes she's got it crazy she's she can tell you you could say February 22nd and she can go in February 22nd 1978 she go that was a Tuesday it's like rain yeah it's brilliant most people tell you that was president you know what's weird is like there's certain things when people go remember we did this my god not really but then something will trigger like a smell or a song and then it comes pull the mail boom find the file on the bear it is like you're in your closet digging around yeah I got a box yeah yeah yeah you see like some pictures yes like whoa but I smell a sense I'm gonna say something some for a movie like I remember I was that yeah that's why it's really dangerous to convict people based on witness testimony if they see a crime people they don't really remember things right and I'm sure the you know the night before like God will remember this and got he is a man when they create this narrative that they wish they'd want to see make things real and also a part of it there's a real problem if it was traumatic what is this remembering a crime that you didn't commit there's people that can plant false memories and in their own head not in their own head and when they're trying to get false convictions and whatnot that makes sense because the pressure of being interrogated is crazy for people well I'll get to making a murder homeboy oh yeah kid I think he got out Brendan he fucked the Brendan name but Brendan Dassey be just a lot of people that are not convinced that making a murderer was correct there's a lot of houses on vince that it was biased it was biased in the way of making that guy look like he was innocent i i've heard the same thing he was good for the documentary like he's innocent when we look into it he's a bad terrible person could have very well have been guilty and they framed them that's possible - it's like the mark fuhrman oj thing like people think that mark Fuhrman planted those gloves on Oh Jay but who doesn't think OJ's guilty but that wasn't who thinks OJ is innocent let me know well I live in this little neighborhood so I do a Simpson but that Mark Fuhrman out just for the defense to paint that or the prosecution right paint that narrative to maybe put that seat in everyone's head but everyone knows was fuckin oj did yeah but he planted evidence you know like doing that doing that alone sneaky shit yeah most people think Oh Jay did it there's a few people thinking like are the crazy ones like oj son did it or something like that I'm like why I'm so bald even though Jeff stuff anything he does I watch it but like I said my brother my college I went god I wish I really knew the truth about hojae and my brothers are you shitting me like we all know the truth man yeah but people put all these different stories out there where you're like God maybe he didn't do it but I just wanna know for a fact like that like what how did it really go down do you think he's ever going to come out like listen no no I don't think you did I don't think he necessarily remembers anymore you think he's just in a frenzy I think it's entirely possible that he's a sociopath and a narcissist with brain trauma yeah little brain trauma and I think that a lot of times narcissists and sociopaths like to that degree like he's just charming the world hey I'm OJ since I'm a good guy yeah I've always been a good guy yeah basically live a conflict free life yeah I just want to go be with my family sounds like oh man he's got a weird thing going on man like he's trying to paint this image all day long with him being a good guy meanwhile he's got these demons know his dad was gay I said that's why it would be like a lot of like you so upset about that see I don't trust that guy I watched that thing when he gave that uh yeah he's like snapped at the judge yeah it was super weird he definitely shouldn't do that when you're trying to get upset about summer ended him on something he's like I said I wasn't there or something yeah yeah forget what it what it was like that Las Vegas room definitely didn't handle it well whoo look man when you're a man and you're locked up with other men you know as prisoners all day long forever it's just it's a horrific existence it's amazing that he was able to get through it at all and then still pull off that kind of charm and not can only suicide yeah they said he was killing it in there like he was the prime example of a prisoner and was like she started organized in church groups and like feeding everyone's lunches and like she was cool Wow well you find meaning in that shit I wonder if he like has a good deep what's going on Chloe's dad yeah a lot of people think he's closed up get the fuck out of here what Chloe's not half black yeah they just don't love black guy thing is that what it is hmm some people do and you know OJ was super close with strong rumor kardashian strong rumor is strong rumor no one be surprised i would my point was like what kind of memory of the event okay we both agree he did it right so if he did it what kind of memory does he have do you remember sticking the knife in them you remember that traumatic defender i wonder i wonder i wonder if your sociopath and i'm wonder if you've been telling people for all these years that you're innocent oh you man trying to find the real killer I'm trying to get out and find the real killer every with all not once did he bring up the real killer I'm trying to find my wife's killer the reason why I mean he never said that during like any of the parole thing when he can't wanted to mount it out oh no not on this the wife's killer yeah never on this someone killed my wife that ships say it was not me I'm being tried for it I'm being unjustly accused you just say the case that I lost he came out of the book if I did it yeah he was going to but he didn't release that book I thought he did know all the proceeds went to the the gold no um I believe I'm pretty sure that the publishing company backed out of that probably smart on their part yeah you can't do that dude I will you have him on the podcast I don't know if he would do it but if he did do it yeah Yeah right yeah after our mom yeah I did it that's a bad oh that's right if I did it in the I by OJ Simpson Jesus Christ that's that still I thought they pulled that confessions of the killer in all caps well there are Goldman Kim Goldman that's how it happened they had to they're the money but and did he really write the full story there what are the rights to them yeah because double jeopardy right can't be tried for you money off the crime is sort of what it is yeah how much money did and also they have a civil case against him how much money you think he made off that book God you don't make that much money off books unless you're just fucking you do feel like Bill O'Reilly JK Rollins or some shit yeah if you're writing books to like old people read yeah they buy a lot of books if I did it we kind of know how you do it if he did it so now we need to read the blue knife yes dad both of them go to Chicago call the lawyers come back come back act dumb yeah Kardashian helps me out rinse repeat so many books they sold I gotta think it was not much I didn't know it was out and I'm all about this he got some sort of a crazy settlement right I was like at 35 million dollar settlement 33 million but how much has he been paid I see no his um Ron Goldman sister really yeah what do you how'd you know her she worked on on something that I did she was very nice very cool check Brian ran into the dad in Phoenix selling men's shirts wasn't the big pause and I was trying to think what his selling but I remarried sell like men's golf shirts or some shit like the struggle is real for Ron Goldman you know like game over you lose a child and it goes down like that just just hard to believe that that guy is now gonna get out what do you do I mean you only got a certain amount of time left on this planet I probably don't I pray yeah hammer be tough to get out he's still pretty athletic and black so I probably get a gun when he gets out drive down to Florida where if he comes back to Brentwood he's gonna make it super easy on you in prosciutto mmm could be headed to reality that's what I called oh I watching that documentary about him I completely forgot about all the weird stuff he was doing before he did go to jail oh no in Vegas where you had I didn't even know about it seeing on the documentary shows everything I did a rap yeah he had a rap rap murdered his wife oh yes before he went to jail in like 2005 or so I'm innocent just like the ghost is lives you guys I'm innocent yeah we're gonna get pulled off YouTube for the OJ Simpson oh wait look at this oh my god wait a minute we got to play this let's ride let's ride this give us some fun oh my god [Music] these girls hose America's Most Wanted this is crazy he's

people in Houston I felt super good about that man that made me feel really good yeah did you see that they were saying there's like no looting or anything going on like he's coming around helping each other would be easy to loot Texas motherfucker they got guns you know they got a whole lot of guns that was the wrong place to loot but everyone has guns even the criminals you know I'm saying so you could get away with some shit but they're saying everyone just gather around helping each other out which is cool that's good you know I think Texas has a good sort of pride in - Texas yeah and they're being Texans is important to them is it's very different than any other state California is very different in the state - I mean it's got its own every state sort of has its own vibe New York obviously has its own vibe the man Texas has its own vibe to the point where it's almost another country I agree like like Texas like if you meet some from Texas they want you know me from Texas Florida's not like that no you don't see people from Miami super prideful or fucking Fort Lauderdale no no it's different but New York they are Boston they are do you LA they all of them don't have it like Texas does Texas everything is Lone Star another Lone Star BBQ Lone Star this Texas that for Texas truck unless plates a Texas truck Amanda different it's different it's Texas football they were they were Republic forever like they're barely a state like they were like one of the only states that like have this argument that they could leave the country they could they leave the Union and it's also a weird state that they have these giant ass ranches like Texas has he's like eighty thousand hundred thousand you look gigantic acre ranches it's cool well it's weird it's like they're all

that I could live outside of California that would be like super happy Texas Austin yeah Austin Texas anyway like Texas Dallas although it gets hot but I could definitely live in Austin which shows there I did a show in Houston and Dallas never I haven't been Austin yet you gotta do cap city comedy club I know it's the shit it's amazing you'd love it I love Austin the next level people - Austin's next level great food - fucking phenomena with you you don't know la brie takes you all over at the best Thai food in my life in Austin strong worked I know right the best ever ever that's Aubrey about it just some good shit right over here on Ventura really love Thai food flan oh wow oh it's weird know what ties made it all though I mean like they guess they're everywhere but like you

to sushi it's the white dudes fucking see you yeah white dudes there's a lot of like white people getting into the Mexican food game makes food gay I'm not mad at you you can make some good Mexican food but better hide in the kitchen keep up this illusion I glue and put the Nexen in front I want that shit police have a lot of Mexicans working at it police in Columbus when I was going there no they switched in there like that I think McDonald's bottom they fucked up and then they bought it back right yeah how good is to pull everyone even though people getting sick in that case so I heard it's delicious I haven't tried it listen okay me I get two orders of guacamole and I get one them rice bowls shake preach and I'm eating fairly Kido without eating all the rice if I just eat mostly the meat and the guacamole which is fantastic and in Quito there you get the fajita veggies for the bed and then you double me you do all the salsas double guacamole delicious do I feel good about it me too man so I'm bad man for fast food it's about as good as you're gonna get I agree yeah Thai food they say to a certain point can be healthy too it's like real tile the noodles and stuff that's in Aikido but no not Kido but rice noodles man I'm I I'm struggling with Kido I drift in and out my pasta is just so strong I go back to it though you know the thing that knocks me back on course though is those ketones man she does ketones taking that key genic stuff that's the big one cuz it's so easy for me I take it when I workout in the morning I know I get before they see anything but no yet homeboy like dr. kita on your show he was saying really it's gonna take about it how long - a year 18 months some shit stinky totally completely adapted it was discouraging off the charts crazy though I mean with with kita crazy crazy smart crazy a lot of people disagree with him I'd like to get those people on with him that he was so smart ago performance and he was like do you like to stay in Quito and if you're trying to go in ki Tony listen that podcast imma fuck her so discouraging he's like give me about 12 to 18 months before anything happens and I was like you lose weight fast weight you know what the thing that gets me the most that I found was when my body became fat adaptive right I switched over the thing that I could tell for sure was that my appetite was not crazy in the middle of the afternoon I don't have the ups and down no I'm stand down right now I went off it and I'm doing pesto and more carbs and I'm fucking starving now why pescetarian why fish just try mixing it up like how does it feel oh alright just alright alright it gets a little challenging like ate so much Sam and in tune you know yeah be careful with mercury levels I know I know with the tuna especially yeah Sam not so much weakly of sardines oysters scallops it gets a little challenging a lot of salads how long you been doing it now 2 weeks 3 weeks are you trying to get leaner like you're just trying to try it out I just try and get leaner mmm and just mix it up to that I know keto works but again like after listening to homeboy on the podcast like shit unless I'm like all the way in for 18 months yeah well I think he's talking about all the benefits you know he's talking about like there's real serious metabolic benefits to be gained from staying with it for long periods of time but I think that's probably the case but food is something else too there's a lot of pleasure with food you know like there's something to be said about enjoying life and I think you should eat hell I follow what I call the 80/20 principle where 80% of the time I eat really good preach and then 20% time I'll fuck off me too Monday through Friday I'm good man then Sunday if I'm with my fam or like went to Universal on Thursday I had a bunch of chicken tenders yes I also work out like a fucking demons every day that every day yes so I don't stay fat yeah yeah but I thought just like a little is on you right now in that the cheese and the meat oh you're not feeling when you take a big bite of fucking heavy sauce cheese lasagna like my mouth is hot you know what fucks me up and then what gets me we're just talking shit about advertisements on Domino's when's the last time you had a hot Domino's Pizza Domino's Pizza they always have in the back if they can get it at a UFC or say they just

a different level the bread is different they have heirloom wheat their wheat is older wheat it sweet like our wheat used to be before we started fucking with it to make it more durable to make it survive pesticides to make it last longer and to give more yield like if you have an acre of land and you grow this heirloom wheat you will have a smaller yield then you have an acre of our news of better quality yeah it's sort of like the same thing like can you see tomatoes in the store and they're big and they're fucking pail of shit yeah they bounce whereas you get an heirloom tomato they're only good for like a couple of days and then they start to rot but when you catch them they're fresh ah yeah I'm like a fruit they're the best they're fantastic it was the best pizza ever phenomenal phenomenal pizza phenomenal pasta and you can buy the pasta so the thing is like their pasta is available in the United States you got to order it from like amazon.com but I think it's called double o

mouth is everything looks like double zeros but it could be well a lot of people use zero in terms I mean you like a fettuccine alfredo I don't I don't fuck with that stuff I like red sauce I'm not a white sauce guy I think it's like white people foods like mayonnaise double zero yeah double zero pasta typically milled in Italy where a Miller's grade their flour using a zero rating a single zero
