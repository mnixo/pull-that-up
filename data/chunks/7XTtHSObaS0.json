to eat healthy foods and they need strength and fitness equipment strength and conditioning equipment like the stuff that we sell at on accom we're going to have to hook up Cameron Haynes with a zombie kettlebell when he's out there shooting elk with his bow you got to prepare for the apocalypse because shit could go down if you've never seen the zombie kettlebells at audit comm they're essentially just like normal kettlebells but we had an artist named Steven Shubin jr. if you look up the big screen you can see those design these cool faces they're also 3d mapped and balanced so they work just like a regular kettlebell they're not just beautiful they're actual functional actually functional we have the zombie kettlebells we have chimpanzee kettlebells the primal kettlebells which are all the great apes we have chimpanzees orangutans chimps and we even have a gorilla and a howler monkey the gorilla is my favorite though because like my friend Cameron Haynes I'm an extremist and I feel like if 70 pounds is the biggest one we sell that's the one I'm working out with bitch okay because I'm a manly man that's what I do alright we said we have all kinds of shit that benefits you at on accom what we call on accom is a human optimization website so whatever we find that works great and it's good for your health we sell it even soap we have defense soap that we sell which is a lot of people there's a lot of confusion when it comes to antibacterial soap antibacterial soap is kind of sketchy like if you use it and you're in a hospital and you're about to perform surgery that's one thing but if you use that stuff on your body the problem is that your body has natural flora there's natural bacteria on your body that you actually want to preserve that's why it's good to eat probiotics things like acidophilus actually promote healthy bacteria both in your gut and in your skin and defense soap is another way to do that defense soap is my friend guy who owns the company created this because he is a grappler and he has been involved in wrestling his whole life and when you have a lot of jiu-jitsu guys or wrestling guys or MMA guys they get a lot of skin rashes whether it's some skin conditions whether it's staph infection or whether it's sometimes we get I've gotten ringworm from jiu-jitsu you can get a lot of this mat herpes really you and a lot of that is can be prevented from hygiene and that harsh antibacterial soap actually can make it you more susceptible these things because it it actually kills the good bacteria as well as the bad bacteria but with defense so but he's figured out is to use tea tree oil and eucalyptus and all natural ingredients that promote healthy bacteria and and kill the bad bacteria it's really good stuff and it smells good and it's it's it's a healthy natural soap for your body just one more thing that we sell at onna calm just like the hemp protein powder which by the way will not have to answer this I don't know how many times but will not make you test positive at work okay if you work for UPS and you're worried about piss and hot you don't have to worry about it hemp is actually not psychoactive and the recent farm bill that just got passed it looks like we're gonna be able to grow hemp in America finally we've been selling hemp a tonic calm for the longest time but we've had to buy it from Canada which is so crazy that means that American farmers have not been able to make a grow a crop that it's a natural plant it's not psychoactive it's not a drug but because it's related to a drug it's been illegal finally people are realizing how absolutely ridiculous that is because we've been able to sell it but we have to buy it from Canada so it's great for my friends up in Canada that are farmers it's great for the Canadian farmers but it is absolutely ridiculous that American farmers are not able to grow HAP finally we're going to start being able to do that there I guess it's going to start at universities and in places where it's legal statewide and then I'm sure that this wave seems to be spreading and it's going to eventually go through the entire country because there's no reason to stop it it's not drug we're not talking even about marijuana which of course I think should be legal anyway but what this is is just the hemp and it makes a fine protein powder one of the very best protein powders very easily digestible has amino al the amino acids in it it's it's got healthy fats in it and we sell it at on a comm as well as well as hemp force bars which are hemp protein in bar form which is great when you're out there hiking in the mountains cameron haines and you need some snacks we'll give you some hemp force bars keeping your backpack so you stay healthy use a codeword rogen and save 10% off any and all supplements that's onn i t-dot-com Aubrey Marcus will be here tomorrow actually we're going to do a podcast with Aubrey we're going to talk about all the latest developments that on it but until then today we have Cameron Hayes master bowhunter all-around badass cue the music whenever you're ready Jamie it's you forgot the volume you fuck you fucked it up at least it's not oh the computer did it Lise it's not live yeah ha ha ha do you know how to do it or we done show's over yeah ok [Music] it wouldn't be the same if everything came out smooth well Cameron first of all thanks for doing this podcast for people who don't know Cameron Cameron Haynes is a famous bow hunter which is a rare thing it's very rare that someone becomes famous as a bow hunter and in the most manly form of bow hunting ever you're famous for shooting the biggest most majestic North American animals with sticks that's right I mean that's what you're famous for your famous for taking out giant bugling elk with a flying stick that's pretty badass I wouldn't say famous let's you're famous to me you're famous I told a friend of mine who's a hunting fan he's a personal trainer and I said I'm doing his podcast with Cameron Ames he goes oh that's that keep hammering guy it's it dude like okay one other got you and one other guy you are famous we're hunters yeah so there's three I brought you up to my friend Ryan Callahan who works at first light and he said oh yeah I know who that guy is yeah so people know he wore man okay you have become at least can I say you have notoriety okay yeah I'd say that okay so notoriety from killing elk with with flying sticks that's it yeah how does one go about becoming famous or at least you develop internet notoriety from killing elk with flying sticks um you know I think for me it's just I don't know I just came up just like everybody else so it's like so what I've done kind of gives other people that didn't have any brakes or just regular guys hope to chase our dreams I really think that's it I think that's why people like me well I'll tell you how I found out about you um I watched a lot of videos on YouTube online whether it's uh weather videos about anything that I find interesting and I saw this video this guy carrying rocks in his backpack going up hills training for elk hunting and I was like what what is that and I thought about I was like that actually is a pretty smart move like I've never heard of anybody training for hunting so I went hunting when I shot that mule deer with Steve Rinella that was the the first time everyone hunting and I would amazing how tired I was yeah I was like this is ridiculous like I thought I was in really good shape but when you're climbing up those muddy hills and the Missouri Breaks and everything's like sloshing and it's you know these steep hills and you know you're doing it for six hours in a row like then you get exhausted yeah your legs get rubber your lungs are burning I was like I can't believe this I was thinking I need to work out for hunting and I never heard of anybody doing that before until I saw you right well it you know like elk hunting you can get up it sometimes 5:00 in the morning to get to where maybe you put some elk to bed the night before and walk so an hour before daylight then you're hunting all day and then you get back to camp after dark maybe at eight or nine o'clock that's a long day and that's a long day people aren't used to doing that I mean how often do you work out for 15 hours a day not only that like you if you shoot an elk then you have to take that elk back and you have to figure out how to carry it through the mountains like that's where it gets really crazy because like what's the biggest elk you've ever shot um is probably a Roosevelt Bowl I killed in Oregon in 2010 and we're figuring it weighed about 1,200 pounds is 12 or 13 years old that's a big animal I was huge woah how long did it take you to carry 1,200 I mean on that's on the bone so once you quarter it and skinned it and take the head off of it and the antlers how much is it how much you carry it out about 500 pounds you know we had it quartered up and then with the hide because I wanted to get a mounted in the head and all that so we had to carry about 500 pounds but I had a few guys with me so you know made it a little easier yeah I guess you have to bring like a pack crew yeah yeah now they're big animals and that's just that's part of it but that's you know when you can go into the mountains where an elk lives every day and and it's like you said with sharp stick take it out harvest it and then so you you're on its home court and then bring it back to your truck and back to your freezer that's that's a powerful experience you know that's the whole the whole thing is hard everything about it is hard but to be able to do that I mean it's given me confidence know that in whatever everyday life I can achieve things you know because that's about as tough as it gets for me yeah I've always said that adversity is a very important thing for human beings because if you don't go through adversity you never know that you can there's always going to be questions and every time you do go through adversity it sort of adds on to your ability and your confidence in all walks of life it's like this tattoo that I have is Miyamoto Musashi the guy who wrote the book of five rings and when I was a kid and I was a competing in martial arts tournaments I read the book of five rings and I remember this one quote once you understand the way broadly you can see it in all things and once you've gone through the kind of adversity that you must go through to you know hike nine miles into a mountain shoot an elk and then bring that giant beast back and then cook it like God is a that is you you will develop confidence and you'll develop a sense of accomplishment that's very difficult to recreate yeah and that's to do that I know how difficult that is and so in training I try to simulate that as much as possible yeah I mean that's where the carrying 130 pound rock up the hill or you know for training I've run 100-mile ultramarathon you know that type of thing basically I just want to I want to simulate that misery because I want to know what being miserable feels like if you don't ever know you never know how you're going to react some people might fold up quit but uh so I try to get there and as often as possible how did you why did you decide a rock why not like weights well you can measure weights to try to just go with the rock because it's even more primal uh-huh I don't know I just I had been seeing this rock you know I run this mountain all the time so I've been seeing this rock and uh I was like I need to get that rock to the top of the hill and so I did this seminar at Cabela's and I said hey anybody who wants to come up I'm going to go run the mountain cuz everybody knows I run this mountain so they came in for the Cabela's seminar then I told him I said if you run the mountain I'll give you a free DVD just come hey I just like to work out with people just you know I like to see people people sacrificing so I said I'm going to carry this rock up and we can all go do it and I figured it'd mean the rock I figured about 70 pounds I had no idea but so I get up there I had this empty pack and I have everybody there I'm like alright just hang out hang on for a sec I'm just gonna throw this rock on my pack and I like lifts at first time I'd ever touched it and I was like wow this is more than 70 pounds and so I ended up getting it up to the top and then we tried to take pictures trying to I couldn't even lift that thing over my head because a rock is just weird to lift and so I ended up taking it down off the mountain I'm like obviously it's more than 70 I want to figure out how much it is so it was 130 pounds but but it was just kind of on a whim I guess is how that came about now I just know it's just my rock now it's your workout rock it is you know you allow to just pull rocks out of the forest is there any regulations about that I may have poached that rock no it's still there it's I just carry it up and down I never take it I took it to the gym to weigh it but it's back it's up on the mound right now okay so what would you do if you came there and you saw somebody else throw that rock in their backpack you're like hey man there was gonna do somebody did I think they you know had seen the rock talked about so and I said hey you know people people kind of quit you know people questioned everything for whatever reason sure and so they say oh that's not 130 pounds on my table here it is go pack it to wherever you want weigh it so somebody did move it like 20 yards and I did notice that but other than that it just kind of sits wherever I leave it that well if it's heavy enough that's good that nobody'll steal it or most people won't steal it I should say obviously I don't think they can steal it now when you take that rock up to the top of the mountain how often you do this I do it about once a week once a week yeah that's kind of Wow I mix it up and that's what my once a week type something different other than that I usually just run the mountain so once a week once every seven days you carry that how far you carrying it it's a mile and a half geez yes oh yeah that hurts my lower back just thinking about I am me too oh is that is there any danger of like doing that's like some serious weight that you're carrying on your back like that it's an awkward way to carry weight yeah do it like once a week yeah I try to think I'm bulletproof but I've found out that I'm and so yeah and that's it yeah that's the trail right there so about Hill with the rock that's some serious work like the amount of actual physical kinetic work that you have to do to go up a hill with a hundred and thirty pound rock on your back like that like man that's got to get you in some insane shape no it helps you know I mean it's just everything helps mixing it up I do a lot of different things but that's just one of them now was this something that you had always done and then when you got into hunting you just sort of ramped it up or did you did you like really get into fitness once you became a hunter that's another shirt I have you know ramped it up oh really is it really yeah it is oh no kidding but uh no let's see so I started bow hunting I was just a teenager and it was I ended up killing a spike bowl out my very first year I think it was 18 or 19 and that was you know to kill a bull with the bow where I came from a real small town I mean 20-some kids my graduating class and so a lot of people hunted but to kill a bull with a bow was like special and so I got attention for that I was like this is some positive reinforcement I'm like you know this after high school after the high school sports and all that and trying to find my way trying to figure out what the heck I was going to do and so I liked hunting I like the challenge of it I got some positive reinforcement from it so I'm like hey this is pretty cool because I didn't hardly know anybody who'd killed a bull with a bow back then and so I was successful but from there I just wanted more wanted more of a challenge and then you know I started to going into the wilderness into the Oregon's biggest wilderness ego cap wilderness it's 375 thousand acres and so you can get back in there away from people and I thought well now I want to go to the middle of this wilderness because that would be even more badass and if I could kill a bull back there man that would be the ultimate and so it was just kind of from there I realized how the physical part of bow hunting where where it you know was more important and so I just is kind of a progression you know I've always always ran 10ks and different things like that but I figured man you can't be in too good a shape to to challenge that country and so I just you know I've never I haven't reached my limit and I'm trying to to try to become what I always say is the ultimate predator so it becomes a part of like your your whole psyche it becomes a part of like what you're doing with your life and becomes that the challenge of it becomes almost as important as what you're doing itself like you're not just going out and getting it out for me you know which I'm sure you enjoy elk meat yeah but it's also it's it's almost sort of like a spiritual quest oh yeah I mean the you know the most powerful moments I've had have been in the mountains in the wilderness after killing a bull because everything that goes into it you know it's not just the fact that I killed an animal it's a it's how much I respect animal how tough the country is by all the training it's just accumulation of all that work and all that investment of emotion and everything else and so that's yeah it is it's spiritual I mean by yourself back there as as raw as it gets it's tough and eating the animal that you've killed for I just started hunting I've been only been hunting a little over a year year and a half and for me the most delicious meals the most satisfying meals I've ever had is venison that I that I've killed myself if there's something it's something intimate about it I guess something but you're much more attached to what you're what you're eating mm-hmm and you know I've never killed anything with a bone much less a 1,200 pound bull elk with a bow in the middle of the woods I mean that's got to ramp it up another notch oh yeah it's amazing because you're shooting something with a rifle you know I shot that mule deer from 200 yards away that's pretty far yeah you know you're shooting these animals 30 40 yards away from you and you're and they're huge yeah now they're I mean they don't commit suicide there they are you know they're used to lions they're used to being hunted so to get into Bo Ranger you know in the redzone so to speak you know that 32 yards that's difficult they're dialed in they're used to being hunted every single day I mean they're they're never turned off and so yeah it's tough and then you have just basically a sharp stick you know one arrow got the arrows laying over there and it's just it's amazing how lethal with the razor-sharp broad head and arrow can be and I've seen you know there's videos of huge bulls I've killed dropping in seconds just from that you know quicker even than maybe a rifle would kill them and that's a you know that's pretty amazing but that is pretty amazing well one of the things about you is because of all your training because of all this lifting and exercise that you do you shoot a really heavy bow you shoot a 90 pound compound bow which for folks who don't know like a lot of people still it'll tell you like you don't need to shoot anything more than 60 mm-hmm but 90 I've never even heard of anybody shooting in 90 I never even pulled one until I pulled yours I mean that's ridiculously I mean that's pretty stout yeah so you're you're sort of like adding to like this whole reason why year you're exercising and all this fitness and getting you know really strong and in really great shape you're you had kind of have to be in great shape just to use the very weapon that used to take these animals out yeah well and it is true you don't you don't necessarily have to shoot 90 pounds I mean people do kill there's women out there bow hunting who are very successful with the 50 pound bow it's true you can do it but you know I want to shoot 90 I what I want on an animal is I want two holes I want that arrow blowing through so I have two but two holes spilling blood that's how I'm going to recover the animal you know an arrow kills from hemorrhage so not from shock like a like a rifle would so to get that hemorrhage whereas a 50-pound bow my going half way and it might get into lungs and it might kill it you know you might get 12 inches of penetration if I go clear through that bowl and it's you know maybe 24 inches across well there's a 24 inch wound as opposed to 12 inch wound and killing by hemorrhage and so it's just going to be that much more lethal in my mind and then if I'm blown through ribs or through a shoulder or it's quartern way hard so I have to go through maybe 30 inches of mass I'm going to be able to do that yeah it's not you know it's not necessary so to speak but it's what I'm comfortable with and I think it makes me that more lethal of a bow hunter how many other dudes are shooting 90 pounds I'm not sure is there anybody I don't know prati I'm sure probably one or two yeah I'm sure there's there some well I just pulled it back and I was thinking when I was pulling it back I was like imagine pulling this thing back of you just climbed up the top of a mountain you're absolutely exhausted and then you have this one opportunity to see if you ever had that happen where you know you you're really exhausted to work to get to where the elk is and then you're so tired you have a hard time pulling the ball no no no that's because you train hard right yeah no that's that's never been an issue um no but it's because you prepare yeah the average person I mean 90 pounds is it's really difficult to lift I mean you're essentially you're using two hands sort of but a bulk of the work has got to be in your right arm right yeah I mean it's it's difficult you know what we're I think would be more difficult as if you're sitting in a tree stand for hours freezing and then a buck walks by and you have a 90 pound bow that would be hard yeah that would be because you're not warmed up you're not you know active so that could be difficult but I did use I had that bow for a late season hunt back home and it was cold it was like seven degrees and I've been up there for hours and I'm just like okay this is going to be a test now if I come if I can pull this back and I was able to and so well it's just because you trained so hard yeah no I mean yeah if you if you if I didn't do what I do every day there's no way that's great I mean how many other guys are doing that how many other guys are like in shape and treating this almost like a sport uh there's more you know there's there's more doing it now especially guys out west but you know I get I get emails from Georgia from people it just you know and what I found is it like you talked about earlier it kind of gives your life purpose you know everybody has a job people have families everything else and and they just kind of they need to find something that can define them or motivate them and now sudden training for hunting is something you know before that was you know nobody ever did it so now maybe that is what's making a difference in their life and so you know and I still get people who they don't like it they they don't like feeling like they have to train to hunt and so I get criticized a lot for my approach also and what do they say what are you doing get in shape what are you doing good strong healthy yeah so what kind of criticisms they come up with you know here though yeah it's a it's pretty I don't know if it's funny it's it's been irritating but I just kind of blow it off but has it actually irritated you yeah a little bit you gotta get tougher got away no work on that aspect new training okay I do definitely but they'll say stuff like oh Cameron says you have to be able to run a marathon to kill an elk right which is I've never said that I do that but you don't have to in a or you know I've just I saw something the other day that says oh you know my approach is what's wrong with hunting today say I whoa I didn't being healthy and strong yes I don't not eating sugar not drinking alcohol eating healthy foods and working out yeah you're what's wrong with the world man basically yeah all these healthy fuckers out there ruining it for everybody else I know all these fat guys like to sit in tree stands blow farts they're they're upset guys like you are out there doing something exciting I guess I don't know so anyway yeah I do get I get criticized just because you know hunting in hunting for some people is kind of a just to get away and there's nothing wrong with that you know you want to it's a vacation sure it's not something you want to gear your life around and that's okay I get that you don't you don't have to train every day if all you're looking for is just to get away and relax there's nothing wrong with that in any endeavor whether it's a game or a sport or even martial arts I mean there's nothing wrong with taking a martial art class once a week just for exercise you like my friend Joey Diaz he's he's big he's overweight he takes jiu-jitsu all the time he's not trying to get his black belt he just wants to get get his blood pumping and get a get a little workout there's nothing wrong with that right and I have another friend who's uh his beat and world champions my friend Eddie's uh you know a black belt and like one of the best in the world this is like those both approaches are okay yeah it's okay to be obsessed with something and pursue excellence and it's okay to just enjoy it as a pastime yeah the problem is that the people that enjoy it as a pastime they're always gonna real get this little nagging thing in the back of their head for some of them like especially the weak ones that they realized that you do it better than them or they realize that if they went hunting with you they couldn't keep up or they realize if they ran with you they can't keep up or if they realize they try to live with you they couldn't lift as much so they're like crabs in a bucket you know what crabs in a bucket I like know if you have a bunch of crabs in a bucket one crab tries to get out of the bucket and the other crabs grab them and pull them down gotcha that's what always happens yes just that's the number one problem with the world is crabs in a bucket yeah the number one problem this world is people instead of being inspired they look to criticize people instead of looking at someone who works hard and does something amazing and and looking at their own life they find fault or they find weakness or they find themselves not to add up not to measure up and so they get upset and instead of finding that inspirational and say you know what I do have a belly I do need to get to the gym you know what I do drink too much I got to stop doing that instead of that they just start shitting on this one thing that causes them to feel insecure not even realizing that that one thing has the potential to empower them right now I I don't know I mean it could be what's going on 100 percent those fat fucks it's a hundred percent what's going on it's a hundred percent man I know it because I felt those feelings I felt I've felt insecurities I felt jealousy I felt all that especially as a young man before I figured out how how to train my mind and how to embrace someone who's better than me and embrace someone who inspires me and look for it amongst my peers look for it even amongst my enemies I try to be inspired by people I don't even like you know I tried like if I find someone that I think is like someone who's a bad comedian who's a joke thief who's a but they work hard try to take that aspect of them that works hard and only concentrate on that and find inspiration in it because then they become valuable to me right now then I can see the negative aspect of their behavior and that becomes valuable to me because I realize it reinforces what's bad but then the good aspects of it whatever it is you could find just a something in someone that you don't even like you could find like something that they do that that can inspire you right and you know I don't want to I get mostly all positive and some people inspire me they say that I've helped or motivate them and this and that that inspires me also too it holds me accountable you know what I mean because now I've created this thing and it's what I love but it also holds me accountable like hey I got to keep I got to keep it up for the people ya know what I mean yes and so that's I mean 99% of what I get is positive but it seems like you remember the 1% you gotta train yourself to not do that yeah that's that's mental training mental training as well as physical training but believe me man I've gone through it and I what I say is it's like snake bite venom like when a snake bites you if a snake bites you for the first time you mean you're fucked you're sick you got to go to the hospital yeah in antivenom you you're in a lot of trouble but if you just get a little bit of venom a little bit of venom everyday over time after a while the snake bites you like bitch get out of here shitting hollering yeah you gotta bail up the ability to understand what it is yeah and I feel sorry for people when I just see ridiculous criticism I laugh it like someone will come into my office sometimes like my wife's like what're you laughter my god some guys making fun of me it's is hilarious I just reading what they say about me makes me laugh yeah if if I really thought they were right it would bother me right but if I you know if I have done what I need to do and I've done all the work and I have assessed myself and I'm objective then I can find folly in their weakness right yeah but you're an inspirational dude for sure because you inspired me I saw some of your videos I said I like a guy who's going for things I like a guy who's is not easy to run an ultramarathon it's not easy to take 130 pound rock put it in pack and walk up to the top of the hill when I see people doing stuff like that I get like this is like ramps up inside me and I want to go work out I want to go do something I want to get shit done I think people like you are really important though the type of people that do things like that they they provide energy for countless other people whether you're aware of it or not you know I know that you did to me so I know that I'm not unique in that I know that other people who watch your videos feel the same way they get excited about it and you cause motion you cause you cause effort because of what you've done you get people excited and that inspiration actually causes things to take place yeah whole thing Thanks this is you know it's what I love to do it's and it's just preparing for crunch time basically getting out there and preparing to be the ultimate predator or not not fail when all the pret you know like when we're filming for a TV show there's a lot of pressure these hunts can be expensive you're traveling a long way away from your family there's a lot at stake there's a guy with you who's being paid there's a big investment so I don't want to I don't want to fail when it comes down to that moment not only for me but for other people who sacrifice so that's that's basically what the works about and I think it's cool too that you feel that people are inspired by these things and it actually like motivates you to ramp it up another notch and keep it going even further oh yeah no I don't I haven't hit my ceiling you know I'm trying you better every day just such a badass manly approach to life you know elk hunting with a bow and being an expert at that that's do you have a regular job yeah with a regular job I'm supposed to be at work right now actually oh really you got off you got a good boss you know that they say think I'm sick oh really not they're gonna find out if this is a bad move that no no no um I see I'm a buyer for the local Water and Power Company back home so I've done that for 18 years so you do that 40 hours a week yeah and so how do you find the time to do all this other stuff let's make it happen Wow yeah it's just what I do so uh yeah I mean I you know how it goes I'm sure you've been there before if I don't get my workout in or if I don't do it I'm just in a bad mood you know what I mean is it you know so we just make time to make it happen and just what I do well there's the other part about working out about the bad mood part is that your body sort of develops this this habit of pumping out energy right you know like when you get in shape and you get your body like really fit and you get your body used to exerting these you know these big explosive bursts of energy like lifting or jujitsu or whatever it is your body sort of rec ramps up for that and then it's like hey where's my release right you know hey we're ready to go hey we're ready to go why are we in a fucking office man what's going on here and we're gonna kill something I'm gonna shoot a bow at somebody what's going on why can't I lift weights yeah hey hey this is kind of crazy and you don't have that release and I think our bodies are probably designed for a certain amount of that being that we were you know for who knows how many thousands of years we were hunter-gatherers and we essentially share the same DNA so those human beings that lived thirty forty thousand years ago is not much of a difference between us and them there's got to be a lot of the old reward the the reward mechanisms of life like still in our DNA and I think that people who don't exercise those reward mechanisms you're missing out on a lot of what it is to be a person a lot of what it is to be like excited by life it's um there's something like pretty intense about just fulfilling those reward mechanisms and I think hunting is one of those that I didn't realize until I started hunting I really didn't realize like what an intense connection you're like your your your mom I want to say your spirit but that's at the fuckin that's where that's been hijacked by so many shitheads wearing crystals around their neck yeah but it seems like there's something in you that like it opens up this weird path that like oh you didn't even know this was there mm-hmm this this predator path is path of connection to the animals connection to the wild world going out there and and getting an animal and eating in and I don't even mean it in like a macho look look how cool I am way I really mean it in a spiritual way there's this weird spiritual connection you have to the mother earth when it provides for you to the animals of the wild itself when you go out and you get one and then you you use it for sustenance mm-hmm ya know and that's you know people who think it's just about getting meat like I heard I think you're talking with John hakumen he didn't really understand hunting at all but uh you know did that they think it's it's akin to go into the store and buying a steak it couldn't be further from the truth I mean the exact opposite of that really yeah you're you're getting me and yeah you're eating it but it's the it's a connection it's the it's everything else that's that it's all about that's where the power comes from and uh man without that I don't know I mean that's everything to me that's that's my life you know just gearing up for that is what I do so well I do a lot of exciting things I'm very fortunate person and whether it's stand-up comedy or whether it's working for the UFC the things that I do I truly love doing and they're very exciting things I mean when it when the UFC starts when the fights are going on I never feel like I should be anywhere else like I'm always very excited to be there honey is even more exciting than that yeah the enix it's accessible to everyone wears like not everybody gets to be the commentator for the UFC all right lucky for me I'm the only one or you know there's a couple other guys that do it but I'm not doing it but they're not as good thank you very much appreciate I I think a lot of them are really good but this to me but you know I'm saying it's like that's a job that maybe five people on the planet get to do right as first do commentary for MMA 3 in the UFC but hunting is everybody can do it yeah a lot of people can do it yeah and you that's the other thing that I really like about your approach you go on public land you you you do it in the the National Forest you do it in the areas where they're accessible to all these folks yeah you can get a tag just like everybody else you get your license just like everybody else mmm and you go out there and then you're not like doing on these canned hunts this is uh this is this is really like the American wilderness the entering into yeah and that's you know I have done so I've had guides like when I go someplace where guys required Canada or different places but uh where I basically nee made a name for myself was in the wilderness by myself onto those solo hunts and you know to tell you the truth I was worried I think let's see I wrote an article is either 99 or 2000 I went with my buddy South Cox he's from California here the did you change his name no he's a stud please North Cox is like South two-step yeah what the fuck your parents hate him or something it could calm South Cox its CEO X oh whatever Courtney yeah so uh we went and we both killed good bowls and I killed a buck also and I wrote this article about it in that the photos were awesome the just the whole experience is getting I thought this is going to screw up my hunting because this is public land it's an ego cap wilderness and this is probably the last time this hunting is ever going to be good because people are going to see this and they're going to want to do it and now we're I didn't see anybody for years there's going to be tons of people well next year came around I went back in there there's nobody there and so you know I ended up writing a book about that type of hunting and still nobody was there and the bottom line is yes it's available to everybody but it's very tough and you're near 12 miles from the nearest road and you're living off your back in some of the most unforgiving country there is that's just never easy and so people try it and I've taken I've taken friends back there who who I wanted to love it as much as I do and you know we're back there for a day two days and they're like dude I'm ready to go hahaha and uh I'm like what are you talking about you ready this is this is how this is as good as it gets they're like um this is isn't what I expected is really her ya know and so the thing about it is just because you love it not everybody's going to love it and it's it's something that you can't make them know and so they see the photos they see the they see the animals that are like man that is awesome I want to do that too unless it's in you it's just going to be a struggle and so it isn't it is available but it's it's still tough it's like taking someone who's a rap fan to your favorite country concert mm-hmm and they're like Jesus what's wrong with you and you're like come on man yeah yeah no it's yeah it's got to be it's got to be yeah it's not for everybody well that's the beautiful thing about life there's a lot of choices so much variety there's so many different things that you could be into the you know one of the real problems with life is people want you to be into what they're into right and if you're not into what they're into there's something wrong with you or they're not into what you're into there's something wrong with you right yeah but the thing about that is I don't need anybody to be into it so I was just like so my buddy Roy who I started hunting the wilderness with he moved to Alaska and he's just a stud that what he was my partner we we both like had the same mindset that there's no sacrifice too great we can't be in enough pain it doesn't even matter and he moved so I'm like okay I need to find sighs I tried to find somebody to take and eventually I figured out there's nobody like Roy Roth so I'm just going to quit hunting there or go on my own and so I just was like it's you know it's on my own and so it is that's where I started doing the solo wilderness hunts and you know it's like I said it's a good thing about you don't need anybody else people don't like doing it because you're so far out of your comfort zone we're so distracted with everything that's going on in the regular world that being in the wilderness where there's nothing is overwhelming for a lot of people it's just I mean it's it's difficult mentally yeah just being alone in the wilderness is gotta be like a very rare experience like people freaked the fuck out when they're alone in the wilderness that's a scary thing for them because they worry about getting trapped they worry about getting injured not being able to get out no one's going to be able to find them like if you don't have a satellite phone and a backup satellite phone and a handgun justing there's a little lot of fear involved in being in the actual wild itself yeah and they're they worry about stuff they make up stuff to worry about I mean just it just to give them a way out and so that was a bit and that was that was true for me too I mean it was overwhelming for me I didn't go back in there in the mountains for a 10 day solo hunt right out of the gate I went it for like one night I got went on a scouting trip and then stayed one night and came out and it's just kind of baby steps into it because it's you know if you if you pull you know I don't know how many people there are here in LA but how many people have stayed out overnight in the mountains by themself it's not be very many people I mean it's I don't know five yeah maybe I mean it's it's just not something people do in this day and age and so it's because it's you know it's you're out of your comfort zone but if you can do that and that's what I became good at that and actually then I I loved it now remember let's see it was uh um let me think what I don't know what whatever I can't remember the year but I killed a six by six bull elk by myself and it was my best bull and I got out of the wilderness has a little Toyota four-wheel drive I had this this bull loaded up and I was just so pumped finally got cell service out on the highway and I'm driving home you know I called my wife and I was like I was like hey trace I killed a 6x6 bull and she's like Princess Di died I'm like what she's like princess died died I go who cares I killed a 6x6 bull it was like I you're so you know to everybody else Princess Diana dying was just like you know the world's going to stop but when you're back in the wilderness and you killed a six by six bolo nothing else matters and that's I just remembered that's the difference between living back there where it's just about am I going to find a place to sleep tonight am I going to be warm and we'll have food that's it that's all you care about well we're inundated by information these days we have like constant information coming at us from all around the world seven billion people in the entire planet provides stories so anytime anything happens that's interesting or extraordinary or scary or disgusting you're gonna hear about it and if you just sit in front of your computer like I do some days like some days man I get on Twitter and I just can't stop clicking I'm just like what that's not real oh my god it is real holy shit and I retweet it and and then you know like you you could lose your day your day it doesn't exist what you're doing is just in you're just collecting all this information from around the world but it's not your life your life is just Cameron Haynes left foot right foot left foot right foot what do I see through my eyes yeah we're you know who's around me who where my loved ones then that's your real life that's it but you know he's sitting wondering about whether or not what if when you shot the arrow right as that arrow hit that Bull princess died died that'd be fucked that'd be crazy maybe somehow someway I killed her maybe that's some look the stranger things have happened if you know you believe in those things if you believe in the synchronicities of the world that would be crazy that would be that would be quite quite poetic as if because if your wife's like Princess Di died and you're like yeah I know yeah right through the lung so the double lung she was in the form of an elk she was spiritual elk right she she bugle Dan I I shot one right to the lungs hey she was hot but not not as hot as that bull elk at that moment so as I don't know I don't know yet maybe if that was like it like an 8 by 9 bull elk it could have been her I think you're supposed to say she was hot I think his she was royal she's not really hot she had some royal hotness you think so I think so not my type sounds like she just died I don't think she could get down I thought I thought she was partying when she she died in a car wreck right well she was running away from the press right wasn't it like a paparazzi situation the boyfriend partying yeah she had a boyfriend right yeah was it was that was up she was breaking up Princess Charles and she is her life was in turmoil that makes her hot I cannot my type I'm not into that kind of chick okay she she doesn't seem like she could get down but that's just me I mean all due respect rest in peace missus die yeah that's a thing da man people do really get caught up like my wife tried to tell me some stupid celebrity shit the other day and she's going on about some things can you believe it this said that and that's that I'm like maybe I don't give a fuck I literally don't give zero I give zero Foxley yeah let's stop talking about this time so much shit to talk about but those salacious gossipy things that gets people so interested it becomes so fascinated become overwhelming I'm guilty of it too man somebody put some thread on my message board the other day about uh it's probably bullshit but it might be true that Bill Clinton had an affair with Elizabeth Hurley you see that he man I thought about that shit all day I thought about it all day I kept going back to the thread seeing what would recent what new developments first I got two things out of that first of all Tom Sizemore can't keep a fucking secret whatever you do don't tell Sizemore who you're banging because that motherfucker spills the beans don't trust heroin addicts with the truth that's one thing I'll write that down yeah trust me and the other thing is I think that Bill Clinton is the last of the great American presidential dick slingers does it play boys it ends with him there's no that you can't do that anymore we are going to be reduced to see not that there's anything good about being that guy because obviously he was kind of a creeper you know I mean he Bill Clinton was one of those weird guys that would just like whip it out on girls like if you talked to I didn't talk to but if you read some of the accounts of some of those women that we're like really angry at him from Arkansas he would get alone with them but just whip it out there's him in Hurley for sure he hit that right god damn whoa but that's it we're not gonna have any more of those those guys no no and you're talking about different thing it here's how it affects me so people talk about well Obama did this this or that I'm like okay I have to go to work tomorrow because if I have to go to work tomorrow not much has changed in my life if I don't have to go to work for some reason then I'll start paying attention that's that's how I figure it out well that's a good way to look at your own life that's a good way to manage your own life the problem of course is that this is supposed to be some sort of a community our country supposed to be some big giant community and the people that are running this community that are in charge of dictating the rules and the regulations are clearly screwing it up clearly this is not the optimum way to run any country I don't know if it's possible to optimally run a country with the mess that's been created before the people that got into power in power before before they got into positions of having any control there's probably so much bureaucracy and crazy shit behind the scenes as far as like special interest groups and lobbyists and the massive web is probably so deep you could never hack through it all clean it all up and and come up with some sort of a rational system so you got two options one you could obsess on it and work feverishly until your fucking heart stops beating and then you die an angry person this system sucks woman it pump your heart blows in your chest and you fall down shit your pants and and die in agony or you just live your life saying okay I'm gonna leave that shit to somebody else let them run it yeah and I'm gonna go wandering through the woods with pointy sticks I like your approach better well I think whoever is running the country they do a much better job if they were bowhunters if they had been in the mountains and actually tried to survive and then maybe even killed an animal and and that was took it back to their family I think they'd probably be a better commander-in-chief I think that's probably true I think if they were a martial artist they'd probably a better commander-in-chief I mean I'm not a huge fan of Putin I think Putin is kind of a psycho but I respect the fact that he's a black belt in judo and he is you know he's a real martial artist he sort of carries himself in that way like if Obama and Putin we're gonna throw down Putin would fuck oh bomber up that bothers me that that disturbs me you know I I wish my president could kick a little ass oh nothing it's important thing in the world but opposable he plays basketball which every video clip I've seen a human playing basketball he looks like he sucks at that too so supposedly plays pool and I'll fucking give him the six out in the breaks any time you want to gamble to do it do it Obama come on you got a spot I think um I think that any any like very very difficult thing that anybody does whether it's bow hunting or martial arts or anything where it's incredibly difficult to accomplish something it sort of separates the the people that will quit from the people that figure out a way to succeed and that's really that that overcoming adversity is that's where character comes from and that's what the things that we all admire and that shit's hardwired into us man the admiration of that like just as simple as me watching your video of you carrying that rock up a hill I mean is it important that you carry that rock up a hill in the greater scheme of the universe no it's not but to me it was because to me that day is like this motherfuckers doing some shit that I probably can't do right now and when you see that like makes it like I want to be able to carry that rock up the hill all right well if I'm gonna fucking start out with a 35 pound plate and carry that up the hill I'm gonna work my way up to that big rock and that you know that inspiring each other and the the ability to push yourself to these incredible heights is really one more exciting aspects of being a person it's one of the things that makes being a man or a woman I mean I guess being a woman I'm not a woman so I don't know I thought about it sometimes what if you like but it makes it it makes it gives you thrills it gives you excitement it gives you like these these feelings of accomplishment when you achieve things they're they're some of the greatest moments in life and I feel bad for people that have never stuck their neck out I feel bad for people that have never taken chances not because they're less because they're not less they're just they haven't reached their potential it's not that their potential is less I feel like probably inside all of us we all have the potential for greatness in one way or another as long as have any obvious physical problems we didn't get Delta a terrible genetic hand of cards and with a disease or something like that but if you don't have that I think all of us have potential we just did I feel bad for people who don't at least attempt to reach a potential in some way yeah and that's you know for me I don't I didn't feel I don't feel like I'm any different from anybody else you know because I've been back in my early 20s I remember I signed up for a 10k race 6.2 miles back home and quit I mean I always had been partying I was I don't know what 19 or 20 and it's just whatever not in shape and I'm like why am I doing this and stepped off the course and that I've never forget I'll never forget what that moment felt like being a quitter and that that was that is crazy but the point is is so if I've been that guy who quit a six mile race and I've come and now you know have done you know what I what I can do or what I finally believed or figured out I could do anybody can you know what I mean I'm not like crazy talented or or have all this ability that just is natural it's just but it's what I what I'm doing and what I chase what I work for every day and I've been able to achieve what some might consider you know big accomplishments and I'm just a regular guy you're a regular guy but you're regular guy who puts it out there and when you put it out there that's what creates that energy that's what creates that inspiration that's what creates action because people will watch your video and go man I'm going to the fucking gym and they'll go to the gym and they'll start lifting weights or they'll do whatever it is that they do that they they'll get inspired by your hard work they'll watch that video of you getting up early in the morning and going running when you don't want to right they see you tired everybody feels that everybody's seen that alarm clock go off or heard that alarm clock go off and like I do not want to get up now that everybody knows that feeling but it's overcoming that feeling right developing that muscle of discipline where you look at that alarm you hit it and you just just get out of you know I had an ex-girlfriend back when I was fighting who she she used to get angry at the way I would get up because you know she had to work and I I was a comedian I had you know a bunch of different like small-time jobs but when I would get up I get up angry because I I had sort of this thing that I would do in the morning like before my morning workouts about training I would the alarm clock goes up and I would get up like my life depended on it so the alarm would go off I'd hit it and I just fucking jump out of bed like the houses on fire because I was like that's the way to do it because anything else is weak right like I had a real problem when I was young like I didn't want it I was so crazy when I was competing martial arts from the time I was like 15 till I was 22 that's all I did mm-hmm and um I I was so crazy that I thought it was weak to want sex that like wanting sex with my girlfriend was like a weakness and that pleasure was a weakness wanting to taste good food was a weakness and it was gonna be miserable I was fuckin crazy I was completely crazy but I would that alarm clock would get up the alarm car could go off and I would get up angry yeah I'll get up angry and urgent and that's how I'd wake up I'd just wake up instantly yeah we got to go and I'd get my shoes on and do my run or whatever I did that day in the morning and you know she would go would you fucking stop doing that fucking drive me crazy you get up I think the house is on fire something like that yeah she she's overacting got rid of that bitch got a better one it wasn't she was overacting I was fucking crazy I wouldn't wanted to hang out with me when I was 19 I was a fucking maniac yeah but you know that that's probably better than hitting that fucking snooze button ten times in a row yeah you know what the developing the discipline the muscle of discipline I that through inspiration I get that through knowing that they're like watching a video of you seeing that alarm clock go off knowing that you're tired getting up and working out but you Instagram the picture from Vegas when you were at the SHOT Show yeah you looking totally exhausted you're lifting weights like yeah okay he's doing it that's what you got to do not you don't want to lift with good go lift weights you know you're tired there's always always an excuse yeah there's always an excuse yeah but when you get through it you realize like its life is a lot of times not about doing what you want to do life is about doing what you supposed to do or what you should do and then knowing that when you want to do it it'll be even easier then mm-hmm ya know I you know that's part of my routine and people always ask well so what do you do what's your you know routine for get in shape what's I'm like it's real simple actually I got it on my shirt run shoot I lift run shoot every day well what about okay so every day every day you don't take Sundays off nothing every day you don't take a day off a week for anything every day Wow that's inviting to me I should have like a days off every day to the bottom I take days off son I like days off and people I people post hey I would like days off too but I can't do it I just can't do it mentally now can he really that's interesting yeah but in people of this one guy I remember he posted on my I don't know where it was Facebook I think he's like he's like yeah you know I've been following you for a long time but you know everything you're doing that is just too much like too much what too much for who too much for you or too much for everybody and so that was like my whole thing is now I want it I want to be the guy who does too much because how do you do too much right right right too much for it I mean who determines is there a counsel that says okay it's been determined you're doing too much so I know what you mean yeah yeah well we what we used to think is too much is now the norm right you know I mean if you stop and look at like as far as like exercise like think about like what people used to do for exercise now what people do now like no one trains harder than MMA fighters right and MMA fighters the you know you deal with a guy like say you know at Georges st. Pierre or John Jones they're training twice a day at least at least twice a day yeah and they'll take off recovery days or like Randy Couture we should take very few off days he would do what he would call active recovery so instead of wrestle lift weights maybe he'll go mountain bike you know maybe he would do something like yeah you know something like where he's moving he's getting some exercise in it but he would do like what do we call an active recovery day maybe go hiking you know it would still work but you're forcing your body to understand your body this is what you do dude this is what your body does yeah and am i I mean for those guys especially it might be for one minute mm-hmm their fight might be over in a minute yeah could be they're doing all you know like I watched your ayah the other night I know how hard he works and first round over yep that very that was a very unfortunate ending to you and it was very unfortunate for uriah in a lot of ways first of all you went into that camp right after the Macdonald fight and he had an injured knee and an injured hamstring entering into the brow fightin so he had a pulled muscle in his hamstring a partial tear and his knee was fucked up so he couldn't wrestle so not the most optimum conditions to be fighting not just for a world title but against easily one of the four baddest motherfuckers to walk face the planet that hadn't borough is um he is a beast yeah that kid is so good and he hit your eye with one leg kick early in the fight and see your right leg give out you see that like that limp that there's a limp that a guy gets when you know that shin really slammed into the meat of the muscle is this like stutter step that they give is like oh boy ya know I'm a long night for you Riya and then he got tagged ya tell even worse that unfortunately he got Steve Rinella Dino Steven oh yeah hey I'm doing a fuckin podcast with Cameron Haines I'll call you back yeah dude call me if you want to get he wanted to get on there yeah probably he's like listen this guy's full of shit you need a 60 pound bow and that's it this guy's a maniac stop all your lifting this dude's a goddamn billy goat we went pig hunting two weeks ago and you know just following him up the hills Jesus he doesn't get tired yeah he's he's has no muscle mass it was just thin guy yeah but he can go for days right for days yeah just doesn't get tired you know I was shocked when we were in Montana because I'm in pretty good shape but I was following him up these hills and be like and he'd be like nothing not even breathing heavy yeah that that's what really got me on to this idea of exercise and hunting being together that hunting is a difficult thing is that you carrying this ax yeah look at the horns on that thing oh my god those antlers are giant doing lunges there is that what you're doing now no just picking it up yeah that's a good way to do it though right yeah now is that is there any exercise that you do specifically to deal with the fact that you've got so much weight on your back because when you're packing out like that and then we talk about the rock yeah but I mean what I'm saying is to compensate for that not just doing that and carrying the rock but is there any other like do you do like like those Roman chair exercises or something to strengthen your lower back because it seems like like your core and a lot of a lot of the areas of your back are really taxed your spine carrying a lot of weight on you on a pack like that well I mean I'm working core all all the time from planks to all the lifts that I do to shooting a bow is can be core you know I mean your whole trying to hold steady you're you're engaging your core so yeah I do in running the mountain so whether I have the rock or not I'm running that mound and when you're on an uneven trail and you're joking around and stepping in holes you know you're engaging your core so and then of course we do you know different regular lifts deadlifts and whatever else so I don't know I try to mix it up yeah I would I would imagine that there's a lot of crazy muscle groups involved and not just carrying that that rock out but just in shooting that Bo do you balance out your body because you're pulling so hard and your rights on do you ever pull your Bo just with your left side just to to balance it out now I just I think the lifting helps that you know I mean because lifting is pretty much you're engaging both sides equally so the bow the bow just is what it is I probably I probably am a little balanced but you would build a towel but just from you know 27 years of doing it or whatever it's been yeah my friend Steve Maxwell was a pretty famous strength and conditioning expert he works with a lot of people that have imbalances like tickers in the NFL right and he gets him the kick of the opposite side and one of the things that they found is that when you use your weaker side um like say if you have a strong side and they found this with jiu-jitsu as well it actually enhances your ability in your strong side hmm so um if you I find that playing pool to I shoot pool left-handed sometimes hmm like if I'm playing my daughter if I'm playing someone who sucks I'll shoot pool left-handed and sometimes when left-handed comes up like there's a shot that I can't reach right-handed I'll shoot at left-handed we go and if I practice left-handed then my right hand becomes better because I'm concentrating I have to concentrate so hard use my left hand cuz it's all like yeah it doesn't know how to move right oh yeah Fe yeah it's not thinking right and my right hand just falls right into place yeah they say that it using your weak side actually enhances your strong side using your your less dominant side yeah I don't know if I could shoot a bullet I mean I know you could don't say you couldn't you could a lot of percent ya know I'll bet everything I own that you could shoot a bow left the only difference in between that is you know you have your dominant eye yes right so to shoot left-handed I'd have to use what isn't my dominant I used my left eye to aim yeah I don't think that'd be a problem you know when I started doing recently the range I started shooting left-handed because I was shooting so many rounds with my right that I was fucking up my right shoulder oh really the 300 Win Mag oh oh yeah I was slamming that thing into my shoulder so many times I was like let me just fucking shoot a bunch of rounds Lefty that's why I rifle on is bad because the the the shock the impacts get a muzzle break too noisy it's definitely noisy I got these cool earphones that you listen to they're there they cancel the sound out except talking like a sound of gunshots gets muffled radically perfect but I could hear you loud and clear and if you're talking to me like actually I can hear you louder than I could with my ears it actually enhances the sound yeah my friend Justin is a gun I told me about him there they're incredible Justin Martindale no no this different that back decade he's a different kind of gun night Justin call it Justin Martindale is a different kind of gun nut yeah but he is a gun nut haha science mm-hmm but um I found that like shooting lefty like practicing left-handed it made me like so happy that I could go back to right-handed because I was so much better at it mm-hm you know I think that if you well you're so good at shooting bow and arrow anyway but if you did start shooting left-handed I bet it would make your right hand better yeah maybe have you ever thought about getting Hawaii to make your left hand a bow I think they'd do it let's do it let's call Hoyt oh I just want to thank you and Hoyt for bringing me this awesome bow Hoyt which is one of the best bow manufacturers on earth brought this weight carbon spider turbo for me and it is amazing we shot a couple shot we actually have a little bit of a archery set up back here in the back of the studio so we shot a couple of targets with it but this bow is sick yeah I had one just like it it's amazing man it's really really awesome feels great about I brought the factor yeah yours is 90 pounds mine the one you brought me is 70 pounds which makes me feel like a little girl we have to ramp it up yeah that thing's incredible I was amazed at how hard that is to pull back to that's really hard yeah I mean it's like you know it really is like doing a 90 pound row yeah you know ya know it's and it's a lot of its technique you know you want to push at the left pull with the right but yeah it's got a lot of power that's uh I built that or had them build that for me to hunt those uh water buffalo in Australia and then I'm going to use it in Africa on Cape Buffalo - yeah Jamie had that video up Jamie pulled video up so you could see that a water buffalo there's a it's a long stalk a long patience talk on this Buffalo and I would imagine you would want to get a bunch of trees between you and him just in case shit got hairy and you had a duck behind one of those trees yeah the thing about this so these animals here is they catch they catch movement so if if they're not looking while you're moving they don't they can't pick that up so about going slow and then if he looks of course I stop so it's just about it's like right here so I stop because his heads up and so he can see out of his eye I'm not moving i puts his head down and one thing night that i figured out on these things is they might put their head down and pretend like they're eating but really they're looking so you got to be able to tell he'll have his head down but if he's not ripping grass side to side he's not eating he's just testing me so he might have maybe picked something up but he put his head down but his mouth wasn't moving so I just stopped I'm like okay you're trying to you're trying to catch me here but as long as they don't see you move you can you can walk right up right there and I get to 40 I'm not sure what we're filming here but we get to 46 yards and the crazy thing about this is is I wanted to let his his leg go forward so I can slip that arrow in as its legs forward opening up his vitals and I waited too long and you can watch this arrow and it clips a tree in between me and it and it hit the arrow hit a little lower than what I wanted because it hit that tree but because I have you know 90 pounds and so much force it was it ricocheted caught a little bit of energy from that tree was lessened but it still went in and Hart shot on that Buffalo here it is when shooting it yeah so watch watch that tree the the curved one so I want it's late to go forward and also you barely had barely barely caught that but if I would had less poundage that could have so right there it's that's a hard shot on him and he has no idea what happened so he's taking off in their vitals that looks like a bad shot like if you were hunting out that would be too forward and too low but on those that's where the that's where the the heart is so you have to know basically right chickens yeah it's a little bit different on those animals than what we're here in North America and so you see he's going to run into a tree here he's pretty wobbly and so I don't know how many seconds this was but you got a 2,000 pound animal with the just a razor-sharp stick and he's down and you know a minute maybe min and a half that's that's a lot quicker than they're ever going to die in natural habitat on their own no doubt and that's one thing that people need to understand when you're talking about animals and hunting animals in you know people that are opposed to it they need to understand first of all that in order to do proper conservation to take care of these animals to make sure that their herds the population is strong you have to call some of the animals you have to because otherwise they're going to die of starvation they're going to you know they're going to get diseased there's there's a lot of issues involved if you're not introducing predators and then if you introduce predators to take care of the population well then you got a whole nother problem obviously and and they're actually seeing that right now in parts of this country with with wolves when they reintroduce wolves I mean they're they're really ramping up wolf hunting now in Idaho oh yeah because the wolves are just tearing up elk yeah and it's yeah decimating population yeah and you know like in Australia there there's no predators so those Buffalo there there's too many of them right now there's no limit on Buffalo you don't need a tag you don't need a license they just want them killed because they're they're not native those are Asian water buffalo so they were brought over to Australia though not native and so there's so many of them were there once was water and there's fish and all sorts of things now it's just basically a mud hole because those Buffalo get in there and you know they they piss in there they do live in there killed everything so they tear up the habitat they tear up the wall they ruin the water source and so now there's one kill so when I was over there I killed three of those big old things and you could kill 20 of them if you want they need them gone Wow that's the same thing with New Zealand as well right New Zealand has an issue with non-native species yeah yeah yeah that's it you know you know there's only if I don't know there's tons of non-native species in Australia I think let's see the guy was with Adam green tree he killed it's not a dingo but it's a sort of like a dingo but it's not a purebred because those are protected but uh kangaroo yoked he is yeah it's like the kangaroo is following the Cameron Haynes grandma yeah Adam that's it would not wanna tangle with that kangaroo man that's you don't need to be that Jack to be kangaroo see he's he's wasting his time he's getting crazy no but uh yeah so it's it was it was good getting over there and seeing different animals and learning from let's see Adam green tree and Owens run L we're over there and they've awesome bowhunters and uh you know get into new countries just what I love to do yeah and the non-native species things fascinating thing to me because that's what we're dealing with in North America with the wild hogs that had been introduced you know they were introduced with the Europeans and they've run rampant all throughout in California we were in Tejon ranch or I went hunting with Rinella and they have 50,000 hogs and this one ranch I mean it's they're fucking everywhere yes it's insane yes see these herds of them oh and they tear they I mean they're written around tearing up the ground yeah and they breed all year round yeah they're just constantly making babies and so there's uh there's certain ranches in California in Southern California there they're begging people to come on their ranch and kill hogs you know in Texas famously they they're shooting about helicopters yeah I mean they they actually have companies that take people on helicopter hog hunts and that's what they're all about they just fly around they find the Hogs and they're shooting them out of the sky and part of it is novelty and in that you know you get to hunt from a helicopter and part of it is necessity oh yeah you can't get to these damn thing is to reduce the number somehow yeah not the non-native species thing is very fascinating to me and you know just the the understanding of of population control is one of the things that I've really become fascinated by with by getting into hunting understanding what the Fish and Wildlife what they have to go through in order to to figure out like what how many tags to give out right what what the numbers are they need to where they need to let animals recuperate where they need to go in and take some of them and reduce them it's a fascinating thing and one of the most efficient programs in our country as far as like you want to talk about like government programs well Fish and Wildlife is a government program but damn it's effective yeah effective inefficient because it's run by actual hunters and fishermen and outdoorsmen yeah no and the thing about you know hunting people still if you're not a hunter it's hard to understand or some people still don't understand why in this day and age you need to hunt well you know like I work with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation there's a number one conservation group out there and they've they've helped protect habitat I think over six million acres now of habitat for elk so that's from hunters hunters dollars you know conservation groups so hunters the money we pay for tag and license and everything else to use to being out there hunting with the weapon that's what goes into helping these animals you know elk numbers now have never been higher that's yeah we're hunting them but we're also paying in contributing to the health and habitat and for elk and other wildlife and that's that's what people don't understand without putting a value on those animals then that's where I don't know that's that's where everything goes sideways but because we value them we're willing to pay money and help and we got outfits like the Rocky Mountain out foundation that just do amazing work for us yeah I know what we're their mindset I know I understand where they're coming from the people that are anti hunting it's they they're coming from kindness I mean they don't want you to kill these cute animals and they don't want you they feel like it's a cruelty thing more that it's an evil thing to go out to nature and find these beautiful things and shoot them and kill them I understand the mindset yeah but it like many things in life is not nearly as cut and dry as everybody wants to paint it is everybody wants to depict it it's it's a far more complex and complicated issue and they have a hard time believing that someone could have a deep love for animals while still hunting them right no it's a I don't you know I don't think anybody could respect bow elk more than I do you know maybe the same but it's I think about elk hunting every single day and those bowls are man once I don't know I dreamed about killing a 6x6 bull elk or I first of all I didn't know if I had what it took I was like am I good enough or am i tough enough or can I even do this I mean maybe I can't maybe I'm not even capable of it because I I could kill some animals I could killed a spike boy I killed some smaller bowls but a 6x6 bull mature herd bull is what every hunter dreams of and for folks who don't know what you're saying 6x6 means six holes and size six points on each side yeah this is an enormous animal yeah yeah for folks who don't understand you're talking about the antlers antlers that are bigger than my arms yeah longer and thicker even than my arms okay so I killed a six by six Bowl this year in Colorado her in 2013 and it was about ten years old so to do that he's been through ten hunting seasons he's you know endured ten winters I mean tough tough animal and so for a long time I didn't know if I had if I had what it took and that was that when I finally did do it is when princess died died like I said and so that was when I when I called it just like all I can think about is I finally proved to myself I could do it and that's it that's powerful that was the first time that you'd ever done it there's one right there yeah that's more that's more than the six by six that's a that's a that's a monster looks he's got an extra tie in there but uh let's pull up a video of Elks bugling I know we played one of those before just so people can hear it because there's one on my on my youtube from Colorado this year and the Bulls coming up the hill bugle and it's so loud oh yeah okay totally what is that what what's the know the name of the video um should be something Colorado Cam and Colorado or something like that well Jamie will find it but the that animal itself the the elk is is almost like a mystical animal yeah because if you've heard one I've heard one call before and we were in Mount Rainier mm-hmm we actually weren't even hunting we were looking for Bigfoot I was there to get my friend Duncan you didn't find it dude we found them I just like to keep so I'm not like Tom Sizemore I'm not all Blaby no we um it was it was the sci-fi show that I did called Joe Rogan questions everything and can hear it yet if you go to like like eight or nine eight or nine minutes yeah let's see can we can we hear the oh yeah yeah yeah oh no this is where it took a selfie of a bull coming in I was past that maybe right in there yeah yeah Turk can you can we there we go listen to this how far away is that right now he's about 70 that's him that's yeah listen to this and that's a carbon spider turbo that's an 80-pound that's not a carbon that's a spider turbo that's before who knows line model boy that is amazing dude that will just put the hair in the back your neck Wow and so you have this scope in your hand that's a spotting scope that shows you the distance as a distance rangefinder rangefinder yeah so he he's about 18 yards right here but he's going to get the wind so I had to try to stop I do that with my mouth I'm trying to stop him before he smells me so he spooked right here and he goes to about 25 right here my son Tanner's filming oh right there so there's a perfect shot and you'll see here's how you see how lethal a bow is he's bleeding on the other side yeah heroin clear through Wow he probably don't even know what the fuck happened no he's he's looking for a bull he hears that other bull was bugle and he just got in a fight with a bowl now he's like he doesn't feel so good wow so that's it that's a that's an animal seven times bigger than you yeah and that's just with a sharp stick basically that's so that's what you dream of is about every bowhunter dreams of that and how many of those have you ever killed oh I don't probably thirty Wow dude you must have the most ridiculous freezer at home yeah now the freezer is full definitely what kind of a freezer do you have do you have like one of them walking Fraser's I have to just two freezers too big giant freezer in the garage yeah and it's full bear and elk and everything else you probably never have to go to supermarket for me right no we still like a good beefsteak everyone's well you know I I buy I buy my beef from Adam LaRoche he's uh he he has a ranch in Kansas and it's just you know the beef is raised no steroids or no it's his free-range and that's where I buy my meat from he's uh he's another hunter II it's on that show buck commanders he plays for the Washington Nationals and is it all grass-fed yeah yeah I mean it's as good as it gets the farm that we hunted on in Wisconsin this year as my friend Doug Doug durin and he actually has cows on his farms well and racism grass-fed gave us some of the beef it was delicious amazing people don't realize man when you're feeding cows these these diets that are unnatural them giving him corn they all fat and shit like I was a restaurant the other day try to give me some of that Wagyu beef like it's our finest beef might get that sloppy fat stupid animal away from me a drunken animal yeah no that's what is they get him drunk off beer that their feed them beer and fattening them up when you're not supposed to have all that fat like in the marbling you get a nice grass-fed steak and yeah it's you know lean very lean it's darker it's a deeper red it's more like a game animal yeah as lean is elk and no um but like you said eating uh is that Steve calling you textin shut this fuckin thing on me Steve yeah how dare he but I've been in Colorado in that high country there and that's about 11,000 feet that's up in the mountains and I killed a bull I don't know I think it was three years ago and we cut off the back strap built a fire and cooked it I actually put it on one of my arrows because my arrows are aluminum and cooked the backstrap skewered on an arrow over a fire and I don't care where I've eaten or the food I've eaten it would never be better than that right there in the mountains killing or eating an animal I just killed is amazing we did that in Montana we had liver and we liver and heart that we had killed the two hours ago and we we cooked it up at the campfire we were all just like oh this isn't quite so good yeah and the dirt east it's so vibrant too like the the taste of elk elk is extremely delicious animal it's uh it's got a really unique flavor to it yeah almost sweet right well and it's just you know so I was cutting that back strap on a rock dirty hands just a knife that I'd got it it's just like so what whatever I don't even know how you describe it but it's just I don't just feels like that's that's how it's meant to be that's almost how it feels like I'm meant to live you know it's just out there living in the in the mountains and I don't know just powerful even not killing an animal there's something to me about the mountains that's insanely appealing I I just I love being in the mountains it gives you this weird i-i've it sounds like very hippy but I believe that when you are in these areas like when you were in a mountain and it's all these trees and there's a river or stream or whatever I feel like there's energy coming out of those trees and his energy in that hill and then these these life forms these a lot of these plants that grow there in the wild and they're these vibrant things that have existed without any human assistance whatsoever and will be here probably long after we're gone there's there's something to them where when you're in that environment you feel it you might not even know you feel it but sort of like you don't know when you're breathing smoggy air you're just breathing smoggy air and then you get to a mountain you get that mountain area like wow this is different and then you round those those plants I feel like I mean it's not like they're communicating with you but I feel like they give off a vibe yeah that wasn't after you smoked a bunch of pot was it I ate a bunch of no even stone cold sober man but that the pie would definitely enhance now I believe that too you know I've been there's this place I used to go and camp by myself and he would Cap'n just like on this rock shelf looking over this huge Canyon and so I was I was sleeping there one night and uh you know stars are out and just before dark I'd glassed about 300 yards away a bunch of Bighorn Rams and you know sheep are just like the holy grail of hunting right and so I was watching these sheep and it's just like it's just so I don't know it's so amazing that moment so I went to bed my bivy sack there and I woke up in the morning the sheep were still there except there was one less and I'm like wonder where the heck that other Ram went well I went over there and and found a lion had killed a ram the night before and so I found this leg I'm like oh okay what here's one reason why he wasn't with them but is this like those those Rams are they're feeding one got killed by a lion they're still there feeding nothing had changed I mean the wind was still blowing - they were still feeding but one was gone and it just to me is just like man he I could die back here nothing nothing changes I mean you were just you really figure out how you fit in nobody nothing cares back there it's just like that's just the way it goes there's life and death and nothing in the wilderness changes and that just to me that was powerful you know you feel you really feel um how you fit in and it's humility you don't have much of an impact really you know who needs to feel that who's that Kanye West I'll take that motherfucker bowhunter there you go take them bowhunting and why is in his little tent he hears yeah here's some mountain go get taken out well I think a lot of people could benefit including Kanye almost everybody could benefit but have you ever had any encounters with mountain lions um we'll see I've had a shot at one I've never killed one I've never been with dogs you know hunting lions so it's just kind of been happen chance but I was still in that same country and I was walking on the top of this cliff and I was looking down at the Rocky Mountain two goats I don't have you ever seen a goat it's a white with a little black well they live up in notoriously steep country so I'm up on top of this cliff looking down at the goats under just by myself sneaking along and I look up further down the down the cliff and there's a lion standing there watching the same goats so I was hunting I didn't have a tag for the go so I was just kind of watching them if they only give one tag for that area it's really really tough to give but still they're just awesome animals and so I look down and there's a lion watching the same goats and you could see they if those goats get too high they get killed by the lion so they kind of stay a little lower doesn't they figure it out but that line is just waiting for one to make mistake well I was just seconds from being able to get a shot because I had a lion tag mountain lion and I you guys can't hunt him here but we can hunt him in in Oregon but no not with dogs but seconds from getting a shot and right before he looked at me and took off so I've seen that lion I've I saw a lion chasing a cow elk back there they're they're nocturnal you just don't see many Lions out in daylight unless they're hunting like that but um I've seen them do you hear them like when you're camping um yeah they make yeah you you know I may not have known what it was but uh they do make it a noise unlike any you've ever heard you know and that's lions and you can just what is howling I don't know it'd be hard to describe but I shot no I can't can't you do a line impression I can't do it Wow yeah no not like that no deeper yeah it's uh no that's more like a bear but uh yeah I don't know but you know something creepy yeah something right exactly something that you like that's weird have you ever seen the photo of the the lion and the RAM dead on the road they'd fallen off the cliff yeah with a the lion in the RAM we're duking it out yeah and apparently they they both went over the edge yeah that to me is one of the most powerful photographs of the struggle of nature the the tooth Fang and claw of the wilderness and that happens all the time you just roar you just don't have of it yeah if it's not on a road right but uh yeah that's they deal with that all the time both of them deal with it all the time yeah and you know it is what it is yeah nothing changes picture Jamie it's a crazy pic yeah this is the picture yeah the series of them the two of them lying down on the road I mean that is such a powerful photograph yeah it just makes you realize like what an insane struggle it is to try to be surviving as an animal in the wilderness and seal it that's all snow piled up there you know it's cold it's I mean they're out there 365 days a year trying to survive so that's why I think about I I think about what they go through when I'm working out and it's just like there's so much tougher I mean we're such so weak as a society you know we're used to laying on the couch watching TV having everything well bull elk is laying out there in the rain and the snow and the whatever getting so tough it's always think about there's this gap between me and a bowl I need to close that gap because it's just getting wider and wider every day for most you know so if you can close that if I can get tougher and tougher and tougher I'm going to be more on an equal playing field and be more of a predator like a lion you know what I mean or a wolf how did you decide to specialize in elk um it's just the biggest animal near you in Oregon yeah it's just like you know it was probably the most respected and regal animal that I could afford to hunt you know I didn't for when I first started hunting we bought a deer tag there's like eleven fifty I couldn't even forward an elk tag because they were 25 bucks I was like 25 dollars there's no way I'm ever going to hunt elk and so that's just so it was didn't have any money and then once I could afford elk it was that year that uh that I killed that one with the bow and uh you know so I'm in it like thirty bucks I'm like I need to get my money's worth out of this thing between a you know I think it went up a little bit so is 27 50 or something like that but yeah that was it there's just it was just the biggest most respected animal a bull elk is just like man you know I could never dream hunting sheep at that time or Buffalo or whatever so is Elk & elk mean if you've got five hundred pounds of meat off an animal what is that worth money-wise I mean that what a bargain for a $25 tag get 500 pounds well obviously you have to pay for your equipment your time and yeah I wouldn't anything it doesn't pencil out doesn't Bluff once you once you figure out the time and you know you look at these bones right here these are you know shoot by the time you get this boat set up here with arrows and everything else it's like 2,000 bucks so you don't want to pencil it out that it's not it's not about the value of it you know what I mean so it's just about more about just the experience and why did you decide to go to Australia to shoot these water buffaloes just for the experience of it yeah just um I wanted it you know it's like when I'm not hunting I don't know just being in my office working at my regular work I feel like I'm dying basically do you really yeah I just feel like what your boss is listening right now another it's like what the fuck am I do you like it here no I do like you like you in the office yeah I am yeah well you mean I like it there damage control sorry boss hey listen man I felt like I was dying when I was doing Fear Factor I know what you're talking about no but I just feel like that's not what I'm what you want to do meant to do yeah it's just I just need I need I need to be outside and need to be you know challenged and so I'm like God what can I do and so came out um it was in December just you know recently and I'm like I wanted to go do something I've never done so hyk me up with Adam down there and Australia and I wanted to do actually when I first decided to go there it was it was just going to be to give away a bow what I do with the bow is after I get done shooting them for the year is I hold these contests and it's like wind cams bow and I just say if you want to win my bow from last year show up at this time and beat me at any challenge beat me the challenges I put out there and you can have my bow and so I was just going to do a win above in Australia because I have so many people that order my shirts and hats and and everything else from down there I'm like I need to get down there and see these people you know I just wanted to I just felt so much support down there oh that's cool yeah so I asked Hoyt I said I want to do a winning bow down and down there can you help me set it up you know with the Pro Shops or the archer shops down there so just kind of turned into a hunt at the same time I'm like yeah I'll do a hunt also so that was what I did the hunt then I did the wind cams bow contest and it's just tied it all together and what was the the contest would they have to do to win your bow um they had to beat me at running well so we ran then we did push-ups then we did pull-ups and then we did a hundred-yard shot so if you beat me at those you get my bow all three they have to beat you at all of them for for all four of them yeah and then if no but if they only beat you three of them not denied then I don't saying next no then I get to choose who I give it to so I give it away either way right I mean I'm not like you guys suck I'm taking my bow home now I just then I get to the thing is I'm going to give it away to somebody if somebody beats me at all that it's no questions is your bow and if nobody does I choose out of the contestants and so I end up giving it to this uh thirteen-year-old girl there and I just liked her heart you know it was a hundred degrees and like 100 percent humidity it was just brutal and we were running we ran 12 laps around this like it I think is a cricket field but is about you know a 5k like 3.1 miles and so we were running and uh nobody beat me at that but she was just out there grinding and sweating and hot and just showing a lot of hearts and she did the pull-ups and of course didn't win the pull-up since she did push-ups and then at the hundred-yard shot she made an awesome shot I mean she wasn't the closest but made a good shot at 100 yards at this 3d bull elk and I you know there's other people who beat her there but I didn't think anybody showed as much hard as she did I gave her the bow and you know as an 80-pound bow so obviously I don't know if I told her I said you don't need to keep it you can sell it and buy clothes you can do it everyone with it the point is is your effort to me--one this boat today that's cool man and it's up to you that's really cool now when you went out there hunting the water buffalo you camped out there he camped out there in the bush yeah there was there's actually we stayed in this village from the Aborigines they were we thought they were going to be there but there's actually nobody there and we had to hunt it's called a traditional land native land you have to get permission from the Aborigines to hunt it and what I was told is probably only 50 white men had ever been there just because it's it's wild country it's just where they live but nobody's in the village and we don't know why it was abandoned or whatever we you know some I guess if an elder dies they will leave they think there's bad spirits in the village so they just leave everything and take off so we don't know for sure why it was empty but we were deserted by ourselves and we just basically slept on the porch of this Hut out there Anna we didn't Adam who uh who I was went out there with he was like you know when we took a helicopter out there's only way to get there was a for our helicopter ride and I I said we want to get any food he's like he was I think it'd be better if we just lived off the land and I'm like okay yeah that's cool I didn't know what was out there for sure turns out there's not much and so that was that was not the best idea to try to live off the land luckily I'm another guy Owen when he did bring some food but still we didn't have hardly have any food I mean I had a granola bar and I had some trail mix from the airport and Adam had a granola bar and then Owen he brought some apples and oranges and stuff like that but all that stuff was gone fast and we were out there five full days it was 120 degrees Fahrenheit out there and the water was like it looked like this coffee I mean because about the Buffalo lived in it and they just piss and shit yeah just non-stop so you know we would we would have to treat that water you drank that water there's nothing else oh yeah my goodness yeah so is a process what is buffalo piss tastes like exactly it's you know surprisingly it's not that good now do you put it through filters D is G boil it like we here's what we did first we poured it through our shirt okay I try to get the big chunks out right like I own brought back some water on time and he's like what does this smell like and I was just like oh my like buffalo piss and you knew you're gonna have to drink yeah so we put it through the shirt then we did it through a pump Adam how to pump and then he had a SteriPEN what kind of pump no no a water you know it's for filtering water okay yeah I don't know what kind of was but it filters through like a pump system yeah you like a carbon right yeah it's a filter this supposedly cleans water so then we had a SteriPEN which is a UV light that also cleans the water and so we had the shirt the filter the SteriPEN and then he's like okay so we got all that now what is it smoking is it like a a cup like this and I was like oh still smells it smelled no different so we drank that oh my god like that looks like that like it was no boiling it nothing oh my god she drank straight buffalo piss yeah and shit too right yeah what about the the bacteria and you know like that stuff that you get like when you drink stream water what's that's called it's real common she already had Giardia yeah well that's what that stuff was supposed to kill or take out Wow yeah so Adam he was he's like took a drink of it and he's kind of went into convulsions a little bit he's like he's like my body's rejecting it and uh it was just nasty but and then then there was another time so we we found this uh we found some hamburger patties that were from the natives there they had the freezer actually the government or whoever it is comes in there and they put power and and water their solar power because it's so you know it's hot and sunny down there so there was a freezer and it had some Hamburg hamburger patty so we stole those and we're cooking those up so we're down to like one last patty and I had it I took it because I had no food and I had didn't my trail mix but bags I had no more trail mix oh I had it in there and I had one cooked hamburger patty and I remember we're sitting there we just drank a big ol vat of buffalo piss water now I'm like man you know it would go good with this is that hamburger patty so unzip my backpack and I pull out my trail mix with the hamburger bag with the hamburger patty in it and it's just solid ants I mean ants are all filled up and this is not like regular little cool black ants like we have here just red mean whatever ants and just all over in my backpack all over that patty but so all I did I just blew off scrape them off blew them off the hamburger patty and ate it why don't you just eat the ants - I wish it oh yeah they were totally gangster I mean you drink it buffalo piss as well eat some ants but but you know here's the thing is you know experiences like that is that's where you appreciate you know I don't know how good we have it because you you realize all it all that matters is she has something to drink and something to eat that's it yeah you have to keep your body alive and there's no other way to know it and so you get home and you see people complain about oh there's no ice for this water I gotta drink this warm water I'm like that water looks pretty damn good I mean I've drink some nasty water and I'd take that you know so it just puts everything in perspective you know and you have to make sure that you're not getting dehydrated too so you have to drink a lot of that piss water yeah you do yeah oh kind of rocket diarrhea did you guys develop I just I need to know because I must have been like some broken fire hydrant type diarrhea no you didn't know I must knotted I mean we must have got it pretty clean you must have a strong constitution I guess so now the Buffalo itself you said that you guys ate that yeah we'd had nothing else to eat and he would tell me about this before the podcast started but for the folks at home what was that like yeah it was uh so the backstrap is typically the best cut of any game animal it's right along the spine and there's no bones and it's just big solid meat and it's usually just like on an elk that's like as good as it gets tenderloin yeah and so we cut that off and cook that up in these Buffalo so cut that up and cooked it up so I take a bite and I shoot my bow just middle the day and uh I was shooting for probably maybe a half hour came back still chewing the same bite and so the thing about these Buffalo because there's no predators and we were trying to kill the the biggest Bulls out there bolt could be 30 years old anything any animal that old in those conditions the muscles are going to be so it's muscle you're eating the muscles are going to be you know whatever just not very pliable and so yeah dance and so I chewed that one bite of the premium cut for half hours like you know eating a shoe so how's it what about the organs ajit the liver no how come no I never yeah you don't like liver now you don't like liver like from a deer no really no why I don't know man that's my favorite part that just filters all that crap it's so good for you though no there's a good job of filtering the crap I'm I'm not a liver guy that's interesting you know the the alpha wolf is the one that gets the liver mmm when they take out an animal a lady consider yeah that's true now the alpha wolf they battle over who gets the liver in the that's how they determine the alpha status of the pack that the the wolf who's the baddest motherfucker is the one that eats the liver mmm there was a documentary on this guy who lived with wolves there was an in there was a contained area I forget where it was forget what part of the world but this one guy lived with these wolves in this contained area and he was the Alpha and the way that he became the Alpha is he was with these wolf since they were little and he would always eat liver in front of them so he would have an animal that they would give to these wolves and he would put a liver inside of this animal and he would like open up the zip lock bag moments live around eat in front of them so they knew that because he was eating the the delivery alpha yeah well he went away because he had to deal with there was a local farmer that had a wolf invasion the wolf were killing his livestock so this guy had to assist this farmer and one of the ways the assistant um he said all these speakers where he had howls like he set up like as if there was like a new pack that it encroached into this area and he set up this whole elaborate thing to try to ward off these wolves without having to kill them and then you know some time went by several weeks and he went back to the the wolves and a new alpha was there so he had a beg for his life in front of this new alpha he had a whimper and he had elderly it was really intense cuz well it was baring its teeth it was challenging him for the Alpha position yeah and so he had to get out of it by being a bitch because normally wolves will Duke it out and find out well oh oh you're the Alpha now well we'll see what's up bitch and you know they would Duke it out to see who this wolf was determined to eat that liver and so he had a like they had a fight for his position attack by begging well that's for his life I like that's what I do like how simple life is in the mountains you know what I mean I mean there's one leader there's it's just that's the you know that when I was young I liked being back there because I didn't have to worry about you know whether somebody liked me or whether I had money or whether any help from anybody it was just like so simple and so cut and dry just like that there's one alpha wolf I mean either are you tougher or is he tougher you know what I mean and that's I just like the how black and white the mountains are you know if you're not tough you die yeah that's that's great if you're tough that's true yeah if you're not tough you want to get back home to the internet like fuck this place man I need air conditioning I need a blanket I did you know I did a commercial with the wolf or Under Armour just know I don't know we filmed it last year but uh I thought the best ending to that commercial would have been if I could have killed that wolf because it was like how it went is me and the wolf were running through the woods were both doing the same things and and then the commercial ended with me I had a bull elk I'd killed but we just took the rack up there but I had it on my pack and the wolf came up and he saw me with that bull elk it was like I won because we're both hunting the helm but I got it so the jumped up on this log and he snarled and was not happy I thought I said man this the best ending to this would be if I just arrow that wolf to kids you got to kind of infer that I won but right man that would that would sell tell the story right there well that would really like send it home for under armour though people would boycott they would say yes killing wolves is this the commercial play it yeah that's it let's hear the volume with preparation and the right gear you can become nature's eek that's even better you like pitch rt1 yeah that doesn't look a real wolf though that's a rowboat don't belong looks like the ones bitch-ass trained wolves yeah oh that was a trained wolf but it was an actual real trained well a real wolf not like a hybrid no no no now that was and that that wolf actually so it was that wolf had been in like the Twilight movies you know I mean it's it's sort of a famous wolf but the thing about it is to make it snarl like that I took some elk steak up there and I was going to give it I was going to give us some elk after it did this whole thing but to make it mad like that you had to give it meat and take it away give a meat take it away Wow and they said they said ok yeah we the trainer said ok we can make it mad and snarl I could need for the commercial but uh once we do that it were done because it's going to be pissed off for the whole rest of the day so that was a last thing so though that wolf had been I think they had it since he was 5 weeks old when was 11 years old but is still crazy yeah I mean real wolf yeah I mean you don't they have that in them so is pretty is pretty cool yeah I had a friend who had hybrids they weren't even foals they were like you know 7/8 wolf or something like that but he had them and they got away from him the guy they were in his his yard and they went over to the neighbor's property and killed like something like 18 sheep or something with yeah just went on just an orgy of murder yeah and just slaughtered this guy sheep yeah and then you know the rancher comes over pissed at him and he tried to deny it gives his wolves a bath and I'm like come on yeah what the fuck else is gonna kill 18 of them I'm outlines gonna kill one and it it's a well-fed wolf dog that's going to go on this mad orgy of murder yeah I've read a lot you know I've always been a fan of wolves which is kind of close to that commercial with the wolf but you know I read you know call the wild when I was a kid and White Fang all that but uh that they I've read a lot about wolves and they're the only animals that do thrill killing you know just kill a bunch of things just to kill them you know whereas other animals usually kill just what they eat yeah they had a problem with that recently at this ranch in Montana where these this pack of wolf's just got to hold these calves and just slaughtered a bunch of calves like you know a ton of them like you know 12 calves and just left them I mean ate part of them but left a lot of them just sitting there dead frozen and it's it was a really creepy scene it was on a television show that I was watching and when they're you know these calves that are mostly covered in snow you see their bodies and you really see this the havoc that these things they're they're too close to people yeah fucking wolves you know yeah they're creepy in a weird way they're smart they're sneaky they're strategic and how they kill things yeah and then they do this thrill killing thing yeah no it's I mean and you can't blame the wolf that's just how they are but we don't need a bunch of them running around the mountains I mean yeah but people have a weird relationship with them because they look so much like dogs yeah you know it's it's a strange sort of a relationship that people who love wildlife have that they would be cured of really fucking quickly if they were out there in the woods and they saw a pack of wolves yeah because they would realize oh these are monsters yeah these these are the things that they made Little Red Riding Hood about this is this is the big bad wolf yeah like there's a reason why all of those children's stories involved evil wolves because wolves eat kids yeah on a regular basis back then well it's people there's not realistic about it I mean a wolf that they're just looking for something to kill yeah whether there's your baby you you ooh a deer yeah you know and people you know just like a timothy treadwell up in alaska when he was living with the bears and he thought Oh bears are my friends you know this hello mr. chocolate yeah how are you hate him and his girlfriend yeah it's just like they're not your friends not even slightly no the only reason why they weren't eating you is because they don't eat you every day so they're not used to seeing you as food that's it yes all it is yeah and with wolves they're like this motherfucker might have a bang stick they like circle you looking what's the thing in his hand hmm yeah I might go bang yeah they've heard the bang stick a few times and they go running yeah I I'm not a big fan of wolves I am a big fan of wolves and I'm not a big fan of wolves like I'm a big fan as far as them like just like I'm a big fan of lions I think even mountain lions I think they're fascinating just wild animals wild predators are absolutely there they're chanting in a way just this idea that this thing exists along with us with our lattes and our electric cars and our Wi-Fi along at the same time at this very same moment we're doing this podcast there's some gangster ass mountain lion in Arizona right now getting shit done yeah on a mountain yeah sneaking up on some RAM or whatever the fuck you can get his teeth onto and that's what he does every day and there's thousands of them yeah not just one there's a whole community of mountain lions and there that's what they do yeah whether it's the wolves in Idaho that are destroying the elk or the mouse there they're really really fascinating but people were anti-hunting need to understand it just because a lot of people don't like to eat mountain lion or these because nobody eats wolves you still need to kill those things like and it's important because if it doesn't happen they're gonna creep into civilian areas the same way they used to back in the day when they were writing those little red riding-hood books yeah I've told the story in the podcast before but I'll tell it again in Paris in the 1400s wolves killed 40 people in Paris mm-hmm like they had a corner wolves in the streets of Paris and and killed them with Spears and sticks and rocks yeah like they're not to be fucked with this is not they're not your dogs this is not a beautiful animal that you know has a relationship I mean even the way we treat like killer whales whales don't kill people in the wild they actually help people that fall out of boats mm-hmm you know the killer whales might be your friends we should probably be way nicer to killer whale then we're out of wolves yeah that's true yeah there's something about hunting a predator you know I mean I've done a lot of bear hunts and I was up in Alberta this year now you know a lot of people bear hunting now they like sit up in a tree stand this that I'm like I said I want I want to hunt I want to hunt a predator in there seven-foot black bear they're huge but I want to be on the ground I was up there with John rivet in in Alberta I said I want to be on the ground living amongst them and there's something about and so we did that this is you're here what are you cooking here oh that call that bear crack yeah so you bait them up there and um there's so many bear up there you can kill two but there's this like tons of bear you need to manage that number but uh so that bear we call it bear crack because once I get hooked on the crack you they're there I mean they're coming in and what is bear crack with woody what's in what do you mix it in there marshmallows and jello and stuff like that to something that smells good but but those bears get cooking yeah I just kind of get it wasting in the in the air and uh huh and then the smoke goes off through there but uh I wanted to I wanted like that bear was probably Kyle was Alec maybe twelve feet yeah well pull that video up again Jamie look how close Faris that's a big pair too man yeah that's a good bear and we should point out probably the black bear are much less likely to attack a person than a grizzly yeah that I mean they'll but the thing is with the wild animal they'll do whatever they want yeah I mean yeah you can say all the books no I mean you might get attacked you go hey you're less likely to do that you know it doesn't matter so you never know a bear a bear comes and they make any animal make a decision right then or what they want to do you know if it's a predator if it's a dominant predator dominant bear are more likely just to come walking right in like that and just say you better leave because I'm coming in and those those are the ones I mean those are the ones I go after I'm the dominant animal and and that one that one wasn't like one of the giant that was a big bear but not one of the giant bear but there's something about being on the ground I - I with a predator like that that's uh I mean that's just what I like to do so you pass on that bear because it was too small Wow yeah yeah that's a big bear yeah that was but it wasn't seven foot four hundred pounds I loved ones that I got well how big was that one new thing I was like probably six foot maybe you know 250 or 275 Wow now why do you want the dominant ones um there that you know there's older sometimes those old boars don't breed as much as I used to a lot of the old boars you know especially a dominant boar will kill other bear so even if its own cub I mean it breeds a lot of sounds you know when they're in their prime so the South's have Cubs a dominant blower will kill the Cubs because he's trying to eliminate competition for him mm-hmm you know so he'll kill his own Cubs that's just how it works and they eat him - right yeah they can't they eat I mean I've I had this we were on Prince of Wales Island went that's where this video is right here Prince of Wales Island one time or no no that's this is Alaska this is a Prince of Wales but this guy hit this bear and we can't write it dark we came back the next day to recover it and the dominant boar had eaten his bear that's just they are just I don't know it's just survival to fit us basically so those so you want we take those dominant boars out of there and it pretty much helps the health of the of the herd basically not not the hurt but the numbers Bears aren't heard but whatever the how many bears are there it'll help you know taking that big nasty dominant one out of there and that's you know I don't know I I I just don't need to kill just to kill you know I've killed you know when I first started I killed anything I'd have a chance at I just wanted to notch that tag take me home to my family and have success now I mean like I hunted back home for deer in Oregon I didn't kill I passed up everything because I never saw the animal that I wanted to kill I never saw the mature buck one that I wanted to get so I just didn't kill I mean I don't need to kill I if I'm going to it's going to be something that you know I'm really I don't know infatuated with or just sold on I really want that so it's just a matter of you just did you see good deer you just didn't see a great one yeah yeah so good bucks probably most people would kill them but I just didn't see the one I wanted what were you looking for how big um like a big you know 4x4 um you know kind of like you know like what you got there that meal but this is black tail Bakht oh yeah this is in western oregon so a good 4x4 black tail you know five years old good mature buck and I just never had a chance at one so I didn't didn't kill anything now these bear that you're killing in Alberta said where was their principal Alaska is that where was it Prince of Wales this last one like we showed that clip that was uh Alberta Alberta are you eating these bears yeah oh yeah no I I eat everything I kill what does it taste like when you this big old bear chicken no now bear you know bear I've had really good bear and it used to be so like if you have a bear that's living on berries and you get up there in the mound you kill it's going to be really sweet meat because as eating blueberries or whatever else if you have a bear that's coming into bait and paint like some people bait down here just with meat scraps or whatever might have maggots it's probably not gonna be that good you know but those bear in Alberta mostly were there's a just grain is what we're putting out there little bear cracks oh those bear are really good I don't know what it tastes like it's more like it's fatter meat may be more like pork but it's good what are they eating for the most part like with their diet consists of mmm in Alberta man whatever they can get ahold of yeah a lot of grass and a lot of grass yeah yeah I just it depends on the time of the year so but they'll take they'll take some oats over grass any day yeah I watched this episode of meaty eater with Steve Rinella where he went for these fall bears that were fattening up before they would hibernate and they were eating berries they're eating blueberries and he it was incredible because as he was cutting this bear open like you see the fat is actually blue yeah it's got like a blue tint to it from all the berries right animal had been eating right and he said it was just unbelievably good good yeah I know and that's you know you get those huge black bears or if they're eating fish like in Alaska if they're down were like on Prince of Wales they can eat a lot of fish that come in and those bears are huge because of all that protein I mean just it's all about their diet they get giant because they're eating solid protein all the time but those bears aren't as good from fish for whatever reason they taste fishy I don't know about fishy just not as sweet yeah because I've heard like diver ducks dive like there's two types of ducks for folks who don't know there's duck City vegetation there's diver ducks that go under the water and eat fish and those kind of tastes like shit yeah ya know it's probably the you know it's probably same with anything you are which eat yeah exactly so if you need a person make sure it's a vegetarian now there's a Steve Rinella with this blueberry fat bear yeah it's just like a berry it's almost half liquid at room temp if you read older accounts from like pioneering Alaskans I mean not even that long ago even back in the 1950s everybody we want to kill a big fat bear in the fall like this on berries yeah we didn't have butter and oil and it would kill these bears take the fat just to lay by a winter's worth of butter and oil Wow I shouldn't call it butter but you know something the substitute is bought or you can just spread the fat once you cook it you can spread the fact you know that nothing that's unfortunate everybody can't do that because it's just literally not enough game for everybody if the entire country went hunting now they're not going to it was like I said when I talked started writing about my hunts and the mountains even people that thought they wanted to do it didn't want to do it I mean you yeah not everybody wants to do that yeah it's hard work man it's hard work I I enjoyed it very very much but uh I'm not I'm not scared to work hard and I like new experiences so for me it was it was very exciting and invigorating but I could see someone was a bitch who couldn't handle it oh yeah there's nothing easy nothing easy about carrying all your gear all your survival gear trying to get an animal I mean it sometimes I've been on Hunt's even now that are so tough I wondered how have I ever killed anything with a bow it just seems impossible to get in bell range and make a good shot and then recover the animal and it's just um so tough Rinella was telling me about this moose mmm that they shot where he had to carry it they did nothing but go out to this moose cut it up and carry it back for three days because it was like a nine mile trip yeah so they would go to camp they would get up in the morning go hike out to where the moose was take pieces of the moose put in their packs and then walk back and they did it for three days in a row and he said he wasn't right for two weeks yeah said his body was just broken down yeah no that's uh you know you earn everything you get out of the mountains I'll get it out of you one way or another most people are just not gonna experience that it's unfortunate but when you do do it the people that do do it they kind of one of the thrills of it is that most people are not going to experience that no but I think you should build a respect it you know that's the thing so it's not saying you need to do it but man it's not too much ask to respect what it takes do you find that people disrespect it well I just think that they they minimize their just thinking like oh you know do you think you're a big man from going out and killing you know I get anti hunters who post on my some of my videos or you know from killing an innocent animal it's just like no you don't you don't even get it yeah that's a weird thing that people love to say we love to say that you know you're killing innocent animal there's nothing innocent about being an animal by the way you know animals are living by the wild and that's that's what they're doing there's there's nothing innocent about it it's probably the least innocent thing that a living creature does yeah if they have to kill to survive any animal will yeah I mean that's it's what's about yeah and don't buy the way they'll run you over with those fucking antlers oh yeah don't make a charge you and run those fucking things through you like a shish kebab yeah now I know it's so I just you know I just think so that's that's kind of why I like videoing the work and the effort and all that because you don't necessarily have to do what I do but just respect it you know and that's a thing I mean that's I don't show all that for to try to to get respect but I just want you know I people have an easier time with bow hunting for whatever reason because it seems like it's harder you know then that they'll easily say negative stuff about rifle hunting because they say oh you don't have to be close you can shoot from 400 yards or whatever but with bow hunting for whatever reason we get a little more of a pass because it is difficult so in rifle hunting is hard - I'm not I don't want to say rifle on is easy because it's a whole different deal you're you're hunting in there's more competition with the rifle out there so you're competing it's other guys the animals have been hunted a little more so a little more wary by that time of year so rifle hunting is still tough and those guys have my respect as well but just for the general population seems like bow hunting and bow hunting's cool right now yeah I mean it's gaining in popularity issues it really yeah it's just you know how what would do you tribute that - I don't know Cameron Haynes videos on lies all all me I did it all know I mean from hunger games you know you know what it is Katniss out that well it's just kind of it's just kind of cool and then I get a lot of emails and correspondence from young guys who want to be more badass so to speak and bow hunting I mean shooting a bow is just cool yeah you know well for folks who do only want to shoot anything they don't want to kill an animal you might be a vegetarian whatever you might just be fine John hackle Minh style go into the supermarket and buying your steak nothing wrong with that but I really love archery and I've rediscovered it I didn't when I was kid I was in the Boy Scouts and I enjoyed it then but I never really got into it I just did it a few times and always thought it was fun but man since I picked up the this Bo I guess I got in about a couple of months ago I really enjoy it I just enjoy shooting targets it's really fun right because when you're concentrating on that target you're not thinking of nothing else it's very difficult you're trying to be steady and when you're trying to be steady there's something Zen in that and when in that Zen activity there's something that's it's cleansing or something I mean I don't I don't know what it is but in order to really be accurate with a bow it requires so much discipline yeah it does and that's you know getting out shooting a bow I like getting out in the summer shirt off listening to music just by myself I usually go by myself and just you know there's something about watching an arrow arc and drop into the target and that's just I don't know it's powerful it's relaxing it's a zen-like you know like what you mentioned and I think people see that and then you look at the bows and the bows look cool you know everybody there you know you'll you'll get into it also but your arrow is like your signature so everybody has their arrow and it's got their colors you know what I mean and it's got you can get custom wraps on it so I have wraps safe your is a liar and Fletch it's a beast mode and so your arrow becomes you know everybody if you walk in someplace and you're shooting with other guys everybody looking at your arrow it's just kind of cool so you can customize people they see their bows and they take a lot of pride and how their bow is set up and everybody believes it their setup is better than the next guys because for whatever reason and it's just you know people get so invested in in archery it's just I don't know it's powerful and Mike I've said before bow hunting has changed my life I mean I went from from a kid who had no direction basically to now I know exactly what I want to do and who I want to be and it's you know allowed me to get on talked to joe rogan here in LA bow hunting is that that's just I mean that just seems crazy to me so it's a it's it's just a powerful deal and you're wearing an Under Armour shirt man Under Armour sponsors you I mean they make your shirts they do just dad loan you're in an Under Armor commercial with a wolf yeah now Under Armour they've been my longest sponsor and I think I think they told me I'm their their longest tenured professional athlete really yeah that's incredible mm-hmm how did you get involved with that um it was actually we're at shot show like so 10 years ago I think I walked by their booth and they had there's a picture Randy white he was wearing Under Armour and they had it in their booth he's standing out there with a bow you know rendu I played for the Cowboys Super Bowl MVP and he had his this bow and I'm like I'm gonna dang he looks like a monster he's like 50 some years old when just veins everywhere just a stud I caught my attention I'm like so I talked to Eric Crawford was the guy's name at the at the booth there and I'm like so uh how come you guys are here you know I thought you were sports you know just you know football and baseball things like that though we're getting into hunting I know the head was like the the green or the brown just tight stuff for hunting just that first layer and I said oh that's cool so it just kind of he had seen me I was editing this magazine called Eastman's bow hunting journal and he'd got the magazine so he knew who I was so just kind of started from there I signed on with them and their hunting line now is huge yeah there's a commercial that I make fun of when it comes on because it's so silly there's all these athletes like there's this woman who's like a professional skier I guess there's all these different athletes do all this athletic stuff and then there's a duck dynasty guy was big fat Moonpie face and he's looking around they're talking about athletes and he's blown his duck home like that it's not an athlete that's Willie you can't wits who's Willie the fat guys willing yeah you can't make fun of me I think that's like against some sort of law nope I just did he's a fat fuck and he's got a big fuckin dinner plate face he's big-boned he's fat that dude's fat as fuck that good dude couldn't go hunting with you he's sitting around waiting for ducks to fall this guy man but it's just hilarious that when his fat Moon Pie Face comes on no disrespect that's what it says that's what it says Apple it's like they say the word athletes you know there we make you know clothes for athletes like come on man I know I don't they didn't call me for that they should call you for that is what I'm saying we know do you think America is ready I mean look we have this duck dynasty show right so it's a reality show which is let's be honest it's not really a reality show it's scripted this fake scenarios it's but the premise of the show involves hunting and I think that's fascinating I think I think the show is ridiculous but I like the fact that it's a hugely popular show and the shows about hunting and I I think there's a real hypocritical attitude that a lot of people in this country have because of the fact that food is so readily available because it's so easy to just go to the supermarket and buy food people say well why would you want to get it yourself you must be a cruel person that wants to go out and shoot animals hmm I think even though it's a baby step a show where like a duck dynasty type show where you see these guys that are hunters and it's a hugely popular show or 16 million people watch whatever the hell it is that's good yes that's slowly starting to integrate and it's okay because it ducks and people don't really have much of an affinity to ducks as they do to Bambi you know like a deer hunting show be a little bit more problematic but they need to do a show with you dude this is what I'm getting at a show with you Ellen out there and then I'm telling them right now that listening trust me there's a lot of Hollywood people listen to this show the shows have been made because of people being on the show that would be a there's that fat Moon Pie Face back that shit up this come on son look at that big fat fig you are not an athlete man got a what Lily's dad he's not a stud look at that look at that that's a fat man it's not that you're a stud that's a fat man I know you're being nice but I gotta cut that shit he could be a stud he's got the potential inside of him but he's eating fucking Cheetos yeah so his umpires his dad his dad on that shot on duck dynasty he he was an athlete at I think Louisiana State or something like that but his back he's a quarterback on the football team Willie's dad Phil and his backup was Terry Bradshaw really yeah Wow yeah that's fascinating yeah that's interesting baucom feels all angry at the gays duh no problems with the gays yeah he does oh he's always great see right there right there it was Phil Robertson in football see he was stud yeah one point in time now he's a gay basher so angry about gays gotta let go Phil I don't care about you you shouldn't care about them so but you know as far as me being on the TV show so I nice nice segue and change gears like how you did that that's a professional that's how a good man in the media would do it no I said I have to turn in a contract today for a reality show do you here in LA yeah really yeah that's one of the reasons why you're here um yeah yeah okay we'll talk to me about it afterwards I'll make sure they won't fuck you over because things get tricky in the world of reality TV yeah well this is just for the pilot okay the way you signed on for the pilot you sign up for the rest of your life I have a friend who they asked him to do a reality show and fortunately for him he he has his own business he's doing well but it was his girlfriend's idea she want to do this reality show and he read the contract and he calls me up on the phone he's like listen to this shit is like they own my likeness for a life yeah like they own him for like like what they're realizing because of all you know it from Survivor to Fear Factor all these shows on because they realized like Fear Factor Michael yo is probably the only person that I know of that became famous because of Fear Factor and Michael yo was a comic and he's on a really really nice guy but you're famous yeah but I was famous already it wasn't really famous already but it was on a sec and I don't know who Michael yo is very nice guy he's a comic but my point was that like I guess I I certainly became more famous because of fear factor but fear factor really didn't make too many stars but some of those shows made stars yeah you know some of these reality shows whether it's the bachelor or you know of course like the singing shows like American Idol made a lot of stars so they've realized that there's potential money to be made once your from your on that show they make you a star and then your business you're a brand well they want that but I so they there are some unscrupulous producers and networks there they have these all-encompassing contracts that are insane like you you're on this show and then they fucking own you and they can use your likeness till the day you die they own you forever and it's it's it's insane and people are like I'll take it I want to be famous like they'll do whatever they can and so if you went and did something else say if you did that and the reality show it takes off and does well but or doesn't do well and then gets cancelled and then you wind up doing something else and that becomes it they still own you they said the first guy still owns you okay so this correct over there you need to look at but you need to get a lawyer to look at it it's it's it's a tricky business this world of reality TV and they look at people as commodities and they look at reality as being flexible so the their version of reality is not really reality I mean they're calling it reality shows but a lot of what you're dealing with is these people that were involved in in fiction they were involved in like sitcoms or dramas or what-have-you and they're producing reality TV now so the engineer it it's all fake like they have fake setups fake scenarios I had a problem with the show that I did for sci-fi were an editor put a fake scene in they put a totally they took a video they added sound to the video and they said that a listener or a podcast listener had sent this video and total lie complete fabrication I found out about it I went fucking crazy out of shit fit I couldn't believe they because especially my show was all about trying to find the truth you know a Joe Rogan questions everything except this fake fucking video Bradley but it's standard that's what they've always done they've just been they do it because they think it makes a better they call it creative license right they think it makes a better show mmm it doesn't make a better show they don't have to do it it just they need to fall Cameron Haynes the bow and arrow hunting for elk yeah what would we call it I don't know don't let's do it off the air someone fucking steal our idea off the air we'll come up with a way to do it with you okay you got to be careful though man don't get bed with the wrong cats because uh this is this is a sneaky town you know and they know oh look at this nice guy from Oregon yeah he's a sweetheart Oh Billy probably tells the truth all the time poor bastard probably he's probably honest I'll eat him alive yeah out there hunting and everything no not going we got you contracts whatever whatever don't worry about all that yeah we will to carry you we'll take care of you I think there'll be a great show I've said that about Steve Rinella show to Steve Rinella show in my opinion is the best hunting show on television leaders are great show and it's a great show not just because it's a hunting show it's a great you know quote-unquote reality show but it is a real reality show like he got charged by a grizzly last night the episode that I watched like they were in the woods and they were they were actually bear hunting and a grizzly mother with her cap no we call them Cubs Cubs charged her and charged them and it was fucking crazy yeah see this giant grizzly running through the bush at them it's like yeah whoa yeah that sense and the narration you know just Eve is a really well read guys he's very intelligent articulate so it's fascinating he's an introspective guy too because the wit the way he looks at these scenarios in life itself is really interesting in him you know just talking about grizzly bears and talking about you know the it becomes an interesting show outside of the fact that it's a hunting show yeah ya know you could have a good show even you know where the kill is secondary this is it right here this is back it up so you could see it before she runs at them because it's it's kind of fascinating she was like circling around towards him and I started getting nervous so were they hey grizzly hunting oh yeah yeah but they didn't want the female obviously we came around yeah we're trying to spook her she doesn't care at all I mean well these three culture behind her life I will shoot I'm going to kill this out and she spun it off spins away and Callaghan says I'll never forget I want to give him a t-shirt with him and his moustache and this should smell us now a tea smell is my lady that's a sentence that comes to callaghan's a grizzly bear changes mind besides not the mauler what he's referring to is as she cuts she gets thinner in the winds like a downwind direction you know and so Ryan saying like now the wind will carry my order to realize that were people and we should be messed with and so what he yells is smell us now lady we're saying be kind of our it's like a meat-eater a little dry now seems like she would have known from the rifles going off to well yeah well she heard it as she was running she was probably breathing and yeah growling and everything yeah just probably didn't know exactly what it was until it's too late yeah they get pretty tunnel vision about protecting I think these shows uh there's there's an element of reality in a good hunting show that would be fascinating on regular television and these shows a lot of them they're on the sportsmen Channel the outdoors network or you know these these these what channel is your show on Outdoor Channel yeah Outdoor Channel yeah and so these channels like a lot of people don't go to that area like for me it's like 600 605 604 606 yeah on Direct TV and a lot of folks don't go to that area unless they're looking for Mexican porn that's like a few channel that's 606 isn't a 618 or something well there's a you know some Fox Sports is uh there's Fox Sports 2 or something like that it's up there as well one of those you know some sports channels are up in that area too but you know it's just a weird area of the dial yeah and I think it's unfortunate I think that's the untapped area I don't want to say this for Hollywood because these same fuckheads who make fake scenarios are going to come in and ruin it but a show like meat-eater or show following you around elk hunting with a bow there's so much drama in reality in that without having to add bullshit yeah you know and someone's got to do something like that I mean meteor does but someone else could do it too where you make a pledge like there's going to be lying there's any no.3 yet this is all real real and it's great yeah no emotion real real providing yeah and you know I've had that pitch to me recently about just showing because just like the the train not only the training for the hunt but the camaraderie getting out there like the challenges I do for my beau giving back ya know just that is all part of the story and yeah we're killing an animal at the end hopefully maybe not you know cuz a lot of hunts end with no kill but just the whole journey you know and it seems like it would make good TV but Steve shows a lot of hunts that have no kills I like that I like that he keeps it real like that I hate that expression they'll keep it real yeah other expressions beaten up that is a beaten up and expression but the you know having that ethic his you know he had a mountain lion hunt they didn't even see a mountain ma yeah they went for nine days didn't see one he had a recent elk hunt saw a bunch of elk never got close enough to get a shot at one and you know I think that's important man I think it's it's important to show people that this is it's called hunting it's not called shooting right you know it's it's not here we're gonna shoot animals today come on watch us people think the drive out in the truck and drinking beer or whatever you do and just see something to shoot at it no that's that's definitely not my hunting well that is the problem that the the public opinion of hunting faces is the ignorance you know well Hollywood helps that too does it yeah I mean just like the scene in Wolverines I what you mean yeah right yeah so I mean they're showing supposedly hunters out there they shoot this I think it's actually Wolverine as he was a an animal but shoot him with the poison pot arrow which I don't even I've never even seen a poison pot arrow but so has poison on the arrow shoots him he turns back into hugh jackman or whatever and then he goes and he wants to he's a window are you serious I think you misread it it was a bear Oh wasn't he found the bear oh was that one oh yeah he didn't turn into a bear no well I thought it was a shit out of people man okay so how high were you when you watching this man no I was on a plane oh so I was probably in and out of sleep deed but but the point was is they got this this arrow out of the bear I guess and he went he found the hunters they were at the bar and they're drinking at the bar and he went in there and you know shoved a the poison arrow through the leaders hand it's just like so it's just showing hunters as the bad people you know what I mean and it's just like that doesn't help anybody I've never been to a bar after hunting and definitely never used poison arrows it's just like it's perpetuating that stereotype well yeah and not only that the way you shoot it the poison won't even get to them blow right through them poison being the arrow on the other side of town Yeah right no not even an effective way to transmit poison you know you got to get into the bloodstream yeah you know when you shooting a missile through a bear's body it doesn't work that way yeah that is you know look these are Hollywood stereotypes these classic black hat villains it's just so easy to do it's just lazy yeah I saw it but so I mean yeah I think people just have the have the wrong idea and so having a show that would show that you know success on ELQ with a bow is around 10% so it's like 90% of the guys out there pursuing ELQ with the bow and arrow are failing and it's it's not guaranteed it is really tough showing that struggle and that's why I mean that's one reason why I trained the way I do I don't want to be in that 90 percent you know my goal is to be successful every single year so if you do what the average guy does you're going to fail nine times out of 10 if you do more than average if you do more than anybody else or the standard then maybe you'll have more success and so as it is I kill my bull every single year and it's just I think it's not because I'm any better it's because I just work harder preparing so well you've become better through hard work right you become better with knowledge you become better with training with Fitness with preparation with arrow shooting you shoot arrows every day mm-hmm right yeah yeah so it's just you know and that's but if people could see how difficult it really is and see that like we did film in Australia where we have no food we have no water is 120 degrees drinking piss drinking piss that I think you know that would make compelling TV because they're like wow this is a lot different than I saw in the Wolverine movie you know and I don't know I think I I think it'd be not I don't know I think it'd be important to get out there because hunters are the number one conservationists there are and sharing that story yeah I I agree and you know some people find that contradictory it's like I had a conversation with someone we were talking about people and I was saying well okay if you if you could only you know if you only hunted like one person a year but the rest of the people you made sure you fed them and you took care of them they got great education and took care of their environment made sure the streets are clean would it be okay to go out and hunt one person right you know people were like fuck no and so like when you apply that to animal hunting it's for a lot of people that's sort of the same sort of feeling they have but what they don't understand is as the apex predator people don't like to think of as us is the apex predator especially if you're a vegetarian or if you're an animal rights lover but there's a war going on between all life-forms on this planet we are just so far ahead of the other animals that we forgot it's a war and we forgot that we have these POWs camps in our cities we call them zoos ok and that's what that is those are prisoner of war camps that's what we dominate this planet and the reason why you can get out of this office and go walk down the street and not worry about getting mauled is because we paved this motherfucker and we killed everything that can kill us and we made sure that anything that comes in we call the cops and they sent helicopters and they fucking circle the area with a flashlight until they find that cat and then they tranquilize it and they get it the fuck out of here we this is our domain and you don't like to think it's our domain because you don't have to do any of the work right but the reality comes into you full force if you're alone in Idaho with a bow and arrow and you get circled by a bunch of howling beasts and they're trying to take the elk away from you comes real clear then fuck yeah it does yeah we are the apex predators whether you're a predator or not the human animal is the apex predator and as that we have to be the stewards of the land we have to manage this whole situation and that includes managing predators it includes managing game animals it includes the whole kit and caboodle and that's what hunters are that's what hunters dollars do is they they put that hundreds of the grassroots out there feet on the ground making it happen and if you don't do that you know what the other option is you got to pay someone to go kill these animals which is even more ridiculous then you have to take taxpayer money away to go take animals that are made out of food and you got to kill them like these are animals that people could have paid to go kill and then enjoy the food themselves now you got to hire like what they're doing the Hamptons I'm heard about that no New York mmm they have oh dear massive deer population so they're hiring snipers they're trying to figure out what to do they might spend money on ready for this strap in birth control for deer you're talking about spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to give deer food with birth control in it to keep them from breathing they're made out of food yeah there's plenty people who would like to go and help them control those animals and pay to do it well the problem is that it's an urban area right and it's become they've let it get so out of control that the surrounding areas you know where you would have a safe area where you can hunt especially bowhunt you can't do it so it's so crazy like they're gonna have to hire snipers thinking that they're gonna have to figure out a way to I mean you don't want the hunters roaming around the Hamptons especially I mean I wouldn't mind you doing it but you know what I'm saying like averaged Yahoo yeah the average dude you know you find out he can go hunting in the Hamptons and you know I don't know man I mean I think you should have to have like a black belt in hunting to go hunting a Hamptons yeah I hear you even then I don't know if I'd be really cool with you hunting your playground no no your arrow misses the mark and goes flying into some kid on slide my arrow what not yours right okay you meaning that other guy out there that doesn't know what the fucking stone I missed once but it's I bet you did but it's that's a that's the reality of the situation is that we're the ones as the intelligent creatures that can communicate we're the ones who have made an assessment we've made a detailed analysis of all the different animals and the numbers and we monitor them on a yearly basis and folks who don't know they don't appreciate that I was in the Hunter when I was young and I didn't understand hunting and I thought there was something fucked up about it I would say why would anybody want to kill a deer Mandy or deer a beautiful I was a fisherman I used to go fishing yeah but that's where it ended for me because I can't relate to a fish fishing for me is like tricking aliens like they live in this water world that I came and see in I throw something in there and pull it out and eat it like I can't relate to that right you know they're running around breathing water like I can't you I got no you don't even take care of they're young they're just like you're you're on your own get the fuck out of here like I did it was a different thing for me so I can relate to people that can't relate to hunters hmm yeah that uh and I don't know I think getting down there to the bow shop and even just like you said shooting a bow you don't necessarily have to be a hunter but if you can listen to a hunter and kind of listen to their stories and listen to it you don't I mean you don't have to go kill but a lot of guys learn a lot of good life lessons out in the mountains and maybe you can pick up on that I like hanging out at the you know the shop to set up your bow yesterday or not yesterday day before I think was is the bow rack in Springfield Oregon and that's like it's like a bar with no alcohol as far as listening to stories it's awesome sure I love sitting on the stool picking things up from other guys and just hearing stories and that's a you know you don't have to be a hunter to enjoy that and enjoy firing a few arrows it's a it's soothing well people that participate in the same sort of discipline they enjoy that camaraderie together they understand each other in the way that maybe other folks don't you get that from jujitsu gym you know you get that from a kickboxing gym you get that from you know a CrossFit studio you get that from anything that you do where the people can sort of relate is unusual activity that you partaken and i think that that's that's something about archery you know when you go like well I did the place that I went to the archery outpost in Los Alamitos there's a bunch of people around they're talking about the all of you've seen the new Hoyt you know they got a new cam on the matthews and this has got a oh they got a the bow tech insanity 355 feet per second and blah blah blah you know all that shop talk and it's a lot of people are missing that sort of camaraderie in their everyday life because most days from 9:00 to 5:00 you don't get to talk about what you want to talk about you have to talk about what you're getting paid to talk about you got to talk about what your job entails and for most people they're trapped trapped in this this world like you know unfortunately you said you are I'm sorry I didn't say that get this reality show brother get cracking should be right up there with that fat Moon Pie Face guy on TV sounds good no ducks though just elk yeah bugling elk and arrows and bears and you know everything stuff cool stuff yeah Mountains yeah dude listen man this
