tea makers of alpha brain shroom tech Schrute expose my alpha Brian already took it once but fuck it this is a late night podcast let me talk Matt my man Duncan Trussell hello friends we had to uh we had to do another podcast today ladies and gentlemen I couldn't just leave well enough alone he wants one of these but I would love some here we go can you snort these I guess you probably could po wouldn't be right way to go huh what out with it whatever nootropics it's all the informations available on it calm and that's what alpha brain is it's a nootropic essentially it's a blend of

up buddy fucked up the whole world yeah you don't have to finish a sentence it's written somewhere I'll tell you it's gonna need some of these fucking alpha brand's who the people living in Dallas Texas right now getting dusted with the poison they're spraying over to kill those mosquitoes of West Nile once they're kent they're publicly kim trailing dallas was some kind of insecticide because these mosquitoes there have West Nile virus nine people have died so far holy shit yeah that's no fun and there's people are just writing about it somebody's throat hey let's let's get through with this then what oh sorry let's get through this commercial let's do it sorry ladies and gentlemen the Alpha brain has got him speaking crazy he wants to give the subjects before the commercials even over he's insane gotta go Duncan Trussell there's a lot we have so much to cover new to honor calm we have this hemp protein powder called hemp force which is amazing naturally sweetened with stevia maca and raw cocoa or also in it and raw cocoa is a great antioxidant it's really delicious - it's the best tasting protein I've ever had and the the easiest digest because it's a hemp protein it doesn't make you feel bloated at all your body has like a really easy time digesting it so I like it if I have to workout in like an hour or something like that I can get away with it where I couldn't if like it's a whey protein I'm gonna get a little bit more farty up in this what is that there's cheese it's way way is like awesome milk forget it it's like living inside a coffin in my office yeah well your body's not really supposed to be processing that kind of milk because it's milk without all the digestive enzymes you're supposed to drink milk only from your mother right that's it but if you're gonna drink milk from an animal cow's milk is the way to go raw make sure they have an organic diet of grass they just eat grass and then that milk is actually really nutritious for you and it has built in like there's there's enzymes in it and all the stuff that gets killed when you pasteurize it and that stuff is what makes it easier for you to tolerate so people who are lactose intolerant oftentimes if you get them to drink natural milk they have no problem with it this is like of you know how like you think of videos that you'd like to see like if you had five videos that you see from any point in time when you go anywhere in time and see like YouTube clips right I would give anything to see the first man to drink milk from a cow that first person who figured out that you could fucking do that like we have so much to talk about did this kid see this car show so because we're gonna miss all the people to listen to us one serious they're not gonna get that part oops

Sprint's like a thirty second sprint oh my god it's ruthless to it it's amazing it's incredible workout you guys are like bioengineering some army or something smart pills get people smarter stronger more aware to be no order there is also no end to this commercial because I don't have a fucking musical player thing I don't have one so let's fake it beginning battle robes now starts robes took at Russell the fuck is going done you know I just speaking of Glenn Don what's going on Don's going on what's going I saw a really speaking in battle ropes I saw this very disturbing video today if you seen the thing about old dudes with broadswords chap chopping the heads off pigs whoa no way it's fucking weird dude because they're like oh my god they're not like warriors they're just older guys that maybe a knife convention or something I'm not sure what it is shit do they have a broadsword and they're just lopping off the heads of oh my god like hanging upside down just laughing them off and the fucking swords it really does demonstrate bloody battles used to because they just it's like they just slide right through the neck of that fucking pig just slide through like a knife through butter and the sound is so gross this flick and these weird old dudes just swinging these swords it's fucking strange man Jesus Christ so glad that we got past that phase of human history thank God some of the visit of gun yeah and that funny I hate if I gotta choose i'll take a gun yeah yeah I'll take it I'm sure there's far less violence today than there ever was when they were swinging swords around I'm sure it's like no comparison well yeah I mean you could just think how easy it was if you're in a bad mood to kill somebody back then there's no DNA fingerprints if you're just wandering through a town you just see a particularly plump young child drag that thing you know it's loose so what isn't it weird there's no Amber Alert that was not that long ago in human history you know oh no man the weirdest thing of all humanity is the the humanity that preys upon its young it's like their yoke their youth was ruined and so now they want to ruin youths it's almost always the same story so it's a scary frightening aspect of humanity you're talking about people that want to you know abduct kids oh yeah he wants yeah but it's it's almost always comes for something being done horrible to them well yeah man that's the opposite of this thing called the disciplic succession which is this idea that people get super super smart from time to time by meditating or drugs or something happens to them and then those people like transmit that to the closest friends which gets transmitted down until it like ends up in the present moment it's called the disciplic succession you know how like you get it's like one thing to hear someone hat from someone happy right but when you get around someone who's really advanced and really happy you walk away with this kind of like extra thing it like gets something into you know it like they give you something from you around them so the idea is that certain times people have like a massive burst of that you know like the monkey that came out of the tree or the monkey that first used a certain tool certain people have that exact same kind of like blast and the people in the close proximity to them they get it and it transforms them and then they give it to the next person that goes through time disciplic succession in the same way there's an opposite of that there's like a an anti enlightenment anti happiness just a foul poison that started way way way back when and gets transmitted from one person to the next to the next and this endless chain of shit that ends up with like people doing monstrous things it's quite curious it's almost like a race between those two it's weird how pliable the human consciousness is you know it's weird how the human consciousness depending upon how your race can be thrust in so many different directions you know it's so weird like we are so not like in an easy thing to develop we're like we really were SuperDuper complicated we have all sorts of crazy emotions irrational ideas of the past irrational views of our own memory you know and we're all going through this whole weird thing together trying to feel our way through it well it's complete we're so irrational we're so it's such a strange animal well it sucks man we've got these sedimentary layers of times in history where you you are just being ravaged by famine and disease and yeah it's fuck it was rough man I mean if we think about that like even now people aren't safe and you can call 911 and have cops come to your house within 30 minutes you know depending on where you're at sometimes faster if something catches on fire dial nine-one-one little red trucks come and put it out they just trucks with water inside of them if there's no water around think about that but not very long ago man something catches on fire it's like that shit's going down you know if somebody if your friend hurts himself you're not calling 911 you're gonna wrap like 30 bandages and just hope for the best it's like so that means that people there's a lot of fear embedded into us genetically from those times you know there's an angry little eight man living inside everybody you can see anytime you get mad you can that's him howling out in the depths of your being you know and no the difference is some people still listen to that howling eight freak who's like terrified and screaming out of the universe and believe that that's then and they become that crazy primal scared being and some people have started to realize or completely realize that that's just one old sort of almost outdated appendage a psychic appendage stuck inside humans you don't have to listen to the screaming fucking ape every time something bad happens you can operate from another place you know yeah you can I mean we're moving towards that as long as we can keep this whole society thing together keep giving people food and purpose we can we can slowly but surely make these leaps into the next stage of consciousness yes we gotta keep everybody fed you know keep riots from breaking out it's really hard to keep rights from breaking out when you're blatantly lying to people you know yeah that's the problem this fucking Julian Assange thing is really good gives me the spooks man because it's like well explain to the folks who don't know what the fuck's going on what's happening so Julian Assange is this guy who created a website called WikiLeaks and he was kind of the face behind this website that people send secrets government secrets people sent him a shitload of files that showed a helicopter gunning down reporters among other fucked up things and so he uh he got in a lot of trouble with the military industrial complex essentially just pissed off the military industrial complex he he and ended up because if something happened in Sweden no one really knows exactly what it is but the UK is treating it like whatever he did in Sweden like he just went around fisting nuns and setting fucking building is on fire like they are doing everything to get him back to Sweden for what I think is a relatively small charge that's the party line I think it's called surprise surprise sex a very odd thing man yeah and and also men not to be a complete fucking conspiratorial weirdo but a lot of people say that there are some basic things if you want to get somebody that you can do and one of them is you set them up with some kind of sex crime you know what I mean you can you can entrap somebody I'm not saying he's I don't know what happened honestly but well you know in society now if you were running an empire and you had an enemy in a really public enemy it goes past the point where you can just assassinate them like in the good old days right like in the good old days if someone had some information you're just fucking sinning is one of your assassins to come through their window and give them a quick snip on the throat leave your fucking sigil or whatever your sign was because sometimes you want people to know that your enemies died and that was it now assassination is a little more complex you know you've got it like if someone gets in the public eye they can't just suddenly hang themselves you know if suddenly a saw and just dangling in the in the embassy there if they came into the in the bathroom and Assange is hanging by a fucking rope wearing women's panties right wearing women's panties with maybe some grub and kiddie porn scattered around we don't know it just freaked out in there from the stress and he tried to do auto-erotic asphyxiation cut to CNN CNN know barely a peep about the wee boy scandal boom pervert pedophile Assange found dangling in the embassy wearing women's underwear pink with Mickey Mouse pictures on him you know what I mean it's like that that's a way that they try to defame you and make you seem like you were um not valid that you were no one should have been listening to you in the first place that's one way to assassinate somebody this in this Lee borer scandal look at what exactly is behind that they were adjusting the fucking interest rates they were like fucking with interest rates not not based on real reality but based on the urgings of the government for my completely low level understanding of this shit but basically it somehow is just a one of the indications of the things that we hear all the time from some like really hardcore conspiracy theorists who were saying that the the you know world economies are just being controlled by bankers who are shifting numbers to benefit themselves you know and this is like of course the military you know industrial complex or war quite often is benefiting someone in a massive way you know so it's just part of that idea that the way things are happening on the planet right now aren't based on some form of humanistic logic but are based on economic that the economic drives a very very small amount of people and make a shitload of money when bad shit goes down you know like whenever there's a fucking war there are people who make so much fucking money man I mean it's nice you know like the way if like I fucking was the Bukit like get my own TV show like if I if I was able to sell a show all right that would be a big deal for me that'd be awesome that'd be an incredible moment my life in that same way that I'm excited about that there's people who are like oh come on Iran say one more anti-semitic thing come on if we just get one more sign that you want to attack Israel we can fucking get in there and if we get in there they're gonna need a lot of my new XP 49 double double-edged fucking missiles and I'm gonna make a ton of money you know and those people have lobbyists that talk to senators and congressmen and their point is the reason isn't fur the reason isn't because it's like you know I imagine it's like when you're fucking a whore you know the reason she's fucking you is from money she's not fucking you because she likes you she's fucking you because she wants money from you and the same way these are these are powerful conglomerates are making moves that are based on their own economic gain I this isn't obvious I don't mean to be so fucking obvious right but you know the idea was that I mean they thought we were supposed to be shielded from that that was the idea yeah it wasn't supposed to be possible yeah when that became possible and an obvious and policy that's when the real problems began as far I mean as far as like my own person awareness when I started seeing it it became much more blatant it seemed like later on in life and this most recent Supreme Court ruling about it where they said that corporations can act as individual right which is insanity you can just give as much money as they want to give like you guys can work out a deal I'm gonna be president how much do you want to give to my campaign how about a million bucks how about I love you all right I love you to work together all right give me some money bitch yeah it's quite sad it's a um it's a sad situation and now it's a strange situation it's a strange situation and it's a it's a situation that up until this point I mean it was pretty easy to hide this shit yeah you could really control information yeah you could people couldn't just look in their phone and fucking Google anything yeah it's almost like everybody's waking up going wait what what what what you know what the effect reminds me of Joe I just fucking bought a TV ah I'm an American I haven't had a TV in so long I went to fuckin Best Buy and buy damn one of those not long as you try to be like mr. Bohemian I don't need a TV it was um I don't know since I've been in that fucking in the house yeah nine months listen to TV is awesome anybody who tells you the TV's not awesome is an asshole no TVs awesome no I know what listen I didn't have a TV out of some hate for TV I didn't have a TV because I understand my compulsion to plug that xbox and pop in Skyrim and just vanish from society for four years yeah that's my problem but the thing about this new fucking TV is um the pictures too good really it's too clear it's like you watch the x-men and it's like seeing like people who just walked out of like a fucking West Hollywood aerobics class they just look too real it looks silly it's too real it something about the pictures too good yeah there's a different quality to it where it makes old movies look like shit yes it's too good it looks silly you know one looked a really bad man I saw aliens to the other day the the movie still holds up it's still a great movie but there's some background scenes where they had a painted spaceship yeah and it was so bad is so obvious in that and with the inclination with HD so in the same way it's weird because it's like that technology is imitating I think what's happening to people's perception of things somehow when a president starts doing the presidential talk or when you see a like what's happening in fucking the UK where they saying with Assange no no listen we have a right to what we have to enforce this this thing is the the deportation of Assange to Sweden it is has nothing to do with a thing or a leaked terabytes of information about military interests reflects nothing to do without that's just a coincidence we've got to get him out to Sweden because he did a surprise rape now surprise sex tonight it's a pride sex yeah I guess it's kind of the same thing well what happened was they were they had had sex and then he was in bed with her and then he had no condom can I stop you for a second supposedly I want to apologize to everyone that I just used the word rape didn't so sorry I said that whatever user word power I will never use it again the words done I will never use that word I've taken that word and I have tied it to a fucking bed it's the new faggot rapist in the foyer I don't even minor illogical system cannot process that word I don't hear any bad words I've got a new I've got an I've been taking a new fucking um no tropic it makes it so that I can't hear offensive words we can enjoy a comedy show because nothing ruins a comedy show more than when a comedian said something unethical or immoral oh I hate it I'm just trying to have a good fucking time yeah I don't want to be lectured I don't want you throwing your lefty beliefs my way oh my lefty beliefs no no I'm saying to the comedian what's our hypothetical comedian that we're just making up yeah yeah comedian person blogger Swamp toad healthy we got er so the mouth shut we gotta so the sinners mouth shuts we can't let them speak we can't let them talk about the things that happen the world we don't like what is so weird about people that they're so easy to program like there can be programs so many different ways they look at like people in North Korea like all crying for real in the street when a their dictator died I mean they were like for real legit cry in the street and then look at people in America and see how much different we are then you know the people in China then rebel in India it's so weird that we're so adaptable and we're so fucking variable we're so different it's it's such as we the strangest fucking animal ever we are a strange we are a strange fucking creature man we went from background to foreground it's like all the it's like animals are so absorbed in the nature when you watch a fucking squirrel running around and you see how like in nature the thing is just part of the earth almost just the earth humans are like a few steps past that so it's like we came out of a picture we like came from the background into the foreground this is the this is the idea that they tried to metaphorically talk about in the story of the Garden of Eden which is you know edia before they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they were unaware that they were naked it was like they're more more animals and then this represents a I think McKenna has said you know this is the representation of the expansion of the neocortex this is the beginning of human brain development is suddenly becoming aware of ourselves of our bodies of the fact that we have a fucking body because you know animals they don't think about their buttholes you know like dogs aren't thinking about like what their balls look like when they're running they're not thinking about their their fucking hair if it's messed up that doesn't cross their mind a dog's never worried about its hair being messed up but humans like we fixate on that shit like we spend so much time thinking about how ashamed or ridiculously we proud we are of our bodies it's fucking hilarious how much time you really consider how much time you fixate on your body one way or the other no we're we're just into our bodies sure so yeah man that's this um that's one of the weird bizarre aspects of human being human is your where you're aware of all the stuff you like you know you're aware of why you like you like you it's a puzzle to you you see a woman with a thin waist and a big ass and big breasts and you're like you don't even know why there's like the triggers are going off evolutions like that's the shape you're looking for that's the shape you're looking for cats like calves from being accentuated by the high heel is fucking weird how weird is it that every woman shaves her legs like you have to like that's not really what their legs look like especially girls with dark hair yeah you know any-anything look really uh what would be the word spicy you know any like Greeks or something along those lines Italians a lot of those girls if they didn't shave their legs oh my god do you know what kind of craziness you'd be looking at well as long as you have you ever let your your whole pubic area girl before you trimmed it me yeah give a trim it yeah I just remember but there have been long long periods where I'm sure the thing is just and if you look at it but it's just ridiculous it's like all over the place it's just a chaos yeah yeah but and then you imagine that yeah covering your entire body oh yeah and that's what we used to be just like a lot of people still Bush never see you know was it Joey George the animal Steele cuz that was the name was it's a wrestler I think it was George the animal Steele something the animal Steele and he was he looked like a fuckin gorilla he was the hairiest human being ever he was huge it is big giant fucking you know superhuman muscle yeah and hair covering his whole body Robin Williams this guy's more freaky Robin Williams is pretty fucking hairy yeah but this guy's built with your gorilla toys I mean it's like it's like it's real close I mean he was he was in one of those movies I feel like he was in a movie I'm not remembering it right well man the the thing yeah I think he did I think he had a career in like horror movies or something we're very close to something that just it's no longer here anymore but people's minds are still some people are still functioning at that level and then some people know that some people are still functioning at that level and understand how the nervous system works and are really good at tricking people you know because once you're like just like well if you still identify with a howling screaming animal inside of you yeah you're really easy to manipulate you know it's not that hard to fucking trick a monkey into going for a banana it's like a little edge and airily easy to get a monkey to go for a banana I want you to come over here and just look at what George Steele looks like so you see what what what kind of ridiculousness I'm talking about it doesn't look real huge dude covered in hair and he's like bent over looking at you like he's about to choke it looks like a stop-motion character from Clash of the Titans or something - Larry doesn't seem real yeah weird yeah and he did some acting I think it was in like yeah he was an Ed Wood I believe with Johnny Depp yeah hey fucking crazy-looking - but he used to like eat the the the corner like you they would have a turnbuckle he would grab it and bite it and start eating it and ripping it apart he's fucking crazy what a weird life that must have been huh being a professional wrestler yeah that's a really weird life that's one of the weirdest aspects of our culture ever professional wrestling you mean like yeah worldwide wrestling yeah yeah world wrestling entertainment I haven't watched wall wrestling since the great kabuki man people still love it dude oh really well it does really well it's fucking crazy what is it man it's like a form of fucking dance basically isn't it like it's like choreograph fights yeah that you know are fake but it was fit bands fucking hard to pull off dude those guys getting beat up those guys are always throwing each other - right shit but it's not it's not real fighting it's like a form of gymnastics tumbling Jordans like it's a work you know it's what it is it's a hard they do what you call would call hard work what they really they slap each other occasionally they'll fucking they'll close off line each other they really slam each other to the ground and you can really get fucked up doing it you they all have like you know back problems and shoulder problems and but the cool thing about it is not just the fact that they're fake fighting it's that there's a narrative yeah weird rudimentary narrative that runs through the fucking thing or they're everyone's has rivalries yeah and and there's a there's always a villainous guy who has shit like generally like supernatural undertones like maybe he's come from Hell or something right there's like always that a new taker yeah these mysterious men you've emerged from like the darkest parts of the world to slap each other's back really when I was in high school it was Bob Backlund he was the champion and the big one was that everybody want to see five for the title was Jimmy the Superfly Snuka oh yeah yeah yeah and it was a big deal man and he would put up his three fingers like this and he would go I love you that was what he was telling everybody when he had his fingers oh I love you and he fly through the air he would fall lie through the air dude and land on guys and what a beating his body must have taken doing that man but did you ever did some ridiculous shit I remember when I was a kid getting into some fairly serious arguments of people over whether or not wrestling was real oh look is you would be like no no this is fucking real dude do you think this is fake you fucking think the great kabuki like a guy could just blow steam out of his mouth and poison a man he's real you were getting these like deep oh yeah before they had to admit it was fake for like right but you see that that's purposes you see it's still happening see this is the funny thing it's still fucking happen yeah only now when you tell somebody you know um our Congress is bought by corporations and it's not really representing the people anymore and you can you cannot you uh you know that some that's that's real it's pretty obvious by now you tell that to people and they'll be like no it's real it's real it's real it's the realest thing there is how could you say that's not real these men these fine men are the high seats of power they're not getting bribed by corporations no never they have integrity yet again and again time and time again we see that these people have been supported by lobbyists at the point where I saw someone on put like on one of the I think one of the presidents or I don't remember which it was maybe I don't remember who it was maybe Boehner the guy looks like Howdy Doody I can remember that was but put all their main corporate sponsors like a NASCAR outfit you know like they said like senators and congressmen should start having to wear I think Robin Williams had those special how I did is that he said I saw a picture of anyone but but the the the the it's the truth but there's still people who want who don't want to believe I believe that's the truth and this is the fucking problem because it's not just politics it's religion you you there's people I just have you seen this fucking it keeps popping up on the internet but it's like this idea that evolution has had that the way some and are the creationists believe it the way some animals got from one continent to the next is from rafts of the forests uprooted by the great flood so like bears and rabbits and squirrels were just like floating across the ocean on logs like they people believe that stuff creation is food imagine that just logs covered in rabbits and puppies and eagles it's this craziest thing fucking ever but but there but people believe that right now well there have been guys who have invested money to try to design and recreate the ark how they're thinking if could have worked dudes have done that like there's some rich dude I think he's in Holland and he's recreating an art right based on qubits and whatever the fuck whatever fucking crazy measurement they use like you when the Lord's work how many fucking lunatics right now how many crazy people right now in neighborhoods and trailer parks across America are in their backyard constructing an art because they think I'm talking build an ark I bet there's at least four hundred people right now hammering in their backyard on a fucking Ark because they had a weird dream I told them to build an ark there's definitely more than one I've definitely heard of more than one person talk about grandiose imagine you thinking you're really Noah but that's like you know if you're cuckoo for cocoa puffs that's a that's a that's an entertaining one you see and you think you're Noah oh my god I mean but dude imagine if like your fucking brain speaking to me wait what hope what Joe it is I the Lord I'm going to flood the planet because I'm pissed that's why I always thought it's hilarious when you see like a fake seance or a seance it looks like obviously full of shit hold on I'm getting a signal he's saying he's saying there's a hole where his heart used to be what does that mean does anyone know what that means you speaking to me I just fucking saw on Trinity Broadcasting Network you ever watched TBN yes so I decide I'm Rena D Broadcasting Network this fucking televangelists say do you want that new house do you want that new condo that $2,000 isn't gonna get you a condo or a new house plant that seed money in my ministry and it will come back to you tenfold a hundredfold so this guy is on TBN compelling people who've been saving up their money to buy a house to send that money to his fucking ministry he's tricking dumbasses oh yeah and just funneling money to him in the idea that they're gonna send $2,000 and because he says it's so terrible what he does he's like try aiming it look it people like illegal immigrants one of the things he said is you know Juan whoever sent two thousand dollars to me his green card had already been denied but he went to the mailbox and he got a letter underneath his bills and he opened that letter and it said he had been accepted his green card had been accepted so you're like trying to hit he's like the most desperate humans who are like as a combination desperate and dumb watching TV late at night and they they just have a little bit of money left but maybe they're a little drunk oh they're like yeah this is it this is what I need to do this is what I fucking need to do and give money to the Ministry of father fuckface and it's gonna come back it's crazy whenever they start doing that that's seeding that's pretty recent it used to be just a donation thing but then someone came up with the brilliant idea of saying that you're planting seeds and then you get it back well let's see the pleasant just a donation anymore it became like you know I mean like it wasn't like that for a while for a while was just donations but the problem is man with all this stuff this is what our religion gets confusing is a lot of the metaphysical principles these people are throwing out there they're real if you put good energy out into the world it does come back to you it is true if you put if you put good things out in the world it's like throwing a fishing line out and there's a really good chance you're gonna reel back something awesome that you didn't expect to get but it's like these sons of bitches they're like making it as though there's an actual spiritual economy in the universe where if you that there's some kind of new quantifiable bank account balance where if you send 2,000 okay 20,000 based on some specific crazy laws that's that's where it gets odd and that's where it's kind of fucked up because it is an innocent because the wounded antelopes have always been jacked by the waterholes that's just the way it always been if you're so fucking dumb that you think that that guy is really gonna be able to do that with your money it's almost like you you have to exist as an example of folly you have to think exist as an example of like when anybody gets scammed by one of those Nigerians yes one of them I watch this one thing they were talking about it was a dude it was really sad man the guy just didn't have any companionship we didn't didn't didn't have a girlfriend really wanted a girlfriend and just spent all his retirement money sending it to this Nigerian scammer went to Europe to meet this chick twice twice twice he kind of broke down during the show brutal because he has his daughter or someone had to tell him that the woman wasn't real someone close to him was trying to explain to him that the woman wasn't real I just wanted to believe he went to Europe twice to meet her dude twice and like she said she couldn't find him oh my god I'm getting called back by my family laughs and this poor fucking guy Bennett Bennett hook line secure and everybody spoke to her there just kept sending money see it's really cool man because we keep going back to talking about believing in bullshit and the effect that it has on your life the immediate detrimental effect it has in your life to believe bullshit no matter what the fucking thing is it always fucks up your life whatever the fuck it is if you believe in something that's crap you end up making decisions based on crap and so then you've just summoned more and more negativity into your life from believing in bullshit now where it gets fucking weird man and we're like there's a part of me that is always combating what the apparent violent and brutal merciless aspect of nature with my own instinct to want everybody to be ok and and like those two things are really fucking confusing for me because you look out into the world you know and you see any on the nature Channel just you know watch a fucking hyena taking a bath and the carcass of a fucking elephant watch fucking on those those tigers in the Russian circus who just attack those dudes or look at the fucking in China of them the monstrous way that there's you know slice the skin off of living dogs or you can go on and on with examples of this kind of brutal the slaughterhouses everywhere you know the brutality of nature you know and and and you can go into this Nietzschean mind state where you're like we you know yes that is that is as much a part of the universe as anything else and then there's another part of you that if you start thinking that way can become a bit a bit nihilistic where you start thinking like oh well if there's a wounded antelopes than why I help them you know what I mean but what let let them suffer for their own good let them come to understand life through their own transgressions so that they can grow on their own and become powerful by their own volition and that's fucking cool man there's part of me that really loves that idea and then there's another part that's like yeah but what if you know there's an actual concerted effort at work right now a concerted effort by a kind of a combination of many different conglomerates who have recognized the psychological makeup of most human beings and have figured out very intelligent ways to intentionally manipulate those human beings to become consumeristic so that they can gain it from from these people's lack of education and understanding I think very educated people are often consumeristic as well I think consumerism is a byproduct of work and doing a lot of work that you don't really want to do it makes it makes you want to buy things well enjoy that buying things when they work hard that's part of it but this is like from this I think we've talked about this before the century of the South about the what's called black psychology or the the using psychology but to manipulate people into buying shit or giving the impression that they need something right so it's like but it's an art form that they've almost got it down to a sign and it's a necessity if you're gonna have a successful economy in a capitalist country you got to keep selling shit right you don't want to make something that's gonna last forever but how did we regulate it do we do we do we just let it what happened so that you can have preachers that you can have like those crazy guys on TV saying that if you send me money I'll give you ten times do we just let that happen I mean what what if you were if you were inclined to decide you know if you had to cast your vote one way or another what how much do we limit well then yeah I'm sorry just we're gonna say like because if that guy's not legitimate okay what if something comes along that is legitimate what if there's some sort of sustainable new environment that's being built and they want everybody to throw some money in and and become a part of it and you know and they offer you like a tangible deal and it's based on the same sort of spiritual concepts you're gonna automatically connect it with those other assholes well now I know this is the problem man I mean this is I can't stop it you know I'm saying it's like you couldn't stop it because you would limit stopping it for a real pose he's gonna stop it - yeah who's gonna make the decisions who's gonna say no no this is the right thing and that's the wrong thing and this is good and that's bad it's like it's almost I only an egomaniac would ever even consider the notion of trying to take charge you know and hmm so it is this you know we we end up in this curious predicament of trying to determine okay well then how much do we let happens for example what's happening in Syria right now how much do we let happen how many more people get fucking bombed in this weird war between an oppressive regime and the people who are rising up and it is an oppressive regime the guys but it like the guy's been around too long the elections are fucked it's serious always been notoriously a kind of fucked up place it's like now there's a civil war happening so how much do we lose who takes the side of it you know one who takes the side of Assad that's his name right Assad what who takes his side who's really gonna stand up for that fucking guy you know what I mean and and and I'll tell you one person who was Russia you know what I mean so Russia's standing up for this guy now we're in a weird situation I don't know how much they're supporting but the that's where things get fucked up because it's like okay I guess we just back off and let a bunch of people get slaughtered because that's the way of the world this is like you know the hardcore libertarians believe this I think Ron Paul's like this isn't our business well his also his contention is that we've created a lot of business that we shouldn't have created that we've made things our business and things we've had blowback because of things that we've done that we shouldn't have been doing in the first place the idea of policing the world yes that's a problem we definitely put our fucking dicks and a great many hornet's nest but it's like the the but if you look at it from like a perspective of just you you're in you're in your apartment right you're in your apartment and two doors away someone starts screaming bloody murder what do you do what do you do are you gonna fucking call 9-1-1 of course you're gonna try to help - maybe you're maybe gonna go over there and see if you can fucking help this person right so now all of a sudden they're let's spread the radius out you know two buildings down that's happening to someone now let's spread it out more you know two miles away at a certain time someone's gonna get fucking hurt how when do you stop helping yeah and right now it appears that when you stop helping is when it's outside the fucking boundaries of your country at that point you're like no no it is the way of the world that people are slaughtered by mortars and guns and executions and dragged into secret prisons it's the way of the world and then it's a really weird fucking situation because it's like well it's also the way the world to get people out of fucking secret prisons and to help people who are in trouble you know it's the story of our fucking you know our history the goddamn the French helped us you know it's like sometimes people need help when do you help it's a real fucking question it's a real it's one of the big questions facing us right now it's like when do you do something you know like if in the UK if they fucking storm into the equity embassy the the Ecuadorian Embassy do you say what is the Ecuadorian if they storm into that fucking thing in breaking the sovereignty of Ecuador which is essentially invading Ecuador if you go into a fucking oh yeah so in that case obviously when they if they just fucking start throwing out the whole game yeah or it's got where they're like you know we're just gonna do what we want and as long as it suits us we'll make it seem like there's laws in place here right well know it comes down to it we're gonna fucking do what we want isn't that kind of crazy that you got it like a whole building that's a different country and that building has sovereignty and this guy can go there and say can I get asylum and they're like yes good cool I'm staying here and now he's there like wait hold up and wait he can imagine with the stress of being in asylum can you imagine the stress of being Julian Assange it so must be unbearable I mean the guy he's crazy but he has a giant Paul's giant giant Bible dude that guy's gonna be remembered as one of the great heroes man that son of a bitch that poor fucking bastard nobody that guy made a real goddamn sacrifice cuz like I don't care how much money he was making from WikiLeaks I don't care if he was making a fuckload of money for WikiLeaks man he knew when he leaked those documents do you realize like when you get that much fucking information that shows that some fucked up shit is going on the moral responsibility to ethical your responsibility you have at that moment because you know that the moment you let this shit out you're fucked well forget it forget it game over you've made the decision like alright I'm gonna fucking throw myself on the fire and this incarnation just because it feels better than sitting back and festering with the knowledge that there's fucking innocent people getting gunned down for no goddamn reason and that's being kept away from the people who are funding the fucking bullets blowing up their heads you're like god dammit I gotta fucking do it and you do it and you're a badass and then you end up fucking holed up in the guy a goddamn embassy and you know that even if you do get out of that embassy even a 50,000 Guy Fawkes mask wearing anonymous vigilantes descend on that embassy all wearing the same outfit swarm the fucking embassy and give you the outfit to wear so that you just mix in with all them and vanish into the fucking into the darkness and then end up in fucking Ecuador you know at one point there's gonna be a moment when you wake up and there's the guy sitting next to your bed and he's like hey man I'm sorry but I gotta fucking kill your ass or maybe he doesn't say anything or maybe they poison you or maybe there's a fucking moment when you walk down the street and you feel a strange prick in the bottom of your leg and the next thing you know you get a weird sickness a form of fucking swine flu or some odd bacterial infection you just fucking dive so tell me more about what's going on in Dallas it's a West Nile outbreak apparently nine people died now that when did this happen I don't know when the outbreak happened and I kind of like keep my eyes peeled for any kind of like end of the world style plague reports but yeah it seemed to pop out of nowhere just eight people and Dallas came down with West Nile virus and how really recently yeah really reason i dust it there I think they're dusting today Jesus Christ just spraying out that fucking poison you know because they don't want the West Nile virus to spread oh yeah the Texas gets fucking funky hot man and apparently Aubrey said that they've had a record amount of days they're cruising in on the the current record which is like some crazy number like 50 something days of over 100 degrees hottest fucking summer and his man yeah it's weird it's weird you know what we were talking about um like Lakes drying up and rivers drying up and shit like that yeah that's uh that's a disturbing thought man that that the climate can shift like really radically yeah and it always has always how it was huh and our ideas that we're gonna be able to stay in this one spot that we so choose to set up shop in that might be silly that might be a silly thing to do yeah it's like as a species we do this thing same thing people do as an individual like it's a species we make this silly just like we have this crazy idea that everything's gonna stay the same you know the planets gonna always be hospitable to our fauna life and we just live with that in the same way that from you know individuals go around like they're gonna live fucking forever no they go around treating people like shit not returning phone calls you know they go around like being like complete conscious there's gonna be some point if I love they say did treating people shit fucking I return phone calls horrible shit you could have said someone does like yeah people are fuckin dog shit my brother is like I love him very like when my best friends on earth fucking plan it but he's found like somebody that he really loves and it's so he's like he's like absorbed into this into this beautiful thing that I'm very happy for him for it but it's like that classic thing when one of your best friends gets a girlfriend you're like gosh fuck I understand I've done it God knows I've done it I've been the king of that shit man it's horrible but the point is people treat their lives and I've tried try to do this last now sometimes people get caught up in like the the minutiae and they end up they end up discounting their existence as though there's gonna be some point mm 10 years from now a lot of people think okay yeah I'm just gonna fuckin party through my 20s and then your 20s pass and then 37 I got stills got some juice in Miss still I'm gonna just fucking do it through my third days and then your thirties pass and now you're feeling a little tired and fucked up a little bit please comment and your like into the 40s I'm going to settle down and I'm gonna really become a man and then you just keel over and die and that's it you never fucking dit you know you never actualize yourself you never jumped into the you never jumped into the fucking fray you know what I mean yeah so in the same way as a species it's like were in that situation where we think yeah well it'll be fine man there's infinite fucking resources oh come on and it's you know not now we're kind of like in that part where you look in there you flip the fucking hotel mirror a little bit and take a look at that pink moon sprouting and you're in the back of your fucking head what the fuck there's a patch of pink there in the same way there's like nice big thick black oily patches of death sprouting up all over the planet from people logging and dumping chemicals in there and like no it'll come around that little fucking radioactive patch called Chernobyl come around you'll be fine in a couple of thousand years you know it's like I'm not even know Fukushima I'll be fine fine it'll be fine that's not gonna that won't affect the rest of the planet well I was just crazy yeah it's fucking crazy so so this is where we have this fucking problem man because we've got a group of people who believe that rabbits floated on rafts from one continent to the next we've got a group of people who really fucking believe in some very archaic primitive bullshit and we're really letting them run with it man we're really letting them run with not only that you're you're supposed to if you're polite to allow them whenever craziness they believe without ever arguing it or ever discussing it yeah or ever disagreeing with it yeah and it's fine it's like it's fine okay man fucking believe that shit I don't care I really don't care and and if it makes you happy I really do mean god bless you and I'm happy you're happy that's fucking awesome but if you're making political decisions based on these belief systems well we got a fucking problem man we got a big fucking problem because you're making political decisions based on an imaginary voice in your fucking head that thinks that floating man is gonna come down from space and this is a problem this is a problem because the decisions need to be made on a more realistic human level which is like hey there's a lot of people on this fucking planet we uh we uh we need to start working together and and stop blowing each other up is crazy an idea as that may be it's pretty much time to put down the Bible let's put down the fucking Quran let's put down the let's put down the old crusty old fucking Scrolls and just treat it like we're living in a neighborhood and let's see if we can fucking um let's see if we can just stop blowing each other up for a second Iran you don't need nuclear missiles Iran let's not make nuclear missiles in Israel let's not fucking attack Iran right now no none of the people want to fight none of the people want war we don't want to die I don't want to die I don't want anybody to get fucking blown up none of us want that man it's maybe like maybe there's 3,000 of us who want that maybe there's 3,000 people who really are into it and that's it and there's a lot more of us than there are of them you know so at some point something has to happen we're a shift takes place where people start prioritizing what's actually happening over what people dressed in funny outfits are telling us an Invisible Man is saying we should do you know it's like so obvious for example if like you're in the woods and you get to choose between two guides there's a guy wearing camouflage he's like got a fucking Rambo knife and some fucking awesome tattoos and then there's a guy who comes out dressed in a black fucking cloak holding a book and he's like this is a magic book this is my magic force book and this book will give you all the answers you need in this giant massive deadly dangerous snake filled bear written for us who are you gonna pay the guy with a magic book are the fucking the the kind of guy you know you go with a camo fucking guy you go with the fucking camera guy maybe you take down the guy in the funny robe and steal his robe to make a hammock but you don't fucking you don't fuck it up you don't follow the guy with the funny book well unless your brain doesn't work that good man that's a problem I think that one of the things that religion can do for people that really helps is it gives you an operating system and I think intelligent people use it that way and I think some really dumb people you that way and if they didn't have it they wouldn't know what to do and they might actually be a problem I think it gives people an operating system and although I don't agree with it I think it's like I've described it as like religion being like scaffolding that it's like scaffolding for expanding consciousness it allows you to have like some real like solid shit that you don't have to think or worry about and then concentrate on being positive helping your brother being you know being a generous person it's a vehicle yeah a vehicle for and if you know you need stories or you know scripture or whatever it is that you need to get you into that frame of mind well that puts you on that good scaffolding this shit's in code it's a fractal there's deep information in all the scriptures I certainly when I the Prophet they're all so different and their rules are so different you know that's true man I know some of them are just not into being happy right well no no well yeah we'll see if we what it is is it seems to be a of a problem of literalism you know it's like people are yeah it's reading things and taking them literally and so not looking into the deeper levels of things this is happening in every single aspect of our society it seems that people are becoming more and more literal they date that the their understanding of symbolism parody that kind of stuff becomes it seems to be a little muddied right now for example the most recent thing that happened as as you know I know you know Daniel Tosh and the fucking rape Fiasco for example right now now Daniel Tosh and I know this has been chewed gum on this show but yeah this is the third row the the someone when you make up when you deal with things on this surface level and you don't look deeper well then you get in the stupid wrestling with semantic wrestling matches with comedians over the most ridiculous ideas ever instead of just like yeah he was like throwing something out there he's not a rapist he doesn't want a rape he threw something out there it's no problem you know the Z but just a little just three inches under the surface fucking thing and it's a yawn it's a yawn mostly just like whatever but like on the surface it's fucking serious so in the same way people take these very powerful scriptures they interpret them on the on the surface level and they start arguing about the fucking surface level so now when people are talking about the fucking Garden of Eden they're arguing over like who who was the bad guy was that evil was it Adam well those leaves fall she listens that darn old snake first people really think that they're like yeah the woman's fault that's what she got cursed with a painful childbirth and there's some of that in there but it's like come on fuck heads come on like if you so then when you look at like when you get into the fucking Kabbalah and you look at the Kabbalistic tree of life and you see something that's taking the fucking idea of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden and deepening it to like that it's really much deeper part of the fucking fractal where it's an expression of the expansion of nothingness into something that's in the universe and it's a cool metaphysical grid that shows the thing becoming aware of itself or a thing waking up and then becoming aware of itself creating a triangle which flips over because it reflects itself into the universe and these are it's deep it's heavy shit and you mean it's fucking awesome this is Kabbalah that's the Kabbalistic Tree of Life in and is this the stuff that you're not supposed to even read until you hit like 36 or some show yeah that's what they say I mean I don't know I don't go to the Kabbalah sin or anything I just been reading Aleister Crowley and he's got like some oh how did a snake sound to confirm your allegiance with Satan fucking you're a grown man you just hissed I've used it son I found myself visiting from time to time just for the fuck of it and hangs would feel good hangover Oh hangover you feel like a vampire yeah yeah that's what vampires look like right they look at their hungover like when the Sun comes out they do they look fuckin what a weird idea is that sometimes you can have vampires that follow all the vampire rules until real recently people got so fucking arrogant they were like well no no now vampires are actually your friend and they only eat deer and they don't burn when it's sunny out they just glisten they don't want to be glistening they sparkle Joe they don't glisten they sparkle vampires all of a sudden became cool and you could fuck them oh yeah dude well that's Anne Rice's fault right Anne Rice oh my god the fucking interview of the vampire well no I don't think so man because even before interview with the vampire Dracula was very sexual the Dracula was hypnotic yeah he was very sexual and like a lot of the older movies you know there was a fume the Gary Oldman what came first Gary Oldman or Anne Rice probably Anne Rice right for the Gary Oldman Dracula I think Enright smiles positive oh well no the fucking old Dracula I think the the Brahms Stoker Dracula Delia oh that was a long he had some tramps in the castle didn't he have like there was a room you went into and there are all these female vampires really and hot is that a car yeah and like they were seductive and they would like you know powerful Dracula that's a good point yeah where everyone's hating on Dracula it's got these hot bitches that want to suck blood they're ready to throw it out oh that's so it just gets that poem he never boned him in front anybody though it's just I guess once you start drinking people's blood that's like way cooler than boiling chicks just completely give up on Bonin I mean in the world of vampires it's that is boning the best Dracula though of all time unquestionably it was Gary Oldman did you see that one Bram Stoker I got it so it's so good that Keanu Reeves can't fuck it up I got it like I don't know because I haven't seen it but I'll tell you my favorite fucking vampire by the way I do like Keanu Reeves it's just as cheap joke I like Harry's I miss the joke I love you can i oh god I love you even pay attention to my joke you just waiting to say what you gonna say I'll tell you what here's what your no no no here's where my mind started wandering is you said the greatest vampire and then I thought no no the greatest vampire of all time the spookiest vampire I'm his fucking nos farhat - oh the original yeah yeah you're right fuck that thing well also that was like really original I mean and think about that guy did that it was like wow this is a silent movie no man that thing was a scary son-of-a-bitch what that was like that's what a vampire's like the long fingers yeah kind of Goblin just a creepy thing pops out of the shadows that one so do keep talking I love it sorry my my Abington I know I love it oh you too really yeah man nice fat hot - yeah man that guy's fucking scary but you know the Salem's Lot vampires are pretty fucking spooky to 1922 brother 1922 and I'm looking at the images of it right now oh my god it's it's it's fucking incredible yeah who's legitimately frightening legitimately frightening and it was in the fucking early 1900s dude run a ball then they find fucking coffins stilted you know they found coffins out there are people of hammered stakes into this oh yeah well there's probably I'm sure people that were fucking assholes and they just wanted to make sure that really never came back but this motherfucker was creepy you're right man you know he might be the scariest one ever yes especially when you consider was 90 fucking years ago yeah man that was fucking spook well I mean I was based on the real thing whatever was warning around out in the fucking woods of Germany that's what was out there oh what a crazy people remember uh it was it was based on a real man oh my god look this fucking photo of it dude it's a really good goddamn image it's a really fucking scary looking yeah that's a scary vampire 19:22 because if you go watch like King Kong King Kong's not really scary and that's a little from like the 30s no not scary at all I'm not scary King Khan can not fuck with Nosferatu no no I mean I guess if I had to pick who I wanted to run from it's gonna be a fucking nice Ferrari though but where does it they just hijacked the whole vampire thing vampires used to be the worst shit that could ever happen to you and now he's a hunky guy well I'll tell you why they fuckin did that shit bro let me in it yeah you guys sell it to teenagers two women man a lot of women what people that want they want romance that the the thing about the Twilight books right so I've been told by mrs. Rogan is that the the very romantic unrealistically romantic because he's a vampire and it's like he's got a little power and everything like that it's like he like he's giving it all up just to be with her you know the man yeah and it's just weird sort of like he needs her so much and women love that shit it's just a natural sort of a thing for them so like when you see like women that would be waiting in line to go to those movies digit just hits a chord that we don't we don't have we don't know that chord but the chicken Road that shit knows that chord so she nailed it you're talking about the Courtney Love I'm talking about the quart of affection and admiration like I think all women want to be you know didn't want to be worshipped you know they think that that's like the most romantic thing for a guy who would do anything for you so he would do anything for that girl in in in those books he would do anything for her I mean he he didn't even want to bite her he wanted to you know he wanted to protect her from everybody he's in love with her meanwhile he was like a thousand years old that she's in high school like it's really fucking creepy if you stop and think about it he's a thousand years old whatever the fuck it is she's in high school man you're fucking crazy for the conversations you having with her Jesus Christ I mean it'd be hard enough if you were thirty if you were thirty and you're dating a girl in high school you be like I gotta kill myself I can't take it I can't talk to her she's fucking she also wants to talk about his Instagram creeper he's a total creeper she could be his great great it's not like he just was frozen for all those years like Captain America know this asshole has been alive the whole time and opportunities in high school it might be one of the dumbest ideas ever it's not fair he's got magical powers he can flies flying a fucking high school kid through the trees Jesus Christ did they fuck yes eventually yeah later boiler spoiler yes allegedly how about that I don't know it already happened might have already happened I only saw like two of them I think there's been three think you put it in our asshole I think vampires allowed to do that it's a sin even for vampires hey vampires no no no female vampires are gonna cut the shape just stop it they don't even shit anymore so it probably dries up nice shit when you eatin blood they probably barely you know get up to you right now you probably get the exact amount you need you don't know that I would imagine you would get the exact money now man a vampire's ass hole is swollen broken a scene where you walk down into a New York City subway and you saw some crazy-looking vampire dude you're shitting blood just blood squirting out of his ass chunky cottage cheese blood that's what a vampire looks like tunnel subway tunnel just shitting blood looking at you and thinking about sucking your blood next it's weird that they're like that's that's as far as they go like vampires suck your blood that's the worst thing they do but there's never been like a supernatural creature that won't bit like mouth fucks you you know what I mean somebody talks about as ridiculous as it is I think we actually did talk about this before it must be on my fucking mind - there's no silly fucking bat or some creepy for apes people that was mouth raping dudes I don't use that word but they're a fucking horrifying horrifying being it doesn't have to be a vampire could just be some bug some insect or something that came out of the earth and that's how it does it it just fucking it sir it lives off of the it lives off of like people gagging hey that's it absorbs its power yeah the trick the twitching of your body when you're trying to throw up yeah it's a gag pyre your pipe is clogged by a fat cock you're trying to throw up and he's just holding the back your head with scaly paw is what they came to do they just came to get head they have like really tough dicks like you really cannot even pierce the skin you could bite it as hard as you want it doesn't matter when aliens face fuck you they just it just goes in you accept it and it just fucks your throat when you try to throw up but it can't get past the fat alien cock that's stretching your insides out pumping oxygen in it by the way it's keeping you a lot on your I think what you suck at Scott it changes your whole it blows your lungs out and actually eats them and converts it to a type of glue that keeps the cock attached to your body to keep you alive because now you no longer have lungs you get all your oxygen through his cock oh my god could you imagine that'd be the work and it's some people would say you know I I don't care I love aliens anyway they're still awesome teaching us listen it for him might be really awesome maybe he loves the fact that he's getting the oxygen to that cock you stay alive your body withers away can't really move your arms you're flailing you like impaled you just look like a skeleton with a fucking dildo in its mouth and every year it just goes deeper in your body keeps dick keeps growing eventually it turns into you you just turn it like a cactus like cactus dick thing yeah you look at Hsu kabob shish kebab dick kebab every year the the the the dick slowly grows inside your body and starts cracking open organs and pushing ribs to the side popping them and snapping them as it eventually goes through your body but it does it so slowly that you never actually die especially since the the dick is providing with oxygen but then when it gets to the head to the end the dick pops out of your asshole and you deflate like a balloon and that sound is not that sound is known as fum ping like it's like the sound of a man's final thumb there's no worse sound it's like a old Hume I mean that's not any weirder than a lot of shit that's real it's not any weirder than those aquatic worms that just stayed inside of grasshoppers and committing get them to commit suicide so they can be born that's and that's enough no man this is this I know it's not that fucking weird and I'm weird alright but it's like we don't the closest to horror movie because it's weird but it's the weirdest thing but it's not any more weird than like cordyceps mushrooms that grow inside ants heads and then explode and spray the air and detect all these other ants to become zombies and Amanda fucking my goddamn my banelings god bless you Starcraft you artosis I love you it turns it turns them into bombs right it turns them into fucking bombs from the world it's a fungal bomb yeah it's crazy um uh yeah dude fucking the nature is insane man and like sometimes I think about that notion of the fungal consciousness infect or the things like you know the I know we don't know this is chewed gum because I know we've talked toxoplasmosis for example yeah I had to describe that today to ever last I've explained them about cats but dude if you take this the next level you know this is where we get into the realm the metaphysical realm that a lot of people believe that you know you can get fucking possessed by a spirit right and this is not just fucking Christians this is like in almost every religion is this notion that a thing can get into you and start fucking controlling you and it's like man if it's if there's fucked you know maybe there's disembodied beings that really can like get inside you you know maybe maybe just certain ideas is it maybe he's like certain ideas I think what's his name Steiner someone's just telling me he believed that ideas were alive right and so what if there are certain ideas that someone could implant into your head that's the exact same thing is being possessed you know what I mean so you get this fucking idea and it just grows inside of you much like our legendary dick alien it grows inside of you and turns you into a fucking different person this is all right there are certain people that are so susceptible to ideas and words that they can get him in their head and obsess on them to the point of almost like madness yes I had a friend who had a nervous breakdown while he was hosting a show where there was a black gentleman was the actor in the show a famous guy and as he's he's warming up the crowd Brody Steven style he gets this thought in his head that he can't get out then the thought is don't say nigger don't say nigger whatever you do don't say and he would never say it he's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination it was just madness yeah so he had a complete nervous breakdown while he was doing stand-up while he was warming up on some Hollywood sound stage and he just had a nervous breakdown he just he could not think of not saying that word so it would just completely fucking freaked him out to the point where he froze and he couldn't get any words on people were concerned about him they were looking at I'm like is he okay like he just stopped in mid-sentence and everyone's listening to him he's got a microphone he just locked the fuck up with I was like wow all right what is that like possessed by an idea the idea possessed him and took over his body and there's other versions of this idea you know whatever the fucking idea is that gets in someone's head and makes him think that a solution to a problem is to wrap explosives around their body and go wandering into a fucking cafe that person's got a bad idea that's a bad idea inside their head that's a bad thing living inside their head yeah it's a bad idea and it's like there's a lot of fucking people on the planet you've got some bad ideas and their fucking heads man yeah you know but you know they're just I suppose whether they're living or not it's just a device to like help understand the spread of the thing it just spreads more like a virus ideas spread more like a virus than they do anything else right they fucking take over a person they get into it's subjective DNA they transform its thought patterns and then that being begins to infect those around it with the similar ideas and then that spreads the fucking thought disease out through it through the world you know and not that's like going on right fucking now right got them chick-fil-a I'm gonna go around at chick-fil-a I need some fucking chicken sandwiches to show my love for Jesus Yeah right you know and and and like that's a vert you know that's the flower growing from the tree of an idea that's been planted in the minds of many people you know the fundamentalists and it's like fuck man what if it is a living thing what if they're actually possessed by a living force that is not that great it's just like that fungal thing sending the ants up the tree that's interesting that's an interesting way of looking at it that these ideas are actually living things yeah I mean it might be who knows I mean it's it is very strange when you think about the direction that our society goes in and then it does seem to be led to and fro by like really insane shit upon occasion insane sane sane st. shit he's like wait a minute what are you doing because she did what she danced what what this is your this is your belief you know you're gonna line a woman up in the middle of the street and throw rocks at her because someone caught her dating a member of the wrong Muslim tribe yes oh my goodness it gets it gets weird man really scary weird well it gets fucking weird because I mean goddamn the first fucking when when the first monkey decided to come down out of the tree and wander out and start fucking hunting yeah you know I don't know I don't know but I'm pretty sure that the other fucking monkeys that decided to stay in the fucking tree and in this situation I'm not saying one group is a monkey and one groups not I'm saying we're all fucking monkeys but the ones that decided to stay up in the goddamn tree didn't have nuclear weapons you know about the nuclear sub that was sneaking around off the coast of Mexico sure dad it was right down near San Diego Russian right Russian you having a little fun Russian nuclear sub got right up next to us just just to let you know bitch holla and sneak up on you armed with warheads sure easy it was a real legitimate nuclear submarine check it out what the fuck whoops that wasn't a message oh my dear I gotta getta there for a while we didn't know they were there I guess my GPS was off I ended up off the coast most apologies America most apologies are OnStar now fuck you malfunction GPS yeah how crazy is that there was a warship the other superpower that wants to get bigger and better wealthy it's run by criminals here's where we come to the fucking you know the the thing that MacKinnon kept talking about he's like look we don't have time to teach people and meditate anymore people are possessed by this fucking idea we can teach people to meditate but first they need to get super high on a psychedelic you know what I mean like there needs to be this there's like this imperative to transform those fucking crazy thought structures that are floating around in people's heads because they've got fucking nuclear weapons thanks friend you can't just climb out of the goddamn tree now you know if you climb out the fucking tree people are gonna say you're a goddamn heretic you know they're you're you're a goddamn anti-american heretic listen to me say there's no fucking Jesus Christ no goddamn rabbits gotta cross the fucking ocean in some way that didn't involve floating on logs you obsessed with his rabbit in the ocean thing well they didn't say rabbits but I just pictured that they just said animals I don't know I don't know the spread of rabbits throughout the planet I'm floating around on lost oh yeah but you know what else is apparently everywhere on the planet sasquatch yeah well yeah you fucking laugh dude you're getting known as a sasquatch believer almost gone that's happening to you I'm I'm down I'm steady squatching look man have you ever watched the show Finding Bigfoot no I I had Bobo from Finding Bigfoot on the podcast was awesome he gave me a cast as a cast over there I'll show to you what giant foot Hat does he believed it Oh fucking he believes it he's had he's seen it you said he's seen it man you know it's really creepy though really Northern California that whole area it's got like eight Canyon a privy monkey canyon it's like all these like weird fucking names and involved primates but it's not a place where there's any Apes it's really strange there's a lot of sightings in one area a lot of sightings for the last couple of hundred years and is a really densely wooded area doesn't mean that they're not bears and people aren't on mushrooms it's totally possible that it also could have been just an idea that one person had and they ran with it and it fucking carried on as almost a tradition okay not to take this idea too far mm-hmm but fucking McKenna I talked about the idea that the UFO is some kind of projection of the Mystere the mystery of novelty of the something within humans or something in fucking hyperspace I think that was young yeah Carl Jung Carl Jung maybe Makino is quoting young yeah it's some hillians and ufos and archetypes I forget that would I forget the book but he wrote a whole book on that concept that the the UFO was almost like a ghost of our imagination so maybe this sounds probably terrible way of describing it cool maybe this is a ghost of our imagination it's a kind of specter that rises up out of the deepest parts of our self or our potential and manifests is like this is what we could be or this isn't a have you ever seen a real UFO footage or a real photo that you were like yes I have seen pictures but every single picture is always fucked up they had a new Sasquatch picture and all they got is his back crystal clear and focuses back yeah one shot man you sons of bitches alright but it's not saying that this is not a real animal and the reason why I say that is Jane Goodall Jane Goodall said she was a hundred percent convinced all the people she talked to that had the same story and all the same sightings that there was an undiscovered primate in the Pacific Northwest I have no problem I mean it's never it's something it's not anything that fucking would I think it'd be really awesome if somebody finally like caught one of those things but it wouldn't like it's not gonna make me fucking any happier when I wake up in the ball it would make me happier I love it I'm like a little kid I'd be so happy but I think what the fuck do I know about primates a lot of what I know about primates came they learned from Jane Goodall so for me to like pretend that I know more about primary's Jane Goodall just seems ridiculous so Jane Goodall says there's a inclined without doing too much research I'm inclined to believe it you know I mean Jane could all his own she's a badass specially the badass lady lady not a bitch thank you but she's um may I ask you a question throw me into a fucking good office all you think she ever humped one of those for sure yeah fuck this shit off at least one just to see what was up maybe that's what kept it all those years I think a lot of those ladies that they want have fuckin chimps chimps have big dicks you know what has that big dicks gorillas gorilla girls a little tiny dicks you know why nobody's trying to fuck their girls look at the size of them Jesus Christ the gorillas the over back the smart ones you think about what they are they're these giant enormous but peaceful vegetarian gorillas it's like nature just made them so big so you leave them the fuck alone and it works so good that they can have a harem so they have a harem and there's no need to grow a big dick he's not about the size you dick you don't have to impress these chicks they're yours go ahead get that one so they have like these little tiny dicks like an inch long they're always falling out did the gorillas are terrible fucking Christopher Ryan the author of sex at dawn talks about this he was telling me about this oh really how gorillas have fucking tiny little dick yeah because they have a hair yeah it's exactly there's no like competition to grow like big cocks that's why they also chimps have huge balls to assault chimp chimps are sluts female chimps just take a dick all over the place so the male chimps their balls swell disproportionately with sperm depending upon how much promiscuity is in their clan so if everybody's fucking everybody that balls are giant and they just ready to shoot loads or a drop of a hat you got to be ready to fuck one of these crazy bitches whenever you can can hold them down they're just banging each other left and right especially like bonobos they're the craziest animal ever they have sex to get over arguments they they like yeah men and men that this is the fuck women and women's is that one of the premises in this book which is that bonobos are closer to us than chimps or equidistant yeah genetically so it's like in they fuck missionary position they look in each other's eyes when they're humping I think there's some mod the lesbians shit that happens out there they're just sexually promiscuous they yeah it's a social it's a way to solidify social bonds through humping they do everything except the mother doesn't fuck the son that's it that's where they draw the one but other than that that's how they resolve it you know issues father Fox daughter yep father Fox daughter brothers fuck sisters yeah but the mom does not fuck the sons nope yeah it's strange well they got something right head step one bitches next try shoes that never get involved because they they have the fucking thumbs on their feet they want to fly around the trees they're not gonna lose that why would you lose that that's the most awesome thing ever flying around the trees is way better than any cool shit that we can do on the ground you know so for them to like develop cars and all that other shit you have to spend a lot of time just walking around with shoes on well no man this is where we get into this first of all man I love the fucking idea of monkey starting to wear shoes that would make me wake up at catcher's mitts they would start off with catcher's mitts just how cute would that be like you see film of like monkeys like into cute little sandals that they made out of Bush baby holy shit do you think it would work I wonder if it'd work sure I wonder if I could wear a mint walk around catcher's mitts on sure they could wear anything we're fucking dizzy t-shirt oh man goddamn boxing gloves it'd be the best well what do you think we would do if we walked in on chimps in the jungle and they were making shoes they were tying their shoes on no not even weapons to shoes we'd really shoot them no we'd weep with joy because it would be the cutest thing anyone ever saw and also you'd be from page of Reddit like yes Ellie would be totally on the front page but it would explode and also it'd be like you know it would be a kind of like a really spooky thing like which is this idea that maybe evolution itself is accelerating in all beings not just in fucking techno technology but like it's like hitting everything it's starting to speed up everywhere where those gorillas popping those fucking poacher traps right you know what I mean like maybe shit's happening everywhere speeding up and speeding up and all think where things are suddenly gonna just start like talking wearing fucking shoes talking and cute English accents and for people don't know the gorillas have figured out a way to disarm traps they know they figured out the mechanism behind the trap so they trigger the trap to working together yeah yeah it's really fascinating really fascinating they figured out a way to communicate their idea and they they took out some traps yeah I mean what would we do what would we do if they started evolving what would they do if they start developing weapons you know if you came into the jungle then you found chimps and they were holding on the spears with flint tips what the fuck do you do you know what do you do that gets crazy and what if they're just using it to hunt they're just using it to hunt then one day one kills a dog you know steals a dog in Africa or somewhere and next thing you know it's on the war could you imagine if they actually did evolve what if chimpanzees this is a fucking stupid idea strap in but if you listen to McKenna's idea McKenna's idea the stoned ape theory was that there was a period of human history that scientists are a little bit confused about it and that period is over 2 million years the human brain doubled and they don't know why they really don't know there's all sorts of thoughts you know like the throwing arm like that we figured out how throw shit and kill things that accelerated our use of tools and the brain just kept up with what it you know what we needed and then the other the craziest one is McKenna's idea McKenna's idea was that it was because of mushrooms is that we had started coming down off the trees because the climate was changing and that the rain forests were receding in the grasslands and that these animals flipped over these cow patties looking for worms and shit that they would eat and then they found the mushrooms on the top and they started eating the mushrooms and then they started experiencing enlightenment they started having creative ideas they started developing language I want why hasn't someone just taken some chimps and given them some mushrooms why don't they try that well I don't think I mean if you will to try lipstick on them and let's see if this perfume is fucking toxic when we Turkey shoot it up your ass you know they'll do all that to chimps Tate they do testing on chimps parrot from medicine and they die they do horror on shit to them they cut their heads off and see if they can keep on in fact allegedly um but why not give them mushrooms could you imagine what if they could show we've been doing this for 45 years we go to some fucking bunker in Nevada right out in groom Lake like these these are the chimps that we have developed through our mushroom program and they look like cavemen yeah how could you imagine we found it for 36 years this weather starting they look like man that's if that's the I mean if only we could have whatever that fucking beam that they had in Star Trek the Genesis ray or whatever that makes shit evolve faster because to me you know the McKenna's idea of the proto hominids chomping on those mushrooms was that it happened of course over a long long time 2 million years 2 million years because it create and like it's like mushrooms at low doses is the other thing he mentioned in his theory is mushrooms at low doses man they're great for fucking dude they're great for having sex they're like they really like it's if you take the right dose its raw it's an aphrodisiac yes so like his idea was um yeah so there's it's like it also improves visual acuity in the peripherals which so you can see a goddamn wine sneaking up on your ass not just in the peripheral but they said that they've done tests on where they have two parallel lines and one parallel line will move very slightly off line and when we you can recognize it quicker on psilocybin than when you're when you're straight weird yeah forget who what the scientist was who did that I should know I should remember that but it was one of the the things that Terence had as a part of his theory but nobody ever took his theory seriously and everybody got completely mocked it and made fun of it because mushrooms are like an inherently silly thing if you say you've done them or you think they're important you're immediately an idiot silly sob and would you would you go to a Grateful Dead concert and dance on a tapestry you goddamn hippie but what's amazing it's like it can be responsible for one of the most powerful reconsiderations of your life ever like a real true religious experience yeah and we're all holding back on all this shit none of us we were trapped in this wonky culture we're all sort of at least partially got the brakes on when it comes to that stuff no they got the brakes on us we don't have the brakes where the brakes aren't on them we got condition the regen but a lot of fucking money into that shit yeah like did this wasn't like a the administration of course not the family but this was like the you know this is the pharmacological Inquisition as they say and it all stems back to the distribution of LSD through the United States starting with the CIA's experiments to see if they had a truth serum serum and the you know the ways I could at what psychedelics do to society is a fucking meltdown the boundaries and when boundaries meltdown it causes a shift and that shift does not work very well for the way we've run our society for a very long time and so they recognize that and they stop that shift because um it's not but but it's important to realize that these breaks are being put on by people outside of us I mean if you look at shamanic cultures and the Amazon you know these are this is a endogenous part of their daily life it's embedded into their culture it's normal as having fucking telephones you know it's a way to communicate with nature so this is like you know a very essential aspect of being a human being is taking a psychedelic gonna has been for a very long time and you know whether or not McKenna is right about the neocortex expanding and when proto hominids chomp mushrooms one thing is for certain once we found out about it we indulged what do you mean I mean that's for certain yeah once we found out about it people been using them forever bingo yes yes yes exactly and we know from our own personal experience with them that the effect is not some kind of like ridiculous frat party giggle fest it's like if you take the right dose when you do it with the right people and you do it with the right intention then there will be a massive shift in your consciousness akin to a form of ego death which allows you to heal and allows you to reacquaint yourself with kind of a living connective energy that isn't all things and that's an a that's a very important experience to have it's but it's it's amazing how well the propaganda worth considering how substantial the effect of the product is that it's suppressed this incredible you know it mean you would say that in an open market eventually the cream rises to the top but it doesn't get a chance because it's cut off and because it's illegal and demonized this incredible I don't know whatever you would call it experience that's called that this incredible experience is kept away from you it's kept away from it what is essentially a natural experience by eating some things that people have eaten since the beginning of time and it's kept from you and it's it's a shame it's a shame that you can live your whole life without understanding that there might be some other aspects to this life that we also need to take into our body in order for us to get a better grasp on things and they might have aided getting us to here and we might be in a very sick sick time where we're not using these things and that's what's responsible for this whole chaotic community that we have this whole chaotic thing where we're polluting the skies and polluting the ocean and you know we will do anything for profit including invade other countries we're doing all sorts of really insane twisted things that are the types of things that would be happening if we were sick if there was something wrong with us if we weren't getting our medicine if we weren't getting we we weren't getting what got us to the dance right yeah man if that's true if that's true if that if the human consciousness really did develop through psychedelics it only makes sense that we fucking need that shit just like we need meat yeah it's a fight it's almost like a vitamin it's like a psychic vitamin and in the same way that way back when during right after the agrarian revolution when people are getting less nutritional value because of droughts and they became emaciated and small and you can look at the skeletons of people back then they are much smaller right because they weren't getting the nutrition in the same way we are emaciated but in a psychic way so you end up with these people of these just broken fucking psychic egos pro wrestling fans yeah fucking wrestling no bro I fucking love pro wrestling and I love you show - I love you - I'm just kidding is this a joke I got nothing against pro wrestling oh man I'll take 700 fuckin stadiums of pro wrestling fans over one phelps family you know what I mean let's talk about those fucks man that's crazy God hates fags guys yeah they're insane when you say phelps oh you have to be careful because it's right off the Olympics you know people would say what the fuck did Michael Phelps - oh Jesus Christ that God how did hear him so fast he's not even like a human man breaks the laws did you see the onion headline that Michael Phelps returned to his aquarium New York he lives in an aquarium at SeaWorld I mean when it goes to the beach he was like there's no fucking way I'm getting in that water he's like yeah I've been in water so much I am NOT fucking swimming like he doesn't ever swim in the ocean he's like I'm just sitting in the sand chillin I don't play I mean fuck dude that guy's like how many gold medals of that guy win more than anybody ever it's like in Hawaii or some shit something nuts he moves so well it's incredible I mean it's just like from an aesthetic point of view or you know from an even in an artistic point of view you you're you're looking at it and it looks like art it looks like he's like it looks like a dance and there's so much flow to it yeah as he's like fucking hurling through the water yeah it's so they move so fast that it's hard to believe but it is almost I mean if dance I mean if really if dance is impressive isn't that impressive just as well I think it's it's an impressive physical feat into a rhythm the way they can swim to a rhythm and then they go under and then they show underwater for like this long period before they bust open and start whipping it again what a crazy fucking sport man while to watch while to watch people do some shit that you just cannot fucking do to know that that's like the capabilities of the human frame yeah if it's that long and that's strong and that young and that dedicated and it puts in this many hours every week look what the fuck this thing can do yeah it's pretty amazing oh it's pretty amazing all the stuff they can happen and physically mentally what you can learn the things that you can figure out it's amazing the the amount that you can send your consciousness out into the universe and understand things it's a fucking incredible you know the and this yeah this this spacesuit that we're in it's like it's got all these like parts to it that we've forgotten how to use you know almost like some survivor of a spaceship crash as amnesia and is in this super advanced spacesuit and only uses like parts of it you know little parts of it to like amble around yeah right and it's like no man there's like crazy fucking circuit boards that you can access in this fucking thing but you know you need help there's certain fuels that you need to like make that connection and those fuels are fucking if you're an athlete you got to eat the right food you know you can't just chomp on goddamn Froot Loops and Cheetos and end up like being a professional Olympic swimmer they've got they're feeding those people like crazy we don't even know it probably glows smells like cum this special nutritional like blast that they just spray into their mouths like foie gras geese there's fucking like do you know god only knows what these fuckers have in their bodies and in the same way and for your intelligence you know for your for your spiritual growth you need to take into your fucking being certain that certain things great scriptures incredible writing and on occasion a nice fucking mushroom trip you know but you got to be kidding you know you got to be careful not to like I feel guilty saying this stuff because some people are you're not supposed to take it you shouldn't take it you're in a bad part in your life right now your fucking balls smell like at the bottom of a goddamn fucking uh the bottom of a donkey's ass you know you got to clean your balls and clean yourself and your life up before you take the experience you know some people shouldn't do it but some people definitely should you definitely should it's very important goddamn just went on a hippie rant my friend Steve Jobs though I mean come on like he said that fucking LSD was like one of the biggest one big part of his understanding of the universe yeah I think we had a world filled with people who've all had breakthrough psychedelic experiences and they were running this this country it would be a lot easier as long as they got enough pussy to keep them satisfied yes if we just had robot concubines or whatever people would think it'd be morally acceptable keep them sexually satisfied so they don't go tweakin and they don't do stupid shit and undermine our world just based on their need for pussy dude by the way you don't need robot concubines you send out into the world hey gays could be a form of the military like it suck his cock especially the troops satisfy the geniuses sexually like some branch what if that was our fucking military like troops trained just to suck off geniuses and make them a fucking happy what if that was like how we like that's how we went to wars we just sent troops of fucking blowjob masters into the homes of geniuses and the complex just sucking them off so they're happy yeah that's why they would take they should take like all like super geniuses just bringing some someplace fuck getting pussy fuck having us ruin your life we're just gonna bring you constant bitches we're gonna pay you well I just want you to be really creative Time Machine is a bit crazy and you want a fan lane you want us to have children we can so we can arrange that as well yeah matter assimilators they do but then they want all the money they want to take it they want to take all the money like a bad record deal yeah anybody who's you know you're creating things for companies well the years but here's the thing man one thing you never hear when a kid's like I want to be an inventor is another give me like you're gonna get a lot of pussy if that happened we would be what we'd probably be floating right now we'd be floating on a magnetic field sending like our fucking thought patterns out of the world instead of talking to microphones there was this guy that I remember who was like this famous hacker who had like a cartoon that he did online I don't remember what his name was but it was a big portly guy and he's like from Germany or some shit like that and Kimber that's what his name was I think previous Kimber and he had cartoons of himself like we would go out and kill like evil dictators and he would take pictures of himself the dude made fuck loads of money he was like a hacker and then he went from being a hacker to being an Internet security expert that would help corporations and heeds like to always driving around this crazy yeah always got this crazy hooked up Mercedes here we are my private jet here we are in Japan here we are you know where Lewey just landed and I mean a dude was like an international style baller and he he just would put these pictures and videos of him just bawling all over the world yeah I'm sure I'm sure yeah I'm sure that fucking like a lot of those guys are definitely getting like some crazy experiences you know they just probably have like refined desires you know they have different ideas of what they want you know I'm sure that who knows what they fucking do Wozniak yes Wozniak married I don't know thank you Jesus super gee we don't know what he does you'll no one knows what he does I'm really sure that guy could walk through walls man he's like really fascinating and smart and kind of like he was only involved with Apple for a while or and then he left yeah but now he's like he's as fucking crazy son of a bitch man you know he's like a loon yeah he's like a real like anti-authority kind of person he likes to break rules and he's got fucking like a wallet full of like professional fake IDs with like really holographically printed he was it's like it's on YouTube there's a video of him showing his fucking awesome fake IDs that he really oh yeah he loves to like use technology to be a aunt to you know to break little rules and laws and stuff it's kind of cool it's really cool in fact you know but you don't want a lot of those guys right you don't want any fucking you need to see one or two of those guys have some fun but you don't want 50,000 of those guys what happens if we got 50,000 Steve Jobs you know yeah cuz it's like right now the thing that is driving so many of us not me I'm driven by my love of humanity and I want the world to be a better place but I think that many men are driven by the desire to fuck and a lot of I know this is probably shocking to you what are you getting this I've read I read it I read it on the back of a cereal box but I'm not could you imagine caution girls men are driven by a secret desire to fuck why do they wear those crazy ties to let you know yeah man baby no shenanigans here why I'm a gentleman with a tie on but a lot of fucking professions it's very strange some professions are fuck professions some professions are not right fucking firemen a fire rock stars a fuck profession that's 100% rock stars the fuck perfect Jagger David Lee Roth what do you think I'm you think I'm just getting mad pussy all over the planet yeah I mean they've gotten so much pussy that they've like withered into jerky strips well well they're also you know the long in the tooth man it's just life long in the tooth but no no it's not no that's not a normal senior citizen these people are like somebody made a stick figure out of beef jerky they're fucking crazy-looking from all the fucking and they're still fucking they're like they're they're still fucking to this day viagra is like runs in their veins spice they're fucking all the time dude still that's a different old man what do you think like Mick Jagger on a regular week how much young pussy does yet I think he's got her at fucking rotation of probably 25 young 25 coming book coming in and out anything women what women would be like why would you want that let's pretend that you we have a girl on the podcast with us that is like probably maybe secretly attracted to you but really upset you're talking about this so openly so why would you want that why would you want why would you want 20 different girls why would you want that you're attracted in me why would you want that well look I guess I don't because I don't know man I don't know why we want that why why girls might not understand that that's something guys want but this is that here's the thing though man this is why I love this book sex at dawn who we just saying would have 20 girls I believe it was Mick Jagger right Mick Jagger I'm sorry okay so the idea is like this is one of the premises of this book is it's not a fucking genetic quality of being a woman that you don't want to fuck all the time that it's more of a culturally conditioned thing that's happened from your upbringing because we're in a very sexually repressed Society and ladies like to fuck now this what does that have to do with this sexually suppressed part look they want to fuck more because we're sexually suppressed they want to fuck more than they let on maybe it's because it's like you know I mean more than they let on yeah cuz when you're when you're a guy what's the number one first thing you gotta fuckin do once you grow pubic hair what's the number one first thing you gotta get fuckin laid man you don't want to be a virgin oh I'm 23 and I'm a virgin still it's like a mark of shame meanwhile I'm like a hot girl is like yeah you know I'm still a virgin I'm saving myself oh man plus you know that if she's 23 and she's a virgin Sproul iike dat head oh yeah oh shit she's figured out a way to get guys off with her mouth yes that's for sure or maybe her asshole oh this guy over here Duncan what's the puppet Duncan won't bring the puppet I wanna see the fucking seance let me tell you high point of my fucking commie comedy career is getting a goddamn message from people saying Andrew Dice Clay says that he likes part of my fucking act dude that's intense fur it's hot as fuck in here isn't it's fucking hot hey I'm gonna turn the air conditioning on so why don't just talk to the people about your life video by myself and rambled one second one second good well friends I'm gonna do a mini mini orient here you're gonna just leave me here there's some kind of pleasant prank so there's no need for you to feel alone in the world my friends open your heart up to the eternal spirit of life and you will find that you will draw into your orbit many beautiful things including delightful wet pussies that comes happy moments happier moments you just have to stop hating let go of the pain let go of your anger open your third eye and allow yourself to embrace the idea that God is love visit Duncan Trussell com wwm control comm and join my minecraft server we have a minecraft server I play minecraft it's one of the loneliest creepiest no I'm telling telling the internet to go to my minecraft server that's what I'm spending my time doing have you ever played minecraft no I just rambled for a long time sorry about that you guys I was disjointed rambling how dare you Duncan do what we've been doing for two hours you on your own everything changes one thing that you and I have both been backing around or a battering rather around is this idea of the simulation theory idea we keep bringing it out man it's a point where it's like I wonder if you know if you really want to get hardcore crazy with the idea of manifesting reality with your ideas you know I wonder I wonder if you can manifest that the whole thing really is some sort of a simulation I wonder if you could manifest that I wonder if it literally can morph that far around do dahm that sounds so hippie and stupid it sounds so stoner stupid it sounds so that dude I just smoked a joint man this is the first time I thought about that man it doesn't doesn't stop it from from being possible well man I mean when you like there's a lot of fucking crazy shit when you start playing around with simulation theory and I'm so glad you brought it up because we get this archetype and many of the world religions that involves the man God the God being eaten by man the God that gets sacrificed for the sake of humans the God that merges in with human beings the fucking shit movie Prometheus tried to address this in a really crap way but like the the notion of the the creators or whatever but what's really fascinating about the idea of being in a simulation like if we are in a simulation now is that we are immortal and the sense that we are computer code that's being run through a some form of operating system and because we're just computer code we can be as there's actually this guy from the tech singularity Institute I can't remember his name no I think he's from Oxford it's on YouTube and he's talking about this idea of vivisecting the human brain scanning the neural system plopping that shit into a compute after you scan the synapses and the exact structure as close as you can as accurately as you can you run you know run this through a simulator now you have a being with consciousness living inside a computer not only do you have a being with consciousness living inside of a computer but he was said it was so awesome is you could it could then theoretically be rewound time could be sitt could be sped up it could be pulsed you know what I mean so you could like control the reality of this being and some really bizarre ways and so what what where it gets really fascinating is that the person who this neurological scan was based the first the living being the meat body whose brain was put on some kind of futuristic combination deli slicer slash neurology scanner that fucking being died had to die so that the being inside the simulator could live and so then you get this those are the only way to make this thing's a slice it up crazy world I'll tell you this the only way to make a computer right now is by fucking putting the pieces of the computer together it's not through slicing it up the point is if this is a simulation the implication is that it was created by a living being right you know and that living being theoretically is mortal you know and so that mortal being has died that mortal being may have died EA ons ago depending on who knows because time is based on the simulation you know the nutty idea that literally the universe began right as you were born there was nothing before that yeah there were did nothing existed before that it was born yeah right when you were born and everything that you you think of is complete utter horseshit everything you think I was just a simulation of the universe being born when you were born it's just because that's when they plugged you in that's the moment they plugged you into the simulation well see my yeah it's a mind melter and here's where it gets even more mind fucking melty because everybody's talking about this idea of the singularity the moment that our computers wake up our machines wake up become aware that they exist is a thing but where it gets really trippy is the idea that we're inside the simulation and were the Machine waking up we literally are the thing waking up to an awareness of itself and gaining consciousness of itself in a true way that's what humans are they the the fucking I almost want to rewrite the got the Garden of Eden story replacing the cord God with programmer because it's getting so fucking cool and like the programmer made man in his own image that's what's really getting really crazy is when you get to these scientists or saying that they found computer code concealed in super string equations not just fucking ones and zeros but what this guy calls dual error correction code which is some form of weird fucking shit that's already in our web browsers and based on the technology or the invention of a programmer in the 1940s I mean this is some lost shit here this is some lost ship but it's been dismissed man I mean I've been raving about it on my podcast and some people like said that it's a real Ferengi theory and you know who knows but aside I thought it was a I thought it was proven to be true it's coming from a respected theoretical physicist at the University of Maryland I can't remember his name but it's definitely not like a kook it's coming from a respected scientist who has found this shit in these equations they're using to represent supersymmetry mm-hmm and string theory is string theory these weird symbols these used to try to represent it but yeah man it's still like it's a pretty eerie thing you know yeah he tried to explain it to Neil deGrasse Tyson yeah in a video yeah and it's it's thought the whole premise of it is very hard to wrap your head around but this guy his name is dr. s James gates and he's a theoretical physicist and with a crazy haircut yeah yeah the John asked ol professor of physics at the University of Maryland and the director of the Center for string and particle theory is reporting that certain string theory supersymmetrical equations which describe the fundamental nature of the universe and reality contain embedded computer codes these codes are digital data in the form of ones and zeros not only that these codes are the same as what makes web browsers work and our error correction codes gate says we have no idea what these things are doing here whoa so that's where it gets crazy our first contact with a fucking alien is going to be with the you know the programmer but it gets it gets where it gets really weird Joe here's where it gets really fucking weird is the idea that the the that we're running in a simulation inside a simulation in the same way that we're trying to simulate reality through video games SimCity various fucking weather pattern supercomputers and all the various ways we try to articulate reality through machines this has already been done in a previous machine that's articulating itself like some kind of mirror a flat refracting off itself infinitely going into itself always inventing itself again and again and again and again if that is the case what a trip it is to the idea of inventing video games while inside a simulation yeah but see this is where it gets cool because maybe the simulation itself is a novelty gener generator maybe the simulation what it's here for is to generate you know novelty which is like look man let's see what happens if we put an entire planet full of people who quantum you know nanobots have done neurological scans of their brain to Camille I kind of like neurological thumb prints which we then animate within the machine let's see what they do I mean what we did was we invented some crazy shit let's see if they invent some new shit inside the simulator and all of a sudden the simulators inventing new technologies that are going up through the goddamn the different levels of the machine until finally it pops out and the programmers desk is like oh fucking awesome look at this one of these beings invented time travel let's make a time machine the machine invented time travel who knows but it's like a really great computer like right now we put into like what's it called Wolfram Alpha you can throw in some pretty awesome equations and I'll spit out it like you can do a lot of crazy shit yeah but how great would it be if you had just a machine where you just seed it with living beings and it starts regurgitating inventions that these beings are creating how fucking awesome would that be you know you know what I found the other day man it's laying around here somewhere it's a camera an Apple camera from my long fucking time ago man and it looks like such a piece of shit now it's so funny this is like one of the first digital cameras it's like a dinosaur and it's only from a tiny amount of years ago yeah what is 15 years in the greater spectrum of the universe yeah or just even of human history it ain't shit 15 years ain't yet but this 15 year old camel is fucking the useless just useless stupid looking camera do they always know that's another component of technological advancement is each the each earlier phase always seem stupid stupid but when it comes out it seems awesome awesome well try driving like an old car you know old cars they look great but if you try driving like a 1969 Chevelle they're really hard to handle there's a lot of slack in the steering they have this crazy power steering where it's really numb it feels real strange this they slide all over the place you hit the brakes they lock up and go sideways I mean they're really dangerous death traps yeah and then go from that to what you drive that mini well that thing is a little go-kart little go-kart spaceship how dare you it ain't no go-kart that's my butt I mean it's the way it's low to the ground like that that thing is or it's it's light and when you get a light car that has like a really good drivetrain and a good transmission and tight steering it's like you know no that wasn't even impossible well your mini you know people would consider you know a sporty like sort of economy car yeah that was a race car just a few decades ago dude what about this if I take my fucking phone I guess you know that you've been dealing with this for years but like I've been driving an 89 Volvo that could barely get me to the fucking grocery store for a very long time but so for me being on the phone and then I get into the Mini Cooper and speakers it's amazing that's crazy it just does it it knows the phone just shifts into the speakers of the car that's insane man it's incredible if you really stop and think about it think about the fact that we're driving around like that you know just talking in the air and it's transmitted somewhere else it's driving around doing the same thing how about these fucking what the quantum teleportation shit they're doing where they're blasting photons across Lakes what the fuck is that and they're saying like the articles that I've read and I didn't research them deeply but the articles I read it they're saying well this isn't teleportation but it's a nice step in that direction yeah like what did you just say you actually made a step in the direction of teleportation like think of the effect that has on society teleport fucking tation man where like instead of having to go through a security line at a goddamn airport you just zap zap from your home teleporter to fucking Asia in a millisecond where do you want to eat tonight France or China I don't know you decide you always make me fucking decide what about that nice little kabosh place in Egypt let's go there now you're just deciding anywhere on the planet that you want to go I think I'd like people showing up and then kicking you in the balls disappearing I don't know what is the kibosh I just made it up do that thing at the stoned food it's something stir the stones it's a mythical stone stoner food exists in mine simulator a kibosh never heard of a dude I think I wanted to say like something between a Kabbalah and a squash or something it's a combination of the Tree of Life mix thing I like buttered squash the kabob the Kabbalah was like the thing that like Roseanne was into for a while and Madonna I believe was into it for a while too right well yeah man and before then it's been around like much longer than that it's like you know tarot cards are based on it right it's a it's a crazy son of a bitch man it's just a it's trying to like map energy flows from nothingness into something this and it's a very strange esoteric thing which I don't understand I keep wanting to study it more when I like when I got strep throat and was fucking blasted on codeine for five days I spent a good two days just fucking reading the Cabal and I had fuck and tarot cards and I was putting them on the floor to try to understand the way they connect to the Cabal and I I don't remember anything that I got out of that but it was like a little bit of it because it's very complicated I keep like peeves some people have emailed me and said they understand it and I think I might get Rosanna on my podcast and then I could ask her directly dude that'd be incredible Roseanne Barr is a real fuckin she's a religion man just Iran yeah yeah I mean isn't she trying to try the run for president as oh shoot oh yeah she's running for fucking president man she's going for it's a good way to get info out there you know Wow it's you know get some exposure and she does not give a fuck I know what it's also a fun thing I'm sure no but she can't really think she's gonna be President she doesn't think she's gonna be President but she's got like shit that she's trying to get out in the world I mean if you follow her fucking Twitter stream and she blasts some crazy shit out there if Ron Paul couldn't fucking make it through that was though that was a disappointing one man that was almost like well let's see maybe this is real hey this is real but there's like so much evidence with him trying to suppress his victories he had won a couple of states they kept that shit under wraps God we always fall for the trick I thought for every fucking year man I thought every elective well I'm certainly wanted to believe the Obama feel like he was the closest guy to us you know who's like in his 40s young guy black eye it's single mom you know the whole deal like you'd figure this is a guy they would he's gonna set us right dude I was on fucking Sunset Boulevard and Silverlake drunk Howlin at cars with a group of hipsters when Obama got elected I was so fucking happy I voted I voted for him I fucking well man I was like this is it this is it and you know yeah it's done some pretty now look before I get as fucking assailed by a million tweets about the fucking drone attacks guys I understand understand I do know that there is some that fucking his DEA is busted more goddamn dispensaries than george w bush's fucking DEA you know like there's some fucked up shit going on but he'd you know there are some other things that he's you know the big thing was the social thing to me it was like well we we have accepted a guy who's half black from a single mom you know who admits he smoked marijuana you know didn't he say he did a little coke but this is the problem he fucking jokes about smoking dope and his goddamn DEA is tossing farmers in prison yeah and not only that you know we sell them this hemp force protein powder we can't even grow this hemp in America we have to get it from Canada cuz although in and thank you for informing me and all this folks people tweeted me that it was legal in Vermont so we looked into it and it is but the federal government is not letting people do it they're still saying it's illegal federally and this is just growing the plant hemp which is it's psychoactive at all you know I because it's related to marijuana they've decided that there's no way people should be able to grow it just hilarious so you can you can have it but you got to buy it from Canada so we have this wacky deal we have to import that shit even though it's it's not even psychoactive they're just telling you that a useful plant is illegal it's really weird I mean it's it's one of the weirdest aspects of the drug war and you know the the war for marijuana legalization is the the the actual like hemp hemp fiber they actually hemp as a as a resource yes you know oh yeah as a commodity hemp as a commodity is very very valuable it's very valuable yet illegal to grow and harvest in this country owned by the colonies yeah and people don't have any idea that it's that's what rope used to be made of that's what canvas is made out of when you paint all those like ancient paintings like like the Mona Lisa those are made on cannabis it's canvas it's so it's the it comes from the word cannabis because it's a stronger fiber cotton is weakest shit and compared to have like we get used to cotton or just we just assume that that's just what it happened is what it is but the cotton is nothing compared to have hemp paper is better have papers like really hard to rip it's like fucking super straw it's weird it's kind of like an alien plant man the stalk is really light but it gets real dense and hard dude don't get me going on the fucking on that plant man because I said it's insane when you get around a nice flourishing marijuana plant you know like when you get around a fucking monkey and it's like dog plus mm-hmm marijuana plants maybe I'm just projecting but they seem like plants plus yeah like they seem like is a little bit more going on in the sons of bitches they've got a weird fucking energy field around them that's just different I went to a dispensaries grow room once and you walk into their back room they had a grow room and the grow room was like tingly yeah and there's all these plants that are like super healthy and super moist they're getting spray they have like a little spray thing it's timed it's spraying them certain times during the day and they have they live under these lamps and you know the lamps are on for a certain amount I'm all for certain around time and you we watched it and it's like these are like intelligent creatures they feel like they're there they feel like they're greeting you with their energy yeah it's strange then it's even creepier that you chop them up like what the fuck man you don't even let them grow you grow them grow a certain point they're like alright time to die bitch yeah good chop them and then you light them on fire dude and that's the relationship it's the fucking fire sacrifice man it's like this isn't you know this is like in every single religion hmm there's a reference to burning incense there's one Bush burning the burning bush it's an everything dude and it's like the fact that the component has been removed from the equation the variables they're trying to take the variable out of the fucking equation it's like when I sometimes when you go to certain churches it's like a bunch of people how many churches are you going to oh dude you got to go to fucking churches from time to time you kidding fuck yeah and they're so psychedelic and cool and interesting phenomena it's like I don't I mean I will I'll go to a church over a zoo really I'll go to a church over a laser light show so how often do you go into churches I've been I went on it for a little tear of going to a Gnostic Christian Church because of this book that I read really yeah I would yeah you eat some edible marijuana and go to the Gnostic Christian Church to watch the Gnostic which is this beautiful ancient ceremony which is like basically a uh it's a Napolitan it is it's an occult ritual it's like you're doing something called the transubstantiation which is transforming matter into like the flesh of infinity but the Gnostics don't look take things literally it's a different fucking thing altogether and it's quite beautiful I'm not a gnostic Christian but man chop on some fucking marijuana go to a Gnostic Christian Church respectfully don't go there like some asshole go there respectfully and fucking report back you'll find that the experience is rather moving and beautiful and it's um when you can see how that component in religion is very important psychedelic see we do psychedelics now right generally we do psychedelics what we don't have ceremony we have a kind of rudimentary ceremony the passing of the joint certain rules based around the the consumption of the substance but there's no real like ceremony after that I think some people do it but it's mostly you get high and you watch them you know you hang out with your friends maybe you work out go jogging draw write there's like rudimentary low-level ceremonies but no like chanting candles incense agent what's the benefit of the ceremony well one one thing that the first thing to remove from when it comes to like spiritual stuff is the term is benefit you know what I mean because it's like it's it's a weird thing that plays against a lot of the way we understand shit is it's like no it's not like you're not going for it for like so much of benefit though it is entertaining and you are getting some instant kind of benefit from like just like being in a beautiful space listening people chant when you're super baked there's some immediate benefit that comes from that but the I think there's a lot of I mean the the the the it's a deep it's for me the experience was like this is a very old thing that I don't understand that well and the energy in here is fuckin cool that was it the first that was the first thing that came out of it and then the priests made a joke about marijuana actually it was it was like really yeah I can't remember but I remember being like whoa fucking crazy man because I just been reading in this book magic marijuana and religion that like cannabis was ritualistically consumed in Nasik ceremonies and so it was like kind of weird and interesting anyway man it's it's a it's a beautiful fucking thing but when you see rituals that don't have psychoactive components in them sometimes it feels like you're watching people warming their hands on dry tender that hasn't been set alight and pretending that there's fire coming up out of it you know it's like you you were to remove the psychedelic from ritual when we see in like so many indigenous cultures the it's a component of their spirituality in their religion it's kind of interesting yeah it was a very important aspect of the growth you know a very important aspect of the you know the the ceremony itself the transcending to the next stage to going through the experience the trip you know to having the Vision Quest you know which yes the the peyote ritual whether it was the ayahuasca ritual whether it was mushrooms in you know in South America in Mexico whatever with it whatever it was it was all about a transformative experience it was all about you know getting closer to Gaia getting closer to the energy of the the true energy which we all get off man it's society is very complicated you know they are social interactions are so overbearing the idea that there's 300 million of us jammed onto this spot interacting with each other all the time and you know this it's it's hard to it's hard to stay steady it's hard to stay on track not freak out it's hard but then this comedy I'm freaking out too is problem too it's when more you freak out and get pissed at things the funnier it is yeah and you gotta let yourself freak too I mean that's another thing is like people this fucking thing where people are all about being happy all the time people have confused you know happiness is the end goal like having this emotional state of just I'm happy like that's not it ideas being you're fully yourself and the entire spectrum of emotional experience you know man and it's like in part of the emotional experience of existing is having meltdowns from time to time like it's good to have a nice meltdown from time to time it's good to like freak from don't beat yourself up for fucking losing your shit right it's gonna happen why wouldn't you lose your shit you're in a goddamn simulator with fucking dual air correcting code at the fundamental layer of the universe and the thing is more than allegedly we're too stupid to really understand that more than likely a telescoping simulation where each incremental telescoping moving out becomes more and more entropic and out of focus and we're somewhere in this like middle mid range of this telescoping simulator that keeps getting washed out more and more and more this is the principle and physics of the universe expanding and running out of energy or the idea and Hinduism of Kali Yuga the final age of human beings or the Mayan calendar and all the various eschatological prophecies talking about the end of the world the fucking simulator is gonna run out of juice someone's getting get called to dinner and have to stop playing the fucking game or or I love my country I love God I love guns that's right and anybody wants change that you gotta come through me I gotta come through me I love my simulator I love the programmer and anybody who wants to fuck with the operating system it's gonna have to go through my firewall I love the engineer I took the blue pill yeah right well then you know those guys are nuts didn't one of those fucking guys get a sec yeah yeah well you know the whole controversy behind the script there was a woman who claimed that she had written that and given it to them like years before and they took the idea and made it a movie but I think she lost I think she lost in court it's gotta be hard to try to get money out of the matrix even if it's true this fucking so much money behind that that machine but yes she sued I don't know if she's crazy I shouldn't even be bringing it up cuz you never really know like sometimes sometimes people steal ideas but sometimes people are kind of crazy well I mean and also the idea of the matrix it's sounds like an age-old idea yeah but I think the similarities were very extreme oh really yeah I'm talking on my ass let me pull it up real quick what a great movie man there's so much information encoded in that son of a bitch telethons the sequels were terrible I don't remember the sequels you know no man I really don't I remember the first almost think they gave the right the reins to somebody else Snopes there's a Snopes which means it's a problem right isn't it usually what is Snopes yeah when Snopes it's like they're clearing up a myth isn't all almost all of Snopes crying up myths right yeah this is uh it says the claim is that she won a large judgment in a copyright infringement suit over the authorship the film The Matrix that is false apparently and she started in okay in October 4th 2004 ended a six-year dispute involving Sofia Stewart and so if six fucking years had dragged on copyright infringement racketeering received and acknowledged by the Centre Central District of California blah blah blah Stewart who has resided in Salt Lake City for the past five years will recover damages from the film's wait a minute hmm she would cover damages the matrix 1 2 and 3 as well as the Terminator and its sequels holy shit she will soon receive one of the biggest payoffs in the history of Hollywood as well as gross receipts of both films and their sequels the total of 2.5 billion dollars Stewart for what I thought it just said it wasn't real yeah I got confused I thought they were explaining it oh this is examples this is an apples of the various lies oh I say ok 2.5 billion dollars yeah apparently she generated controversy by claiming in a lawsuit brought against directors Andy and Larry which one we came to check when can I ask you something holla when you deposit a huge amount of money into a bank into your bank account how long does it take to go through like if you deposited like a million dollars in your bank account I don't know who listen to this Stewart's case was dismissed in June 2005 when she failed to show up for a preliminary hearing of her case and a 53 page ruling judge Margaret Morrow the central district court of Chau for a dismiss the suit saying Stewart and her attorneys had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and she didn't show up that's crazy well man what that is you think they paid her I think they pulled her son Scylla so much I don't know I maybe why why not they've got a shitload of money who knows I don't know probably know I wonder wonder how close it was close the case was I mean she's a knows man you can do you can take anyone to court you know like you can file suit against people right I mean people when I worked at the comedy sort of filed suit against Mitzi for sinning negative telepathic vibes into their thoughts for real yeah we go to court for that kuks look up the parking meter lady there's someone suing the city for their new parking meters you can google search it it's like all over the news right now it freaked her out do some people just like lawsuits they just get really good at it's like a hobby just fuck with the system try to drag things through I mean of course some people make a lot of money like some people will actually track down ladies nights and sue the fucking companies because they can't get in yeah yeah that's hilarious yeah that's like a way that's some people's bread and butter awareness is a people will find places that aren't like equipped for any if for for people in wheelchairs and they'll fucking sue a man and you know in that way I am very much a feminist in that I think women should be allowed to have their own fucking gym and I don't think you should be allowed to protest that I think if women want to workout a gym with no drooling fucking ape dudes any guy who try to go to that gym is an asshole if you want to go to a gym that's just completely filled with women who don't want to be around men they know the deal that's what they agreed to and you want to claim that your rights are being violated because this gym is closest to you so you just by proximity you should be allowed to use it like they shouldn't be what ridiculousness you shouldn't be allowed to limit your business to only include one gender because the other gender is always trying to fuck that single gender they always make it uncomfortable and feel weird when they're fucking stretching out yeah that is that's fucking gross it's gross it's gross than any asshole would actually try to sue them for that by that you would want to go but but you know it but that's we're because like you know women's bathrooms are like sovereign nations for women a man can't sue to be allowed to go into a woman's bathroom well one we can't sue to being a man's man right so in their of their attend sue if there's not a woman's bathroom if you go to a place and there's only a man's bathroom not a - all right you have to have both yeah you have to have both so they would have to build a gym if they built a gym next to that gym all men for all men gym one would be empty and one would be filled with women yeah well all men Jim gets filled with gay guys oh yeah I forgot about that Gold's Gym dumb joke I forgot about that I when I first was on Newsradio I work out there and I had this whole bit about it doing the bench press and dudes would just like spot you they wouldn't even ask they would just literally just dangle their balls right above your head they were like so cocky like dudes were like hitting on dudes left and right in this gym it was crazy because that's what they were there for i watch these guys just just fucking grunting through a set they were doing the guy was doing rows you know so he's like bent over and the other guy is chest to back okay pressing down on him and the way he's spotting him is you know the guy is holding on to the bar and he's holding on to the top of the bar chest to back and it's like he's fucking a man I mean it's like it's really physical like if I was doing that I would you know if it was a check if I was doing that to my wife I'd kinda take my my dick would get hard if you were helping our pull and push like that he would start to just put this fucking weight down what's up you know you would immediately want to fuck well now it's a fucking motion and these guys were doing that in the gym no it's funny how like them it's funny how the mythical the mythical world of porn like in the Incas in the porn universe the physics of porn are not the physics of the material world the MIT physics of porn that shit happens dude you're at the gym and some chicks like hey so can you spot me for a second and you're like sure I'll spot you and then like just you just start sucking your dick yeah wow I can't believe that guess I owe you one zip yeah yeah that's the horn and then another dude will come over and you start jacking off and sticking into her while she's sucking your dick you don't care yeah yeah what's up buddy yeah let's try to train on this bitch but in there but it's weird how like in like you know like places like what you're talking about which I had this guy very fucking brilliant guy Connor a beep who also happens to be a gay porn star on my podcast and he was talking about fucking your own actually a great essay on cruising and and which will permanently shift your notion of rest areas permanently prick but like you know he calls those types of gems that you're talking about I think the term we used was cruzi is the word of it so yeah so like those places that the physics in there are the same as inside porn if you're a gay dude you can go to a gem and like any good fuck yeah you're gonna fuck yeah it's a completely different experience because there's no yang it's all just everybody's easy or even there's no yin I don't know which one is the hard style but it's just just fucking it up that's it they just they're just looking to fuck one thing I've never thought on my way to the gym is I'm probably gonna get laid in here never thought that I'm like I think I'm gonna fucking probably at a blow job after my fucking squats today I told you when Bravo and I used to work out at this gym we used to work out at 24 hour fitness and when we would go there there was a dude that we got friendly with it was the magic guy real friendly guy he's had he had just transferred over from Santa Monica and he was just so happy he was so relaxed to be in like the suburbs and I go well what's going on he goes I was brought in there to clean it up and he was brought in there because they were just fucking everywhere they had just turned it into a gay gym it was just not just to gauge him but it was a it was a gay pickup joint it was a it was a disco so they would have a steam room they would fuck in a steam room people would constantly be walking in on guys fucking in the steam room they would find loads all over the benches shit he'd have to come in and hose everything down so they had like literally like to clean up the whole place and tell them they got to stop fucking and people get mad at them like what do you think there was like one guy who's like straight and just annoyed all the time because he was always sitting and and like fucking workout dude I'm sure there must have been some straight guys there I though I was straight when I worked out at Gold's Gym I was straight like the guys back when I started there before I went queer I was straight and I was there and so guys I worked with were straight and they were there it was a convenient gym it wasn't all gay but it was at least 50 percent maybe more gay and they were really like they owned it they owned I own being gay they owned that place they would wear like timberland boots with like fluffy puffy socks and like shaved legs very muscular legs with ready ready ready Daisy Duke shorts yeah yeah and guys would work out like that with a tank top on they working as fuck dude at the fucking is Gold's Gym I used to work out at Gold's Gym in Hollywood on Cole that's what I'm talking about Oh Gold's on Cole yeah dude there was a guy in chaps yeah fucking black a black leather hat and fucking chaps like he was like just wandered off of a fucking ranch filled with their spot man you know like good for them that I've never understood anti-gay feelings they seem like they're having a fun time I know I know a lot of gay people and I it seems like they're having a good time they got a lot of exposed disposable income you know yeah I know this gay couple they're always driving a new car like they had a great time yeah man yeah no I know these fucking homophobes these so stupid bucks right now are really like really but it's cool man because like what's happening what's really cool and fascinating is like the bigots are the ones who are being driven into the closet it used to be that like it's like reversing like gay people are coming out of the closet yeah and bigots are getting pushed into the closet that they came out of which is great fucking it part that's a good balance that's what it should be like and I've always said that that that's my take on everything that as a human being that I should be a humanist you know and I should it shouldn't matter whether I'm with the straights or with the gays or the whites of the box we should all just be with the humans and I've resisted any ideas of being a masculine ax store any ideas of being a feminist or any being a nationalist or any ideas of being a peacenik or more money to stop it this is like it's this ridiculous you're a fucking human we're all human and it should be real simple we should get in each other's way as little as possible help each other out as much as possible it's really that simple it's very simple it's really that simple and anything else is crazy and that's why you know it if you got really upset about this whole Tosh thing and people got upset at the backlash but what I I think we we can't ever pretend that intent is not important what can't ever pretend that there are buzzwords that you can never use or subjects which you can never cover or you know or you're not allowed to because someone could have possibly had a bad experience in a triggering event that's not comedy man you you can't have those sort of restrictions and have stand-up comedy you're it's not going to work that way you're gonna miss out on a lot of great comedy dude you can't have those fucking restrictions on anything you can't have it on literature you can't have it on poetry you can't have any smart people want to restrict people why do these smart people want to come down on it so hard when they know what is really going on well it's a I think there's a bunch of different answers that question I think there's a variety of reasons people want to do it from the from like I suppose like people who are like Crusaders and truly are true believers and what they're doing like really have gotten the fucking the the language virus to the to the enth degree and for really believe that they have to fucking shoot the abortion doctor in the fucking face you know really fucking believe to like all the way to that the you know bottom level where it's just like people are trying to look fucking cool or even worse how about the guy who goes into the Sikh temple and doesn't even understand the Sikhs are very peaceful people and thinks that they're Muslims in somehow or way and he's got 9/11 tattoos on his body he kills a bunch of people yeah yeah how about time no see the unless you want to Alex Jones it up false flag operations false flag well look man I don't I don't fucking know man but I do think that the complexity of the way that I think that the that greedy selfish lying people tend to use complexity to their advantage and people who seem to be more on the fucking beam as the freemasons say have very simple ideas very simple fucking ideas like what my what Gandhi said you know very simple idea find someone who needs help and help them it's simple right and right away some assholes like yeah but what does that mean what does help mean it's like I'll tell you what help means somebody fucking might need you to loan them some money somebody might need you to bring them some soup somebody might need a ride to the fucking Airport it's not complicated man it's basic and if everyone starts following the basic principles like that then there's plenty of resources yeah yeah the real problem is we got this weird competitive game that's going on and it's it's set up not not an efficient way where we generate just the amount that we need in order to be happy but in some crazy way where you never think enough is enough and the game becomes part of what motivates you and instead of it just being about happiness it sometimes morphs into just being about the numbers just being about the game just being about accomplishments and you get nutty and you're like you could become Evander Holyfield when you're living in a 110 room mansion that cost a million dollars a year to keep the electricity on I mean that's people can get like that yeah there's a I saw a fucking a piece of real estate online the other day there was a house for 40 fucking million dollars I was looking at this hassles like that is the craziest fucking shit I've ever seen in my life this but somewhere there's a dude is like I'm ready to take it to the next level well here with this 10 million dollar house it's a piece of shit to me yeah a minute to move up like an international want to be at the top monetary gangster-type motherfucker without serious shekels top of the tree there's a great website check it out awesome blog rich kids of Instagram have you seen this shit no dude Google that look at the receipts oh these fucking rich kids they put receipts they take pictures of receive hundred and three thousand dollar dinners with like what yeah good kids yeah rich kids of Instagram you fucking check I guess you do this to me I'm apologize but it's amazing it's an amazing website man I'm fucking inflatable wow it's like the first when I wrote rich grids rich kids of Instagram so one of the first it's a beautiful site dude and they're saying they're gonna have to like try to keep their kids from like posting this shit on Instagram okay really cuz it's a security fence so it is a website Instagram calm rich kids of Instagram calm yeah it's amazing they have a giant bottle of my way and they're mmm just scroll that or gallons of my way handfuls dude get to the receipt just scroll down there's a hundred and three thousand dollars seat Wow the girls chilling in the mansion she's a little kid yeah I can't find any receipts but they got some dope-ass houses if they do yeah wow those guys living in the fucking castle yeah they live in castles it must be really hard to be like yeah Harry is 117,000 put the receipt online with a douche bag but cokes are like ten bucks sentro pay ya cappuccinos twelve dollars coca-cola's 20.0 ten dollars to Coco's ten dollars each but it's like crazy whines Dom Penn Yan $4,000 oh another Dom $5,000 oh my god it's crazy 107 grand yeah dinner what's the tip uh it doesn't show I know it says 107 grand it's gotta be maybe in central pay you don't tip maybe it's one of those weird places there's a lot of places where you don't tip right you know or you do you mean you can I do but they don't they don't expect it I'm sure the waiter gets taken care of at a restaurant that has a hundred and seven thousand dollar dinners maybe but when you have 45 I said four thousand I'm sorry I meant forty thousand the Dom Perignon it's $40,000 so is the other one that's not five thousand it's 50,000 yeah that's why it's so hard that's fucking incredible you can buy a bottle of something for 50,000 bucks sure we sure it's dollars it's not you can buy it you can sell it that's the hopeful aspect of it there's dip shits out they're gonna pay fifty fucking thousand dollars for your goddamn carbonated grape juice how dumb is that that's awesome there's another craziest thing of all time that someone would actually spend that much money I mean how good could it be kiss you no way can be it can't be it's probably not even as good as kool-aid kool-aid is fucking delicious especially if you're really thirsty it's sweet it's delicious dude if I'm paying forty thousand dollars or something that shouldn't come out of the fucking some frozen vault of those laboratories and better fucking they better be the acid that Hoffman first generated and stored in a crystal vial somewhere deep under the Pentagon that even that and maybe that would be worth $50,000 cuz it would be so life-changing yeah yeah it's kind of silly man it's kind of the weird thing with wine wine is such a strange beverage people that get together and work on the taste of it and they have an educated palates and some of them like they they become you know like high-level Somalia's they can like detect like where the grapes are from but just by tasting a glass of wine dude it's weird it's fucking weird but it's I mean definitely like when I went up to like I went up to fucking solving one stitch now I get to drink like wine from the vineyards and yeah it's awesome dude it's incredible the variations in the taste and they're like the beauty of the set of the terrain it's like a really beautiful thing man it's like I would sit like up there's a different what's the climate like I think when we were there as hot as I recall man and summer it was summer and we got this you get like cars to drive you around cuz you're gonna get trashed going to the vineyards slurping all that wine and a fucking goddamn driver was like an AAA dude it's like still our drivers this sober guy driving us to the vineyards and you felt kind of guilty by the end of the day because you're just like in the back of the goddamn car with like crusty red wine all over your lips how much wine did you drink over the course of a day oh god I didn't have to worry about a DUI no I was taking marijuana tincture at the same time so what do you think you check it half a gallon maybe like they just it's pretty free people must be falling down left and right oh they're trashed and by the end of the day you're like slurring your words gesturing it fucking vaguely like things on the menu barely talk I can't I can never do that just you do you don't have to get I can't I can't well I can't get drunk at dinner ever because then I come home to the kids I never walk around my kids yeah that's why it's good to have kids man got older I get the more inhuman I feel because I don't have a little fucking talk yeah I'm sure you would but you were first of all I have to have a relationship with a person what deep deep relationship with a person and know each other very very very well yeah and you enjoy each other very much and if you don't you're fucked and then it's becomes a nightmare but you know keeps you from coming home drunk that's for fuck sure no it doesn't keep a lot of people for their fools a lot of people it does not keep them going yeah I think it's you should not be impaired or on your kid dude have you seen that picture of the baby sleeping under the barstool here's the map picture I don't want to hear brother fucking dragging the kid to the bar I don't want to hear about it dude there's so many people that just they just fucking get a shit roll the dice and they're born into a family full of dummies dummies doing dumb things yeah man it's a bit of a problem I wondered if things are really changing Duncan the way I feel like they're changing I wonder if it's just my circle of people and wonder if it's just the people that we come in contact with through the podcast and through Twitter that all the positive people I wonder how much the world shares in the sort of the vibe that we that we feel and that we're riding and I always wonder if that is what if putting that out there if if it's possible that we can get our shit together by using the Internet by using pod by using you know different ways to communicate to each other that we can somehow another all be reached and all get our shit together in this generation more so than anybody has ever done before well you know man I mean I think that there has to be a you know everyone has to keep using the technology it's like dude like when I went to fucking Cincinnati Mike this guy I met this awesome guy named Izzy he started his own podcast from wasn't any Europe podcast and listening to my podcast he started his own podcast called tales from the hardside and he came outside yeah but he was no man he definitely is like a fucking kind of like a rip dude like he's definitely like had a very fascinating life but you know the point is he start like he listened to this and then he started to he started his own podcast and and in like he's like there's like a group of them who hang out together now from like listening to your podcast and from listening to my podcast and they started their own fucking podcast which is a kind of cool thing fuck yeah because it's spreading it's spreading it more you know it's like it's like people the bottom line is you can't get hierarchical with your geography cuz a lot of people are like you know I just live in Pennsylvania there's no one here to have a good conversation with her wherever the fuck they say they live it's like I guarantee you're surrounded by people who want to talk about philosophical shit and want to connect with someone on a level deeper than just what you had for lunch and what the pot what well you know what fucking clothes are cool or movies or whatever you say that but unless you're in a city that's probably not the case dude I was just in well you know oh yeah that day I depending on how old you are especially man all we all I know is that like I don't want to sound like too like weirdly patting myself on the back but it's you to like when go to these fucking shows dude there's thousands of fucking people there yeah when you talk to them after the show they're all really fucking cool and they didn't all just come from metropolitan areas these people are coming from different short towns and cities and and they have but they have access to us they don't they might not have access to people near them as what I'm saying that also share in those interests it might not be anybody around them like that you might think there is but unless they're in a really area where there's a lot of people to choose from you might not be correct it takes a lot of people or a lot of focus to break to get the group of 2,000 people that will come to see one of our shows you got to go through hundreds of thousands of regular people now to find those 2,000 disenfranchised people they really want to say fuck yeah Duncan Trussell bust our little hobo bitch no people to listen to this podcast the people that look I've had people come up to me that say I I hate the word cunt and then I I loved your podcast the first time I heard you say cunt it bugged me but now I say it every day now everything's a cunt everyone's a con she's a cunt this as a comic apps account my sister's a cunt and it just becomes a part of your vernacular and that's nothing I'm proud of but that's the type of thing that can happen and if it can happen with something bad or stupid ridiculous like the word cunt it can happen with any sort of idea any idea can get through because of a podcast like the idea of you know treating each other treating each other really as if we are ourselves living in another life the idea of recognizing that this really is a temporary situation situation temporary situation and you need to live it you ly need to live this bitch up okay because you're not gonna feel good unless you do if you you hang back and be that guy that you described earlier who's 30 well which I'm 40 I'll get my shit together and 40 and I still have a career but a man I got a good job I'm gonna keep it for a little while maybe I'm gonna learn how to be an apprentice yeah and then one day is dead yeah he loves ride and you keel over then it could be a guy like you the guy who's counting on Peaks valleys and had dry spots and and now it's riding this new crazy wave well you sort of just figured out how to get on the board and really fucking travel yeah yeah that's the fucking cool thing man is because it's right there and it just requires a kind of like you just have to fucking it's really so the thing is it's so fucking simple it's like it's not it's not because to have access to people is not simple by any stretch of the imagination to have the right ideas sure but in order to get those ideas in front of people that takes a heroic effort man I just think like well the thing that I'm like hesitating to say cuz I don't want it to sound fucking coffee is like I really do think that people can like organize yeah I do believe that and wherever you're at man there's gotta be something there's ways that you could fucking figure out other people who like have this sure interest that we talk about here well I think through Twitter that's one way we can find out people that are interested in the same kind of shows that you're interested in and you find out that you're hey where's the cool motherfuckers up in Tallahassee and you put that up on Twitter and you know put Tallahassee as a hashtag actually now people are doing it back and forth that's it dude and it's like that that it's really fuckin important because it's not just good enough to exist in fucking digital space with people you need it's like something about getting into fucking meatspace with people and like exchanging ideas they're like being around people it like it it kind of shines a light in the shadowy darkness that can come into you if you've isolated yourself because you feel like you're a psychotic freak with insane ideas yeah you know instead of realizing like no man a lot of people are thinking this shit right now a lot of people are a lot of people willing to entertain all sorts of alternative ideas you'd be amazed and they're around you yeah like like our boy Matt Staggs living down in Brizzy Mississippi or some Tennessee someone yeah which nashville is in tennessee tennessee is awesome spots as does mississippi but you know here's a wonderful be there anymore what's like let's get out of there the internet the internet well I think Stags is definitely like on the precipice of some crazy shit happening because he's like definitely becoming like a conduit for a lot of crazy ideas and he like always hooks me up with like some with great guys yeah and he's running the disinfo podcast too yeah so that's gonna do that soon I have to I have to get with him yeah it's um we're living in a strange time of transition I'm really curious to see I I think this the whole Terence Mckenna 2012 thing is like I always I always laughed I always thought it like a movie really cool if it was true but I'm waiting too stupid to really understand any of the science behind it even has a real or not or the arguments behind it yeah like I saw the the Watson a disagreement or anything was called the Watson objection Watson objection was a mathematician who deciphered the time wave zero novelty theory and had zone objection to it fucking they both lost me within the first paragraph I mean what you're saying there's also less complex mathematical reputations the theory and I've heard that just like you know leap year wasn't accounted for us in twenty twelve happened some time ago right so it's like you know that the the again but though this is like people getting caught up in the surface level shit and trying to like now no it's not gonna happen on December 21st 2012 and trying it like but it's like no look what's happening around you I wonder if what they calculated when they calculated the Mayan calendars besides you know the moons the the the rather he eclipses of the moon and eclipses of the Sun I wonder if they could calculate how long it would take for a culture to grow before it imploded when if there's like just a just a set number like a culture can only last for it's like he can run and then you fall down yeah and they figure that out a long time ago not good for like these 10 thousand year pulses or whatever the fuck it is no there's there's a guy he's a easy you if you I bet if you googled extinction theorist right now that's what he's called he's a he's a he's also the guy who's like into simulation theory too and he's you know he's tries to answer that question while we haven't encountered alien species and it is this notion that they implode in on themselves I can't worse it's on YouTube I wish I could remember his fucking name he's brilliant I put a clip of him on one of my podcasts when the same podcast that I was talking about the guy from the University of Maryland cuz he was he was he was the one who was talking about the idea of a vasectomy human brain or slicing it into fucking thin thin layers to scan the neurology katka I've got no extinction theorists shit man I can't wear his fucking name he's brothers evolutionary theory of course but last dinosaur extinction theory no if you look up simulation theory and like explanation Theory like studies this shit it's a really weird like ways that we can ways that our species could blink out oh so so many ways anyway the what the fuck is his naming its goddamn brilliant have you seen those the impact of meteors a meteor shower all over the world they discovered 12,000 years ago he told me about this shit in the sedimentary layers yeah yeah they've done core samples and it's the same spot all over the globe and it's the same sort of shit that exists when you have nuclear bombs going off it makes like a glass the world got pelted by fucking giant chunks of rock gets slowed down to that shit bursting through breaking the fucking sound barrier as it goes rocketing down into the fucking earth boom boom that must have been fucked up man I wonder if they had writing back then cuz I don't know if we know that they had writing 12,000 years ago I know it all depended upon whether or not that event that twelve thousand year old event was really the sort of mass extinction event that like Graham Hancock and a lot of people think might have happened to to human culture or humankind rather the human species because they they you know there's a lot of speculation about like when is the oldest civilization and they think pretty much settled on Mesopotamia they settle on like sumaré but the the Sumerian text details a long lost civilization and older advanced civilization like they kind of all do they all talk about some dudes existed before I really had it down yeah and Samara was supposed to be like 6,000 - years ago so imagine if that's what it was it's a 6,000 year Trek from the time that they got pelted with we can't wrap our heads around how long that is that's so long ago but yet nothing you know in the greater spectrum of the universe nothing but in the the idea of our lifetime 6,000 years is a long fucking time ago and they talked about an old civilization an old ancient civilization that existed that was wiped out the epic of gilgamesh which is essentially very similar to the noah's ark story about about cataclysmic flood and floods yeah they they probably experienced some fucking nutty shit man probably killed almost everybody that's probably that probably explains a lot shit a lot of shit all over the world like gobekli tepe all these weird structures that they're finding from pre 12,000 years that Gobekli templates 14,000 years ago that means in Sumer the really old shit in Sumer is like 6,000 plus years ago 7,000 plus years ago this is double that so this is as old - sumaré as we are - sumaré assumed heirs to us that's fuck that's the distance so having the distance of people writing on clay tablets in scratches in these little scratches up and down and sideways yeah that was their whole language and the idea that they wrote of something from 7,000 years previous maybe and that's what gobekli tepe shows it shows that there was a sophisticated civilization from 7,000 years prior to the the people in Samara and the people in Mesopotamia 7,000 years earlier they were making these 19 foot tall gigantic stone columns they were carved with animals that were carved in a relief so that like they stuck out which is a really sophisticated method of carving you're not carving into the stone you're actually making a relief with it sticks out so you chipped all the rest of the stone away to reveal this frog and to reveal this bird this is really sophisticated stuff it's hard for people to wrap their heads around it so when I start talking about like hunter and gatherers from you know wearing skins around their dick that these are the ones that built this boy I don't know I don't know this is a you might have more evidence of the fact that there might have been some really super advanced cultures that got fucking pelted just wiped out everybody no talking anymore changed languages no no fucking written shit no Darla's their brains the fucking Road like it was like the road worse nuclear ash falling down yeah fucking just decimation well by studying genetics I believe that they've found several extinction events in the human genome like they've isolated several events I don't understand science behind this I really am talking like extremely deep out of my ass but I believe they've shown that when studying the the the DNA from different human beings of all over the world they've concluded that they've been several times where the human species has gotten very low as low as like a few thousand people and that you know we probably had a big number and then a much smaller number and they got as low as a few thousand people and then we had a recover it's fucking amazing it's amazing what they found out just by studying genes you know well isn't this kind of like that one of the ideas of like the Freemasons or the Rosicrucians or the secret societies is that the information from a very long time ago has been kept secret yes like yeah they said but they kind of work signs to each other they work symbols into the architecture of society right and which is that fucking crazy goddamn if you look at this the street configurations of Washington DC have you seen that shit where it's like a anatomically correct eyeball looking out over a pyramid just like the eye and the dollar bill I mean come on dude how do you how do you how would you describe that if I was gonna Google that Masonic symbols and DC I don't know Washington DC Masonic Washington DC Road roads I don't know fucking little tea stone to Google I'm gonna go with Masonic symbols in DC yup here it is yeah the they have it laid out yeah Wow I mean that's that's like you got a really believe of a pentagram yeah there's a pentagram in there there's a fucking optics so strange yeah there's an eye there's an optic nerve and I there's a pentagram it's real weird when you look at like the money and you see the fucking all-seeing eye and a pyramid on you know the cap of the pyramid is the all-seeing eye like what he's saying I mean look man printing it on money okay but how about putting into the goddamn geography of the fucking capital of the country that you made trying to embody the ideals that you know you knew mm-hmm and you encoded into the fucking very patterns let me look man there's a goddamn monolith the Washington Monument an obelisk an egyptian-style yeah remember how the Egyptians helped with the Revolutionary War because they were there for us they provide us with what's what's even crazier is that Egypt at one point in time was thriving and then if this was nothing they're like they they they showed up and the Sphinx was like covered up to its neck like during the age of Napoleon when they even they first yet found that it was like a fuckin everything was abandoned they'd already looted all these different tombs who knows how much really incredible shit was melted down for gold baubles and shit when they didn't understand historical worth well I mean dude that I like one thing that like over time that time is proven again and again and again is that shit doesn't always work out great for the smart people with good ideas you end up getting thrown into basements by dumb people who are like what the fuck are you talking about Galileo they end up imprisoning you sometimes they crucify you sometimes they embarrass you sometimes they take away your property so overtime really smart people were like you know what why don't we just fucking keep this shit to ourselves well you know that's the theory behind mushrooms and the church that's the theory a lot of this was young Ervin's work and another dude who died who turned out to be a child molester but he did a lot of really good work with with with mushrooms with the historical and he was writing a book with Jack Herer when he got arrested for being a child molester this guy fucked up Jack Herer because it fucked up the research and it really like sort of invalidated and a lot of people's ideas like this work this guy had done but they have so many images and photos of ancient religious art that involved mushroom symbolism when you looked at it over and over and over again you're like oh my god like this is so obvious like first of all the halos the halos did not look like they're the frisbee thing yes they looked like a mushroom cap and they were circular behind the person's head and the idea was to insinuate that that person that holy person was under the influence of God under the influence of the mushroom yes and that's totally believable and that makes a lot clearly believable and the images of the doors they're shaped like mushrooms doorways are shaped like ones mushroom symbolism and in so many different places and there were so many images of people in bliss naked in bliss covered in a mushroom they would be in a transparent mushroom these are like fucking ancient paintings of them well I mean yeah it's definitely like that we we do know that they're encoded into the fucking framework of our society in the goddamn architecture of our society or some very odd symbols like if you look at the the cathedrals you will find Gnostic sim symbols chicken gods Abraxas you can see a practice in some cathedrals well it's a chicken God it's some Gnostic fucking God you can Wikipedia bar axis it's this happens to be the same name of the company doing this goddamn trapwire shit - no way yeah look up Abraxas Gnostic Abraxas a chicken attic got a spelling a Braa praxis access Abraxas gnostic Wikipedia for some reason the creepiest goddamn information gathering surveillance company that's ever climbed out of the shadows or been exposed to happen to name themselves after a gnostic God with a chicken head what the fuck man yeah go figure a chicken God well this thing is freaky looking yeah it's freaky looking and that's in cathedrals they like is like a lot of the that you know a lot of these symbols they let they the cathedrals were apparently I read this and I can't read the name it's one of Graham Hancock's books that fucking Staggs sent me because he's trying to drive me insane but one of them but but but um but yeah like in in this fucking book it talks about how the cathedrals were like a nexus where I'm absent show it as a chicken man shows it as a man I've seen the one with the chicken it's definitely chicken oh that's weird because this one this image is a man look Google Abraxas chicken okay that's Gnostic chicken and fucking Nashville it's a great name for a fucking chicken - this man Abraxas chicken chicken god chicken god yeah just Abraxas chicken it's got chicken head hmm no I'm looking at em I'm looking for chicken a breakfast it comes up right away let's see a breakfast it comes up image search but the chicken doesn't come up doing it oh yeah and the images is one of them where it looks like a chicken it's a fucking chicken yeah well it's crazy though it's a chicken holding a whip a mallet yeah one of those things achieved on one side wow what a fucking freak animal yeah it's freaky Jesus
