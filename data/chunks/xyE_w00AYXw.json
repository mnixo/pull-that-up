hello the leopard theme you have leopard jackets today you have a leopard top is this just a coincidental or is there something to this well I'm a little bit way trash and I want everyone oh I don't know I I liked I liked married with children I'm a little bit uh and I'm trying to get comfortable are you comfortable I don't know fine I'm with the king anyway okay so leopard leopard I like mirror the children I don't know I always Alden Peg Bundy well I was gonna go for Kelly but thank you okay I like dumb and slutty and uh no I do have my friend who started pegging her boyfriend and my phone as Peg Bundy well what's her name she started hanging her boyfriend she got a new his I think he's gay honestly sure listen if you get pegged I'm not saying you're gay for sure but this guy this guy this guy I think is gay and what did she think they broke up she thinks he's gay oh Jesus Christ they broke up why did they break up he was emotion available cuz he's gay wow I think he's looking for something with a deck so what was her other signs with him that he might be I don't know I think that he just was not he may be he's just emotionally unavailable guy but he seemed to have a lot of issues around wanting to get dicks so it seems like maybe he needs to try maybe a less plastic one yeah we probably use already trying it don't you think baby I don't think you just why would you waste your time with a rubber dick strapped to a woman if you could just go get maybe Jesus some Christian stuff like you oh yeah I think the real dick yeah maybe it's like internalized homophobia probably or maybe he's just like transitionary like maybe two years - no he'll look back and go god I used to make girls fuck me in the ass I'm such a dickhead why did I do that I should just come out yeah or maybe he likes the feminine aspects of a woman and rock-hard cock part of a dude there's a lot of people that like that he needs to get there needs to be like oh I guess that's what he needs a hermaphrodite is yes well Whitney Cummings was telling me that those sex robots you know you saw her special new minute sex robot that there's they're really popular where they have a woman's body and a dick those ones are really popular all right hmm all right you get to live your you get to live your you're generating you just want everything yeah inside outside give it to me I had a guy call in to my podcast about his wife won't peg him enough and he's a cock but she won't yeah but she like she like tomato she like makes love to him while she pegs him and he wants to be just destroyed Jesus Christ and he he's a cock but he she won't fuck black eyes so he's just he's like I'm like I feel like for what you want you should be very grateful you have this woman that's pretty down but there's always more so I'm wondering if he just wants more or if this is all the same with but just that's how it is with people if you go back to the early days of porn it was basically just pizza delivery man and sorority girls and and sex and everybody had a bush but then you look at today everyone's gagging and slapping and choking and spit and not choking on pubes in his box there was none of that back then now it's like standard you know it's like everything keeps getting pushed boundaries keep getting pushed everyone's getting the fish hug poor Aziz it's fuck as these watch the board the wrong porn Aziz oh yeah what a disaster mmm have you seen a special I haven't watched it yeah I watched a clip and it shot so bad it's like you see him and then you see people behind him in the backstage area milling around and he's on a seat it's so dumb it's like there's there's doors opening it back and then people walking behind the doors it's like some odd artistic choice to try to be like it doesn't matter that I'm up here yeah like it's no big deal life still goes on even I'm up here which means you were thinking that life doesn't go on and you wanted to show people that life goes on - that's you were you were insecure about how narcissistic you are and then you tried to fight it well I was thinking it was the directors choice or is the director who has a director Spike Jonze yeah I think he tried to do something crafty which you know it's kind of interesting in any other format I mean it'd be interesting if it was a conversation it was just uh you know two people talking and they're in a public square and see people milling around behind him that's not distracting but what stand up the more things you have to think about other than what the person saying the more it's gonna take away from what the person saying yeah it does feel weird to just I mean you know I go on with the leopard print jacket sometimes but I like to dig myself a little hole but the leopard print jack is just cool it's just funny it's not distracting it's just he or she is I like you know I have my choice or don't know if you've been around for any of those sets but you know it's late at night you gotta wake them up you gotta wake him up I just just a plastic sword from the toy store I spend a lot of time with props I I have fake blood on me most times I don't know when there's gonna I'm gonna be inspired to take a funny picture to make a pratfall to make a fan fall did you see the pratfalls that we did me and Stephen Randolph one of the door guys at the comedy so what was those they posted on the comics we challenged each other to three pratfalls it's so embarrassing listen after Brody died I was like I'm going all out I'm experimenting I'm having as much fun as I can you know obviously it's about jokes but sometimes you got a really just you got to just have your time up there the Brody one was hard on everybody I was the one making sense that was one that just like felt like swallowing a dry rock yeah Wow like how's that guy gone it just feel he was just such a big presence and then it it's sad I don't want to talk too much about ayahuasca on here because I know that's what everyone does but I did in one in when I did trip on ayahuasca it was right after that and it helped me a lot with that because I kept thinking about how sad it was that he couldn't feel us like hugging him we loved him Brody was loved like we loved that man he was our brother you know and that was the sad part well I mean I just feel like there's no way any of could ever understand what's in anybody else's brain you know I don't know what's in yours you don't know what's in mine it's like they're we assume that there's a similar thing happening inside our head as other people's hands I think that's wildly incorrect I think some people are just in pain all the time and there's not much you can do as a friend to help them you know I mean I felt the same way about Bourdain when Bourdain died it was just I don't I don't get it I just don't understand how someone who so loved you know has this amazing job is a beautiful daughter and he has this life it's extraordinary and very interesting and and deep and he gets to mean these fascinating people and travel to travel the world and expose people to all these incredible artists and culinary artists and yet still didn't couldn't take it yeah yeah for whatever reason and I just think about it it's like so they're there okay you know they're off wherever we go or whatever happens they've transcended came back they're floating around somewhere but it's like selfishly I'm like I want more Brody like of course I want him back course yeah and it's you know and then you see people they just fade you know like each year goes by and they just which is gonna happen all of us so you know but you know luckily he had a lot of catchphrases poster in the back of the store I love I kiss it every time I really yeah I lick it I give it my herpes Wow I don't have herpes yet Joe Rogan are you do it's okay and honestly if you have it it's fine what am I gonna have a vaccination they must have one already from us sure what do you think conspiracy theorists cuz he already sparked up when we talked about the aliens thing with oh did he bring up Ohio no I left it all out but he's got his eyes there's just something there's a spark they have conspiracies yeah they have a little spark in their eye when they he perked up he killed his asshole a little bit when I brought it up yeah but but I it was really funny like those the last question I asked him was about UFO kind of almost has a joke yeah just just as a goodbye yeah I like to keep it silly that's all I'm reading it's in fucking hundreds of articles it's all Bernie Sanders says he will tell the world about aliens if he becomes president that's the thing that they took out of that well it's smart of him it feels like Trump straws it's like smart if Bernie had said it if Bernie had brought it up I would have been like that is a brilliant tactic but don't you think the people that believe in aliens are already going to vote for or that are the most hang up on it no no you don't think they're the same no no I think they very wildly conspiracy theorists or left-wing right-wing and the alien one is different than any other one and I think there's a lot more people that are that are alien lovers that cross both sides I think it's just one of those things where you like allele of those guys that fuck aliens are not this only

friend who is obviously mentally troubled right now Wow and I'm more shocked by Joe Dirt of the new movie yeah we're digging back 1001 we are digging back well fuck that seems like a long time ago but you know what doesn't seem like a long time ago 2009 you say 2009 that just happened nope 10 years a decade like 1962 1970 it seems like forever 70 to 80 seems like forever 80 to 90 seems like forever but 2009 to 2019 for whatever fucking reason seems real close yeah and it's not it's not it's not whole years you style will show you that too because I was I was born in 83 I'm 36 and the kit the the younger kids right now are dressing like I dressed in high school like it cycled back around there in my Styles yeah but that's none like not 2009 to 2019 is there a difference in style yes coming from someone at zero style yeah there is what is it it's okay from 2009 I would say 2009 was maybe when they had started having I've to remember where I was in life I just moved to New York people were wearing I don't know I had lived in Santa Fe and I was drinking a lot so I definitely not I quit drinking 2009 I still have never been how many them Santa Fe's was supposed to be a weird place that's why I met tape Fletcher hallo caveman coffee I met Tate in in Santa Fe he used to come in with a bunch of sober dudes after meeting I don't know if I'm supposed to say this but whatever he's pretty open but he I mean it was the truth they were so annoying I was like a drunk I was wasted at this cowboy bar to wear a cowboy outfit you have to you have to do that's your uniform really being a waitress is not humiliating enough you have to dress just have a John Deere hat on no you have to wear you had to wear a cowboy hat and you had to have a shirt that had yokes on it oh if you work there if you worked there not when you went in yeah that would be crazy but sotae would come in with a bunch of people and they just wouldn't order Alki mean it was just like low sales high maintenance I was like who's this fucking guy so big and ridiculous and then I was talking to him I hadn't quit drink I didn't drink until I moved out of Santa Fe but I told him I want to do comedy and he made them turn the karaoke night into a comedy show for me really yeah everyone up yeah Wow did you have put things prepared yeah yeah and then I would yeah and then and then I moved to New York to do comedy and I was I crashed my motor scooter a Yamaha Zuma and I crashed because I would drive drunk all the time I was my happy place like to this day I really was honestly that feeling of like driving wasted on a scooter was the wind Blanca Eric he's not wearing a helmet but then you don't really think you can kill anybody else so it's not that bad at drive drunk yeah but you can you can get in the way of someone else you can do anything I fucked myself up so bad I woke up just had blacked out completely my face was split open I had road rash all over my chest this was Father's Day 2008 you don't remember falling I don't didn't all I remembered I just remembered like little pieces I remembered that someone helped me I woke up I was living at my friend's house I woke up at the house he was staying at his girlfriend's house so I was there alone but my chin was split open I've been wearing a dress and it looked like I my throat had been slit like there was just blood all the way down it road rash all over my tits all over this side of my arms my knees like I just was fucked just faceplant just face split open I just I went I peeled out and like just went chin first and everything and then I remembered that someone who didn't a girl that didn't like me had helped me that's all I could remember it was someone who usually hated me helped me Wow and then so I went out I went to the hospitai called my roommate he came back I went to the hospital they get I got 9 stitches and then I was still wasted and I was still so hammered and the doctor kept going were you drinking and I kept going just between us he's like yeah no man nope I'm not gonna fucking jail you motherfucker look no he just crashed my scooter it's crazy he didn't know that I didn't wake up to drink through the pain so so then I got the stitches and I was friends with all the cops in Santa Fe because I was an alcoholic so that's a really good plan you gotta befriend them so they don't arrest you and they had told me if they had caught me because I ended up finding my scooter on the side of the road my friend drove me around so I found out where I had peeled out and there was like a bunch of loose gravel so I just peeled out on the gravel and the cop said that they would have arrested me for an Agora aggravated DUI because I hurt myself I'd injured myself that's what an aggravated DUI that's what they said back then I mean I was still wasted when they said that it's worse have you hurt yourself you would say yeah I had to go to the hospital and stuff you would think you got a little punishment in there yeah well so then I didn't learn the lesson I went out drinking that night with the stitches in my face and I had my line was I would carry neosporin around and ask as if they wanted to rub neosporin on my titties like I almost lost a nipple I mean it got so close yeah I looked crazy but I was a drunk so I was like whoo fun girl yet they still call me fun girl Annie behind my back and I thought they were I thought it was like a cool they're making fun so anyway so then I went out that night and I saw this guy with a puppy and I started playing with the puppy and I was like oh you're probably so cute he goes do not remember me and I'm like I've never met you before he goes last night and I helped you you crashed your scooter and I was like oh fuck he's like I ride a motorcycle so I didn't want to call the cops or anything because I know you would've gotten in trouble and I was like who helped me and he's like some girl so that my friend called me is like my boss told me so was my friend's boss from this hotel that I used to get wasted at he was the bartender so she hated me because I would just go get hammered out there nice establishment do you look back on those days with any fondness because you're sober now you're all clean yeah I mean I think I have a wealth of stories I was a juvenile delinquent I had so many childhood traumas and abuses and weird things that happened I was running for my life in Jersey City when I was 15 from like a fake modeling agent who was like a six foot eight drag queen named mahogany running for my life this is a long there's a lot of stories and not a story you can brush all right what happened you were fifteen so I was I had gone to me mahogany yeah so I gone to John Robert Powers modeling school one of those like fake remodeling schools and if you pay like 200 bucks and they make like a compilation headshot yeah you like go they give you classes and modeling like that's a thing it's like you either like are weirdly weird-looking alien hot and tall and skinny or not yeah or you're not I mean I maybe could have done commercials or something I was cute but I I also had very low self-esteem was just such a weird it was such a weird thing to be doing so and I had been a tomboy up into that point so we go I go to this modeling thing and then we went to paid more money to go to like a modeling convention and then they had actual modeling agencies and then they had just random people that I guess paid to be there so mahogany was one of them and my mom's like super liberal and so she likes anything that's like a little on the fringe that she could brag about it her book club or whatever if that sounds like I'm angry I'm not angry forgiving my mother but so they ended up they're like we want to take your daughter for two weeks and we'll send her out on auditions and stuff over spring break and we have this nice place in Jersey Steen yeah your mom let mahogany take you for others so many more stories Joe jesus fucking christ yeah no there was my mother did not have anything bad happen to her when she was growing up she was adopted by a very nice family and she went to a nice boarding school and stuff and nothing happened to her did she read the newspaper she didn't read the newspaper I don't think much so she it just she didn't she wasn't aware anyway so then okay so I was I went to this place in Jersey City in Jersey City I don't know how it is now but it was fucking crazy back then it's still fucked it was fucking crazy so we were in this one little condo and it was mahogany and then there was like some other people that were there none of us were really that I mean I probably was like the hottest but I was pretty rare I mean I don't know I think I was cute I don't think I was like a I don't think I was a model and I don't think that was my future maybe I could have done something but um the only person that I had really bonded with was this 23 year old guy Chris who was this black guy from I don't know where he was from but he was really cool he was really nice and he was a little creepy like he would say things like if I was your age but he never was trying to fuck me or anything but he kind of was protecting me and at some point mahogany got mad and there was it was fake like I just he would make me go by and weed on the corner and stuff and just a fake thing my parents paid like $1500 to send me to this thing and he would I think he sent me out for to be a I to go into New York by myself on the train at fifteen wearing this sluttiest clothes ever - this thing - and then he would tell me pretend your lie and say you're 21 to be an extra on like Sex in the City and stuff it just wasn't real there was nothing real about it was a total scam so I was starting to catch on to that I was supposed to be there for maybe ten days I think made these next-door neighbors shorty this little Puerto Rican lady I don't she was a go I smoke blunts with her but so this guy Chris was kind of protecting me and he would go into the city with me and then all of a sudden mahogany didn't like how close we were so he separated us and he said you can't see each other anymore and I was like well I don't feel safe if I can't talk this guy just would rather go home I want to call my parents I don't think this is real this seems like bullshit and a scam and he was like you can't talk to your parents and he locked the door and took the phone away from me so I packed all my shit up and I threw it out the window and I yelled down to shorty I was like yo I'm gonna run so grab my shit and then the guy one of the other kids that was staying at the modeling place knew the situation so he went down and bumped into the door unlocked it without him noticing and distracted him and I just jetted out of fucking house and he started chasing me I was like screaming I was like call the cops help me help me and I was wearing a tube top my like 15 year old titties Ida nipple rings were like hanging I mean I looked like a prostitute the cops ended up coming and they thought I was a prostitute mahogany got me at one point I was hiding under cars for my life like I thought I was gonna get killed I was like screaming people were just watering their plants like what the fuck are ya cuz he was chasing me I was trying to hide and he finally got me I was like getting a hat like you're ruining my scam pretty much and then he scratched my arm but that's all and then the cops came and arrested both of us thought he was my pimp thought I was a prostitute I come from like a like a when he came home well they came to the cops and then the cops told them that they should arrest my parents yeah they're like we should and I think they just were in denial about I should arrest him for a day at least yeah they didn't and then more stuff happened after that once they'd made more mistakes yeah but it's okay we all make mistakes I love my family good now but I also look at all these things no I really like have had to do a lot of work on it because to forgive them yeah because well I blame myself for all of it for most of it which was my defense mechanism like this stuff I had some stuff happen with a teacher in high school too right after that actually was about six months after that happened and you know therapy session I don't want to do a therapy session I don't want to do that but anyway you had asked me about am I happy about these things and so but the point that I'm coming to is I am happy with them I'm so happy with like where my life is now that I can't be mad about any of these other things do you know I mean like they're they're like exciting and now they're funny because I didn't get hurt that's what I'm saying like looking back on the water looking hilarious yeah there's something crazy shit is some bromance to it if you survive mm-hmm I flashed a chain gang once on my motor scooter and then it didn't start and I had to like put my shirt down and keep walking like it's hilarious I did crazy shit and I came out like genuinely I feel good you know I'm happy with my life so it's good thank you for getting that getting me off of that path but well it's just everyone that I know that's funny is fucked up and had some then go wrong that's how and it's like how you get through it and then your insight yeah it on the other end you persevere and then you don't blame people you don't like go around being mad at the world I think it's it's easier to be I know it's just some of the most hilarious people did blame people yeah that's Jennison yeah Kennison was always you know screaming about his ex-wives yeah you know let's try that's funny too I just for my own personal sanity cannot run around angry at everyone well you don't need to be I mean it's not necessary and especially now that you're sober which obviously Kinnison never got no he refriended them no no never no never met him Tom so I'm live a few times once once at work once when I was working I was working at a great woods Center for the Performing Arts I go in it's like a amphitheater in Mansfield what were you doing son found cakes no security oh yeah and I got to see Cosby there Rodney Dangerfield gotta see a few people or you did you want to do comedy yet um I was 19 I probably had thought about it a little bit you know maybe maybe had been in my head like slightly but I didn't really start thinking about it I was like 20 did you feel embarrassed when you had that thought at first of doing comedy yeah no but I did feel like it was preposterous yeah I did feel like look it's such a difficult way to make it like I remember my girlfriend when I was 21 her dad was mocking this idea that I was gonna be a comedian like I remember him smart guy well you know the odds were not in your favor no they're not in anybody's favor but I remember that's what are you saying you know that like who makes how many people make it as yeah and even if you do make it how much money do you make he was a doctor that's so funny is really angry like he just felt like I was a waste of his daughter yeah it's really funny he's still alive let's get him on the podcast I do doctors don't live that long my doctor died that was so it was sad when he died it was like I trusted you well there's a great book called dead doctors don't lie but this guy Joel Wallach and what a lot of it has to do with nutrition and it's about mineral deficiencies and vitamin deficiencies and doctors who abuse drugs and essentially talking about how people rely on doctors for advice about health yeah when a reality doctors are good at very specific things like if you're a podiatrist you're good at fixing feet if you're a you know an orthopedic surgeon you're good at knees and shoulders and shit but you probably don't know a fuckload about nutrition yeah and you really don't understand like the mechanisms of Amadas absorptions of nutrients and minerals and vitamins and one of the things that I've learned from doing this podcast is to understand that even like what I the cursory understanding of it that I have you have to go through fucking hours and hours and hours of reading and watching documentaries and listening to experts and I still have to go back over and over and over it again so I've talked to doctors before and they've been like super dismissive about even taking vitamins and I get angry at them yeah well I think all you need is a balanced diet well you're retarded like what are you talking about that's a and by that way I don't mean someone with Down syndrome nothing retarded way in slow - yeah you are you're you have a diminished capacity for advancement then you're slowing down the reality of the progress of nutritional science yes this is a stupid thing you're doing right now giving me bad advice you really don't know what the fuck you're talking about I get angry I'm like why would you say that like this is done don't tell me that there's no benefit to taking vitamins when there's a fucking ass load of studies yeah there's data and science and it's all proved all do you think it's just south of ours researching this stuff and trying to figure out what the fuck is good for you and what's not good for you and some chubby asshole with a fucking skinny fat body is telling me that all you need is a balanced diet like bitch what's your diet you ain't got a balance and do you think that they're just doing that because they don't lay out of there out of the vitamins no no they don't have this just don't feel like reading up on the new stuff but they haven't they haven't decided to pursue it that's all it yes I mean and if they did pursue it they'd realize it's a fucking bottomless pit of information yeah from essential fatty acids to different kinds of proteins and absorption of plant-based proteins versus animal-based proteins what's the benefit of grass fed beef over regular B it's a fucking endless stream yeah I mean if you follow someone like dr. Rhonda Patrick you realizes really quickly that she is in the heart of this shit 24 hours a day seven days a week and she's still learning things yeah you know it never ends it never ends I mean we and also it varies what's good for you is not necessarily good for me your diet might not be as effective as mine I only ate Alec is that bad and that's good that's good for everybody's alcohol they turn you into a fucking elk I got some fanny pack and some goddamn Oh what kind of a cooking setup do you have at your place I just have just a stove with frying pan like cast-iron frying pan I do I have cook you could cook I'm all right decent okay I'm decent i hook you up with some elk sausage we'll start with that I'll give you a recipe how to cook it correctly do you have a thermometer I'm really into it I'm really into Bigfoot porn can you not say Alec sausage in front of me I don't have a meat thermometer no well that's good for elk sausage it's fine you'll get a sense of when it's good I believe you want want one me why because I didn't get to joke sausage bro I'm sorry I'm insulting her no it's just Bigfoot dick elk sausage I don't know why I wouldn't draw those two I wouldn't pull those together why you wouldn't yeah why why would I not have one of them is Angela the other one is a legendary primate oh my god you're really getting stuck on semantics here listen you're the one who cracked the joke let me just make some fucking jokes I just got accused of doing a therapy session and now I'm telling jokes was I'm feeling triggered are you feeling judged no no but I'm not feeling judged but everybody that I know that has had those wild drunken days it has come out on the other side there's something like nostalgic about it like you look back and go huh I made it through that have you been doing a a meeting you can't it's like the good old times an AI or I always felt like people were either telling these stories that were so insane and I was like I'm not an alcoholic or they were like oh my god - pussy shit get out of here you're even cool enough to be here like Celebrity Rehab right did you ever watch that show huh one of the best parts about it was Eric Roberts you know Julia Roberts brother bunch of movies he was there for weed addiction yeah and everybody else is having the fucking DTS there on the floor in the fetal position shaken he's reading the paper treadmill is so ridiculous like some people you know their stories are a joke I did quit smoking weed and it did make things a lot easier like laundry just little things I was like oh that was maybe making things I would always smoke weed before I would clean my apartment that was like seven years to get my apartment Glenn yeah it can get distracting it doesn't it does not affect me well yeah well when I do things like if I want to clean my office I just have a thing like this is what we're doing now I don't know even listening to music is not good oh yeah I find out I used to listen to podcasts while I clean my office but then I find that I would be like pausing and listening to routing them part then I'd want to rewind it I'm like oh I'm fuckin with myself here I'm distracting right and then that's a weird defense mechanism too because I do that all the time too I'm always multitasking and I always have to be doing three things at once like you know I yeah cuz it's gonna make me I'm gonna slow down so much I might have to like mmm yeah so like writing to like sometimes I write listening to music but most the time it's better without music with lyrics yeah yeah sometimes lyrics and sometimes foreign music I like foreign music is I don't know what they're saying what kind Brazilian I like a lot of Brazilian music I like a lot of Spanish me some Bollywood or what I listen to some with that alright dollar men day do you know dollar ideas no you don't know Darwin now oh he's amazing it's really cool I just listened I listened to a lot of Elton John that's what I'm into right now that's why I like to wear all my crazy things yeah I like to Elton John that should please some dollar Mindy may have played on my phone didn't with your band high percent 100 percent why it's gotten before even if we all because you can yeah yeah howdy spells name da areas dollar mending what is this say the song is not currently available in your country or region oh my god I love it now I'm really into it and but I want that shit what is that here goes that's actually a woman getting fucked by big he's a guy yelling yes Wow okay welcome to the wonderful world of the internet anyway I like dollar Mindy it sounds cool but is his name dollar da h-hold on I would liked it better if it was like the dollars a le are m eh n di but I think he got arrested for human trafficking but can you still like his work that's a problem like I was at a Dave Chappelle and I did some shows the other day oh yeah DJ and the DJ was playing all this Michael Jackson music and he is so good yeah he's great oh he's a fucking pedophile allegedly most likely yeah pretty probably yeah definitely did something wrong yeah even though it's still fucking great yeah but also he's dead yeah so what if you don't listen to his music you're punishing what are you punishing okay the man's dead right but even if he wasn't dead like if Ted Bundy had some great poetry would you want to read it would you enjoy it um no I don't agree probably not yeah yeah I mean I don't know this I really don't know what Michael Jackson did I don't know and I don't think anybody does it to ya but there's a lot of fucking weirdness to it for sure yeah hands of little boys and I know it's really uncomfortable just like inappropriate boundaries and that's enough to like molest okay honestly just having that inappropriate the single word thing between kids and grownups it's not good yeah you hold hands with your nieces nephews and that makes sense your children that makes sense but if you're a 55 year old man and you're holding hands with 11 year old boy and Dubai yeah that's where I'm not again I gotta get suspicious yeah I got a question whether I'm gonna enjoy this song that I'm enjoying right now he's done it something yeah oh good I was listening to the music I was like god damn this guy was amazing yeah so except there's no way he wasn't molested I mean doesn't he seem so molested well um in the interest of being beaten a fucking dead horse I have talked about this many times in the podcast where I think that he was a castrato which is someone who was castrated when he was very young to preserve his high-pitched voice then his doctor the same doctor that killed him came out later this is long after I'd predicted this and said that he was chemically castrated to preserve his voice so he he confirmed what I was saying and what this doctor so intrusive castration are you not able to get a boner I don't believe so oh my god so he maybe wasn't molesting them but he was just he could have been just being weird with them I don't know who maybe didn't do anything with them maybe he just wanted to be a child maybe his childhood was stripped from him because he was famous from the time was five fucking years old and his father did something yeah it definitely was a weird life according to the doctor his father did did something to Mike chemical castration is what they do to pedophiles yeah they'll do it to pedophiles so that they can never get erections and it basically stops your body's production of testosterone and kills your testes and they do it with some some chemical injection and apparently according to the doctor that's what they did to Michael Jackson which you think about his voice it makes sense yes his voice was insane yeah it was so high-pitched and if you listen to like castrato z-- those there's there's only a few recordings of actual Cristiano's but it was a common practice not common was knowing everybody did it but it was a practice that was done to young boys to preserve their high-pitched voice with your fucking castrating what a word horrible cuz strata but they did it I mean people would let their children get their balls chopped off so they sing good and they would you know it'd be very valuable to how long how long ago was that well there's a recording so the recording I don't think they had recordings until like the late 1800s I don't believe but there was a lot of dance yesterday had a boy dance last 1920 to 1922 is the last castrato recording and how old was that dude so he's probably born in the 1800s or something he died in that same year so hmm it's but it's he died never nothing but always yeah beautiful singing voice of an angel and we can't play that either right no you should listen to it though well I'll play so upsetting yeah it is upsetting it's haunting yeah you can't yeah you can't enjoy that yeah I played it for a friend of mine the other night and he was like what's and I was like look you gotta listen to this and I played he's like he's a fucking real and he's like it sounds like someone did something to somebody maybe people should jerk off to it - like in honor of the men was 63 when he died in 1922 is born in 1958 and those recorded 18 v done in 1902 tonight - no force that makes him 40s yeah here's in his 40s he said weird nose you said 1958 you mean he was born in 1850 1850s he was born sorry yeah in 1922 Wow yeah that's the whole thing's dark the look you gave me during my circle-jerk idea was red well looked out urea you gave me a come on bitch circle-jerk for the I was saying it too if you couldn't come look are you projecting listen I know this is uncomfortable whew and you're nervous to be here but I'm your friend I love you and I want you to be happy no come on the King you know I love you I know I love you too thank you so much for having me I really do appreciate it I am trying to be chill it's just like a cool and weirded out by this but being here I'm not weirded out I'm trying to be in the moment I like to be funny impulsively like it's my impulse to always like tell jokes and stuff and this isn't more like chill less jokey to be jokey okay now there's pressure to be joking huh you're overthinking this shit - I'm not overthinking anything I'm being chilling normal everyone cups of coffee one's calling me a cunt what is uh one of them one of them is caveman what's the other one this is caveman and this is a cunt mug I got it for my dad and I got one for myself - got it for your dad yeah as a joke well my dad and I it also looks like it says aunt we one time we went to we were at the post office my dad's very funny he reminds me of caddy daddy actually the oh really by the way that fucking thing is hilarious that you guys are doing yeah we recorded one and then it just wasn't funny it wasn't we have to rethink it mm-hmm don't want to put out we don't wanna disappoint one you did dude the one you did put out was hilarious yeah that was fun yeah he's so fun he's hilarious but um so my dad and I were at the post office and mailing something out and I was taking a while and mail something out and just we're just jokingly antagonistic you know my dad's like come on I was like dad leave me alone I'm not done you know we're just joking with each other and this old woman who's been observing she goes to leave and then she just pivots before she leaves and turns around she goes she goes you know what young lady you're a real itch and itch and itch and my dad goes I think he mean an unde which is fuckin one of our best stories my dad he's funny so she doesn't realize you're just joking around she didn't get we're just joking she was like oh you're being so it's like did you tell everybody this is my dad we're just joking no my dad said she's an aunt we laughed so I think she got effed yeah well she was leaving when he said it yeah we just work with like crying and then the fact that someone needs to stop you and getting put you in your place yeah it's just so silly but it's like she was all mushy now yeah I'm sure I'm just gonna try really hard to not be one of those old people what do you think you're gonna be like an old age I think I'm gonna peek I'm excited well I'm I'm trying hard to I'm trying really hard to be in the moment and appreciate each new age and not get anything in my face or do anything like that and if you're sitting in your face well you know except cumshots obviously know I mean like you know oh you know I don't try not to do anything too crazy it's just it's fighting an inevitable thing and I think it's a gift to age you know it's we get to be different every day my mom was a she worked at a this organization called gray Panthers which chemically great pain yes for old people but like the fuck old people that like to fuck I mean I'm sure they like to fuck but Maggie Kuhn Maggie Kuhn was the woman's name which I know there's a little bit of a parallel between gray Panthers Black Panthers her last names oh yeah but it was spelled differently but so she was this it was in Philadelphia and she was she like died versus 19 maybe 89 but we still hang out with her all the time and she had dated famously dated like a 40 year old I think in her 80s or something oh so I think she was fucking was she peganum she might have been packing him I don't know if she could pack at that point she had a lot of hats a lot of keys down a peg guy oh he can peg himself yeah you remember uh Elizabeth Taylor it was like she married a series of gay guys before she died oh yeah yeah honey that happens really pretty old ladies they you know just want a man to tell them they're beautiful I've been just showered with compliments by gay men yeah I think they go through menopause too and they probably give up on the idea sex yeah they just want pretty men around them yeah I mean not that her gays were that pretty I've had prettier gays I've definitely been the lat I've been the last pose for a couple guys the last post before gay yeah I'm like and then one guy got married and should I was sure he was I sure I was sure it was his last listen just because he got married doesn't mean he's not good yeah that's a good point I know it but he guys would read a man would reach out to him they would try to touch him and he was wearing a suit we lived in Santa family wearing wear suit like slap is it their hands were like not until he comes out I know I mean I was like there's no way you should always want to have like threesomes with other guys I go I remember we invited my one friend and we were just drinking so much we called uh we called Jack Daniels OJ so we didn't feel weird and more like past the OJ were just like fucking shit-faced all the time shaggy Marie went to this college it went my college and I'm going out of business just there's a little school in Santa Fe just hammered and my friend who I worked at a restaurant with a guy friend he wanted to hook up with me so he's like sweet so he like hops into bed with us and then he leaves and the next day he's like he kept looking me in the eye and he kept looking at me he can try to make eye contact with me so he was boning you and your boyfriend Leia I don't know if he ended up boning me I think he would just he hopped in the hopped out pretty quick was that mean cuz he got freaked out because but actually I mean we were in black guys at that point I really feel like I'm five years younger than I am because I just blacked out five years you should write about those days I know I guess book there were so many I have so many crazy stories and it's funny because I always thought everyone else had them I really thought everyone else had this great I'm like you didn't steal cars and like you didn't do all these things that never happened to you have you thought about writing a book yeah but they'll be it's also a great like comedy writing act yeah I know all these stories on stage so more yeah flash and the chain gang was I mean there's just been so many I drew some pictures I draw - so I've been drawn in a while but I drew like a coloring book ones that I never followed through with but it was a lessons from a chubby alcoholic and it was just different like true scenes from my drinking days just fucking crazy the shit I did so how did you stop well tape that actually brings me back to Tate so I moved to New York I wanted to do stand-up so bad I just done that one thing at the cowgirl in Santa Fe and I liked it I really like I was nervous and I don't remember I'm sure it was like all abortion jokes I don't really remember but then I do remember my first set after that I remember all the beginning ones so the first one was when I got to New York I moved to New York to do stand-up I crashed my scooter so I wanted to move to LA I had met people out in LA and I thought that was where I wanted to go but because I kept drinking and driving I was like I have a drinking and driving problem I have to go somewhere where I can't drive so I moved to New York thank God because I think I really I think it helped me really push and get really strong before I came out here so I moved to New York I wanted to do stand-up I was just drinking I was partying I have so many friends I just went on benders like random shit I was just doing insane things day drinking just way more drunk than everyone else my left my drinking buddies in Santa Fe and everyone else was kind of like what are you up to so I was staying on my friend's couch and I wanted to do stand-up and so finally she was like look I'm let's just go do an open mic I'll go with you and I was like all right so I got all my jokes ready we go to an open mic I go up I drop my setlist and then I completely black out I'm so nervous and like in this basement at this place code cake shop my friend Kate Berlant was the host of it or was she the host yet I don't know anyway I got up on stage and completely bombed just started yelling at everyone I just started yelling at all of these comics like fuck you you piece of shit like I don't know what happened and then I sat down at the bar and I'd already quit Jager Jager was the first thing I quit so I was sitting at the bar and some guy came up this comic who I did not like or think was funny or want anything to do with and he kept buying me drinks he was buying me shots of Jager and I was like look man I'm like struggling with drinking I really like I can't really say no to a drink but please stop buying them for me he just kept buying I'm like I just was you know I wasn't gonna stop and so he kept buying them and then so then I ended up waking up on his air mattress is that for my first open mic waking up as air mattress fully clothed didn't fuck him or anything just like trapped somewhere in Bushwick it was snowing I was like where am i what am i doing I looked around his apartment and like all I want to do is be a comedian I was so sure that's what I wanted to do I was spending all this time drinking get a second set this was my second yeah this one I'd moved to New York was my first one in New York what it made you so sure that you wanted to be a comedian I just never wanted to do anything else and when I think but you'd only had one set at a karaoke bar mm-hmm and then the second set were you screamed until everybody fuck yeah what was it that made you think that you could do it um I just I don't know I just never wanted to do anything else I just didn't have another there was no other plan I had been a special ed teacher I had done a go-go dancer I'd worked at the bars I'd done all that stuff I just never I just always I just felt like if I could do it I could do it mmm I mean I guess it's that little bit of that delusion and that but I just I never but I knew that I wouldn't be able to do I knew there were obstacles in my way and I knew that drinking was one of them I had talked to a comic before that said at the open mic and he had said just try not to his advice to me was try not to hook up with the with the guys at open mics because you're gonna get a reputation when you're just trying to be respected so he had said that to me good advice I that was great advice because it's also there's no time for that this was my whole hustle also what are the odds that person's gonna follow through if you follow through and become a comic what are the odds that they are yeah I might get hitched up to some fucking loser yeah you definitely want to get hitched up but it also was I needed to put all my energy I was in and I'm barely in a place now to be in a relationship so it's like this was 11 years ago so I I I when I woke up on that guy's air mattress I was like fuck like I already broke the thing that I wanted to do and I was already you know from all my like weird sexual assault II stuff when I was younger I just didn't have a good relationship with sex drinking didn't help with it you know everything was just out of control and all and I had this thing now this like precious thing that I want so bad so you know crashing my scooter almost dying all that shit that wasn't enough but stand-up really was that's what I wanted so I went to my friend's house and I called tape I just called to I was like I want I got a I just want to do this and I want to quit drinking so he told me to go to meetings and just try it out do you remember your first meeting yeah I went to one I think it was a Lower East Side and the guy sharing was talking about he's like I always knew I had a problem because I I when I was two I took all the tylenol and I was like what are you talking about any kid with a childproof thing is just gonna eat the pills I remember kind of judging him and being like whatever but it was good to have that community then because I needed to detach myself from like the partiers and all that lifestyle so I did go to I did 19 I did a meeting every day for 90 days and then I I never went back some people actually learn how to do stand-up from those meetings there was a guy got a bomb there was a guy named Dave Fitzgerald it was a really funny comedian back at Boston and he learned how to do stand-up from making hilarious stories out of his drunk days he he was a fucking raging alcohol yeah the same thing just quit and then started doing stand-up and literally learned how to do it yeah meeting cuz he would tell these crazy stories about being act out fucked up and being in gunfights mm-hmm you know high speed races and all this nuts if you had alcohol - Oh crazy stuff goes down yeah but yeah many of them learn how to do stand-up yeah you're standing up in front of an audience I was brought up Quaker - so our church was you stand up and speak and everyone just sits there in silence yeah what's that like which one's Quaker that's the oak box Oh box everyone's like gets it confused with Amish which doesn't nothing to do with Amish the difference it's just a very chill Christianity so it's those the pilgrim hats the fists Quakers no I don't think they were the they were when did Quakers and start I don't know Sophists they're they're pacifists they believe that God's in the form of an inner light that's and everyone and everything so why would you fight it I mean I agree with that just from hallucinogens and shit too but it's something I struggle with like I have to look back at you know childhood predators and I'm like can I have to forgive these people because they are from the same light I guess what is the what's the wacky thinkers Quakers are well it's just very it's just you sit in silence so the churches there's two types there's programmed and unbroken that was unprogrammed which is the super chillin there's no Bible talk there's no preacher there's nothing you just sit and benches facing each other my meeting house had these old creeps explain what are you talking about so it's like a it's a meeting house that you meet up with on Sundays yeah you look down at your hands you don't really look at each other but you sit there's facing benches and then there's you know benches here so you are kind of all looking at it you're facing each other and what do you do you sit in silence and then if you feel moved to speak it supposed to be God speaking through you but if you just feel moved to speak at all you just stand up and you say whatever you want Wow and so you know reading scripture I mean some people every once in a while someone would do that growing up but I went to a Quaker school - and we were little kids we stuff to sit in signs for like 45 minutes which was impossible it's such about 80 - it was insane I would wear shirts that had like things on it I could play with like I had a shirt with a phone and I had like a cord and I would just wear it and I would set alarms and set on my alarm so it wouldn't go off I just had to be doing stuff it was crazy you're just so little and you're just they're so bored I'm so bored you know and what's the first thing they do they try to medicate them because yeah they're so bored well I got Medicaid Ritalin and stuff Oh No but when I was older I don't feel like it affected me they put me on antidepressants a little bit but I was pretty good at being like I don't want to do these things you don't feel like it affected you to be my Celyn but I didn't take it for that long how long did you take it for I don't know I don't like looking for the home alley makovski duh she was talking about I love her love her too she's just about how like that same shit happened to her when she was kids yeah bouncing off the walls and the Medicaid yeah yeah it's so it is interesting because it is I can only imagine what it's like to be a parent you just there's all this information coming at you and you're dealing with your own shit and a lot of people didn't go through their healing process or anything - so it must be so hard to be a parent it's just got to be crazy I think about it I never wanted to have a kid until I did some hallucinogens and then I was like maybe I want to have a kid you'd be a great mom yeah I think I would but I'm just dealing with all my heel I'm dealing with all my I just want to make sure I'm not in a place I I was very angry in the past and it's something that I work on a lot I just wouldn't want to redo patterns and stuff like that but I do think because I've had I had such a traumatic stuff I think I would be I think I could protect my kids so good when the Quakers are allowed to medicate their kids that's part of the doctrine yeah you can so there's no dot I mean it's pretty loose it's like you can do whatever you want there was one guy that wore his like Jewish stuff to a meeting I went to meeting after the election I went a little bit I was like maybe I want to go back to church what the Quaker Church yeah I just fell in 16 yeah cuz I just was it just triggered a lot of things in me and and I went real crazy for a second I just had a lot of trauma that I wasn't doing one drop one it wasn't this is embarrassing okay I was hanging out with a lot of anyway what happened I just got really like I got really mad I don't know I got really mad I just wasn't I wasn't um dealing with stuff and it just kind of pushed all this stuff forward for me and how so what do you mean buddy just like some sexual assault stuff just came up like I think a lot of people that were angry and were marching around and stuff we had some personal triggers that had happened for them so because of like the grab them by the pussy yeah and then you read it and then I read up on it and it's not what seems and I don't know I just I you know there was a lot of hysteria and it just triggered just triggered a lot of my shit but I'm glad it did because it helped me get through a lot of stuff and I definitely I think have a different view on those things now and I you know I was running around so mad at who I'm like Who am I mad at I did a lot of like when it first happened I was like fuck man I did that for about three months thank God I got out of that but really angry and just projecting and piss and all this stuff and it's like there's a few there's a few men I'm at it right there's a few I'm certainly not mad at men but there are a few from your past yeah you know and that was something I had to deal with and I had to learn to compartmentalize that and not make it this broad thing I hate when people setting the drinking days the drinking days and for my childhood you know I had I had some fucked up should happen but you know it it's you can't it's just important for me to not blame a large group of people that have nothing to do with my trauma and it's also when I get triggered what I needed to learn was that's my responsibility to handle my trigger and I can't just be running around like this like unsheathes sword I mean I can but I'm gonna cut everyone around me yeah the thing that people do when they blame everyone that's part of that group you know it's so common it's oh you remember there was a real problem a few months back where Liam Neeson was talking about one of his friends that had gotten something that happened were black I had done something murdered one of his friend raped when I was friends something awful thing right and so he would go out at night with a bat looking for a black guy to start trouble and he talked about and everybody was furious at him yeah and he was saying like look I didn't do anything and I was in a terrible state of mind just being honest about this I'm not proud it was one of the most embarrassing and darkest moment my life but I did it right and not letting people express those things and and talk about it and say oh wait cuz I am embarrassed that I got so man Haiti I mean it's a bite you know there's a couple podcast I did where I was like fuck Matt you know and I that hurts people I hurt people by saying that I mean so whatever no but people have lashed out at me for stuff like that but it's like I don't fuckin I don't have the capacity to hate an entire group of people and I certainly like I have brothers I have my dad I don't don't you think so sometimes you say things and that's not really what you mean yes pressing anger mm-hmm of course and then I think right now what's going on and I've checked out of a lot of stuff I don't pay attention to a lot of things anymore because it was just like what the news you mean yeah it's just like not it's not real I don't read Twitter at all I just don't do it it's like I got to focus on what I can do and how I can feel good and how I can I just want to make people laugh have a good time make people feel good I want to feel good it's like I can't do that if I'm in this constant state of taking and all this information that's just pushing my buttons pushing my buttons well yeah some of its not gonna be but someone certainly is and if you're not controlling the like you have a mental diet too and that's something that people don't think of all the time you know I remember who described it that way but it's the best way of describing it you have a physical diet and if you have a poor physical diet your body says yeah if you have a poor mental diet your mind is sick yeah you're taking a nonsense all timeout and fights you know I had Bernie Sanders on yesterday and who that guy is running for something no kind of looks like my dad yeah and I've briefly looked into the comments of one of the posts and so many fucking people are so goddamn toxic yeah they're just battling it out left and right and misrepresenting his position miss Rep someone's calling me and all right white supremacist white nationalist like what in the fuck that's so I sent them a t-shirt so this has someone said that I had somewhat witnesses Stormfront or something like that what is that white supremacist Paige storm front of something they said I had the founder of storm front on my part the fuck are you talking about you just Muriel proudly no I'm so proud of this guy yeah I'd Gavin McGinnis Gavin who is the founder of the problem I had him on before but I had him on before there was a brown boys I didn't even know what the fuck yeah but also why can't you talk to her and I asked him about it and I was critical I was criticizing and I was like you can't just claim you're gonna have violence with people it's it's so fucking dumb and then all the proud boys shit that happened with violence came far after that but people are like blaming me for having him on I don't even know what the fuck it is he's the co-founder of ice that's also just it's also interesting don't you want to hear the other side like don't I want to hear everyone's opinions and everyone's thoughts don't you want to try to understand and come to a common ground don't you want to realize like I'm not religious really or anything but it's like we are all God's children like there's missing this whole thing it's this fight each other yes but no okay the problem is there's a lot of these people that do go on shows and try to reinvent themselves disingenuous way and they try to whitewash what they're doing whitewash their past and to that point I mean the idea is that you're helping them recruit people okay before he was on my podcast though there was no work there was no people for him to recruit to that people need to understand like he wasn't there was nothing like I had him on because he was this guy was funny and he used to do a lot of interesting video he fucked up when he started that group and he fucked up when he was calling for violence and telling people to choke a bitch and punch people and grab these people and he was doing it in response to the violence that antiva was was pushing on right-wing people that would have these meetings and show up yeah doing like it's all clown mirror back at them it's all crazy Riya was all poorly thought out but the idea that that makes you a white nationalist cuz you talk because you talk to them yeah it's so fucking stupid but it's like this is the world we live in and everything so authorised it's like your left or right your black or white your one or zero it's like there's no gray area what they also freeze you in the one moment that you said the thing and then there's no before or after there's no growth there's nothing it's like yeah fucking out yeah they just look for this quote trap and just that's it I said that you said that like not like I clarified like yeah took it back I revisited it like there's a lot of things that people do when you talk or you just you know you say things like you say things like you don't even know what fuck you're gonna say when you're saying it yes and then you go up doesn't make sense when you read re-clarify and when you're talking a long-form conversation and like this and a podcast and someone wants to take a snip it out of it and they just decide that that's who you are it's nuts it doesn't make any sense and it's this is the world we're living in today everybody wants to paint everyone is toxic yeah everyone that you want to paint so many people I should say want to paint people as being a problem or a negative thing and it's like this is the Twitter world where 20% of the people make 80% yes yeah so many of them are fucking losers and it's also it's such a you're giving all of your power out to outward you're not paying attention to yourself you're blaming others you're trying to change the world around you you're trying to create a safe space through other people yeah yeah like jail unhappy you're gonna be in your life if you're expecting other people to come cower to all of your demands and 12 your stuff they're not trying to be happy part of it with what they're trying to do is somehow or another score points and rack up was you know and and distract themselves from their own life by focusing on these external issues that they think are critical and super important and some of them are obviously running for president whoever is gonna be presidents very important issue and most of the time like 95 percent of time I avoid comments but for whatever reason I just found myself flipping through it because I wanted to see what the people think about Bernie yeah you can't look you can't love it seems worse though it seems like every time I check if I don't check Twitter for four months and then I check it it's like whoa is that if things accelerated this much or people are so angry at so many different things and just they they paint people in such character caricature way like a OC is a woman who I don't think they're I don't think I've ever seen anybody work so people worked so hard to mischaracterize her or paint her in a horrible light and I'm like look she says things that I don't agree with yeah why is everyone so fucking angry like what is this well people were put all their thing on things on you know and they're they have these beliefs and like definitely when I was in my whole like you know when I was extra angry and feeling you know you you have this whole system around you mm-hmm and you you know you can't hear the other side and you have to like yes everyone has to be a villain in that or they they're either with you or against you and I don't know it's just Timmy is just unhealthy I had to tap out I stopped paying attention to a lot of stuff and I don't know if that makes me ignorant I just got to live a happy life no I don't think it does make you angry I don't think it's a an effective way to communicate I think it's a really piss-poor way to communicate and I think it it fosters rage more than I mean yeah there's something about being able to talk to people where you don't have social cues you don't have empathy you're not looking at them and people say the mean is nasty shit either and it's insulting people and dunking on people is more important than actual community well it's attention too so it's you know they're maybe trying to impress their other buddies that are on there they're trying to get those extra little likes right they're like the the main point would be they want to get your attention holy shit that got Joe Rogan's attention that's so cool you know they just want to feel alive or whatever and that's you know people have their own process I try to not take anything personally it's like you don't know me if you don't like me like that's weird you don't know me you shouldn't really have that much of opinion it's like not finding your validation you can't find the good stuff or the bad stuff in the comments you can't but if you look at the comments for good things it's just as bad as looking at for bad things yeah I mean some people think it's a good idea to gauge like whether or not the conversation was effective whether or not you could have done something better than navigated more efficiently or more more entertaining for the make it more entertaining for the people to listen looking for the constructive criticism yeah they're mean there can be some of that from some people the problem is you're trying to manage all this data at scale right you're dealing with thousands and thousands of humans that are chiming in and a lot of them are deeply unhappy yeah a lot of people that are commenting on things that are just really frustrated with their lives like imagine if someone saw or listened to you when you're like fuck man yeah and they're like oh that's who she exactly then you see they see you on here laughing and being silly yeah wait who's this bitch yeah like that doesn't make any sense that's not the same person yeah well you're not the same person you're not the same person who you were six months ago I know groan oh I believe yeah I hope so I mean I do I try to do a lot of work on myself I stopped look watching you this was huge for me I was watching a lot of true crime I was watching like Dateline stuff like all these things and I mean that is fucking toxic people are obsessed with it they're obsessed with it and I just started to realize I know a friend of mine had there was one about her sister and once I saw that and I just realized like this is not good this is finding entertainment out of these really real things that have happened to people in this pain and I have had fucked-up things happen I've had friends have fucked up things happen I've seen these things I don't need to bring awareness to this I know that and a lot of women get into those true crime shows it's like dramatic and everything but it's not it's it's real these are real things that happen to people is it because you want to know that that's out there so you can prepare yourself for so you can be aware like what is what is the appeal because apparently see find out this is true but I remember reading this that true crime shows sort of skew in their demographics more female than male like the more females are into true crime shows than male yeah I don't know I just I think it's like a beginning middle and end to a story like there's a whole plot line and then they catch the person and the way the editing is and you know the interviews and well for a lot a lot of the episodes they will sometimes they catch them before they kill them and that's disappointing but it's just very young women are the biggest true crime buffs and here's why if you're even remotely interested in true crime story oh and true crime boy mm-hmm have the last couple years been good to you first there was the mega hit podcast serial which launched October 2014 several months later the HP HP released the jinx six episode documentary blah blah blah blah blah blah captivating as captivating as programs were for the general public one group in particular has become particularly enthusiastic about the genre young women hmm it's weird and a lot of the victims are young women it's like what I don't know what it is hmm I don't know what sort of likely that according to dr. Howard Forman a forensic psychiatrist had Montefiore Medical Center the trend is rooted in empathy by the time you get to adulthood women are able to empathize with a greater degree than men on average Foreman tells tech inside this may lead to true crime being more interesting to women than men simply because if you empathize more with the victim it may be more relevant to you and more gripping and then if you empathize with the murderer you're in some trouble yeah it's just a job it just was too I don't know it just got so dark and weird and yeah I had a guy in my when I was living with my ex-boyfriend in this hood in this apartment building there was this really weird kid who was so overly familiar and just really weird with me and I felt I really felt threatened by him I felt really uncomfortable with him I told the landlord you know my boyfriend was traveling a lot for work and stuff so I was alone a lot I had a cold that he was like maybe 18 he's young he just was weird he was off Asperger's he very weird like very just the way he looked at me was weird he overly complimented me in an inappropriate way I would set up boundaries he would keep coming he tried to I was bringing my laundry up to my apartment and my boyfriend was out of town and he the kid lived on a different floor than me and he goes oh let me take your laundry coat no no and he goes I'll only take oh no I don't need your help very clear and then he the door opens to the elevator he tries to take my laundry I go no and then I get off the elevator and I start walking and he starts following me and I go you don't live on this floor and he goes oh sometimes I get off here and walk up I go no you don't you're not supposed to be on this floor and then I pretended to go into someone else's apartment because I couldn't let him know where I lived and then he left so that's when I called Tate again and he set me up with Scott I've seen a tenth planet and that's when I would start doing jujitsu because I'm like nobody's fucking with me anymore there's no I cannot control my surroundings I cannot control that all I can do is control my live in the same Jesus Christ yeah that's the thing that we might have to deal with and I I have experienced it to a far lesser degree with creepy dudes who want to follow me in hotels oh yeah I've seen people people are so weird with you yeah it's weird they want to follow you in hotels though yeah like guys follow me into the elevator and want to come to my room like hey yeah they want to watch you jerk them no people come up to you and they're so excited this is their moment there they're shivering they're shaking I watch it all the time it's night I told you I want to do a reaction where they just should have our faces your friends faces when people are approaching it we're just all like oh my god I mean they do it on a smaller scale with other people too but I mean you really have it they're always unfolding a paper they've always got something they need to share with you and this is their big chance to tell you whatever the thing is that they need to tell you I mean it is really their moment so you're a part of people's biggest moment of their life all day long the biggest one is one they have a business pitch uh-huh the most frustrating Cena I'm like listen we are not going into business together yeah how do you know if you don't hear it because I don't have time to do what I'm doing already like and I'm afraid I'm already selling fanny packs I can't do more super busy the fanny pack business higher primate

they're young no no no thank you mold rather no no no no no no no they are cowards they don't want to wear it as a fanny pack so they wear it over their shoulder because they're cowards yeah and if a hot girl comes it doesn't like fanny packs they can throw their elbow into it and pretend they're injured no I got a laugh saw swing they're doing it because they don't want to they want the functionality of a fanny pack but they don't want the social stigma they're cowards well it's a new yeah it's like the Jaden Smith was like Jaden's I don't know it's like he would wear that it's the younger this is the younger generation they're they've taken our fanny packs and they've made them into something out there's any non-binary maybe what is it saying at the bottom of that you'll be picture is that coward any pack and see-through iridescent zip okay I don't have a see-through bag by the way nobody wants to see her tampons hide your purse maybe I don't know you never know what these young boys these days they're very woke woke there's so light I was bite there's all these women that want to get choked by Bigfoot so I was reading this thing about Yale and that Yale put tampons in men's room because they said not everyone who men straights is a woman and I'm like yes they are I thought maybe they worked for diarrhea no yes everyone who men straights is a woman scientifically we're getting a woman right now lucky yeah it is it is a weird thing that's happening oh I'll call anyone whatever they want it's just a weird yeah I will too I have no problem I want I would I would love to make you happy as long as it doesn't it's so wacky well Chappelle said that thing on his special rece ed to what degree do I have to partake in your self esteem right that's a good way of looking at it yeah yeah I mean it's but it's not just that it's it's an enforcement there's like an authoritarian enforcement of certain language in certain ways of communicating with people yeah you know there is a goddam hilarious thing that Tim Poole posted up of a communist meeting where this woman is calling everyone comrades and this guy is like could everyone please stop moving because could you guys please stop moving because I have severe a DD and all this moving is really distracting me and woman goes all right Thank You comrade duly noted and then the guy goes please can you stop using gendered language when you say that in my very it's very offensive and like it is woke gone this is what I was saying before about how it's like if you're expecting the world to accommodate to you like your safe space is inside yourself you fool it's inside you you don't have control of the outside world this is people trying to control the language of everyone around them yes and then saying it's unsafe if they don't follow your new vocabulary that's an unfair thing did you find it and he said this can't be real it's like two days ago he put it me a sam harris reminded me of it as we were fucking howling laughing about it it's it's just times it's like a parody it's like the onion is not ridiculous enough and like these people are more ridiculous than the most ridiculous parody like you can't even mock it but do you think that it is them trying to see what they can get away with yes there look how far can I go there play make-believe there there I'm a chicken you know I'm so as someone said this to me I came here it was but that all of the the words the key words that people are using now like triggered safe space their autistic terms their terms that people use with autistic let's chose yes play this if we want to defeat capitalism we are going to need a party that will or just working people to fight for the demands that we want and to win socialism thank you so much guys first of all James Jackson Sacramento he him I to a minimum I'm one of the people who's very very prone to sensory overload a lot of whispering and chatter going on it's making it very difficult for me to focus I know it's we're all fresh and ready to go but can we please just keep the chatter to a minimum it's affecting my ability to focus thank you point of personal privilege yes please do not use gendered language took to address everyone okay monster where is he right in the lower right hand corner with the the halter top would've that's the one that jumped up that's the he him she he's wearing that he's wearing that red so when he gets his period do not use gendered language this is this is where we're at we're at where in nonsense land and people are acting like this is normal you're a bunch of babies what do you give a fuck if someone says yeah who cares what was said about girls say girls I could be there say girls I don't care this is your you're crazy please do not use gendered like what how does that change anything and by the way where you can if you can't deal with a bunch of people moving around and distract making noises and shit just stop yeah get the fuck out of it yes force everybody else to deal with your fucking weak mind go home there's swamps watch this on youtube eat a steak do some squash mistake eat some elk get your fucking life and or fuck baby alright go fucker Gawain Bigfoot will write a Bigfoot fuck book and make millions what is this seminar about about being an asshole comedy just it's just so it's like playing on this thing - were it's like I want people to feel good I was a special ed teacher I've done all these things special ed kids wouldn't have been talking like this asking for all these things and well this is what they with these kids are calling socialism right like this is what I mean everyone has to be like super super sensitive and aware of every single fucking thing they do and every single fucking thing that everybody around them does just to comply and it leaves you a victim - because it's impossible for that to happen so no one's ever gonna comply to everything you say there's always gonna be one person even if they don't even if they want to maybe they were listening to something else and they didn't know that that's what they were supposed to do or whatever so then there's always gonna be you're always gonna be a victim of something someone's always said the wrong thing they've always done the wrong thing and all of your worth is from something outside of yourself and you now don't have to deal with your own but also just it ramps up what used to be acceptable a year ago now is unacceptable a year from now it'll be something else after a while you won't even be able to say colored you're gonna have to say the c-word right you have to say you can't say people of color which is a PSA is that people color that's what that is a weird one well yeah like the n-c-double-a or n-double-a-cp brother National Association for the Advancement of Colored People which is bananas like yeah you can't say that you can't even say that anymore it's like so dumb it's such a weird thing and also people I feel like if people stopped having attachment towards you could stop having them mean anything like they wouldn't hurt you well the we talked about that in the 60s it was one of his bits in the 60s dude he would call people by a bunch of ethnic slurs and then say you know the problem with not saying these words is that if you say these words enough time they lose all their meaning and it's not gonna hurt some feelings I'm paraphrasing but this is the opposite and you know it did to him nothing they turned him into a woman and Miss Mazal oh I watched a little bit I think it's good I haven't judged mrs. Mazal as him yeah she's the mother I auditioned for that and then when I saw her tits in the front like my tits auditioned for her Ted so it's like amazing I want to show you this no but in the first scene she showed her tits I was like all right thank you thank you for getting me that audition I don't understand what you're saying she showed her tits in the first scene and I didn't realize that that was gonna be in the scene they didn't make me go topless or whatever but I was honored to have been in the same audition pool is okay as Rachel Brosnahan her and her big juice she looks great she's good she's a great actress she is hilarious but I was talking to a male comic was really funny and he was like I don't like that fucking show because there was no woman like that but yeah yeah there was no Superman either man like with the doctor was no Walking Dead Rick didn't killing he's off yeah guess what it's all fake oh yeah it really freaked you out there was a woman comic like they're not saying about comedy right it's a funny show about comedy you should be excited that there's a show about stand-up comedy in 1950s and 60s it's fucking great yeah like so what do you care if they made up a woman like why well they're not getting represented the white men it's not even that it's like it's like a historical thing with yeah it would've bought was bothering him historic it is that they are they are intersecting with real things that happen so I can see where that's a little annoying I want to bring up Elton John again but I did see Rocket Man and it is it was weird when they were not if there are things that happened and you're why do you say bring up Elton John again cuz I keep bringing water yeah you just didn't even bring him up earlier I've just been talking about him the whole time did you listen Ellen John a lot do you yeah I watched this one live video of him a lot I don't think you said no where it did did you yeah I forgot okay that's okay I can only be expected to be listened to 20% of the time what was wrong with Rocket Man well it's just he didn't write this lyrics which they said but then the whole movie was like trying to force these life events into the lyrics so it was like but he didn't write it so he didn't write it so it just wasn't it didn't feel real I would have rather have heard more shit about when he married that woman and stuff I married a woman yeah he married a woman whoa yeah how frustrated was she she must have been or really horny just sliding around in there we didn't know she's very rich but I think I think probably maybe it was just a beard situation she knows sure but also it's gotta be a lot of those guys want to believe that they can be straight you know that's why they buy the Whitney Cummings dick doll but that's where I like that I'll pray the gay away stuff is oh yeah you ever heard of those pray the gay yes yes guys are sitting around holding men with boners they'll even really get hard-ons holding you and telling you you're not gay yeah yeah it's fucking crazy it's like it's so wild to not be like just lean into what you are your happiness your joy yeah but think about yourself you were raised a Quaker what if you raised some wild you've been told and you know anybody who does that as Satan for sure and you're gonna go burn in hell and you live with all this guilt and feeling like that shame that you're rotten or whatever I mean I definitely have my own shame and I know probably everyone carries them with them I can't imagine on that scale what sucks that is probably one of the biggest ones if you're raised Christian though if you're raised like serious Christian especially fundamental it's one of the worst sins laid with another man and just dealing with it the dick that they must get at those camps oh my I mean they must just be pounding each other out they probably come so quick because they can't believe their eyes they're just like and then they have that camaraderie in the fact that they both are trying to not be this thing oh my god I'm getting horny just talking about honestly private new genre it's not Bigfoot we have to we have to work through this I mean I'm not getting you're not gay you know we just fucked I know just crying in each other's gay arms what a sneaky trick if you believe in God that God did God said listen you cannot have sex with men but you're gonna want your nothing down on it they're gonna want that all day you're gonna see the juicy assholes all day want it more than food you want more than water you just want dick and foot dick and bought Dudek but ah fireman and follow yours construction workers and Indians and cowboys and then a bands gonna come out and they're all gonna play each part you're gonna have to try a lot and then you can't even go to the YMCA anymore yeah it's what I mean if you really believe in Jesus and you really believe that you shouldn't be gay but you are gay what a dirty trick God it must be terrible I just feel like there's nothing more dangerous than were oppressed that's gotta be where cancer not just homosexuality but repressing any sort of feelings like that sure it's gotta be what cancer is well repressed sexualities always strange like when I was in high school there was always these girls from Catholic school and girls from Catholic school that went to all-girls Catholic schools worth the biggest hot cookie and all doesn't yeah they couldn't wait to get some dec because it was so forbidden there's a forbidden fruit they just would get so excited they couldn't believe it was real just fighting off these hormones it's just such a terrible trick to play on a young person yeah to tell them that their body is dirty and awful and that these thoughts that are just prevalent omnipresent in their mind are the wicked ways of the devil and that which you resist persists you know you're just thinking about that fucking butthole all day fucking sucking a dick fat juicy hog you just can't have it yeah I mean it's terrible it's really bad you guys also if you're out there listen let's just say let's God let God give you a Hall Pass go fuck an asshole yeah go fucking asshole go just move to Boys Town and realize like you're gonna be fine there's a group of them they get together and they have a great old time there's a parade and they're so happy if you go down that stream so happy free they don't even their shoulders are exposed like there's just tank tops everywhere just hair shaved anything you want just every tonight you know I love going I feel invisible it's amazing love like I could just walk bottomless and they were just I've talked to gay guys though they get mad at straight guys or and straight girls are going to gay clubs now to hang out that it's like a weird thing cultural appropriation host talk to Martindale well I could see like where you'd be like hey this was like our place to fuck and now you're here like you're wearing glitter yeah wearing rainbows member Demetri Martin had that joke about where he's like gays just get I can't compare for him but gays just get rainbows that's not fair you just get fractured light like greedy greedy gay Haysom and this is what back in the day when you could say stuff like that yeah I did about that was pretty similar about that they it was because of duck dynasty one of the guys from duck dynasty was given I don't get it I understand working and my bit was like listen you should shut the fuck up or the game people will take over camo the same way they took the rainbow oh that's so funny they own the rainbow the rainbow used to be leprechauns used to be Lucky Charms guy yeah now it's gay people to the point where if I came onstage with a fucking rainbow t-shirt on people be like I know it we've been waitin for this fuckin knew it but um the idea was that if like what all the gay cup guys would have to do is start every gay porn in a duck blind oh my god every gay porn would start with that's so funny they're wearing camo and they're duck hunting and then someone would come a black eye would come and go some about duck on make me whole that like duck whistle thing oh my god my friend worked on my friend Mike who I stayed with worked on duck dynasty so he knows all those guys that seem like a trip are they but fucking all the time I don't think so but you know it is funny when you take just a family and then you make them stars mm-hmm and they you know they cross between reality and yeah all that stuff and then they go crazy and then they all of a sudden they're on their own and they get interviewed thinks there's something really crazy or not yeah some TMZ guy puts a camera in their face yeah are they still doing that show I don't think so how could they stop it seems like it was just printing money yeah I wonder I mean maybe they are I know my friend doesn't work for them anymore but yeah doing duck dynasty yeah I don't I get him the credit for duck dynasty whether he wants or not I don't know how that show episode March 29th 2017 so how does that show end ever it feels like a smart producer should step in ago hey guys it's been a couple of years I don't know someone a lot of wacky stories falls asleep with a cigarette in their mouth is gone yeah all that camo gun it's just it's weird I mean if you watch that show it's like there's nothing compelling about it at all but it was an enormous hit yeah just a bunch of people doing duck stuff there is something about reality TV that where you're just like it's so thoughtless you just don't have yours being taken on this dum dum ride it's just it's nothing happening it's like all right yeah may next thing you know you're watching people dissect a storage container yeah but you know what I'd really like is survivor that one I still like survivor I still like survivor I think is the number-one reality show because it's making people it's taking away all of their comforts and they still have to communicate with each other like games with each other they have to they're starving they have to do these physical it's still you're watching people be like tested and put what season is that all oh my god it's there's so many seasons like season 1 million I've seen all of them it's so good I don't I don't pay attention to them fully so I can rewatch them at some point I watch them a couple times that show was on before Fear Factor mm-hmm so I we started Fear Factor in 2001 so that show was probably on in 2000 yeah and 19 years later it's in the 30s now 30 seasons or something 33rd yeah I'm embarrassed I don't know because that's how much is still a hit yeah it's and listen people either are onto Survivor or they're not or they've actually done 38 episodes or season somehow it says but this is the 30th yeah they do several year now is it still Jeff Probst Rob's he's still the host it's still under the radar like Jeff Probst just like catch those checks and stays and yeah but here's the deal I've seen him driving around he had his little summer fedora he was riding in his Prius like drugs a Prius this was like three years ago I was driving around stockpiling all the cheese yeah maybe he's rich dad poor dad no I mean he must have all his money just stocked away he's driving around in a Prius he's the he's I love the show if he's open they could take this away from him at any moment okay somebody placed him would you notice a part of the show I think people would be upset there'd be upset helpers took a spot I think people would be very upset I think they'd be extra upset but if Adam Carolla took your spot um they would get cancelled people be like Trump now is he a trump supporter I think so Adam I think so but I don't know sir listen I don't know for sure I don't want to call anyone anything I think he's conservative I think he has a trump supporter though some people get conservative when they start making money though I listen I everyone has the right to be whatever the fuck they are what do you think I think that what about Nazis they have a more of a right 1/3 right I don't think that's right right what does this Third Reich I don't know I don't even literally don't I mean I don't know what the Third Reich is but I don't even know what it means tell you guess I literally have no idea what that means I know it means the Nazis right I don't know there's Reich but what does it mean in German but isn't that a funny thing like that's like the Third Reich is like everyone knows yeah but no one knows what the fuck that means the etymology yeah do you with the big words I know a few what does it mean third regime or Empire or third realm huh so the third version of the Nazi party's was the Holy Roman Empire which lasted until 1806 the second would be 1871 to 1918 and this was the third interesting so they were just they were considering themselves to be the third rulers of the world like the Romans interesting yeah what a mess and the other thing is that that was not that long ago it was not that long not that long ago at all here see the video of Hitler tweaking at the 1936 Olympics working tweak like serious speed we were with Brian Moses Brian Moses was saying that Hitler was into bowl semen and I was like what he's like yeah and then we found out that taurine which is in Red Bull actually is bull semen oh my god that's so fun that's why I like Red Bull do this that's Hitler tweaking oh my God look at him go straight up tweaking at the Olympics so he was on all kinds of crazy speed and then we read this thing about how he was like incredibly fatigued and almost dying and he got injected with testosterone and cocaine I wasn't gonna make that well and then went and talked mussolini out of leaving the war cuz Mussolini wanted to get the fuck out of World War two and Hitler went and just talked at him for five hours as well all coked up and oxycodone doubt and bull come dripping down his throat oh my god yeah how did he get how did he extract the bull come I don't know but bull semen apparently has de story and stuff and it and they extract taurine from some other method to make the Tauri that's actually that's what the guys at the gay to pray the gay away camp to that's their job in the tap mm-hmm they're extracting holes dick you deserve all that well do you remember I always think about that horse oh yeah and zoo the documentaries amazing that video of the I'm so try and the part that I'm traumatized by is not the fucking part okay and do you remember the scene okay so he gets up on the bucket right and then you know they need like several people to grab this giant horse cock and put in his ass and then the horse rams him only once and then he goes that this is the part that got me he goes he looks back he goes did he come like he was so concerned if the horse came I was like oh my god yeah and the guy made a noise like noise where you're dying he was he died so soon after noon as his friend goes too much too much like did you get too much you got too much of course like and he did die hey des if you look at the math the size of a horse dick I have a body cavity it's like where is it going yeah what's getting out of the way make room for that dick oh boy they dropped him off at the hospital they rolled him out he was bleeding he bled out he'd bled out from his asshole and that's it I'm happy I don't think he did you don't think he was like maybe that's if the horse had come do you think he would have been worth it he would've thought it was worth it the horse did come but do you know that this whole thing they had the hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage of him getting fucked by donkeys and horses and a bunch of other people that these people had met online and the zoophilia right is the the mm-hmm medical terminology for someone who sexually attracted to farm animals and so or animals period and so these people all met online in some chatroom and then decided to get together in Washington state where it was still legal to fuck animals there's like only a few states where it's okay it's so funny that you had there has to be a law yeah there has to be a log keep you are you just so happy that's not what you're in do I'm just like I just wake up so grateful and blessed I go thank God right could you imagine if that was your Oh God thank you you can't control that right if you get something like some people are in the feet some people are into getting fucked oh I was segwang in defeat huh yes people are in defeat yeah have you heard I have heard they're in defeat I can't believe it well I was reading up on it that it's the part of the brain that that handles your genitals and your feet are right next they're adjacent so sometimes the white they think that the wires get crossed because and the guy that studied it was a guy who'd studied phantom limb syndrome and he was so he was following with these people's brains where they would feel that they still had a foot or whatever and some guys would get horny it would get their brain so it was just like crossed huh we had a horny thinking of their own not foot oh it's hilarious how you pixelate your feet in all those pictures it's funny how that get started they just people were they started a wiki fee account for me I just didn't know if my feet were thing I just didn't know I thought I'm just walking around in you know in slides didn't know I was walking around he may as well just have been bottomless I may as well have just been wearing like pajama bottoms with the ass flap backwards open just put I mean my little feet pussies just walking around so then once people I noticed the wiki feed thing and then people were damning me all the time to see my feet and I just was like you don't get this mm-hmm Whitney Cher's DMS with us sometime a group chatham in with Nick Swardson crystal Ian Whitney and she'll post pictures of her DMS it's like what in the fuck yeah they're wild I do a thing on my pockets and on my livestream is sometimes where Ice Age my pussy at the end of the night sage if I get sage and I just yeah I just to break the the negative dick cords that were sent to me the unwanted dick cords from all these dudes I'm like yo put your dick cords away but you know people are pervs what are you gonna do I just make fun of them but it's more guys that are pervs than girls are the pervs with stuff like feet yeah thing that girls are into that's kind of gross the money it's so gross but that makes sense like money can keep you don't like your job some people are no like a guy with money fat guys some people aren't I don't know it's people are not all different things but but not in the same way not the same you're right it's not the same as some guys are into fat girls too but there's a big difference between that and feet men are just very gross you're gross but it's biologically your dicks or just you're just ruled by your dicks are just dragging you through the world right and it's just got to be acknowledged we can't pretend this isn't a thing true just dragging you it's just that's not we're like breast feeding and shit we're thinking about other shit in archery there's a term called front of center meaning how much weight is in the front of the arrow it did different determines like how much penetration the arrow will have on an animal I'm getting so horny this is so weird what are you talking about it's like the same thing with dicks it's like dicks are like your front of Center it's like yeah no they're just I I like I feel you guys should be like holding ourselves back to the doorways because your dicks are pulling you through things and it makes life a lot easier when you just realize that but I think it's like I just have only grown up a girl so I just didn't you know I knew obviously because I've had a lot of sexual attention even very young but it's it's just like your dicks our thing there well there's a reason why there's seven billion people and it's not because it's not necessarily because women are that horny right I think it's just dude you're trying so hard to fuck and now hotties compelled I mean this is a evolutionary thing and it used to be really hard to stay alive yeah I thought that long ago yeah now it's really easy and we're kind of left with the burden of this shift yeah we haven't our brains and our biology hasn't really caught up to the fact that we don't need to have as many people as we used to we used to you know used to have a 50% mortality rate amongst yeah it was very difficult to survive and I think that's also was just in China too you're seeing more shifting with you know like like those those guys in that video these beta guys the one got calling out for people to stop being distracting and the other one calling out for people to stop using gendered language but who are they well they wouldn't survive if there was a you know the the Roman army was invading they would have never made I wonder who's fucking them nobody nobody maybe they're just men that aren't driven by that you know no that's not true that's just as good as they can get they just jeans circle they're getting attention and stuff yes it's a mess they're a mess this is so weird how much more survival how much of our like cavemen should is still there and how much of the survival stuff like I've been doing listening to a lot of therapy podcasts or just one called the adult chair this woman Michelle Chalfont and she's just it's all about dealing like with your inner child and then all and all of your instincts she was like the adolescent chair in the adult chair and your adolescent chair is all of your ego and your emotions in your fight fight or flight like all of that the stuff that you do the procrastination whatever is your problem like why is that happening there's something that's coming from either your child chair or something from your childhood or things like socially when you have social anxiety and panic attacks and stuff so much of it could be just back from in the days if you were excommunicated from your tribe like you would die yes if we were a part of the club you would fucking die and that that that's the reason why people are afraid of public speaking is that when you were speaking in front of a group you were trying to save your life you were trying to plead your case mm-hmm for the most part unless you were the leader of the tribe most of the people were just trying to say please I didn't know and don't kill me is that how you feel walking around me no but the comedies are people new merciful King no you know how I feel walking around I feel like they don't if it's like they don't have anybody house it is the way to put it when you are listening to someone all the time that person's in your ear the person becomes like a weird part of your life and then you meet them you're like wow this is crazy that you're right here I've experienced that when I when I first met Anthony Bourdain I was worried about yeah I believe you're right here this is so weird I see on and I've gotten used to that over time but still it's strange when I meet famous people yeah you know when I meet and it's even weirder when I mean famous people and they know me and what yeah yeah become famous people together like I think I've seen that before at fucking when two famous people just see and then you're just arty you're already in this weird Club of famous people mm-hmm it's strange automatically a famous people club well it's it's not a normal state and it's not I mean people that are that enjoy the podcast it becomes part of their life and maybe it benefits them and maybe they start getting motivated and cleaning up their life and start being healthier and exercising and eating better and then then it becomes just like almost like a religion yeah but because it becomes the thing that you think of you know in terms of like how to benefit your life how to live in a positive way you think about the things you learned on the podcast almost like you would look at a religious doctrine yeah you look at the the teachings of Christ you know you look at the teachings of Moses or you look at like oh what Rhonda Patrick said right yes oh well you know what Graham Hunt Hancock was talking your voice is like in their head you're like a on hired coach the laminate of that it's and it's also represents my own quest to try to figure out my own life and to do it publicly and explain what I've learned and how I failed yeah what I've gotten better at it helps other people when you hear that because you all cam alone like I'm because people think that if like your life is in order right now that it's always been like that so I think it really helps people to hear like oh I used to be a fucking loser yeah and I did and I can be scared to talk to bank tellers it's true yeah has to be weirded out socially I was very strange now can they hear your voice over the cha-ching cha-ching cha-ching cha-ching cuz you're rich that's so rich you're my richest friend probably I'm guessing probably I can't imagine who's richer well someday you'll be rich too I can't wait well laughs you have laughed at me before will you get those same kind of glasses but surround them with diamonds yeah I get jewels ooh I could see those people or do you think it's gonna take to surround them with diamonds yeah just ordered them you don't even think about it because you're too busy doing other things I'm so busy yes so busy culture appropriating with those hoop earrings cuz I don't think that's have you heard my joke about that no about how I got accused of cultural appropriation for wearing these ooh it's hilarious because uh but it's used you my my best friend she's black but I did I did slide them off her neck she's Africa that's the crazy shit when they stretch that neck out I know I'm like this is when you can get mad at the Jenners for cultural group is when they've have the lip plate yeah I mean when they come at the stretched out thing three women yeah it's just a cultural preparations are weird I don't know I think we should all be dressing alike I think it's cool that we also be I think people should be driving you shouldn't be like disrespecting people's culture and stuff but I don't know what it just seems like of what we're calling culture appropriation today's people looking for a reason and complaining yeah cultural appropriation is one of the reasons why cities are so interesting because we share each other's food share each other's clothes and listen to each other's music and you know we're each other's jewelry it's nonsense and what's interesting is like how many people from America are upset about things but then when people from China or Japan find out that we're wearing Chinese like like Japanese geisha we also do bukkake they're so pissed no they like it I feel like there's been times where I've just done stuff online you know I'll have a bit or whatever and then someone else starts doing it and you don't you get mad at that well that's different not is it not a joke I mean just like a thing I'm doing well that's different because then you feel like someone's copying you you know average is making all the time but then some of people some people get mad like oh I'm doing a podcast now he's doing a podcast so you copy me like hey fuckface you know own podcast that's ridicu I have a pocket it's like the Joe Hren experience that's fine I've literally had that conversation with people where they were like ma'am but now he's doing a podcast I'm like what are you talking about there's six hundred thousand father just doesn't have to do with you just focus I am your era bitch like handle your own life it's it's so I have lived as a victim for many years it's there is a benefit to it because you're always fed it you know if you are looking at the world like your victim you will be given everything you need please no stop using gender actually you're gonna be so everyone gonna be disappointing you everyone's gonna be upsetting you or you can just accept some fucking responsibility and it feels so good you know it feels good does feel good yeah I mean it feels good to be calm and to just be at peace and you know there's a lot of work involved in that you got to fucking gotta meditate you got to iron out your own stuff you gotta exercise it's a work in progress yes we all are fucking try and men I'm fucking trying um I have to wrap this up if anybody wants to see you you are at the Comedy Store on a regular basis you got any other day I'm at the comedy start a regular
