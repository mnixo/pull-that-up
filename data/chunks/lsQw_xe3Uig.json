Mark Coleman and Kevin Randleman we were in boxes hotel room this is after pride event we don't know which one and pride back then left to party love to experiment you know and I'm a good humble innocent Canadian boy who hadn't really gotten out much Joe and how when we say experiment we talk about like mechanics Grazia and M Simone yeah Bart says are more have you ever taken a percocet and

why not so he gives me you gave me three percocets - not one three so I take these things okay fine is whatever Coleman and Randleman walk in and all of a sudden you know I'm still I'm not feeling that you know me I'm very impatient like well what the hell it's not working it's not working razzle mid asked buzz it goes and what do you give them in Bosco's I gave them three percocets well you did what and then all of a sudden almost onto it it hits me and I end up instant anyway was there with us as well visiting and I end up for some reason going into my old pro wrestling manager heal mode and going right up to ensign and go hey I think I can take you bro I think extending I'm doing this I've been joking and I'm really just kind of needling I mean he he's you know trying to be nice he knows ok this is the English announcer cool whatever but I I'm pushing it because I'm not impacted by Perkis that's right but you are you thinking that you doing a performance I know but that's that's the thing I I felt like I was I was high I was I was like out of your head I was out of my mind man I'm one really thought and I don't want to dream you know the you I wanted to be up acting in you I don't think I could be a mother I'm up Joe but I challenged him to fight he finally had enough well my face call me broke my glasses and I got a bloody nose and I'm like well now I got to wear the badge of honor and I took a picture with him and an ensign and I'm like yeah I don't think I'll be doing percocets anymore I'll stick to that the only time a narrow Challenger a trained killer yes thank you yes and never again thanks to your lucky anthems a good guy he is a little guy yeah we were really far away hit the crowd here is over if we're not gonna remember when our mother granny Couture yes and he he was one of the first guys I ever saw through a really hard kicks to the legs from his guard and I remember watching that going oh look at this because he would prop himself up on his back arm and whip that leg into it and he hit Randy with some hard kick old model was that but when I run away my Frank Shamrock dancing anyway a lesson it was really just the rampage when his brother a what tensions brothers negan negan always fighting oh yeah there was a long as I don't have because of what Frank did in speaking to brawls how about Coleman and Mauricio Shogun who uh when who went to post broke his arm and shoot across and hammer out Bilborough Wanderlei Silva stamping on Phil Baroni said prime was wild bro yeah it was amazing for everyone on down you guys had like real Street oh yeah back oh yeah well then higher grade you just walking into the place hi and grace she decides out of the blue I have no cool wife pull the fire alarm wow this is before the whole show honest I gamma and buddy gur does extinguisher felt like a color extinguish colleague come a screaming yeah everything falls out of the free clothes because he hired retardant and fire again employee right he released it he remains to this guy and got the show went on anyway so I don't know he's just walking at suddenly he separates himself from the group and he hits them in you don't want like that night but yeah that was that was the night that the first time when he said well the first is very sheet away first time five members of the Gracie family never competed on the carnival Daniel by merits right so you had yet hens oh and Carlos Tuesday at hens oh hi n ho Drago Daniel and who was the other one I meant no disrespect but the Daniel thing is a weird way yeah is that your last name worth it your wife yeah yeah what in the fuck is going on here sir I went to a boxing gym once I know if I just could use the boxing the ring you know to Train uh-huh and the guy comes to me and he says if you want I can teach you some groundwork she's you know I'm a Gracie I see your glacier yeah what you're married to a Gracie very graceful very nothing how strange up not yet right any but but that night hi and took the mic after and went off I mean using every expletive I'm known to man just snapped because of the digital voice Gracie controversy and oh hi n was the craziest of all we have got some times of him Oh real good times what I like you say i tortured soul but at the watch anyway always a good one of the few not few a lot of guys but he always went out of his way to make me I mean you're a legend but to make the you know the male announcer feel good you always came up Mauro good to see you and will once you general John Henson you come we got the extraction team everybody we have a complication we had build the bow just Ellis Rendell Manila he did is the very first New Year's Eve we spent in Japan for shockwave it was you Kevin Randleman high in Gracie Quentin Quentin arrested you because he knew you didn't react in what in civil man Matt gray you got the end of the night show the one that made the most sense was this guy yeah you're the one that kept the peace because Kevin was was losing his mind and even high in great he kept saying more oh don't worry we'll be okay and I'm like why he goes just trust me we're OK and I swear to God I thought he might have had a gun well there's anybody be saying like what they're going on we were you wouldn't be okay about okay so we bought some weed from some about sit there and and and I didn't look because you know it's it's felony there so right I just get it and we walk off and while we walk off we realized that I figured out that Oh is not enough so I go back and I say guys that's not enough indicating me more and he goes no it's not gonna happen and he has this attitude I say okay I won't let me do a difference I'm going to be back in ten minutes we're going to be back in ten minutes and then it better be here so we walk around we thought you know maybe we should light up at least as we relax and we're in this weird what is it though there's meal boxes like it's it's a yeah and then funky with complex and suddenly when one starts jumping up and you start getting angry and he hits a mailbox and I'm Ryan start and I'll try to keep this boat since guys down and I go don't know you catch me less you actual shot my friend I say so right now right go talk to me like this with hey come on man are you really doing this right now and we get this whole fight goes on I said no no we got to like stay relaxed you smoke a little weed we're going to go back finally everybody comes down we go back and these guys probably call somebody but oh no first of all these was ripping guys I don't know a little bit guys and I walk over I fail which so we needed right now and they said ah we need to wait because they're bringing it right now so right away already we're looking back and sure enough there's two big guys coming also same clothes as they have and you can see them very sturdy walking up to us and as soon as they see you they make a 180 and they start back in the fold goes from the guy and I go those are the guys calling you right now telling you you got to give it up and he goes he opens the phone and the guy he says okay and he puts it down and he gave us a whole mouth yeah the prize fighting badass it was right out of a movie man it was alerts but there's a whole altercation when everything everybody start jumping that's what Quinton left yes we're gonna save it to let it die arias they have a great times great times yeah crazy times what's a good times yep how much of a presence was the whole Yakuza thing while you guys were there like how how aware of you guys of it were you guys know I was like wearing but nobody would notice you know he mentioned drugs they don't do anything like that but real estate no clouds you saw people sitting down that okay you well look like they were missing fingers we are the guy who on remember a lot man crazy that was where my shadows we boxer with yeah Mike your workers they're all fighting and we were this a strip club and this guy sits there and with long hair and he comes over to me and say how are you doing like a little feminine really weird you got me a biggest fan oh you'd be fair so although we got this crazy guy here right I had no clue what to think and he said so all your plane fight he want to know what I do and he takes his shirt off and he's all tatted up but people start literally leaving the place there I think I realized he's Yakuza right so we started talking I was talking about it and then the tattoo that I wanted in this color I said but in America is hard to find it that time people only wanted to use black ink and he says now that's not hard at all why don't you come tomorrow morning and I can do this for you so the next day he and I we go to this dungeon like five stories underground right it was the weirdest place we opened the door there's a cage with a back that massage so much I know you were trained on bravery wage indicators to governments around against the thing it's like there's human skulls everywhere the speeches of Bush killing people yeah this guy yo yo man he starts screaming and all the people who are getting tattoo it at that moment they all get up and they run out to this place they lock the door and I look at my arm like yeah you know because this is a really weird situation but no well no you able to do it when he was he did a great work you know but it was he started look we made it beat you alright y'all see many of you I'm have like a nice cold with a bullet hole in there I look actually recording audio will as well because nothing there's a cage where Masato used a chair that's why I said the kickboxer would take one yeah right yeah he would train in a cage in the basement well five stories
