four three two one alive this is a bummer of a fight weak but also an awesome fight week I'm very excited you see the the latest countdown what is it all access what do they call it no embedded combated yeah was try call with the name of its really so they're all the same but yeah all access embedded 24/7 that is very good I should I shouldn't remember the name it's very good they're all the other on this this new one is really good because it's got max Holloway running on a treadmill to treadmills over from nurmagomedov who's also running on a treadmill and they're fucking very cool to each other they're very interesting khabib thank them for taking the eyes when she should she should thanks for taking the fight and then they have the same weight coach like yeah that's crazy Lockhart right it's like my heart is going Lockhart working with no momentum yes well both of them so Lockhart was like Lockhart is legit like he goes over calculations of like how much you weigh how much water you're gonna take and he's weighing things out took him an hour and a half to do the calculations yeah it wasn't like hey we're gonna win this it's like no no no no no no we're gonna do this way cut correctly and he's got it down to the day you know like it's six days to lose I think he was 171 is that is that that I was wondering what did he start at does it 171 yeah so I think he's gotta lose 16 pounds what's crazy is when Max was on my shows talk to them a little bit off air and this is on record I'm not spilling anything that he didn't say but he just goes you know I with the injury Jesus credit embedded I think it's better than that UFC not UFC the HBO ones I think it's been 24/7 yeah how dare you I think it's better than only four seven when there's a big fight yeah I do I think these generals are BA I think well I think in general they're better cuz they do more of it yeah but a 24/7 they're very good they're fucking very good leave Shriver oh I love the bro watch her word something that guy I like these better a leak at least driver yeah he's like tonight here we go but it was no one was the thing you I'd buy this because there's almost no narration right yeah it's almost just it tells us so I want to see the footage I would have liked the video of when they called max with the fight she's from what I heard he goes it could be that stuff's got in the world fuck yeah let's go which is insane why don't they have a video of that but no one knew I don't think they knew you know to turn the video on i don't think max knew why they were calling amazing video of him being especially if he wins this my thing with max is I think khabib is the toughest fight in the world on six days notice I'd rather fight anybody else in the world than could be one six days because this style injustice tenacity but with him for max when loser draw whatever happened Saturday night if you don't respect and like him even more after this you're a moron you're a fucking champions on a broad like max Holloway's on that would be willing to take this fight on six days notice and also I should say coming off of a broken foot correct so he had a pull out of a fight with a broken foot with Frankie Edgar what's just happened so I mean how healed is he and like I said I'm not sure he was saying you know I've been doing some jujitsu but in the swing of things I for me it's good because I haven't been balls deep in the training I've had just been a little jittery you know gonna light workout but it gives me time with my family because which he goes you know this in camp you're present but you're not which is true and he goes you know so I'm going through it I'm with my son and the family but I'm thinking about something else you so this has been good for me to really focus on my family that was why two weeks ago three weeks ago Wow so then BAM he franca beam the reason why he wants to fight could be because he thinks could be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world yeah and which is nuts because you know when you look at Kebede resume it's good it's it's it doesn't blow your hair back it he's 25 and Oh for god sakes it's good but it's not like all this crazy you know big names on his record but you talked I was just in San Jose John Fitch goes dude and this is John Fitch yeah you know could be you know welterweight go he's fuckin did not go p-- he's got damn good he goes I've never seen anyone my lifetime like could be he goes I fought GSP in his prime he would beat him that's how good he is DC said he's the path friend great Valerie's ever seen DC said that he hand fights with him like DC's was the heavyweight Strikeforce champion he said he goes dude we go to war we go to war war like imagine that DC's a guerrilla he's jacked I mean DC's got some body fat on him he's strong as a fucking ox she's so got Intel so good it's like watch watch when DC throws Josh Barnett through the air when they fought Strikeforce to just go Jesus offensive he wagged auld Hendo and couldn't be a cool guy like the nicest guy ever DC might be the nicest fighter of all time well my favorite people here were max they're up there I love them for nicest fighters I don't know max as well as I would know DC because I've done so many shows with him but for DC as good as he is to say that him and khabib go to war I'm like that's crazy you Josh Thompson is the captain HK said you know ed Ruth Penn State and three-time national champion freak just start doing MMA in Bellator complete freak wrestling he I was in San Jose and he yeah I did a show with him and I go what were you doing this I just came from practice could be second class practice ago what was he doing he goes just straight wrestling I said who was arresting you said Ruth oh my god the Penn State like legend he was yeah man how's that go down he's like the only one of them's going down and ain't khabib like what a truth and he goes oh he was bro it I've never seen anything like it so there's just this legend of why they skip when they tell you that it scares me ot what well we're gonna do see it in action when you saw the barboza fight he's walking towards him like a zombie gets ahold of them and just ragdolls them just ragdolls but this is what's great about this fight and that's what makes our sports so special is yeah I'm super bummed I've been in deep depression because Ferguson fell out and we've talked about this out there but our sports so special because what max Holloway has the chance to do Saturday night if he can beat him if he can somehow pull that out there's nothing like in professional sports there's nothing like it if LeBron goes out the team still goes on it's whatever if Tom Brady gets hurt it sucked but they still play here you know man max has a huge chance now are the odds stacked against him good god are they ever there gonna be a worst matchup for him but it what's the one Achilles heel if there is one for a khabib a guy who can strike going backwards max Holloway is pretty fucking good at going backwards yeah it's it's a fascinating fight if there was no controversy if it wasn't like six day time period for him but that's what's great yeah I know it's kind of cool the only other fight that's been like that was Natan when they took on Conor in the first here's the difference though Nate's the bigger guy right Nate the bigger guy the more seasons guy there so for Nate it's like yeah it was short notice but that's a rough matchup for Connor right you know Connor should be an underdog in that fight they wouldn't fight at the same weight class so that makes a little more sense but wait a minute they do Nate Nate fights in 55 before that though he's fighting at 70 right oh no no no you only fought three times at seven but he's fought at seventy point he fought at Conor's number fought at seventy right but if can't when Conor fought him at seventy that was 70 Conor's never fought you cannot send me powder right but I mean Nate when he fought 70 didn't go well I mean who did he fight he fought Rory MacDonald at 70 tough city fight well see 570 lost his fights at 70 I think wasn't great at know he didn't lose all of them was a great one yeah wasn't great at 70 helped but the thing is he's the bigger man he's a great guy but if they agreed to fight at 155 he would make the 155 weight 100% yeah it's like there's all this talk about him being so much bigger than Conor oh he's bigger for sure taller he's taller he's a bigger he's a bigger round heavier when he gets heavier but when they fight at 55 he makes that weight and Conor makes that weight tough too they both struggled to make 155 mm it's a much easier cup for counter at 55 it's not the hardest cut but when you look at the difference between how he looks physically when he fought Nate at 170 and how he looks when he's you know 145 he was awful I was gonna say annika week 145 Nate couldn't have I mean there's there's no chummy could have made it because that fighter was a total leg off you know if like real this he's not making four he was very thin during the Ultimate Fighter days remember we have to be a fighter right so he's make weight base three times in a row why just think he filled in two I mean he was really young back then under percent but you have to maintain a lower weight yeah that's the closest fight to it though I agree that fight no I agree with you one of the same kind of balls that Nate has it's like what but but max the difference is that like max has taken on a guy that everybody's avoiding no one's been able to solve the riddle of khabib no one's even ever even put him in jeopardy like he's like a Johnson hit him but that really wasn't you know what was going a bit we were talking about that the other day who knows what was going on in that fight because that was a fight where he had the same issue cutting weight that he did when he had to pull out of the Ferguson fight where his body shut down correct so who knows he had that same issue at the Michael J he may have been severely compromised in that fight even though he beat the fuck out agree the difference between McGregor and Diaz is the the both keep it on the feet really right yeah is a phenomenal boxer comes phenomenal striker max Holloway phenomenal striker could be phenomenal grappler so it's it's even more of a task because Kobe's not gonna sit there strike with him what that's your one way to win cool I'm the best grapple on earth yeah he'll entertain it for a little bit but your if you if you want you down there's literally no one in the world from I'll say 155 to 170 he's not gonna take them I want to see I really want to see him in some straight grappling competition do you're hearing this yeah hearing that about how amazing is in the training room I'll tell you it from a guy like DC I know and and and Fitch and I mean talking about and all like pioneers of the sport animals I want to see him against Woodley at 70 I think seventies his natural weight class yeah I think he'd probably be a lot healthier imagine that imagine what stronger than healthcare it would link Abebe to you what but what is a different thing man you mess you fuck up and you you leave yourself in a position to get hit with one of those nuclear bombs I'll knock you out Woodley could put people to sleep and he can grab was a strapless ass off hard to take down and puts people to sleep with one shot I don't think Woodley gets his due and I think the best evidence is the two fights that people point to where they say that like Woodley should have done better those are the Thompson fights the end the Maya fight the Maya fight but Maya never got hurt like he he hit my a bunch of times but it was uneventful because he was hurt Woodley was hurt early in the first round with the shoulder he fucked his shoulder up but I was like oh he should fight my if you don't want to go to the ground 100% but my point is in those two fights with Thompson Woodley was the one who hurt Thompson he hurt him yeah bad and both fights almost stopped him in both fights yeah I don't see them ever fight again but I hear you a great play yeah hard pass me there was a crazy UFC 200 card and that was on it I wouldn't be mad I mean I get it twice I cool yeah that's a super complicated equation to solve Bob set I'm set though they're just like you're Dave same thing if they just said no this time is gonna be different I'm going to war yeah and then two rounds and you're like thank you that's like Dana on Ferguson and kabhi B's like that fights never happen to a fifth time not happening I'm like I get it I get it man it's such a bummer though let's talk business like I don't know how many pay-per-views this was gonna do but for the hardcore fans this was a big one this was a big one because this is the first kind of khabib it's fighting a guy that's super versatile that can fight standing up can knock you out with one shot tough is fuck has incredible endurance and can grab off his back and the most dangerous guy could be will ever face yeah Tony Ferguson has the perfect style to test was so we could really find out where could be exact because we know where Tony's at we and we kind of know where could beeps at do we we kind of do we said the barboza fight in my opinion was the best example of it dos Anjos dos Anjos was that's old-school dos Anjos that's dos Anjos also compromise to make 155 right dos Anjos hit 170 different animal that's a different fucking animal that's a totally different piece and that I think dos Anjos is one of those guys where you point to a perfect example of a guy whose body just was not allowing him to compete at 155 there is he's an he's a fucking animal in his mind I mean he no one works harder than that guy yeah you see that guy train but yes I have you seen in person yes monster monster however and how about he's fighting Coby Covington Brazil Brazil that cold good luck oh good god security please security to super hard to take down real hard to take down and brutal leg kicks and I don't know it's a lot of fucking yeah what 90 minute but video he's been doing everyday but his legs are gigantic grumpy rump that Brazilian shit huh his chest he I don't know what squats front squats dude I don't know what kind of crazy shit he's doing I know he did some training in the past a lot with Nick curse on out of speed of sport and it helped him quite a bit Nick's you know the Mart Marinovich disciple yeah and he does all that crazy shit that Mar have had BJ doing he was doing he's got a lot of ton of videos online dosanjh is he working with perello Jason Perla yeah I don't know is dos ángeles and pearl I gotta think he is he I remember I remember seeing him at the Ruka Jesper le the greatest coach of all ties I you have probably the career come here and just being cyborgs I mean just these monsters and you know what good dude great game and doesn't want the spotlight 0 he doesn't want to be outlined camera yeah doesn't want anything did it wouldn't I was telling him I think he's doing a great job dude shakes your hand looks you in the eye like he's right there he's right there thank you he's like right there and he won't work with just any Skyler which is what I like I like what he did with Bisping help is being a lot yeah came world champion I mean he's he's a fucking great coach fact that could be you know who I think and I'm not just saying this because he's my boy I'm known for her but you know who I think could be his Achilles heel who matches up better with him than anyone who everyone's overlooking Brian Ortega that's a good point Brian take is a big dude at 55 easy weight cut for him but here on the ground on the ground he's most danger gun in the world right now yeah I think so too I think the way he locks up submissions is very different it's like if everybody else is hitting it at a 7 or an 8 or take his hit in a 10 what are you watching you go oh that's different and you haven't seen it so for khabib who he's he's grappled freaking grizzly bears since he was four he and he's seen Sambo he Seabrook black belt Jiu Jitsu he's seen all this stuff you're not gonna catch him you know well or take it's a little different and he actually encouraged you to go to the ground yeah and he's dangerous on his feet but on the grounds where he thrives isn't it funny how that thing about going to the ground is bride says for the record Dana called me yesterday see if I'd step in against khabib since max hadn't responded yet I said yes eventually max replied and gave Dana gave him the fight if all goes according to plan I'll get my turn at both of them phenomenal fight fight just stylist declarant and if i'm kabhi kabhi goes why would I fight Ortiz phenomenal fighter we didn't have a belt in of their name is the most dangerous fight for him I think and it's all it's also I mean Ortega became a much bigger star with the Frankie Edgar knockout much bigger star but is it way to go yeah max Holloway is one of us fighters on the planet mm that's a really interesting fight Ortega's god there's something about his jiu-jitsu man it's like it's on it just wrapped up and sharpened down to like such a just a Razors Edge man when he grabs ahold of stuff you like you have very little room to get out yeah and it's a he sets it up from the clinch and it's very unconventional in the head snaps which like Tony Ferguson with the Darsh chokes ready no snap city however what I want to see in this Ferguson khabib fight with the snap city is like Josh Thompson Fitch like oh no we've never seen khabib his neck snapped down ever that's it for him it's a pride thing growing up where he grew up did no one snaps his neck then he'd no one's snapping him down it doesn't work come on let's Tony Steen they go watch watch no one's ever snapping his neck down ever Wow yeah that's so crazy it's like I've never seen him lose around like fuck goddamn legends I just feel like this and I'm drinking the kool-aid I'm so into this kool-aid well wear that hat Saturday night sir yeah damn I'm fascinated I'm fascinated by this fight I'm always fascinating one could be fights because you're always wondering like what's the first guy that's gonna be able to give him something different see I look at it different I look at like all right I hear all this crazy talk about could be let's see it like I want to see I want to see that pound-for-pound greatness out of them let me get it but you don't you think you started the bar bows now I think Barboza's one-dimensional I think I think we did see and I think people are taken for granted how good could be but what grappler is because you talked to Frank II talked to Eddie Alvarez how hard is it take down Bart bows they go oh it's damn near impossible in training like we don't get him down very easily and they're badasses so you know what khabib did we didn't think he was gonna be able to do and if you look at that third round he quit Barboza's like he gets taken down and he's like kind of caged crawling you look at his face he he looks like get me the fuck out of here like this sure panic that's the difference train could be even worse these fighters that's why it's the worst to fight on short notice cuz it's not gonna be fast you know it's not gonna be fun for you it's a smashing yeah I feel like bradying we've seen the pound-for-pound greatness in him like the potential for it but we need to see him against pound-for-pound greats yeah well that's how you get there but about Connor all but right right right that quick knockout or DC Gustin john jones DC like there's certain times in your career where you have these signature wins he doesn't have a signature win right well I think the Barboza's as close as you can get but Barboza's lost to a few guys he lost a Tony he got dark choked and plus cowboy yep yep but he's also very one-dimensional yeah you're not phenomena on the ground he's a good anti wrestler his striking is phenomenal but overall package yeah then that that is the difference right is the really good guys always threatened takedowns always threaten submissions he just doesn't do that he stands up he's a specialist and up but it means stand up is wicked he's got some of the best stand-up in the world for sure in MMA I mean Barbosa is so fast to such a wonder boy Barbosa the right up there during till ya dare until and Wonder Boy is gonna be a month there fucker how about Wonder Boy I saw a quote here and here we go who's not impressed there until who is he like did you learn not them from the cowboy fight even I learned from that I touch it I was like man why would cowboy take this I don't really know who dare until is and then my inbox just flooded with shit and even did until went off on me and I look about like oh my god this guy's a monster he's an animal doesn't have a gorilla tattoo or something does he he's got gorillas all over his like uses it in his screen name and Twitter well he's a gorilla he's never pulled gorillas bad motherfucker wonder boy who's rehabbing his thumbs and it's just like you know right if you want this and then what happens if one let's say wonder where we're to win which I don't think he is unfortunately let's say I don't you think I'm on the ceiling you know I just yeah I think there's this kind of dare until dick cried a little bit right now I'm Brom hard dick riding on kabhi Hill there's a few guys DC always Connor always always always Brian Ortega I took right Mighty Mouse for sure yeah you do dick right that guy I think he's not wait forever I think he's the best I mean that's fair he needs a guy to challenge him you think fighting so hooligan who I love - who - it's like that shit you guys hate fucking money that shit's ridiculous I mean so who does a beast no doubt about it and I love what so who'd ohdid against Wilson Hayes holy shit that's like a different so who don't he looks like a karate champion I get all that do you see what Mighty Mouse did yeah it went right through him oh oh you're blackout cool what he did yeah oh you like to clench check these out detective Olympics that's very cool check this neon sir needs the body is fat I grabbed him once just joking around plan he hit me in the body with the knee so fast been fusing it was a confusing where'd that come from like I go supposed to go that quick like there's supposed to be I see you move I get to think that this might come my way here it is no it was already there different before I realized he was doing it he's so fucking fast why and did do we know why the TJ fights aren't going down dude I don't know but that one bums me out that would be that is a that's a fuckin gigantic super fight like why wouldn't he take that fight well first of all Mighty Mouse right now is rehabbing a shoulder surgery so it's gonna be a while he was doing those you know that Bo thing they do that flexi thing yeah he's doing some of those exercises the other day on Instagram I'm looking at him like okay that's a guy that's got like he's got some scar tissue to work out like that's not that's not healed up did he get surgery right now yeah he got surgery mmm so he's out for a little bit and TJ pride doesn't want to wait I don't know if that's what the case is I don't know what the case is you know I mean shoulder surgery six months I mean so you wait three months and you have a three month camp you know I mean if they want announce it yeah right no I mean I don't even know you can't even say that because hard I'll you might not be able to go if you Matt Hume and Mighty Mouse are about as smart as it gets when it comes to preparation right so there's no way they would take that fight of his shoulder wasn't a hundred percent many fight and risk is legacy cuz he loses that fight when I was like toldja and he wouldn't go hard early to test it he would let it well look at what Whitley's been out a little bit because of his shoulder yeah yeah yeah he was in here like right after got it he said he can heal up quick yeah and he might PRP all that yeah he's gonna do all the PRP you know there's as much you know different therapies cryo I'm sure it's probably still takes a while even with all our advances after now he's forced to fight and I I see what the UFC is doing where they do in turn belt between kholby and dos Anjos where the you know it's interim belt so now Woodley you literally have to fight the winner of this yeah I have to fight him it's very sneaky may have a belt what do you do you want super fight nope this guy's a belt I get both sides if it's dos Anjos of dos Anjos beats colby dos anjos lightweight champion now well Troy champion that's me oh great great if I have dos Anjos sitting there with two belts on shoulders I mean and then what do you do with Danny let's say he for whatever reason walks do Wonder Boy which is you know it's tough to do but say walks doing which Woodley you know struggled a little bit walks through them and Wonder Boys the number one guy not there until jumps up to number one or is doesn't work that way because the ratings are fucking screwing man all there sometimes I see a guy who beat a guy and then that guy who he beat is still ranked ahead of them they're a nightmare all they are all the ratings do now it almost hurts if you're a guy like Sean Shelby or Dana trying to make these matchups cuz guy who's that fourth a hey wanting to fight sevens like no he's seven I've nothing to gain from that where before I was like he wants you to fight this guy he's a name he's on seven fight win streak we don't know what ranking is but we know he's damn good guys were more willing to take it now they nope he's seven what I want a number one exactly right I need three four you know yeah that's weird hurts us that's also weird like the UFC could just did they just decide who's fighting I mean it's the whole thing the business is so interesting because it's like they decide who's fighting they decide who's champion they decide Tony you're not champion anymore we're gonna strip you it's like put it okay well I don't want this to happen Fox Studios do I twist my knee but he was working for the UFC when he fell I mean he's doing his obligations his press Abigail it's very strange to strip him of a belt when he never lost it and here's the longest winning streak and then and mean but also he even has no belt it could be this there's no belt could be was gonna take the belt they're gonna make up a belt and then Connor has the belt at 55 so what do you do with that belt well what they're planning on doing I believe and now they've kind of let the cat out of the bag cuz they said it's gonna be for the world lightweight title they were gonna strip Connor the moment something happened like the moment the fight started that's when they were gonna strip Connor they're gonna yeah because if they'd stripped him beforehand then what happens if Tony doesn't make weight or something Tony makes we have no bed of khabib doesn't make weight then what the fuck do you take concern then you have nothing he stripped him we're gonna give it back to him I'm gonna give it back to him down whew so what if he wants to fight again now he's not the champ anymore the fuck kind of shit is estranged so they waited and the idea was to wait but now they're in a desperado situation fucking April Fool's April Fool's Day it happens I didn't believe a goddamn word of it Jimmy Smith starts texting me and my fuck that dude I'm not falling for it Jamie texted me I'm like I'm not falling for it you texted me you go bro it's April Fool's I'm like no but Dana I said dated released a video and he's listening I'm sure he likes a good April Fool's joke but what he likes more as money and pay-per-view buys you can't honey dick the fans and like psych its back on people are gonna be pissed I'm not biased that's a good point I didn't buy it I still was like maybe it's just an elaborate PR scam I didn't even read about it until the next day I know I was tweeting about other shed people like what the fuck bro this is good dog you naughty fort win by Mike I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna do it my judgment I checked with you in it then I checked with Josh Thompson who works closely with Habib and then I saw boom there's my two main guys and I Ariel that's all Ariel tweet I'm like god he's out like journalists i'ma yeah I'm an ass clan he's a legit journalist like he is the you know credibility summit bro is this really goes I would never joke around like that Brandon oh my god he's right well I went straight to his jiu-jitsu coach I called Eddie talked to him on the phone your good friend yeah so and Eddie gave me the full rundown of what happened with Toni it's like he saw somebody and he turned to say hi to somebody didn't see some wires on the ground tripped over some wires and just blew his shit out and Eddie was on the podcast yesterday and Eddie was saying that Toni wanted to fight or day before yesterday Toni wanted to fight they wouldn't let him fight yeah his his ligament is torn LCL from the bone which is rare which is hard to do I don't where's that one lateral lateral whatever collateral ligament some shit anyways but do you think it would if it went tripping off that is that a freak accident or do you think you would have went during the fight it's hard to say oh I bet it was a freak accident right yeah LCL yeah I mean the way they said it but first of all what Dana said was very savage what he said Dana said he wears those sunglasses indoors that should happen to everybody that were sunglasses indoors there's only two type people that wear sunglasses indoors blind people and assholes especially at night like what are you doing so hard to see what is this what are you doing I've seen a guy in a club when I used to go to clubs he does a glass son and then people walk late lift them up to look around then put her back down you can't see shit the biggest tools wear glasses just two fights wear sunglasses and they sit there with her fucking sunglasses on especially celebrities that do that it's like flurries it's like get a grip however we mean that's like when you know you fucked up you got two famous you have to wear sunglasses and a fight that is in the front row of sunglass and your boys just like now I like it man yeah wear those indoor that makes complete sense same if you wear like a peacock coat and your boys like that's all good start doing podcast like dude that stresses me out from now on that stresses me out see I'm Tripoli did a podcast like this did you say what did you say some dough yeah and I put mine on I put mine on and we've done it before with sunglasses with NASA outfits that's all Julia did I put the fire in the kid with sunglasses on I go bro you got to take the sunglasses off because my future's too bright now I'll fuck mine too and the countless shit I've got my sunglasses yeah it's a weird thing sunglasses it's a hilarious coat by Dana though yeah ha layered hillarious and especially considering how much money he's losing on this but can you imagine can you imagine you know call that clothe me like what what keeps happen it keeps happening it keeps happening does it tap into this many times it's happened a bunch of times this one's MMA gods like you morons I'm trying to do your favor what was the most recent one would that happen where cyborg stepped in last minute this close yeah said the last one cyborg stepped in who oh that was max Holloway brunette but then there was the Ferguson one with khabib Orca Bebe's liver shut down they had to take him to the fucking hospital was a bummer that was a bummer because this happened a ton of times it was the worst one Jon Jones do UFC 200 DC matter the right literally the day before you're like what but I wonder if that's better for the UFC shitty business either way but is it better for the UFC because people we've always seen the hype where I bought in yeah and then like the next day like what the where's Jon like oh yeah you didn't hear that like does that help them more or does this week at least that can promote a little bit with max Holloway you could promote a little bit with max Holloway and it's an interesting fight it's a very interesting fight yeah there's a lot of those men that happen you like what which one was that John Jones DC one you see 200 and that what was the the thing that John did which one was that remember that the coke one yeah I think there's the coke coke was this was dick pills remember he was like eight we got strippers we hadn't pull them from the card and then DC fighters and Silva that's right I'm like Jonas Anderson and then decedent winning fans that cuz he just kind of yeah yeah he just wears fight he just wrestled him and his whatever still you know fought kicked him in the gut too and I think you heard I'm here as messed up yeah and that happens in sports this this is what I think makes fighting so great so great max has an opportunity that no one else in the world in sports can have and then you know then look at Canelo triple G it's it in in combat sports this is what we deal with yeah Canelo that's the biggest fight of the year biggest fight ever wants to see the rematch of the year and then tainted meat do you buy the tainted meat absolutely not sir I've had many tacos in Mexico and I'm not swole yeah but you're not getting tested for trace amounts of clenbuterol you don't know maybe I have to go and snitch come to my house just for the fucks of it I'm still in the testing protocol mm interesting no I yeah maybe I don't know but I'd see some sort of change but even triple G's camp goes last fight he was on it what else is new now why did Tripp what do you think they said that he'd I don't know I'm sure listen I'm sure gennady's been in there with what over 500 people now 400 people and he just said in his experience he can tell who's on peds and who's not and he thought Canela was do you buy that I do I do because that a fighter as a fighter this guy's I fought who I assumed were okay but what about woodenly a guy at Woodley he has tremendous genetic he's always been like that right always been like that but so is Canelo no hmm you look at it he's gone pretty swole now he's getting older though so it could be that too he's just as you get older you put on more sighs well the big one was Manny Manny was the one that everybody was always accusing and Manny is the first I mean Manny went up eight weight classes and kept his knockout booze fighting as a little boy and then just was like crazy I mean and kept the knockout power true and most people thought that man he was on PT correct and then they thought that Manny got off peds when he fought Juan Manuel Marquez and he got starched but he up there's two there's a two sided story there he got off peds and also found Jesus Christ so he stopped going to strip clubs he stopped hanging out with girls but he stopped having fun and then got serious about Jesus and gotten like the fuck out yeah II saw Jesus in that fuck Jesus is like listen if you want to be a savage you got to live like a savage she's like I'm not even advising this man just let them do your thing yeah take them steroids like listen I made steroids okay Cameron's odd that wheatgrass ain't gonna help you say it's good for you but you need to get good but you need this to him depends on what you are I mean if you want to be 147 pound are 'test me but marques is no stranger to the night skin supplements no no no no no no no no no no well here's they had the same strength and conditioning coach when Manny found Jesus his old strength and conditioning coach went over to the dark side wet mat Juan Manuel Marquez he's always on the dark state on the dark side that dude was always in the dark yeah Morty what was he doing now Hiep Alex Alex Alex Ariza Ariza yes good call brother yeah he knows the shit man he knows his shit and I don't know whether or not he got anybody on peds either just blaming him that was a shit as a strength and conditioning coach that God is very very yeah out of work doing with us fighting I saw the stuff that he was doing with one my mom Marquez I was like this guy's he's super legit and he brings those guys up to like modern levels of preference not the old-school shit yeah it's some of the old-school shit too to this day I think chopping wood that's all legit man sledgehammers on tires that's it was good at I agree I think it's good at in I think deadlifts all that stuff but I think you mix that with the new wave of Technology and I got something well like what I was saying about Nick curse on and that Marvin Marinovich method it's all its plyos man everything's like jump box jumps and movement yeah left right left right left right you know curse on sits I'm very interesting to me when I said like what do you think fighters are missing most like strength condition wanted foot strength that makes sense it totally makes sense you know who's been on that ball since God since I've known him is Loren Landau who I worked with in Denver now he just got the gig is the condition coach of the Denver Broncos Wow but he was making us work out barefoot forever he was football players steve maxwell was always on that - yeah all those kettle bell works there's some of those guys too it's like oh this is all new and then you talked there like a lauren or that max will gather we've been doing this for like 20 years yeah you guys is now finding out about it well so many people you know you see so many people working out with like high thick-ass running shoes that are all spongy on the bottom yeah I'd be one of them yeah a lot of people do you're not training for a fight right now no no but if you were you tried to optimize everything wouldn't you yeah I used to wear those five fingers - I'd wear those - run I'd wear those on the track at wear those during most of my stuff so now you just wear regular running shoes for comfort regular running shoes and then I had a knee prompt just putting so many miles on it and now I'm on a bike I go I got on those peloton's yeah those are dope it's been good those uh it's good because it's you could play along and go along with a class yeah it's cool I don't know if it's the answer do every day but I like I need I need to mix it up man I'm getting I'm just bored as fuck with working out so that go bike those are dope I want to get one of those in the crib they're called boxes but I like waking up because my Mondays and Tuesdays are a nightmare I have to be on set at 7 a.m. so I'm waking up at like 5:00 just doing that pellet in for an hour that I'm off oh that's good yeah we're before I'd have to try and go to the gym or I was missing my workouts to dress me nuts dude you know what to start the day with a sweat and then I get going you know what kick I'm on the Versa climber Jews are a nightmare I went to the gym the other day and I did 150 meters sprit at the end of the workout the trainer I mean do 150 meter sprint on their first class you feel like passing a holy shit it's hard holy shit when you get off man like you're barely a lot of before yeah but I haven't been doing it numb I'm getting one in here now it might be the toughest thing as far as cardio eyes again Lauren land I used to have us do even its football players all the time I was like what the fuck are we doing man this is awful is by far you'd have these circuits and it always end on that I remember everyone feels like here's your circuit and universe to some of the best athletes in the world just like oh my god and what are we doing yeah but that's what they do with this this gym that I've been working out he likes to do a circuit the end the circuit you get on that verse of climber and you sprint and it's you know how much time to get to 150 meters I've been doing rows with my trainer oh yeah I do that - I do you wrote 1000 meter row and I'm like what's a good time so we looked up the top times I'm like I think I'm top 300 in the world right now a bit you know I got to do some work big yeah there's big difference between top 300 in the top hundred yeah but dude your top 300 in the world with a row with a rail yeah I look it up that's pretty fucking sweet it's all right I mean it's a row machine okay top eighty-five million I mean no your that you hold up your the hold on hold on let's just I was that that was the humble brag but let's just be serious there given your the hardest kicker ever on that goddamn UFC machine well I call it the Frances machine well I there's a video of me doing 150 to like right now you only see the one with me kicking it in with my jeans on and that what got to 135 stretchy jeans yeah that barbells gene basically peds yeah it's like sweatpants man some dude burned me burned me from the audience and he goes hey man how long did it take you to paint on those jeans oh my goodness sir scorched me now you see OVA did me dirty gets brought weird clowning each other with Clara each other I said you look like an extra from the waterboy set he goes fuck bro you look like you you look like you're get the Nordstrom's rack in your mechanic please fucking pants man these pants are the shit these are different these right now I have on they're similar they're called Martin bow no that's a good company yeah those are like legit jeans yeah they like more feel like jeans well jeans like they look like jeans to touch them they go hey what's going on here like sweats no those are that's not a good company just so bind you up a little bit more if you were trying to kick somebody a little bit more so what did you do the record-setting King barbell jeans this is the that all that I did the record or this is the record one that dos Santos Trump I see you saw my Hill running man my ass is way bigger a lot of people been complimenting me on it nothing wrong with and I don't like that fat belly though I'm so fat right now you are not fast for me 1:52 and what's the hardest I'm definitely fatter than I usually am I've been up cheating on my diet way too much I hear you man well it's also I can't there's certain things I can't do in the gym right now and I got this man this dildo that I got here bro this is for you know I've golfer's elbow I have this tendonitis another so well fuck dude I've never had tendinitis before have you ever had it yeah not fun it takes forever forever like way more than a muscle doctor I got PRP I got regen Akeem I got stem cells I had a bunch of shots this this dildo I'm holding this helped me more than any of them exactly two weeks in two weeks as things help dry needling it did seem like it should have fixed everything what did the dry needling I dried needling where they'd used electricity to and they zapped it never done that pulse to do nothing for me didn't help this helped this is cheap you buy it on Amazon it's called the thera-band and what do you do with it and my friend Brian told me about this Khalid no no no Brian from his last so he's Vinny Sherman's buddy from Fontana California I think what does this is think Double Deuce boy toy is that his uh his place here oh that's a great shirt by the way Jamie Bryant obler and Brian is of great Muay Thai coach himself so what'd he do he had he had a issue and he told me this is the thing that fixed him you take it you hold it out like this right in front of you right then you twist this is the arm that's injured the bottom arm so you hold out you twist it with the other one and then you hold it straight and then you let it untwist with this arm slowly and I've been doing this shit all the time I do it in my car I take it with me at home but I'm twisting the shit out of it and then slowly untwisting it with my right side that's helping how to it it makes a big impact it makes a big impact because it's strengthening it it's strengthening this this little particular area but it's also getting a ton of blood you hold it like that like palm palm out and then twist it right and now straighten it out unwind it with this hand with the injured hand there you go just like yeah yeah and you just do that slow and I'll do that like for like 5-10 minutes of time and then I'll leave it alone game come back huh game changer you know another dude a lot better I mean obviously I've had a lot of other shit done to it like the Virgin Hakeem was like might help a month or so ago I'm sure it helped but that's good this once I started doing it almost immediately within a few days started feeling better basic Sun yeah but I can't just a lot of shit I can't do like I can't do chin-ups right now I have been able to do chin-ups I could do rose but I can't go having like 50 pounds everything has to be all about preserving this little ligament and your trainer knows that yeah it's a new trainer yeah yeah so it's a good trance they usually know how to adapt but even here like when I'm training here you can't do it with so much shit I can do other wings no no I can throw straight punches yep but no no no hooks uppercut but it's getting it's getting much better just in two weeks of using this fuckin thing you ever think about resting it maybe just not doing anything sir mmm that's how I got fat well you can still get up you're crazy you're crazy do I for me to speak on a diet I have to add to have a meal specialist like deliver my meals right now I'm usually really good at it but but one thing this has done is ramped up my Hill running so I've been doing just good dude well I see late night you're always posting you get that fat ass I see when the pH fat I see when at night when you come home from the Commerce story always posting like protein and veggies yeah you really that already like there's that and then you have McDonald's on the side if I cheat it's pasta or be like I hold pizza the other day I can give up what we're from it was at a restaurant I was uh with the missus and we ordered some other stuff I said let's just get a pizza - right she's like I'm not really into this my good oh I wolf the whole pizzas out hate that whole fuck and I'm so disappointed myself I had these at these meals man I've been strict on it when I'm on the road it's fucking tough or when if I'm not getting sleep my body craves sugar and carbs yep but no always crude saying I'm like I just one in there one I just can't stop myself it's hard and then last night by my son this pasta and of course I have to try it I make sure it's not poison I tried I'm like that's fucking way better than my meal got to eat so I just fired up some tortellinis ah it's hard it's also hard when you work hard because I work I do a lot of things I'm always busy and it's like sometimes I just want to go off with food like that's my indulgence that's the one thing where I can get loose on men but most of the time I'm very strict most the time but it's been hard with this injury it's just because I thought it was going to be healed by now so it's been frustrating the shit out of me certain things I want to do like I was on this heavy chin up kick and heavy cleans and presses kick and that's probably where I want to do it because I felt some twinges instead of just working on it and like letting it heal up no I pushed through it for months that's the athlete in you that's the idiot in me hmm for months I pushed I'll tell you that but that's how it works when an athlete I'm sure when you doing Taekwondo or jujitsu you get hurts like oh let me take months off to make it as bad it's none of that yeah that and that's something that Eddy said about Tony is it like Tony when he gets hurt he's like whatever I'm hurt just works around it whatever it is he doesn't stop working out ever ever yeah but this is an eye-opener for me this this thera-band thing is like always keep searching there's oh and the other thing I have is this other thing when I put my fingers in this rubber thing and I expand my fingers right that's very difficult to expand you know it's easy to contract you're always doing that but how much strength you have this way very little when do you ever do it never never never but this rubber thing is really good and I think I read I think was Jim still pani who's a bodybuilder guy online he's got a bunch of supplements and shit and he's also super super smart educated guy and he he was recommending now for people with tendonitis there's a lot of different things you do with bands and this one this is the strongest one they have to shake and like do you think if you would have went to physio therapy they would have shown all this stuff before he injected yourself with all these need and stuff I feel like that a lot of its Physiol maybe yeah ya know you learn most of them were just saying I sit and rest goddamn move the rest yes but the rest they want it's just not what I want to do yeah the ball it's also when your body is so used to going hard and then hard then your body sorry okay let's find some problem I know I can't sit still that's like right now I'm lazy and it affects everything like a bitch I know but like I said it's increased my badonkadonk yeah that's yeah oh man dude the missus likes it or she wants you tone it down she's happy with it no one like the flat ass no one even I like guy yeah no one that might be the worst thing feel flat and they watch smaller girl wants a flat ass cuz she knows the guys not going anywhere correct yeah where you going Maserati flat ass fuckin Chitti jean loafers don't you know for Gucci loafers no success gets tired walking up stairs do you imagine if all of a sudden you had someone's flat ass right and then you had to like walk around and you know realize oh my god it's so hard to walk up hills how get around for walking around flats tearing up the grocery bags up the stairs that's out how about when you but you I've seen it where it might be one of the easiest muscles in a build like there's some girls with flat asses then you see them on Instagram these Instagram models who do like deadlifts or something and then just over time boom that ass just grows it's like a tornado if they really are motivated you can get your ass to grow a little whinny a little fucking a little of that right yeah for sure there's a lot of that going on with girls man there is wind straws what we're talking about folks you don't know what went on yeah I was a tree friend of Winnie the Pooh went strong roids yeah a lot of those Fitness girls are doing steroids yes they just do a little bit just a little bit just a little bit changes a little bit the jaw the shoulders anytime - any time count sees a Rip Curl your steroids literally every time stare right a lot of my goddamn broke they keep that shit though they keep it that's what's weird they keep the manly parts like like they don't just keep them when they get off the shit if their face is still hard the other structured like their face structures a little differ as a lady who lives in my neighborhood she used to be a big old Miss Olympia and I see her walking around and it's weird she's she's she looks like a man not just in her face but in her her the way she carries herself everything right it's like you know I mean that sounds weird to say but there's a certain masculine quality that the the people the women that take massive amounts of steroids they develop they just develop they look different they're wider yeah they don't look like they're in take care of you I don't I'm not attracted to that I don't know listen to each is so then I can be the best mom so what I'm saying here you know it's like it's not necessary that so that's even bad but it's but if you want that I'll suck those career women will be mad at you like if you want to know if you want a soft sweet caring woman who likes to cuddle is gonna be a good mom it's just sweet to be around yeah you know obvious it of us yeah yeah yeah but a lot of career women will get mad at you know like oh

equal like why do we have why are we playing math games yeah why can't we just be chill can we just like each other yeah yeah why do we have to be equal yeah that I don't know it's weird women I honestly have run from it he's successful who who said there can only be one headshot in the household have you heard that that's good you can only have one headshot in the household he's not gonna

they fire you from show time you you know it'll be like they use the force against themselves stronger I do say a lot of crazy shit though you could do that show on your own you do all the anything like that you could do on your own yeah I think it's great that you're on show time yeah it's a fun show too yeah what I like about it is you're being you on that show yeah I see you on that show I'm like oh then let him be himself like you say about your silly shit yeah laughing there's a lot of cracking up yeah I have fun they let me do my thing the first one it was like there's a lot of teleprompter and I was like kind of throwing out my finger let me go and they listen to me that's the great thing about Showtime they listen to me but the fans like man this isn't why we listen to Brendan to be another freaking sport show like God let him go and literally they all were like alright here you go man here's your point do what you want to do I'm like really yeah but then they edit it so I don't get in trouble oh my god which is why their Showtime and I'm what I do well that means this we we talked about the other day with Eve Edwards he was in here that was that's one of those things like and I was saying when you talk as much as we talk we both I talk too much you talk too much we talk too much yes when you talk too much shit comes out of your mouth you step in some shit and then you're scrambling and try to like make it make sense Joe like in I can't I didn't listen to podcast with these I like these we don't know each other that well the thing that bothers me about this is I couldn't even tell you the point I was trying to admit as soon as I give us a million dollars tell us the point you try making I forget American League on and then I remember before that I was 20 minutes deep in this explain why I think DC is the greatest of all time as a besides you as a commentator eyes the future of the sport and then before that show me and Brian were talking about something with race and men and women and somehow that entered my brain and I have no animosity toward it this way I have no animosity towards UFC tonight well my favorite shows I've worked with Karen Bryant for over 10 years she's a good friend Woodley DC Kenny Florence good friend biz beings a good buddy I don't know ease I work with the team on your scene light I love those guys I just had Jimmy Smith in and on my show who works you know there it doesn't make zero sense and then I was in st. Louis and I started to get texts from so involved in that show I don't say their name and he was tame in some people upset here about he said and I'm like what I said I can't even tell you what I said and he tells him like what and then King goes hey man I'm seeing online about some of the stuff should I edit it out like no we never do that don't edit let me deal with it let me see what I say that makes me look even worse if you cut it out looks like I was saying something that I wasn't meant to say and then you know he's was upset and then me and eve's text back and forth again I don't know him Brian works with him a little bit on certain stuff for help or something like that for shows or he was trying to do which is great everyone should talk to Brian you know if you're friends with him and then I sent evotech so his number from Brian and I thought it was over squashed and then I was doing PR from my pull the belt show in New York and someone brought it up my man again I went I meant no offense I come up with about 10 hours of content a week I can tell it a saying I messed up whoever had problems with it if it's Eve Edwards that's his own insecurities which is so stupid because I I couldn't tell you what he should be insecure about right and then as soon as I got on that interview I you text my brother's this he goes you're an idiot you resurface that story like oh my god and so i tec c weekend and then he comes on here right and then i I haven't listened to it and then you know I text Eve like dude I don't want to keep going through this I meant zero fence I've text Karen Bryant DC Woodley literally anyone you can see the night I this business especially entertainment you know it's better anyone it's impossible to be successful in this business it's a fucking monster I'm willing to help them out I want to help you know I'm saying aye aye I don't want to criticize people that's not what I do that's not why I signed up for this I just got caught on a path when you start talking about this yeah and then one of the things that we do the best part about it is there's no script the best and the worst it's the worst that can feel with this sometimes it goes haywire yeah but it didn't go haywire my biggest issue is is whenever someone was hurt by my words or is upset by something I said that I'm like again I don't know if that well at all but I lost sleep over like oh my god what am i doing I've respect for him he's a pioneer at 1:55 again I love all the people you see the night I watch the show all the goddamn time there my face went it makes zero sense doc and you tried to just make sense of your words makes no sense I apologized Eve's it's it's all good eye token door policy ones come on the show we can talk about in there but yeah I put my foot in my mouth and I hate tell you Tritan happen again I wish I could say it's not probably happen again it's part of what makes it fun is that you are really working without a filter work without a net you're just you're trying to have fun yeah I mean that's and sometimes you take some swings you miss I came to balls trying to hit I can tell you taking swings at balls I was even know it as hitting so you know yeah sometimes that shit happens but it happens yeah it's just one of those things I mean I've done it a hundred times in this podcast said some shit no I was like what the fuck I even say that for okay I don't even know what was going on in my mind and sometimes like when you're trying to form a sounds like right now I'm trying to form a sentence right like sometimes while you're thinking about it you like this isn't going so good no let me try to make it sound better all right let me try to see if I could rescue this for the people that are listening and make some sense and then it just makes it more cloudy and more fucking and and it's hard for people to fall in just like that I speak for a living yeah I've ever been on stage he's going through my set and I said I've been doing it so much lately I'll be the middle of it and in my mind I'm fast forward to already the next bit and I'm think about that bit while I'm doing this one have you done that or am i caring about that I know cuz I'm not I'm not present don't do that you know what happened is I missed I skipped over a part that was new and I thought was gonna be a home run I skipped over it yeah and I went back and I record it right and I'm and I didn't realize I was doing the moment and I listen I go oh my god and I remember in my head going dude you're here on third you're in first base you're looking at third already you miss second base you know anything that you're not even the moment that's hard because there's I go you never know how you should think when you're on stage you're doing the bit and you're just trying to perform the bit right and if it's going well then you start saying okay this is going well what am I gonna lead into next but while you're still talking about the original thing you can't do that I know have you done that before they're like yeah no I've definitely done it you know so disappointed myself man the big thing about comedy one of the big things is the audience has to know that you are honestly thinking about that subject like even if you talked about it a hundred times when you're talking about it that day in front of those people they want they they're hearing it for the first time they want you to be tuned into that subject 100% and present yeah if you're not they can sense it now I know I'm so disappointed - I've never done it before and it was it's very strange - because and this is what hurts me about the Edwards situation is the guys I looked up to yourself Garry Shandling like they always help people man you don't put anyone down they always help people and I don't have the same platform you guys have but I like to think one day I well and I want to help people like you guys tell people like there's the 60 degrees of separation and you look at all the lives you've touched and Garry Shandling it's it's insane that's so inspirational to me and I was watching the Garry Shandling doc I want man that's so cool and that's why this Edwards situation is fucking me up because like damn and it's not I don't want to hurt anyone but would you back to the comedy I was so excited that Garry Shandling stuff when they whenever they get it Shandling whenever they show calmly store stuff it's just I'm so into it man his time at the Comedy Store and I got super inspired and let's do this I've never been more pumped to hit the stage and then that happened I'm so disappointed you're still getting it I mean think about like how long you've been doing stand-up you've been doing less than two years yeah this is a thing that's gonna come up yeah and it's like you know it's like one year you know you're doing a certain move and you leave yourself open for an armbar you know how the fuck am I still doing that it's just you just have to cement it into your head it's a craft you know I mean you'reyou're you got a great work ethic yeah and you're a funny dude and you're very good at going off the cuff and you're impulsive like those are all great qualities for comedy and you also doing the work and too involved like you're listening to tapes you're going over notes you're doing things a lot of comics don't do this a lot of comics are fucking lazy like I've had conversations with dudes I'm like you did a fucking special last August or last October and you're already recording another one and I'm like yeah I work I fucking work man like I really work like I get home from a comedy store I'll get home it's 12:30 at night I'll just sit in front of the fucking TV I'll put something on just for background and I pull out the laptop and I start writing when you come back from us all right that's time I go over I go over subjects I'll put on I sometimes I just have some in the background just for a visual I just want to be stimulated by something back there sometimes I'll just sit by myself at my desk just nothing just nothing but that fucking screen staring at it and when I do that every two or three days I'll come up with a great line you know every two or three days which is not this is nuts which is a lot of work yeah and because usually I'll come home you know it's late at night I'll just take one little hit just sit there and go over the ideas give those ideas their time your the stuff you already have yeah give those ideas their time and then maybe I have a new idea maybe of a new idea I'll flush that out too and then I'll come back and look at that again tomorrow night then I have a whole list I started using this program called Scrivener for her script now on the iPad more on what you can use it on Mac it'll work on an iPad or you could use it on Windows - I've been writing on Windows right on you like that yeah I like actual paper uh papers good but I can't write with my hands as fast as I can type got the phone version oh they got a phone version too is that for Android as well it says features for iOS so what exactly do you do with this job um well this one is this is a different show the corkboard thing the corkboard things interesting what what they do is just see if you could fit right there pull that up so they have it like that this is like you could do it in different colors so you have different do each one of those things those little windows can be like a box oh that's cool that you know that that doesn't look like a corkboard but sometimes you could change the background shit and it'd make it actually look like a corkboard but what it is is basically a board a bulletin board where you've taken an index card and you put it up there in the index card has the sub that's sweet so do that in real life too I have a real quirk boy really and I put index cards on the cork board like if I'm doing like vegan cat yeah that bad I'll put it up right there I put all these different things on the cork board and then I'll look at them and I'll pick one and then I'll do it but really all these different things is just about making the time making the put in the focus discipline that's what you do and that's why you're getting better so quick yeah and all these are the guys with the flu who's who were doing an hour with the folk he's touring the road he works yeah he listens to those recordings nobody listens to the recordings man they record him and they never listen to him I listen you gotta listen after it sucks to hear your voice right

open a card and I'll pick a subject and I'll start going and if something else comes to mind while I'm on that I'll just start talking about that going it's all just about opening up the floodgates but really are just about giving giving everything more time giving everything more more attention your focus you know you're not just giving through yes so we're done what's good is a moment like this where you fucked up and your thing get about 1 bit why are you thinking about another now you know that that can happen yeah so that's like a lesson so just look at it as a good thing look now

Ultimate Fighter I've told the story on here I think but that's palace nation casino guy pulled a gun yeah well it was the night before the Ultimate Fighter right sorry if you've already heard this it was the night before the Ultimate Fighter and they they put all the fighters in there and they tell you the production F goes do not leave this room if you leave this room you will be kicked off the show before even begins you're not allowed to leave this room we're taking your phone everything all you have is what you bring in the house do not leave this room we'll bring you food any food you

walls are paper-thin it's palette station we got six and I hear this guy in this girl arguing like it's waking me I'm like what the fuck and then she's just going off him and I hear him slap the piss out of her oh like hard and then there didn't I hear keep going and him hit her again I'm like all right man so like fuck this so I get up in my underoos to like stop this because I just thought I was a regular dude hitting a girl right I'm not flat I'm not cool with that man I get up insult that get mine where I hear another do go nah man nah man fuck this bitch I'm gonna shoot her and I hear a gun clock them all definitely not going in there now fuck that noise and I'm like god it's so quiet I'm like I don't want to hear me so I'm army calling my undies or cuz I'm afraid fucking gun fire is gonna go off I get to my door and I hear him go hold up dawg hold up someone's next door I'm like oh shit so out you'll see that I'm sure there's video this power station me just booking down the hallway and I run to the casino and the staff was like game or something they see me go running by and went to go get security your underwear in my underwear and I went to go in security but all the production staff saw me like what the fuck is Shaab doing so I told I'm the key some girls about to get shot next door I don't know what's going on but she was hit before there's two dudes in there and there's a lady in my room 213 and like all right so you'll show us I go up there I'm on there it's and then they just they go go to your room but I'm in my room like looking and see what's going

knock does a cast yes I'm here I'm here put me my Ultimate Fighter house yeah that guy got out of jail like quick or guarantee Oh for flapping and she was a prostitute I did not know that but still used to pimp get was a pimp and a prostitute and then some John is in there she's a woman friend she's a woman she's my equal mmm she's your equal she's my equal I like I think you think you're a feminist man that's just showing your belly I know and just hold me to movement and it's I don't know it's a tricky situation it is you think it's gonna bounce back I think the game's changed for a forever I do I think if you're creeped you can get sought out and found out however I think men in power in position and if there's an attractive young lady in the office or the studio there's this as always gonna be the dynamic because I think this I think there's some attractive young ladies out there who are like I don't have a problem with it they did yeah okay yeah he's an attractive dude just happens to you know have some power and get me movies whatever but I actually like him you know I'm not being forced to do this well there's there's a new option it's almost like a new element is in the game like if you're playing a game and then all sudden someone found like a new magic power you can end careers now if you are like a woman who was sexually abused by a guy like Harvey Weinstein used to have to take it now you have a new power which is I'm all about however some will take advantage of that power and pull that card once not one reason dudes are losing their jobs like oh yeah there's people that are crazy like look that video that we were watching before the podcast today that lady was shot up YouTube we're watching her her online videos one of the worst YouTube videos I've ever seen she's fucking nuts and there's gonna be people like that and there's gonna be people like that that take advantage of the me to movement it's just it's just gonna be I mean there's no way you can deny that it's just part of human nature that's with anything though right yeah but really ultimately where it's going to shift but people have to be nicer to each other and they can't get away with shit like that and that's what Weinstein was doing was nothing but crime it's just crime he's a bad dude he's a bad dude and I'm glad that happened yeah I really am I'm glad he got sought out and he scrutiny should be screwed you imagine being a chick you have to suck that fat guy's dick Nord get in the movie hey Harvey is there any way you could just look a little more attractive no do you have to be so hideous there's nothing to do at this point they would have to cut chunks of his face and pull it back to kiss the money he's got what about the diet it's part of the whole thing right it's like he's a glutton what girls complain if you look like Brad Pitt though tony is cliff has a bit oh I was interested he doesn't use that as an example but it's a great bit you have to see it I don't want to even paraphrase give it away no no you didn't it's a great bit it actually involves louis c.k it's a great I love it it's really fucking funny Tony's brilliant I don't want to tell you where it goes cuz it goes he's you're awful I'll see it's got to see it are you gonna see him tonight yeah he's at the store I'm at the store murdered I took him on the road with me this past week he's the killer and murder and he murdered him in Nashville murdered murdered him in Charlotte a lot of a lot of rednecks hoechlin whoa really Tony had a go to war good luck heckling Tony I mean he's a writer for the roast for god sakes he's so witty I fucked up one time I had let my shield down it stole my I almost started crying Comedy Central and I just feel his neck gets stiff against it and right I'm like oh here he comes and he was like you know screaming Comedy Central and just roasted me for basically the rest of the show why would you why'd you almost Chron Comedy Central just cuz it's full circle for a guy like me beyond county central doing stand-up you know it was just a special night for me and I and turn this the story that I tell I talked about how I realize that's never become UFC champ but being on Comedy Central and Judd Apatow is one of the books I've read when I super you know getting started comedy and that day at Judd Apatow on my show that night did Comedy Central I don't know it just hit me in that moment was on stage at a strip club where they shoot it and I don't know I got emotional I was like do you need to get your shit together man you gotta get shit together you're happy yeah I was happy as emotional man and then he said the fuck Jeff I feel in split snake neck go what I was like oh fuck he's like this isn't Comedy Central in 2010 and just went nuts man well change clubs always had a thing with Comedy Central's yeah yeah Frodo he's gotta burn his side about them like they didn't appreciate him he's a very underrated guy man like right now he's still to this day he's right now he's underrated I agree it but and I think with your show and we were he was closed I think got yeah yeah I mean he's a monster and on a show the most under a guy who I should be selling out theaters to steal Vaughn well we were talking about that before Theo's got it he hit a stride like within the last year he hit a stride where he just like sometimes you'll see dudes they they're doing really well and then for whatever reason they figure something out and they take it to the next breakthrough and that's where Theo is right now he's just he's a mom and he's a unique guy like his comedy is so unique like you wouldn't work with anybody you don't see it anywhere else no tell me sometimes I'll watch other comedians and I'll go I can see how they came up with that idea right and I watch the I'm like what the what are you smoking there where you coming up where were you raised how how's that you or the world we are graced by a fucking pack of crocodiles in New Orleans yeah he's but even just hanging around with him like offstage he's just a weird dude Paul bro you pulled up this deer yesterday and he just got a new car I don't say car nice car we'd like it and he like of dude you're killing it man that your car is yeah and he has some homosexual bumped into the back of me thick why is he a homosexual is it cuz he was I'm like alright just happened yeah I usually just happened to be he's just so hilarious man yeah there's a lot of good guys right now I was talking about watching that Garry Shandling stuff and doing all the Judds documentapp toes documentary it's brilliant on his process and stuff like that I got emotional on that as well I don't know if you guys know obviously I'm a complete bitch but Shannon talked about how his goal through going through everything was to get on The Tonight Show then he does it and he walks backstage and kills it right but that was his goal and he starts crying he falls into Bob Saget saw him search crying right because I was goal but he's talked about the Comedy Store and like he's talking about all the big names there and I was thinking god that must have been cool to be involved in that back then around all those big names I was talking to Brian Broncos man right now The Comedy Store some would argue it's better and we think about I'm like God it is when you think about all the fucking just legends man you / you got Mary and got delete I'm II just don't you keep skewed the list goes on and on and I'm like oh my god it's a crazy time you mean it's it's certainly the best time at the store in terms of like the amount of time that I've been there and I started going there in 94 it's a long time it's a long-ass time so in 24 years that I've been going there it's better now than ever before but when you think about it I mean obviously there's the seller in New York but far as like and I get you're there on a Tuesday night going on Wednesday night I mean it's freaking yeah they're very similar oh they're very similar in a way but and they're also very similar in that they become big tourist traps too like Comedy Store people take vacations for comedy they do comedy vacations and they fly from Australia getting a lot of people from Australia yeah but because you know if you show up you didn't see bill burr Rogan Marc Maron and Tilly in the same night almost every week one of us is there sounds there at least the stones on tour someone's off yeah yeah in a lot of times you are on tour um but shit on any given Tuesday Dave Chappelle might stop it correct and then Chris Ross Rock you know maybe Louie I'll make his comeback there I hope he does come on come on come on you like people watching you beat off I mean there's worship come on mmm yeah just need someone to come up someone has to do something much more horrible you know Callen shooting his special I think in July no he is true uh some so I forget who's shooting it but definitely not his buddy works for ESPN this time so they're doing it right there he's doing it right this time but they're gonna go out there and try and sell it but he's ready to go I just hope it works out for count as far as netflix or showtime or somewhere you got to land somewhere so is he gonna sell it and then bring it somewhere is that the move I think so I don't misquote Bryan but I'm almost positive but he has someone who I think he shot Segura's and a bunch of other guys stuff like it's it so he knows what the hell they're doing where's he gonna do it I think Chicago in July yeah that's a good spot UFC June I'm doing the Chicago theater June 7th or some shit I love Chicago cool what theater that sounds that did Chicago theater Chicago the end yeah yeah it's great it's beautiful beautiful old place - yeah Chicago's awesome man doesn't get enough love it's a weird place right does it not get enough love I feel like everyone fucking loves Chicago there Pete so people won't shut up but that's not really pizza it's casserole it's a casserole correct yeah it's like I'm calling out a Pete it's not a pizza if you can't large thick square that would be a casserole where I come from if you have a hamburger and you roll it up in a tortilla is that still a hamburger Oh tortilla not a wrap that's a burrito better in an out protein style then oh that's lettuce lettuce conk oh it's a wrap though that's a lettuce wrap Chinese food place correct - trap check it out see the difference is the way you make it it's rolled up look you can take a piece of pizza and flatten it out and fold it over over and over again and then it'll become folded pizza but if it starts out folded what are you telling me it's a calzone you sell yeah you sell me a goddamn calzone I love the calzone I'm a fan I'm a fan of calzone you got a good thick piece of pizza from basic casserole from Chicago though yeah oh yes you've ever had those very good the best you've ever had what did where's the place we go to what is it called Yordano someone might have been you know who makes a nice square piece is Kings in New York or have you ever heard of fucking getting the artichoke pizza in New York artichoke it's called artichoke pizzas I have to have ripped pants to get in there no sir no sir people kept telling me go there when I was in New York working for Showtime I tried one slice you know postmates s'posed mates what makes me fat now because I wish tomato smells that we get food if it drops it off to your hotel room so I get done after a long day of PR I'm like pizza be great so I get two slices I'm like next and I'm like fuck that was delicious let's you know I got a fucking love handles and it is gin isn't it weird how like when you're tired you want carbs you want sugar and carbs I wonder why I think it's like my willpower is weak yeah I want like I never fuck with Egg McMuffins or Mick griddles house water but if I'm at the airport and I'm on a fucking 7 a.m. flight when I you and I together I never need that shit you and I together is so good for the brief moment it was in my mouth dude you know I was thinking I'm like McGriddle but I don't be judged right now I'm gonna wait to see if he goes to that fucking wind bright place on the breakfast spot on the right or is he gonna make dollars and we started leaning over there I went and I want to be I want to be mad at Ike McMuffin and you slick them it yes fuck this let's do this yeah before I saw you guys I thought you would skip it be the guy who pulls the tray you don't be judged man yeah most of the time I'm gonna not pull the trigger but did I feel like that's part of the things like pulling that trigger every now and then for fuck of it have some fun get chicken and waffles go to Roscoe's yeah go to Roscoe's and slather that motherfucker with maple syrup and butter you just can't do it every day can't do it every day but you do it one day a week I agree rock his Instagram like those the pictures of him eating stacks of Gmail stacks of Pancakes definitely photo shoot yeah I hear you you ain't you know that son yeah you think so no that's definitely so he's a giant you don't think he eats all that shit yeah he's not a giant he's under with supplements than I am we're very similar size different supplement different supplements yes sir supplement supplement hey do you think they come from south of the border I'm sure the same topics yeah you see camera videos depression yeah I think he's it's a football thing then I think and then also Pro Wrestling all that slamming all that getting slammed around this is my take on this I think I mean you I'm sure you've dealt with depression right yup bummer dates Jamie up bummer days right shit happens I mean there's a difference between having a depression period in your life or events in their life and then you know you're normally happy dude and there's people with severe depression who has to be medicated there's a scale yeah and he's not on that scale no he's on that stage news coz goes hey I've been sad too before like yes rockets at to crime different said we're not talking Ari Shaffir depressed here you know I'm saying right he was talking about his mom was Ari Shaffir depressed though much worse it was mom walked into traffic and I'm not throwing shade at Ari we've talked about are you having depression before and he takes medication that's what I said that he doesn't anymore he's off medication yeah this is a lot better thanks Lou magically Oh weird phenomena macand successful and he's not depressed also he got off propecia callicles bullshit on account so taking propecia like there's skittles and he's the happiest man I know yeah but it's not necessarily like Universal like some people can take you know penicillin and then of a problem other people are lerczak to it yeah but it I think it's a rare case where you take propecia and get depressed Alling is that rare I bet if you look at the studies and this come from talent I mean look this is bro science well challenge just wants that hair let's keep that hair so but he'll do anything you know well you should wait well good fat one yeah a red one yes just go crazy so I can yank it off and shit I want to wear weak so bad like one of those those mesh net ones just like the LeBron sprayed-on looked almost looks like a Pittsburgh Steeler helmet Ron still doing that yeah kind of you just gotta let it go question I'm mister wouldn't you take propecia because you're a little depressed because your hair is falling out and if it didn't work you're gonna stay correct a little depressed also fucks with your dick game yeah maybe but I think what they're saying is like suicidal depression that there's something about the DHT inhibitor dihydrotestosterone which is derivative of testosterone is what causes you to have your hair fall out the DHT inhibiting factors in propecia with some people it adds to it it's a low percentage so I'm pretty sure might be the study this comes from which I just I would googled it might have been more than one study was in 2012 and it was only 61 men well the only did 61 men how many got depressed said 61 men who formerly used propecia who experienced more than three months of sexual side-effects and had no history of depression sexual problems of any sort yeah I mean dude if I'm losing my hair and my dick won't get up and be depressed - yeah and then also you got to figure like what's happening in your love life if you're depressed and your dick doesn't work correct you can also bla Sofia if you had a nine-to-five job you hate and pay the bills and your family drama eleven percent of those I guess so 11 percent of the 61 which would be what six of them five or six yeah had mild symptoms of depression 20 had moderate and 36 had severe so whoa 36 had severe I mean so that's also them when you're asking them so it's like what is the step what was the study but hold on a second did you say 61 people 36% had severe depression found that 44% of the men had experienced thoughts of suicide hold on uh I'm already hold on Jesus Christ 44% right but that's what I'm also going on like what were they would they just ask I'm like a you ever thought of it because you like well it's a scientific study I'm sure there's some sort of protocol they have to follow let me understand this though 66 people were randomly out of Iran how many people took it right it says that the journal of clinical psych psychiatry psychiatry I'm sorry study included 61 men that's what so what is that like 28 dudes wanted to kill themselves that's fucking crazy I lay off that propecia I just don't ball dude Ari said it like it was like almost instant and he never put the two of them together never depression with the with the suicidal thoughts like it all of it came like right when he got look you know he had had some issues in the past with being depressed after breakups normal shit like everybody had in there but it wasn't that's not the case I never want to kill you know he didn't are he's kind of a stoic dude he's very proud and he doesn't talk a lot about stuff and so it took like me and him hanging out where he like wasn't talking and I was like okay what's the matter and he's like dude it's just hard it's hard to just not kill myself he said that to you and I went what yeah so we were playing pool in my house and I was like what I go what's going on so he starts telling me they put him on medication and the medication didn't work and then they put him on another medication and then that didn't work and you know he's with sag its sag after insurance not the best insurance and he's like I don't know what to do and I'm like okay this is one of my best friends and he's reaching out oh my Saints up for a reason and I don't have any experience with that I mean I've had some bomber moments in my life but I would never say that was depressed I'm pretty pretty happy Birds been depressed though yes of that bad moment yes but I'm not I'm not I've never gone through depression I've never been down for like no I'm never couldn't get out of bed or thought about suicide know there's a scale of that she thought about dying he was he was on the dark end of this game he was thinking about kill himself and trying to trying to not do it so I started making some phone calls and I found my business manager found the best psychiatrist like he said like this guy is a wizard he's dealt with a bunch of my clients before he's helped out a lot it was very expensive so I just paid for it not to say just to life I just talked about no I mean I don't think about it that way I mean Ferrari he couldn't afford it so I was like yeah I'm sure a great option I can't afford this yeah you know he was getting by winning poker tournaments and getting the occasional commercial how long ago was this quite a few years ago I want to say like mm I don't know it was quite a few years yeah 2004 some shit like that I don't know I don't remember when it was sure but it was far enough back where Ari was really struggling as a comedian I mean he's talked about this publicly otherwise I wouldn't talk no that's why that's why I brought it up that he's talked about poker I'm not Aaron always laying right dirty right no laundry out there I love art I mean I don't know what caused it if it was that I can't stop coughing today like Mike my kids are circus fuck youngest one yeah and everyone gets it yeah um he just his career wasn't going well because he was you know was just getting the ball rolling yeah really but I really think it was the propecia don't you think it was the perfect storm maybe par pichia career yeah who knows what's gonna raise a girl and it's just this fucking perfect storm then the propecia is making you even more depressed like dude awfully not killing myself what the fuck is going on right now but anyway darhk's so he pulled out of it got off the propecia and then his career took the fuck off right he got on good medication whatever the medication his new psychiatrist got him on worked like a charm and like he was better in like a couple months a couple months he was like back to re fucking around laughing then oddly enough when it started working really well for him then his career started taking off right of course that's how it works you know a stand-up started taking off his career started taking off he became happier got off the propecia and then weaned himself off the drugs and he's good now he's good yeah nice great to see but he smokes a lot of weed and I always wonder elected that how much that is self-medicated yeah but it's okay but you smoked a ton of weed it's not self-medicating though right no I like it I just like doing it yeah you're not a doctor it makes you makes you vulnerable makes you think about shit makes you nervous makes you like makes you pop you don't just take things for granted when you get high you know what thinking about my problem is I smoked the other night but I couldn't sleep and I was think about a lot of things and then I got this thought in my head this is some weird shit man I was talking I think I was telling Callender's I hate when my when I think like this when I was in San Jose and I saw this mom with two homeless kids and then I was at the store and I was going to buy an expensive sweater and I felt so guilty so when he got cash and gave this mom a bunch of cash and she started crying I'm like fuck man and there's like this weird guy around the kids and the kid was about my my son's age about two sitting there this little girl and I thought I thought I don't know why I had this rate of thought what he grabbed her by the legs and spiked her on the ground I don't know why I know I know and then I didn't and I gave you the cash felt better because more people around like you know seeing like that having a kid and so that whole night fucked up at it and it's over reach out to Mike dude that's her side hustle she does that all the time she's actually not we've seen her like raise those kids on the street she gets picked up by her husband it's a shitty deal so I'm like eh that's fine Mike I smoked weed right and I'm laying in bed and then I had this visual someone do that to my son I'm gonna sleep I felt sick to my stomach yeah I know it's weird like sometimes we I can think if I think about a bit I think that some are good on this cool road but then if that creeps in there and then it's like it kept coming it was so visual and I was like sick to my stomach right I mean it's my son Walker at 5:00 my fucking beeline to his room and just like sweet stuff fuck em for the rest of the morning it's hard man nobody knows how much you love a person how much you can love a person until you have a kid correct one says that anyone says that you know and I'm like okay okay everyone I know you told me that Brian thought everyone told me this but then once you have a kid it's like I don't know man it's just a different animal we're now like when I see the shootings when I see you know the the nuclear war talk with North Korea and Russia I think God and I see that that that's a lot of negativity on social me and stuff like that I'm like the world is such a kind of a fucked up place if you want to look into that stuff I'm gonna have a kid I think about him like God man yeah what's it gonna be like when he's like 16 or 18 like what kind of world is gonna be when he's 18 I think too hard about it that's what I'll get depressed well I think the world's gonna be okay I mean for sure I don't mean to bring this podcast down to a bummer no no but horrible things are gonna happen no matter what correct but you know it changes who you are when you have a kid it really does you or you're a piece of shit yeah you're sociopaths Aneesa just if you're around the kid enough it changes who you are and if you're not around the kid it changes who you are because then you realize you're not around the kid that's gonna take a piece out of who you think you are but you know what if you if and we have friends who aren't great dads or whatever and you could see it in their kids I can I and I'm not some psychologist or I'm some expert in parenting but if I go to a person's house and I see the way the kids treat the parents are you you're not around enough man I can't I promise you I can tell my son doesn't act like yeah because one thing I but you can't call me whatever you want whatever you want one thing I am is at peace of a dad I know that I don't know if I'm good comic I don't know if I was good fighter I don't forget podcaster that's all up for debate one thing I know is I'm a fucking good dad man good for you man that's a it's a very very very very important quality and that quality when your kid becomes an adult that's gonna be just a major factor in how you get along you know like if you mean even parents I know friends that had bad relationships with their parents when they lived with them and then once they got out their parents were nice to them but the parents were shitty to them when they were kids and they always hold it against always they always have that shit in the back of their head like why would you a dick when I was 12 you know that that shit is always in their head it's like that avatar horse when you're young you mixed together and if you don't think together when you're young yeah and I was talking to someone a Serpas they're saying I think it's from like till they're three if you don't make that connection yeah when do I go when they're four I go I'll do it now it's almost too late because they already developed these these brain pathways we're like nope my dad's an yeah and there's really nothing in do to fix it yeah man I went to the movies just drove my kid movie we went to see the Gnomeo and Juliet oh no is it yeah what is it Sherlock gnome yeah they sure like gnomes yeah cute little movie yeah but you know we went to that cine appleís place we know you lean back you know those things yeah seats lean back good food and you take the the seat rest down and she just my 7 year old just snuggles with me Beth they're snuggling watching a movie I'm like I couldn't be happier yeah I don't want to see the stupid fucking movie no but I don't play she wants to yeah so I couldn't be happier i sat there watch this silly Noel's shit movie yeah she's just a little snuggle bunny I've watched her sauce baby nine times it's not a bad movie like a week that's pretty funny movie the boss baby's great that's the voice I watched like nine times but my son whenever watching uggles that woman when usually that's why I want a daughter that's why I'm jealous you have daughters his daughters love their dads my son I'm like you little traitor mommy mommy dude it's me every morning your cry for your mom girls are like that too in a lot of ways sometimes you got to accept the fact that the mom is not just the soft sweet woman in the house but she's also the person who made them in her body yeah the chemical mimic out of her body man there's not like I had to deal with my wife like I'm not naming any kids I go I got veto power I go but you do way more work like it's way harder to make the person I go as long as you try to call the kid applesauce or something fucking stupid yeah you know I just don't feel like it's it's not an even proposition I did it fucker yeah anyways see you know thinking about it's over time for you it is kind of crazy though that sex is how you make people I know and everybody want just wants to fuck all the time and you want to fuck a bunch of people but you don't lot of people don't want kids now hell no you know who open my eyes like in a big way in a podcast recently that's really been making me think a lot about this is Brett Weinstein he's the the professor that got in that you know the this you know he is yeah controversy with evergreen and all that and they were taking the day well that's yeah everyone it wasn't a pronoun thing was the day of absence yes they wanted all the white people to stay home he's like that's racist dicus yeah anyway he was on who said there's two different things that men are attracted to they're attracted to of a woman that they think would be a great companion and a great mother and like someone who he said there's a difference between hot and beautiful correct like some women are beautiful and like they're loving you want to be around them I goes but there's other women who are just hot and in males that very receptive woman who doesn't require any commitment was an opportunity for men to spread their seed was someone who they didn't have to be around for Wow yeah so there's literally like a programming in a man's mind so you see a girl with big giant tits and a little waist and a fat ass hanging out of her shorts and she's got sloppy makeup on and she looks at you and you're like okay let's do this that's what that is it's not like you don't live with her right you let you're not saying I would like to start a relationship with you it's like no I want to shoot my load into you and then you raise my kid when I'm nowhere near you yeah because it's an opportunity for my DNA to propagate Wow makes so much sense makes so much sense I literally never considered it until he brought it up on the podcast I went Oh duh me neither I just thought she's hot she's just hot yeah dirty in a dirty way why she's not attracted to that yeah why she's so dirty yeah I told my girl Joe I told my girl Joe probably four weeks into five weeks we're getting serious and she got this job offered go to Miami she's talked about career and stuff like that and I know that's all cool and so and no one's career first more than me however you know you're put on the search to be a mom right like you're gonna be such a beast of a mom I guarantee cuz I saw her interact with talents kids I can guarantee you you might be the greatest host in the world but you're gonna be the best mom I've ever seen and then she's like really I might I guarantee you like bam bam yeah well that's just those qualities that you can see it's something and when someone's not when someone's a bad mom it's such a depression worse so depressing to be around a woman was like really short with her kids and shitty with and like or even as a kid if I had friends who like talk back to their parents or mean to their parents like oh god what's wrong with your frost date and a girl she'd like badmouth their mom like what's wrong with you you know the hard thing is that pattern is hard to break it's hard to break those kids may very well have that same kind of behavior towards their heads like when they become adults it's a hard pattern to break sometimes you need the right person in your life like a good person in your life that you you know a wife or a husband or whoever it is you know when you match up with that person like it changes who you are too that's what I always say that one of the most important things about community like your community of friends yeah it's when you have good friends those people change you like you react like everyone is your tribe you react like everyone's your friends so you want good for them you love them you care about them they change who you are they change and they inspire you or they whether they inspire you with being smart or their kindness or their ambition whatever it is that we are not individuals we're a piece of a community always and that community even if it's a small community that you call family that piece is dependent upon who you do that piece with you might be an amazing dad with the right woman but with the wrong woman you might be so frustrated with the relationship that you're not as good at data it's wrong right now there might be chaos going on all the time you might be situations you put the kid in when you're yelling and screaming at each other the kitchen see all these different factors that are dependent upon your relationship with this other person and they change you and you change them like you might be the wrong person for them they might be super cool and calm with someone else but with you it's not a mesh if it doesn't hit buttons for the reason it's like a woman saying to you you know you don't want an equal well I don't want this yeah that I want this no I don't want this you might be right but I know for sure I don't want though you're threatened you're threatened by a strong woman know I'm threatened about you you just you're aggressive no reason who the fuck has ever said that you're threatened by a strong man it's talking about a strong man like what shut up what are you calling yourself a strong man get the fuck out of here any guy who calls himself a strong man like that strong most likely a bitch yeah most likely this is trying to wrap himself and I feel the same way about women who say that she agree women are like you know you're scared of a strong woman like okay am I really or are you a con yeah are you a conscience of raging cuz this cunt talk this sounds like us and again super uncomfortable I don't know what got us to this position but whatever I did please I'll apologize but I also feel like in in in this community of friends that was talking about if you were a shit father it would show elsewhere in your life around us or no if we're at the Comedy Store where a restaurant or in your in your social media it's gonna come out one way or another you know you know that to be in that group you know expression how you do want things how you do everything yes yeah yeah I think there's something to that I mean obviously these people that are really good at one thing and suck at other things so it's Donna it's not always a hundred percent correct but you know if you're a shitty dad you're gonna be a shitty friend mm-hmm I agree and if you're a shitty friend you probably gonna be shitting down and and I say this too with like with dudes who are shitty debt of dads it's like right if you're willing to do that to your literally you're connected this person chemically they're they're made of your DNA if you want to treat him like that when the going gets rough for me where the fuck are you gonna be right there's no way I want you my foxhole yeah yeah that's big man it's then people that don't they don't understand that they don't understand what they're doing wrong that's rough too bummer the people that can't see it you try to explain it to them and they can't see it the one thing people won't put up with those and I would never do this but if you give someone parenting advice it just doesn't it's just the certain things you can talk about usually politics religion and parenting the only way I think parenting advice works ever is if you talk about one great thing that you found that you do with your kid without criticizing another yes you can you could give them advice but not give them advice by like you could relay your personal positive experiences and either they take it or they don't but as soon as you start saying hey man I see how you talk to your son and you're like what what the fuck did you say people use a man just as your son is you know he's an individual man you treat him like he's an object fuck I don't fucking treat my son like always on get him over he's not even listen what he said dude I had my son was one and a half at the time and I was taken to this this play area and he you know he did not express himself and everyone was older and he'd hit kids and he's a big kid he's a 99% tile for size and all that stuff and he would hit kids and the the place where I was taking them in Brentwood knew I was a former fighter one of the guys who works front desk as a fan I've talked to MMA with him and they took me this sign and said you know we got a bit of a problem because Tiger is hitting kids and we think it's in direct correlation of you let him watch fights and for I just started laughing you guys are silly as fuck im a I'm never bring him back be he's one-and-a-half everyone else in there's three I mean yeah he cold-cocked that kid with a left hook and I'm proud of him he proud of it could took his toy however it's just this what kids do they hit man it's nothing to me and I tell him no I'm stay on top my helicopter the parent the fuck at him when he's in there but he's one and a half right those skis are older and trust me he's not watching UFC it's not has nothing dear things like to suicide another this lady was like that you of FC or whatever you get into oh my god this is some Brentwood shit lady there's a lot of some Brentwood shit right now alright yellow yellow meat dirt if they hit each other they hit each other we're concerned that you're constantly reaffirming his gender without him choose not we're concerned hmm some I was reading something about some lady with a three-year-old trans kid I'm like oh my god how about you sure are you not just a kid you're three oh you mean how he's into cars this week next week he's mean trolls me one chopped his dick off well they were like this article was like really super positive about it like bringing the kid to therapy and shit and aiding his transition like he's fucking three and this I just read this like two days ago it's like this is so nuts there's so much that's going on right now yeah and I want to be a transformer with us three you don't see my dad putting fucking mechanical arms on me imagine I was three arms I mean I'm 19 like what the fuck dad why am i a robot now well when you're three told you want to be a robot that's the same shit it is the same shit it's correct it's insane it's so weird it's so weird that people are just openly jumping into this and it's these weirdo super you know ideological progressive people that just they're locked into this idea that it's amazing to have a trans kid and you know the kid shows any sign whatsoever being inclining to be female or inclined to be male that they're pushing it I feel like it's actually bad out here well it's also very dangerous because they start wanting to fuck with the kids hormones like you gotta let the the child develop there's no real science and what the fuck happens when you put hormone blockers into a three-year-old and try to transition them into a girl but also the real doctors who know what the hell they're doing they're not gonna inject that kid with hormones so you say listen if you want to do this when you're 18 19 even then a little too early but nice to you when you're 21 which is against you early that and I've seen this on some of the bullshit reality TV shows i watch but these legit dogs go then I'm willing to help you out but before then get out of here no get out let's see where you're at when you're 16 there's a market for it which is a cruel thing to say and a weird way to describe him here's the problem John which they were talking about you know on the spectrum for some of those kids they do feel like they're trapped on women's body you know and I feel for them that must suck to go through high school and all that but isn't that the exception you know I'm saying like it is that kids the exception that was like so and they should have access to it how could you do that with a three-year-old I know I mean how do you know I mean you just don't and anybody says he do you're crazy people change you changed when hormones get into your body and maybe you won't be the most masculine man in the world and maybe you will turn into a woman someday maybe but give yourself a goddamn chance that just exists did you see the high school wrestler yes the girl just beaten the break in that Ben and she later just booze like a motherfucker she does I know it's not fair she should be able out to wrestle ball or he should be allowed to wrestle voice you know but you know whatever man it's crazy you're taking a high school girl and you're filling her up with testosterone with injections what it's not allowing her to wrestle girls that aren't on testosterone it's fucking cheating okay if she was just a girl and she wasn't like trying to transition into a man and they found out that she was winning the state championship as a woman or as a girl rather by taking steroids they would take it away from oh they would say she's cheating should there be an uproar but not let her wrestle yes not with a wrestling arrest at all why if they go we can't rest with the boys and well you can't rest at all well this rest of the boys or don't wrestle I would say she that's what she wants he wants rest of the boys she gonna answer the zero losers yeah I think hey if you if you're gonna choose to go that path of this transition into a female then you give up your right to wrestle because we don't have a division for that that and yet we don't have enough wrestle yeah she's transitioning to he and it's just it's not fair if it was the other way it would be more fair because like if you're a man and you're transitioning to be a woman and they make you wrestle men well you're gonna be at a disadvantage because you are taking hormone blockers or you're getting castrated you're losing your testicles you whatever whatever it is you are at a disadvantage yeah yeah that aspect yeah he's at a disadvantage now transitioning to I mean he's at a massive utage right now transitioning to a man these on steroids the gonna up the kids on stem testosterone hundred-percent and play a lot of probably a lot of it because they're trying to turn him into a man correct it's all nuts man oh like where was this 30 years ago it was it's like a silent epidemic there's everyone just I was covered and like god I feel like a woman you know there was a few of those there was like that one guy renee Richards that the tennis player that wound up transitioning he was a terrible male tennis player transitioned to a female tennis player and started dominating on us you that's Juwanna Mann it's the plot of Juwanna Mann tennis edition movie no what do you wanna do wanna man was a guy who couldn't get suspended from like the Lakers the fake Lakers in the movie so he's like god I won't play basketball so like you could make the women's team you just wore a wig and put TVs on it start dunking on bitches well that does happen today there was a guy who was ready for this 50 years old he was six foot four five played women's college basketball because he played as a man but now he's not a man anymore now this fool is a fucking this fool he's a fool he went back and you're 50 years old and you're pretending to be a college girl he'll be like I'm in a fantasy world oh this is my fantasy and she's a giant and she swatted basketballs out of people's hands this Juwanna Mann yeah see if you find the guy who played it was 50 what type in 50 year-old transsexual man transsexual plays women's college bath in America right yeah in America but here's the thing imagine if your kid is on a team with that person and that person takes your kids scholarship takes your kids oh look at that right there Oh seriously Jack Jack and Gotha dear old nose on them and became a college basketball player at fucking mind hitch the fuck out of here 52 excuse me Gabriel Ludwig 52 okay two years older than me goes to college kimchee ball I think she played as a man look at the size difference now imagine your kid is competing against her and he can't get a shot off it's just bullshit it's like if Shaquille O'Neal was playing on that other team if Shaquille O'Neal transition to be a woman and decided to go back to college this College would let her play as a woman that Shaquille O'Neal as a woman what college is that douchebag University I don't know I wanted I don't want to give him any press press makes me sick I mean that's a giant nonsense with tits it's straight nonsense it's straight nonsense this is where she good ball plays is that this is where progressiveness goes down the rabbit hole what is it mission college let's write a JUCO huh I don't know what it is but it gets it could suck it it can suck a dick well the interesting thing she played college basketball for 30 years ago as a man I said how does she still have eligibility cuz she's a woman now that's what I said but you're trying to determine they let her they let her transition and when you're transitioning you go now you're a woman you don't have a history as playing as a woman so now you're allowed to play again five more years of college ability yep do I feel like a lot more guys gonna do this there's a few that would do it a hundred percent know Dana White was joking around about that like I know a few guys if it could be a world champion they'd cut their dick off there's a few guys yes some guys who that by all means necessary it's crazy to even suggest but so is walking into YouTube shooting a bunch of people and then shooting yourself in the chest that's crazy to suggest to that people a fucking mind that bitch was definitely out of her mind and also if saw a YouTube video no wonder you've made no fucking money lady those videos were terrible well there's something wrong with that lady's brain how about her dad goes warn the police I can't you guys need to check her out she didn't do something bad do you do there's some some issues here but if you're a cop and they did find her the night before it 2:00 a.m. because she went missing they found her and they're like yeah she doesn't seem like she's gonna hurt herself or anyone else I don't know what you want us to do but we found her she said she's good sleeping in her car until someone does something it's so hard to do anything about it like they they sent that one college kid they're sending him back they found his roommates I was we were talking about it yesterday his roommates were talking about they were seriously worried about him he had bleached his hair blonde start stockpiling ammunition bought an assault gun and then the cops came to visit them and and after the cops left he went out and bought another AR and they're like okay okay that's it and there we got it we got to do something about this his roommates were freaking out like people are freaking out being around the guy and they sent him back on a technicality because he wasn't going to school because he stopped going to class so what can you do a student visa what they can do they deported him oh really yeah Oh perfect yeah and they said we think we prevented a tragedy I love that yeah that's exactly what they should do I mean however with this lady let's say they stopped at 2:00 in the morning she's in a car right and the parent and that the dad that dad who you know she she came from his seat goes listen she she she's gonna do something bad we think we've seen signs we've known her since she was a day old you guys should do somethin bout it I don't think you should go out we talk to her seems alright maybe take her in for the night you know talk to a therapist but if she doesn't do anything and then she like you people are so unpredictable to get those eyebrows in kossmann jail for that video of her doing those squats and the jumps to workout video here boy look at those eyes crazy that she's not there she was a different plant horror movie and then up but then in this she's mad she's not getting frickin revenue from the YouTube and YouTube's like your videos suck lady we have nothing do L see you crazy you didn't come up in the Open Mic circuit so you don't have a PhD in psychos all these dudes that have been in the grind like I remember I mean Mike's a long time ago but they're fucking crazy people there's a certain amount of open mike rizzo they're really funny and they can't get work and they're angry about it and they're really fucking crazy I get on kill Tony when I've been on like two three times perfect example kill tony is a perfect example you go there and you're like what in the fuck am i watching and if someone tries to tell that person like maybe you should connect more with the cross-connect man connected this is my best bits he's put your good bits and the people like what in the Tony too long guys like dude you're bombing is they were laughing their laugh and they laughing at you Antonio's they're laughing cuz you're fucking terrible and we're making faces behind egos that's laughing you know what the fuck you're talking about Tony's like get off the stage he's like make me it's like oh my god good boy mmm yeah but you see you see that too on American Idol there'd be some crazy do like my mom thinks I'm the best you know the best things Lionel Richie and then get up and dish completely bomb and then they talk shit to the experts yeah you guys just don't know what you want well you have to look at people as a whole right now if you look at people as a whole like physically right there's people that are built like you and there's people that have built like fur and Troyer that's just a fact it's just it's tough it's tough stuff it's the stairs also brilliant mine right my point is it's come on seven it's a roll the dice that's the same thing with everything it's the same thing with your mind as well it just is the mine varies widely it varies racially it varies interracially it varies age wise like you gonna have a 50 year old black guy that's the smartest guy you ever met in your life and you're gonna have a 50 year old white guy who is a fucking moron and you're gonna have a 50 year old woman who's out of her fuck mind and you're gonna have a fifty year old woman who's a brilliant you know physicist and you're gonna have everything you know every combination every combination of smart and stupid and the tall and thin people vary but they also vary with how crazy they are but also as a variable I think some people are crazy and then they find a passion they run with it maybe it's music comedy but then some of those crazy people who are different than the others in high school get made fun of get bullied and then that craziness turns into darkness I mean they get a hold of ak-47 then that's when you get the mass shootings oh yeah because there's experiences with those crazy people and maybe they turn a right direction and they do something great write great songs come up with a great bit or come up with a great TV show yeah or that person gets bullies so bad the direction they go in stark is far however isn't that crazy mine does crazy stuff yeah so a hundred percent physical abuse sexual abuse along with that medications yeah sure medications could do it and assault me every single mass shooters on medications but when you look at the combination of all the different factors it's like when you see that lady crying in her car two o'clock in the morning you're a cop you don't know what to do well what do you think you think she's gonna like I knew when I looked at her that she was gonna go onto YouTube and shoot that place up no there's no way no there's no way he's no but no let's cruise kids same thing they came to see him two years before they decided he wasn't a threat and the people like the FBI's incompetent no twenty four months later first of all he probably got fucking crazier crazy in twenty four months his mom wound up dying like six months before that so that probably fucked him up too there's probably a whole host of factors in events right but he'd never did it before how the fuck can you predict that so that these random shooters it's a I don't know what you're gonna do does the only thing with the YouTube thing is if the dad goes listen my daughter is gonna do something crazy and they find her near the YouTube Northern California offices we should at least take her in for the night talk to her and you know that's the least you're not gonna gonna lose anything taxpayers be happy to pay for a night in there you know it's all good yeah I mean I don't know if that would do it though you know it's like that lady just seemed fucking nuts man someone someone said someone posted it and said be ready to never sleep again I mean that that'd be didn't give me that much yeah theythey I went oh she's batshit crazy yeah like super duper batshit crazy that YouTube was out for cuz they she was her views were lowering when one video I thought she had 45 views I come on man as fucking announcement I'm sure they pull our YouTube pages by now Jamie yeah and if you're gonna go out right most people do to the head she shot herself in the chest that's a dark way to go other people have done that I guess people that knew their brain was gonna get yeah jr. sale did that jump self in the chest cuz he goes I want you to stay in my brain cuz it's not good fuck I can't feel good no I feel like the brain people yeah we went dark we gotta bring it back we've done dark this Punk bring it back what's let's bring it home it's bringing home with a positive thing grow that's the fight no it's talking about you want a rose hey Jamie tell um homeboys gonna watch the monitor um yeah Doug Rose it's being overshadowed yeah it is being overshadowed it's a crazy one right it's because you nobody expected it to go down the way it did in the first one you know not at all and the rematch you on is on wait she's way lighter she was 122 last week you know so she's just a few pounds away here's my problem with this fight and I'm I'm actually I might stop making pics I said on the podcast they say it doesn't make me feel good when I pick against people it doesn't make me feel good I feel like I have to do it a lot of people don't do picks and they come to me for pigs what do you think's gonna happen for a long time I thought oof Rose rose she's a monster and I know vroz right from Denver she'll and that left hook and Trevor teaches that and Pat Barry teaches that and that's exactly one to do amazing fight I bet they fight you know three or four times but if they do a rematch which they should give you on the meet at rematch Rose me a little bit of trouble because you on is a fucking machine here's the caveat to that when I see you on a do interviews and she goes it was my nutritionist it was this person it was this it was this never once says she take owned it and taking credibility oh that's not the way a world-champion speaks that's not the way at all someone talks yeah and when I see a bunch of excuse I go oh shit you have a hole in your boat and you're cut you're masking it with duct tape and you're trying to get back to this point mmm you just math you're not solved you're not actually patching that up and so you're susceptible again and now you you're talking like that never happened it was a fluke Bros is pretty fucking good and if you don't respect it again you think it's your nutritionist is why you lost that fight you're probably gonna lose again you might be right you might be wrestling i bothers me I think you honest when the greatest change is all time when the greatest fighters but it's just when I see that like oh you're just gonna you're going about the wrong way and she goes you know I even talked to Rhonda and you know she said she had a weight come like no one's dealt with losses worse than Rhonda you don't want to preface that you don't want to reference that at all right I don't want to see that out of you Anna she has so much more work to do yeah well it's all so you wanna had a long career in Muay Thai a long career you know like a lot of fights yeah done a lot of kickboxing sparring a lot of MMA sparring sometimes your chin just goes I mean this is a there's a real possibility sometimes you shouldn't just go you think it's a chin thing to I don't know yeah I don't know I think it's too early to call for that especially at that weight class I think for her it's more she just wasn't being respectful of rows I thought she's gonna walk through and all the shit talked and she was doing and Rose is a different animal she she reminds me of Brian are taking a little bit where where she's very dangerous on on conventional and the certain spot she can't train for so I she's that type of animal with similar Brian Ortega but with Johanna if the gun to my head I'll tell you on a wins by decision mmm but again I hate making picks makes me feel badly yeah making picks is tough man because you you know you're gonna piss people off and you know they're over fuckin rooting against me like that's no no you have to look at the analysis of it before the fight I thought Rose was in trouble I'm like Yoanna is very hard to take down to her stand-up is world class and I think she's she could very well pick Rose apart and you know and crackers she's coming in but when she here with that left she hit her before and hurt her but when she hit her with that left hook I was like gee explosive - she looks good man and rose like on the embedded Rose was Pat Barry takes a giant box of tennis balls and throws tennis balls at her and she's popping tennis balls in the air and she looks fucking solid and rose to her ceiling is we're just seeing it it's just so much room for girl she's so young and just Pat just Trevor around her and now forever people like you're gonna be world champion and when everyone tells coaches tell fighters all the time but when actually happen you go oh shit yeah they're not bullshitting they're not just saying this and I think it when you check she believes it now you're dealing with different thug rows you're dealing with different Johanna Johanna doesn't think she's the greatest gift to the MMA world so that kind of combination such a fascinating fight and no one's talking about it yeah well everyone is so caught up in this cancellation and the ferguson kabhi fight was so huge for the hardcores for sure but it's also one of those things where with Rose coming into this fight now and you want to make an excuses for the last fight you know I'm really interested to see like what happens when they square off I can't wait for the left on each other is Jana gonna do the same talking again and Rosie reciting the Bible I don't think she can I don't think I don't think you wanna can do the same talking you don't you don't think she goes this was a fluke I'm doing the exact same thing no I think Rose gonna stare right through her fucking soul like I'm the champion when you talk a gang of shit at someone and they just stare right through you and then they murk you in the first round it's very tough that shit the second time it's gonna be interesting I think that's a sign if you're on it isn't respecting rose again if she gets up there and start talking that shit I would put a ton of money on Rose yeah yeah if I see her doing the same things oh shit you learn nothing girl nothing well it's whether or not Rose can clipper again if Rose charges in and clips or again it's also the thing about a striker always worried about being taken down is more likely to get hit with a shot yeah like Kevin Randleman when he knocked out Mirko Cro Cop correct same thing like Kevin was the threat as a wrestler leaps in with a left hook and catches him right on a chin knocks him the fuck out I think there's a there's real correlation there I wouldn't be surprised if you're honest so focus on improving her stand-up and you know it's like Iook at this time she can overwhelm her stand up she gets submitted she overlooked the submission game of Rose which is actually Rose's best weapon that's what I was thinking I was thinking bro tweets we might see Rose threw a flying arm correct you might see Rose different wild shit doesn't care about B on her back no no and she's fast she she goes for shit she like she's a wild explosive person you know and she's a really interesting thinker too you know she had a tough life man yeah tough life grow and and develop this very strong mind because controlled chaos is what I thought she's brilliant at yeah I think what else about fascinating about this not that fight death I'm more almost more excite for that fight than anything now but what's fascinating to me is everyone talked about Conor McGregor right especially when you talk about 155 and with Conor and max Holloway Connors never looked back when a fight that guy backed even though I'm betterment the thing that gets Connor out of bed I think is the challenge and making history I think if khabib or max were to win that would be a new challenge and he'd be an underdog against could be man will knock Holloway the FC have a history at 55 especially if could be were to win I think we see Connor take that fight now because he goes that's how I found great well I'm the best at moving backwards hitting dudes I bet you I can beat that guy and we see him I think we see him take that fight hmm and I've never said that before I've always I know Dana said oh they're gonna fight in Russia I'm like honor fighting him and then I think I'm like we think of all the challenges in comics career and what gets him going it's not people behind him it's always when people that guy's the best he was cool give me that guy very similar max Holloway hmm yeah if max wins for sure they have a rematch 100 100 percent the thing about khabib is you go he's got a wonder who's avoiding him there's a difference there everybody yeah see the difference is Max is one of the best fighters on the planet no doubt he's one of my top one of my top guys maybe where he's ever top featherweight of all time but people aren't avoiding him no it's like I said cubes a different era the era fine guys have referenced this I said I said if you gave me a choice to make the walk against Francis or could I'm picking Francis because it's a quick death ahead in the third row but it's quick khabib it's like an Isis video it's gonna be long drawn-out it's me a fucking nightmare that you're not gonna forget yeah he's gonna be your body into a poem but it the worst is he breaks you where it's like oh you were gonna do this and people thought you were mentally strong watch this now your entire family and friends gonna see how much of a pussy you are as I bash your brains in round after round after round after round you see him break guys too though you see like this something happens to them when they just they give in to the inevitability of getting rag doll he's just better yeah oh the only person that's gonna beat him it's not a person it's a fucking grizzly bear you know it's like fuck this man and you see it see to their eyes we're just changes we're just like no not happening how many rounds four four more rounds of this this is terrible if he wins and he beats Holloway I guarantee you he's calling out McGregor Tyrell he wants the GSP fight khabib wants GSP holy shit that's what I hear whoa that's the set 170 hmm whoa what a great fight right it's a perfect time to do it right now right GSP wins by rear naked choke against Bisping at 185 says he doesn't want to fight at 85 again here take your belt suck it yes yes PA just go suck it good take you I know I told you I'd fight they're soft I'm just gonna do it fuck I made a couple million bucks drew I'm gonna kick back for a while and now you get party Deepu oh you fancy yourself a grappler jazz pea me too let's party that's a really interest you know if I can make a super fight if I was like Dana scrooge mcduck there sit on top all these gold coins I call it been asking like yo any interest in fighting could be but 170 fuck yes fuck whatever that's what I'm talking yes that's the fire boy boy I'm gonna tell you talks like calls we called your boy debuck you girl I don't call him but I'm sure you could kill him this weekend I want to talk to him this weekend that would be the fight but you know the one who tried to get one here's the thing would have been aspirin wins he starts talking shit calling Dana Murphy fuck perfect egghead it sells paper ease it's the bottom line yeah but then you've ruined could be I've been asking could be I think you give Ben Askren a guy who's a good fighter GSP well yeah but seeing it most people don't know who Ben Askren is the problem is he fought in Bellator for so long and then even when Bellator has gotten bigger on Spike TV he was off in one Fc which you have known we are huge Ben Askren fans now but we're hardcore like the the casual fan has no idea like who's this guy with the curly hair they're sending to his death but we can sell it because he speaks well he's about beast on the mind yeah and then you pin ever gets hit an Olympian yeah he's never who's on if he had never been hit against right khabib yeah and we call it the cold why thinking the UFC particularly me well I'm a Big Ben Askren dick rider and Jimmy Smith who's also a Big Ben Askren dick and we're all dick right we're on this riders we could sell the shit out of it I could hype the shit out of it--and to be a hundred percent honest in the process I think he's something special I think his grappling is very unusual very difficult to prepare for and if you're gonna deal with khabib against a guy who can neutralize his stuff and then we see like what if we see khabib on his back Ben Askren fucking with a knee across the belly punching khabib in the face well like nah right just doing the ground in pound all right there's these straight crazy up scrambles and grappling community seem like it would be amazed as terrible striking good luck selling that to uncle Dana a foot off of a fuck you he's gonna slam that phone down fuck you he would have to have he's like sir I'm trying to finalize CM Punk Floyd here an aspirin to beep how dare you he would have to have a good relationship with Ben Askren they would have no he does not ease I disagree he doesn't know he can go alright I make money off this kid I have four and fifty million dollars they make money off this kid let me do this don't you think you'd have to put Ben Askren in the UFC fight though against some money to show everybody what he's capable of hope he has all those belts undefeated Olympian we just promo the shit with he's on embedded he's on you see at night he's blow the bellies on JRE we go on this campaign he's dressed and they'll kick flag watch me beat the shit on the power pound great Russian who else not like Russia yeah great whoo I like it it's never happening probably that's never happening no but you sold me thank you just get Dan to listen to this video Dana uncle D if you just have him fight someone who's really good like a Neil Magny or Carlos Condit have him up like fucking kobayashi toss that introduction fight and who knows nope this is a one-shot Hail Mary we're selling the fuck out of it girls Connor and just like rape some hump some four three rounds people that's sucked man I know but he probably won't be able to like khabib so you gotta watch that one we missed the his style is so much more suited to one Fc because they allow those knees to the head on the ground true soccer kicks and what they still have soccer kicks in when I see did they stop it after Brandon Vera like almost executed dude I thought maybe I think they still do it how about the Roger worked oh my god sure work - go ahead kick by that timeout Roger worthless fighting Ben Henderson this weekend and that was flying under the radar yeah it is flying under the weight well it's like you know Huerta was the first-ever MMA fighter on the cover of Sports Illustrated he forgot you know people forgot that back in the day was his like 2002 ish three-ish oh yeah he was coming right before that I forget - he beat then he's supposed to fight Kenny Florian if you remember and you're the front cover what year was that 2001 for 2005 no laying that 2006 John six six was it say oh yeah here's the head kick mmm so the dude is he's already beaten them here Agdal some horses down and look at this this is horrible blow I mean that was one of the worst head kicks you'll ever see that was horrible that's yeah I don't want to see that I don't want that unless yeah that's horrible that one's horrible like that guy was he was already hurt and out of it before that well the average casual adult soccer player can kick a ball with a thousand foot pound the average professional soccer player can kick at about 1,200 foot pound force my educated guess is elite highly trained martial arts perform very similar to the professionals hardwood I'll tell you what you put somebody down their hands and knees and I kick him in the head like that it's gonna be a lot more than that they're fucked well he might grow and kill we got you know you don't want to see that you could you could kill somebody yeah than that you literally could snap their neck there's no doubt about it when was that Sports Illustrated cover though Jamie because you might object we're toast rated I want to and it says his MO is the UFC the next emerging sport or is it just a fad or something like that I want to say 2006 - I'm six I think it's post its post tough yeah it's opposed Stephan Bonnar force grande agree that was 2005 yes seven maybe seven remember Roger worked he got all that notoriety and then he tried big dick in the UFC well no I want this this and this they went cool we're gonna sit you and then give you the worst matchup possible here's gray Mannion yeah may 28 2006 so we were in the neighborhood yeah so this was you know Roger worth it was like the poster boy handsome Hispanic Latino bad motherfucker never watch her were to beat that dude up that punched a chick in the face like a goddamn monster he's a big football player player sucker-punched a girl in the face in front of everybody dropped her and then Roger worked it takes his shirt off and fucks this dude up there's a scramble you see the dudes squaring off Rogers waist more than I'm cut to a few seconds later see Roger soccer kicking him here it is so Roger is standing back here and this guy steps into this girl TMZ son did you show the first beginning of it it's a long video anyone yeah but the beginning of his when he steps in and punches the girl on the face alright won't drops the girl go to right to the beginning knocks a girl out right to the beginning so the guy loved the guy look orange shirt big ass dude drops girl female face look weird uh look at him yeah good luck calling backwards talking shit he's saying that's a girl man he's so much smaller this guy's like fuck you I'll fuck you up - work - always had to get fashion to some other than out there there's another video that's we hear more volume when I'm talking to each other this might be the only one I've ever seen oh there goes work - takes his shirt off and he's pear guy who a girl Roger worked took this shirt off here we go that guy had some titties with a Suraj it chases him down well Roger was fast as fuck - hello yeah no idea what he's doing he was a new animal that before he knew that dudes getting punched in the face and at the end you see Rogers got the do to ground I could kick it him no it's like it's like jumping it into the water and there's a pocket I'll in there before you know it look at Roger boom he's out cold you know and that's justice isn't it it was a sea yeah he's making a Mexican Batman there if he kept kicking him it have been justice I mean it was justice for sure but fuck that guy I know some guys sucker punching your daughter big giant 250 pound football player sucker punches until they said be heard not kill very hard not super is very lucky he's alive yeah very lucky is alive and you probably shouldn't be if he doesn't feel remorse for that sucker punching a girl in the face like dr. Carl it's a special kind of piece of shit big dude - it's a giant dude yeah I mean who knows what the fuck was going on in his head but and then again who knows what the fuck is going on with a lot of football players that have suffered a lot of head trauma true or he could just be a bad guy that could be a bad guy maybe it's raised around that thinks it's okay maybe who knows what the girls either way never okay to hit a girl fuck like that - its that's a horror like that watch it's a horrible thing to watch a scalpel that guy punching a guy like you is horrible but punching a girl in the face poor woman there's a lot of fuckin shitty humans out there man it's a real unfortunate part about us we keep going dark it's tough not to you want something like that but the Roger rock just say today he did man superhero style I bet that guy's a bit his friends like we're in that time yet by Roger worked uh the taste I mean about 155 pounds and your giant ass is all juiced up in the goddamn weight room every day and you still got knocked out for hitting a girl remember that asshole yeah every day I ever lives that down nope even now cuz I'm sure people will find him on Instagram by ke Rogan shot were talking mad shit about you man you know that well I'm never gonna live it down if he never went to jail for that that's the punishment correct you never went to jail for that do you supposed to go to jail for that yeah that's supposed to put you in jail for a long time and hopefully he doesn't have kids what else is on this card this weekend yet she has a independence that's a fun one everybody's dead you've slept on that fight I know it's another one that's gone under the radar I know Jessa it's very interesting man yes a man he fucking submitted but neil darish he gets your back your fucks ville remember he got submitted by Kevin Lee he did but he didn't he didn't he didn't get submitted the referee stopped it I know but I'm saying he was good look he he was tightening up his neck you gotta let the guy go out come on brother 100% he was done Felder Iaquinta wit kicks it off whoa dude cater did you see you remember cater fighting Impostors he's a monster Calvin cater and mic on oh that's a good fight to you look at the undercard you got bored you got Joe lausanne going around on quarter Calvin cater and I not to annoy Connor great sight that's a great that's fight fight of the night written all over it yeah all over god there's fuckin five excellent fights on that that main guard like your boy fleas hit are luckier girl fleas hearing yeah a ver versus Carolina yes olena kaval kovitch and then I'm not even mad at the the fight pass fight I mean when your boy Bruce Lee or Irish Arlo Bob who's off the team Connor and then team khabib saw each other they got into it do you think you know the team Connor and then the team could beeps got really into it cuz Jimmy asked for Connor when Tony fell out and Dana was like come on let's get real yeah you can't put that you're a better shot offenses I read there's video supposedly of calling him a coward and like he was calling him out to say it to his face oh wow another ghost good good luck was that from for Dagestan this is Dagestan right yeah you know any people he must have seen get killed shit never come out off like mentally he's a completely different space goddamn Mike Kim being color that's like why they have Mike Rodriguez whites Mike in black and white white dad is this kind of bullshit what is this bullshit they didn't allow them to flex goddamn my condoms out here's the fucking regular Russell shorts on that you get in gym class fuck Mike oh man Oh Joel Oh Zhaan's on the car too Mike slow Mike rubbery that's not a great nickname don't slow Mike that's not good that's a trick it's fast so fast it can't get him a colored picture um light heavyweight look at that one 205 and 192 what is that what's that shit this eyes out real wait it's real always on 192 one of them's 205 ones 192 that doesn't make any sense like unless they're fighting at 85 and they caught them before the wake that makes zero that makes zero sense one guy's 13 pounds heavier what weight class they fighting I mean no I know that's that's light heavyweight but what is Mike Mike Rodriguez with strange name for but black guy last name Mike Rodriguez the Cuban maybe names Mike go slow mo Mike but if he just fortunate he had a picture cuz usually this throw up a shadow if they don't have it this time you know what you're not gonna shadow we're gonna backlight for ya we're gonna let people know that you haven't really fought the UFC before it's not give you up but we're still getting pictures what do you think about chiesa and pedis ah man Pettis right it's just bad streak he's on a rough streak he won his last one right but then him fighting at 45 whoever told him do that's insane let's out holla we got his belt but I'm a Kevin Lee fan but I say he did not submit Michael yes your own age should have let him they should have let him go out and he would have won but they didn't and he didn't okay so all were in the same boat however if it would have kept going on he'd been choked unconscious maybe not maybe not better jujitsu made you long night no yes is like Hickson Gracie Hicks and Gracie let's black belts take his back full rear naked choke and said go ahead I know crazy right to children let's that's that's you know you know what Gracie were talking to take some pics that's a I love chisa that's a far cry Rickson Gracie but and also he went to go tap if you look at the video you look the better he he panics a little bit and now he's a he's a black belt I think he said he knows looks like he's doing he was going concentrating on his neck if you hear him talk about it that he tightened he put all his focus on his neck and let his hands go it's just tight yeah oh yeah you have Kevin Lee who's a fucking anaconda around your neck and has previous wins of rear naked chicks I don't buy it I agree with you they should have let it go on I think we've been choked unconscious got to let it go on you have to gotta let it go on the only were stress I've seen was the ref in the Joseph Parker fight I didn't send a judgment the ref would not fucking let these guys fight any timing we got close he jumping they don't push him away hmm who do you think that favored they I think they thought I was gonna favor Anthea Joshua for sure they want him to win but actually favored yeah yeah well yeah you agree with the decision yes Parker definitely lost but I don't agree where people are like Oh aunty Josh looked bad enough night no no you morons the in Paulie mentioned this the distance they fought in such a high level no one got hit and Parker's such a good boxer his jab is so goddamn good it was just a battle of straight skill man and I thought it was so impressive and people walk away from him going man I think Joshua's not that good I went man he's better than I thought he can box way better than I thought well it's cuz you understand fire yeah the people that say what's not that good because he didn't win by spectacular knocking yes like Deonte Wow wow that's a that's interesting the wilder fight is very interesting cuz Wilder talks at other shit he's exciting he's brash he's got serious knockout pound crazy he and he's fun to watch man and he's like a brash American you know that's a great great fight only gonna do that is while there have to fight somebody first it sounds like Joshua's gonna fight someone else in wild he'll fight someone why are they doing that that's so stupid so stupid up Oksana's yeah it's so stupid well they build it up to make this big giant event and when it comes off link look it comes off it comes off like Pacquiao vs. Mayweather it's giant it's the number one problem with boxing give us some matchups everyone wants to see that's why the UFC gained so much ground right because usually damn besides asking could be usually when there's a fight Dana goes boom there you go super you want to CCPD see boom there you go Colorado boom there you go yeah so we get all this Connor at the Opera there you go so we hit these super fights in boxing like no no that listen we want to do this and this guy's the mandatory I manage this guy in this guy's PBC box and Sky's Showtime so you saw this red tape it'd be a phenomenal fight it'd be a phenomenal fight phenomenal fight it's gonna happen I think it happens I don't have haven't done to this year but I just can't believe triple G and Canelo are not gonna fight that's a fuck I felt like it's not even I mean what is today day you say April 5th it's a month or woman oh they have any of them they haven't even put the the hearing together the hearing is like what the 18 there's some Cannella backed out why did he back out I just don't think I think he knew the odds were against him and backed out and then you know triple G still planning on fighting May 5th Wow he's still gonna fight and I was hoping fizzy I'm fine I'd love it if he fought Billy Joe Saunders but Joe Saunders can't fight till June so by rooting because he has he's coming off a hand injury but he's like I'm ready in June let's do it in June if I'm Caniff I'm triple G I'm not fighting May 5th you're gonna sell 30 pay-per-views when Canelo drops out whoever they replaced with it's not gonna be a huge name I'm sure it's gonna be a tough guy it's gonna be a worthy opponent somebody tough you know it's not gonna make you Bank you make Bank off your pay-per-view you know just fighting June fight fight fucking Billy Joe Saunders in June for us yeah but the problem is they don't have the date in June when you look at a venue like the T Bommel arena in Vegas that motherfucker is booked out for you a in advance yeah except for the Mayweather on McGregor fight and Mayweather McGregor fight they found an opening I said let's do it cuz now you're doing the boxing commission yeah hey yo ice cubes basketball league had a book like he was basketball league how much did a league I heard six million really that six pounder and then they but it's three on three basketball for so IceCube get the fuck out the way I'll watch three on three at the rack I'm not trying to see these old basketball players play three on three get the fuck out so we can watch carniverous Floyd that's basketball this is three on three League have a bunch of old like college players and some old NBA players and they play a three-on-three half-court game put it on TV it was like done every week in a different City and like at a four point shot it's like if they had a masters leak and you could only use your left jab that's what it's like in the fucking sons of bitches karate is back new world full contact karate combat league kicks off is this with bas Rutten just announced today yeah yeah bas Rutten is the commentator commentator he's coming on he might have something to do with the organization - boss is coming on next week to talk about it Gua poll in the house i love both i love boss - they playing a pit or they fight rather in a pit this is a shape it's like Sam Pinkett it look at it see it all broke Chuck Norris did this shit yeah that's the way to go man oh yeah worked out great for Chuck look what didn't work out great he had a lot of successful shows have a fight with karate pants on - it looks like so they're fighting with little gloves on but they're wearing karate pants it's gonna be in the Olympics not this exact thing but cries and limb picks for the next use in the Olympics I'll tell you right now all these vibes better pray to God Wonder Boy didn't get a feather up his ass decide to join this sleep or Raymond Daniel sir yes world-class guys now can you kick to the legs you better be able to kick to the legs you can fuck it for sure fine a sand pit though they should fight in a basketball court okay stop that we can't I can't stop fighting a basketball court period don't let me get too close to the fans lunch to cook the rounds of three rounds three minutes offensive techniques scored more highly than counter strikes this is karate is back approximately 50 million Americans have participated in karate at some point in their lives and then I got a yes stop and I grew the fuck up then I realized oh I'm not learning shit that John Claude did in movies and this isn't fun anymore yeah when someone says that karate approximately fifty million Americans have participated in karate at some point they're like yeah little kids taking fucking karate classes my seven year olds awesome out correct yeah that's great of the yellow duck out of here the problem with karate is we already know about MMA and we already know about more time but in jiu-jitsu what I do like is if they're allowed leg kicks and they have those small gloves on it's basically like MMA fight but also it's all standing but also then I can allow like it's God I got a lot of leg kicks that's a huge fuck up they know a lot like kick these postures to Compton he's in now you know it's promoter I don't know I'm we're gonna find out next week but I would have I would hope that they allow leg kicks I don't even like that glory doesn't allow elbows I agree I think that's the sport the sport is if you're gonna stand up it should be more time I mean that to me is the sport the rules of moita you could throw a wheel kicks in more time you get through a fly-in sidekicks you do it fuck you want but you also can do MoIT I like lease the body elbows to the face all those super effective close-range techniques that glory doesn't allow but I think they're worried about what the elbows guys aren't gonna be able to fight you know close together because they'll go to the cuts however I'd rather deal with that than not allow it well I don't like the guys fighting close together I think that's super dangerous I think you ever done it but when you have guys fight more than one time in a night I think that is fucking crazy when you have guys fight two three times a night like Joe Schilling did in the LA Last Man Standing event that is bananas but you are you're taking a giant chance you're hoping that someone doesn't get severely concussed even in a win in their first fight and then come back and fight this and that make it fun though like that's kind of the nature of the game like what about wrestling the n-c-double-a s those guys wrestle getting head kicked the cutting massive way they are cutting massive weight but they're not getting head kicked gettin gettin head kicked in the first round and getting up at the count of seven and then finally and then fighting and then it's not getting ked kicked again an hour later it's nuts craigory it's crazy I just don't like it just in all so you don't get the best guy versus the best guy in an even situation right like if one guy wins by first-round knockout the other guy has a four-round war like Joe showing doing fallout Simon Marcus anything crazy fight they go to three rounds it's a draw they go to the third and Joe had been knocked down I think in the first and then Joe starched him in the fourth isn't that kind of cool if you know the sport you like damn like help these guys just get through this they've dealt with this and now it's kind of cool but but we know the repercussions most people don't right well then the UFC should bring back a tournament to then I'm not mad at that the Pride tournaments it's so old-school yeah it's and people are pregnant a dyke is getting so good now but that's what you sign up for with the problem as if one guy goes through three rounds of hell and the other guy just lands like a connor straight left hand they did on aldo and wins in 13 seconds it's not fair I know and you know but however that guy pulled off that 13 second knock out another guy had a war it's true it's true it's true it's true I mean glory is the only organization right now that's mainstream where you could watch guys fight more than once of the night I do it all the time here's the point why do UFC is never gonna do it most sports won't do it it's hard to say it's a long show B it's hard to market that it shouldn't be sanctioned no yeah there's a reason why yeah you're you're in the right here there's a real why it's not i play devil's advocate but the reason why it's not is because the mass isn't like what I said we're just saw me kick in the face fighting again they sanction it for kickboxing but they don't sanction that for MMA isn't that weird because like last-man-standing was in LA we saw that at the Hakan forum that was uh that was right here the whole the whole rules are without the judge and we've talked about this before and that's why I was so intrigued about the 21st some fight and this is why I did stand-up at this San Jose improv and in the front row and I didn't know they're gonna be there was all of t make a John Fitch Thompson stuff like that and after the show sewn in front of them asked me fertilis before first and drop there went Ferguson could be who's gonna win and I I it was a toss-up for me but because I thought Tony was gonna do work off his back where I was gonna land crazy amount of elbows and fucked up kabhi face but because Kobe was on top he'd get the win via decision and I said the losers are gonna be the judges because they don't know how to judge that fight and say that from the aka team was awkward depends upon how it plays out but if it plays out the way you described it yeah if Tony is landing big shots from the bottom submission threats elbows his face getting bloody but khabib 'he's doing work at the top but Tony still threatened elbows elbows like fucking them up it's possible but if could be Moslem it should be real clear we see that now and that is us that's a sin against humanity well that says we'll never see it he said he said crazy shit like John Jones never be in the main event again he said off your easy shit true he says this pushing it's a title shot than someone else does yeah I think he's emotional he's upset I'd be pissed too but also too much money he's missed out on something that that'd be if they tried to give me the fifth time try and promote this it's not so really this is the fourth they've dropped out and fourth they try to make this fight that's in Sean Shelby and Joe SIL was trying to make this fight before he retired the one fight you want to make never happen so if you're Dana like hold up how much money have we put in marketing to these Fox and it just doesn't happen for us we're doubt it does happen you got to do it you know you said that you didn't believe it was gonna happen until you saw the door bolt and they're standing next to each other yeah yeah you're right it's such a shame uh-uh you're the first person I text when I saw to return about how sad of AP bomber but this is the next best thing no the next best thing is Connor this is the next best Nexus the next you this the next best thing on the six days notice yeah you would never get Connor on six days no it's a button but if Connor would if Connor was scheduled to fight see the thing about it Connor at this stage is there's no tuned up fights it's there's never it's never gonna happen again no like every fight is just giant they'll only fight where where would be a level playing field would be Nate Diaz cuz he's been out just as long so you're both gonna but you have a little bit of ring rest you're both gonna be out for a long time you're both going through the same thing you finally got like Kabhi do you think they offered it to Nate who do you think they offer it to we know they offered it to the Ortega Ortega Eddie Alvarez and Alvarez had no right yeah why do you say no I'm not sure oh yeah he's one night he's been doing it too long I'm not making that Sun he said I'm all of one name imagine losing 35 fuckin pounds now how much and if you know please say it for everyone how much you think they paid max Holloway to take this fight six day notice they go bro we know your champ at 145 here's the offer cuz no way we're just giving you this much all I know is what Eddie told me on the podcast about Tony you said he was gonna make millions so if that's what we know we gotta assume there's a big paycheck in it for max Holloway I told Brian goes how much you think he's in pain I said if I'm max I don't take that fight for under 4 million I know they're in a tough position and they need a big name and they're trying to recoup the pay-per-views so I got them back in the corner I'm on the longest win streak I'm saying 4 million or bust whoo you're a bold man I take two two after taxes yeah that's not worth it I need a million for every day so six days so you know you know max can submit people but we don't anticipate him submitting khabib it just it seems like Kabir aplans on a higher level than max it seems like the way max can win this fight is by pacing because max is even if max is not in shape he's in phenomenal shape I mean he's just he's got an incredible cardio base and he really knows how to pace himself very well pacing if it's more of a fight and if it's at his tempo yeah beep ghosts watch your tempo and just throws in a blender yeah he's so and it's a six day notice and it's a max who's taking time off spend time with his family so all the chips just stacked against max all of it and it's a weight class above his weight class it's khabib who's a huge 155 it's arguably the best grappler in the UFC and the other promise he really does entertain the stand up game so your chance of the 1 a home run shot it's even dropped even lower that's why I'm saying for me did you hear what he said about it he said thank you for taking fight I don't think you'll ever be the same again oh so that FAFSA I don't think that'd be the same again and he's probably not lined that's a hard thing to say - not just you'll never be the same again ah my heart did we might say I hope he's wrong and you know what you know I do if I was in Max's corner and if it's like halfway through that second round and I'm like damn max looks exhausted keys not in shape he's just taking a beating he's so tough he's probably last five rounds I thrown that towel I'm gonna take all the shit for that from the fans because I don't want max dealing with this because this isn't this isn't his fight to be honest this isn't his fight this isn't his path he's gonna make four million hopefully he's gonna be set for life fine answer if he's smart with his money however this isn't his path we did this to help out the UFC he made Bank here's the towel fuck you I know you're in hate me max we'll talk in Hawaii over ball of you tuna that's not a bad idea yeah well if we know we I think with a could be fight one of the things is after the first round you kind of know how it's gonna go well know and split the thing to format suit if he had 12 weeks he's a phenomenal shape and he gets taken down all a kind of Chad Mendes Conor McGregor when targeting down rock it's just a matter of time where Mount amount of time we're gonna catch him but with this khabib 'he's in better shape he's at more time he's preparing for a guy who's insane cardio shape so it's just the odds are so fucked for max crazy crazy really crazy dressed as I'll explain it myself I'm stressed though interesting interesting man it's gonna be a good one so we were talking before let's wrap this up but before talking before this we want to do a fight companion but there's no fights that we're all around for a fight companion so let's let's do a fight companion get all the boys in
