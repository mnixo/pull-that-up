the girag an experience please talk about this know I could talk about this absolutely okay I think I can other smooshy there I mean if you want to go if you want to back things up did that man how fucked is that picture the walrus is sitting on a concrete floor with a with her arm through it's a her right yeah with her arm through a fucking prison cage that's so dark man so the story of smooshy is you know she come in from like wild-caught 18 months of age 200 pounds she's this big she's a big pillow beautiful Amy she's baby she's not couldn't come in alone she comes with some other animals walruses where they catch from Russia in the Black Sea so she comes in and we start yeah now we got to get blood from we got to see if these animals are healthy so the way you do it with an untrained animal you throw a big net on him physically jump grab them that sticks a needle in there vet or train or someone and they go to take the blood out well during this procedure there was another walrus there that we were doing the procedure on and here's smooshy who's you know climbing up on the other walrus it's making things very difficult you might as you can imagine these guys are like linebackers so all I do is I put my hands in front of her face like this and she opened up her nostrils and I I remember this vividly she took a big breath she started to follow me after that I started to back up this animal followed me big eyes staring at me following me I'd never seen anything like this before I thought it was like this is gonna be just a one-time thing she's just following me because this just made her nervous what had happened that 18 months of age and that that specific time was I had imprinted on her that's what happens in the wild you're a mother walrus you you shut out a calf that animals gonna tap to to its brain your smell your sight the sound everything so that you can be identified in you know heard of hundreds this happened that 18 months of age so she imprinted on you just i'ma shoot her you imprinted on her because she was panicking I think it has to have been it was at that moment no question because I noticed a baby while this is all going down and you can imagine the stress of being caught only maybe months before yeah separated from your mother or witnessing your mother died in arms Jesus Christ so this happens to this animal I am printed on her this is this is an anomaly this doesn't happen this isn't hey here's food we're like best friends now great this is you're my mommy that's the relationship we have it's crazy Wow yeah that's intense so then when you start factoring in the fact that she's in the pool with a lot of crazy chlorine values and she's getting chemical burns and everything else and I'm like so you almost have a paternal relationship with this water definitely have definitely have a paternal orders that's crazy and all because of the fact they're not cleaning the water she's getting sick well there's more than that well she come in at two thousand four so she's probably 10 a little over ten years old now this relationship also turned into created some problems it manifested in like you know physical manifestations of stress she developed this uncontrollable regurgitating issue where she doesn't keep her fish now she pukes it up and it's from anxiety from separation anxiety I'm fast-forwarding a bit from that moment of the imprint to now or well it's a prior to now of course so there was there was a lot of challenges that that relationship posed so you try to train well so I developed this this system where the animal consumes fish and thereafter consumed jello I would teach her to eat the jello and play with the jello so try to keep her from throwing up the nutrients that are keeping her from gaining weight and being healthy right so I tried to train all the other people on this you know tried to wean myself out a number of times but again so the relationship was a blessing in the fact that this is this is amazing this is crazy and it was also and more so now like an absolute curse because giving a shit about an animal in that at that level like what you're saying that the parental relationship that bond that's tough man like to see what she's going through and you start realizing like I don't know what I can do to save her because she's gonna die
