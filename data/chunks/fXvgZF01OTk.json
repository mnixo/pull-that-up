five four three two one the first man to smoke marijuana never really smoked it he inhaled it it was a Chinese man he was a very great man and whenever he lit the the plant it wasn't to get high but he would start to get high and every time he got high a bluebird would come to him and tell him to conquer his neighbouring neighborhoods and he listened to those two the burden that's exactly what he did and he became a great emperor in China at that point the story Pablo Escobar was his doctor and he goes have you ever been to Disneyland and the doctor was not Pablo I have a penis very clean very organized whoa that's it but it's a truth first together never got I was a Chinese dude that burnt the plant because he liked the smell of the plant and gave him a soothing but after the days of doing it it packed up in his body and he started hallucinating he saw a blue bird a blue bird came to him and told him that he had to conquer the neighborhoods within the region what a crazy bird he got high and a bird started talking to him what do you do you know I don't know if this is true but this is one of the things that uh the pot aficionados always used to say is that you know when priest walks down the aisle and they have that the thing that they swing and there's burning incense inside of it I used to be weed that's what they used to do what I don't know at one point I believe it was we then it became that that Batman shot at the Green Hornet it was like pedophile smoke you you wake up your shirts bomb back with this your pants are missing well the wooded what is it now what kind of incense is it now smoke I go in there to church every once in a while yeah you have to go for the full effect one like the 5:00 in the afternoon Saturday and the early morning Sunday they don't break out the incense mmm they don't start breaking out the  my lugia somehow my melon candle and the guy comes out and when guy comes out throwing water jesus and then the other guy it's so weird how somebody made a great point on Twitter their day and they said you mean Mitch Hedberg if there's five of us that delivered newspapers there's five no  the delivered newspapers you Hedberg didn't yeah you delivered them in a car to other places I was an asshole it took a route but not the route in my neighborhood the route in the neighborhood over so I had to beat the kids there before they get there and steal the papers I would deliver him right to the doors oh you did - yeah yeah and then you collected yeah I collected from only a handful of people most people were on like a monthly subscription plan they were switching over but the people that you'd have to collect from yeah like this envelope like at an envelope and you had to like mark off like you know when they owed things I barely remember it because it was only a couple to clients and after a while I kind of got away from doing them I said I don't want to do these people that have because it's too hard to collect it's annoying like I don't want to I don't want to have to go that was my specialty I didn't like I must have been that was when I first got a Catholic school and my mom gave me an option that I had to go up to and work in the afternoon was only I gotta figure something out I just don't want to go up there anymore and my friend said I'm giving up my newspaper route but he didn't give up the one in my name about it he gave up the one in the next city over the next town over that City I could still walk today so I'd have to leave school right over there because I'm not to do to steal my papers and sell them as their own on the street corners so I'd have to get them put the circulars in put them in a thing and then throw them on people's balcony and around Fridays and Saturdays I have to go back with a ring after dinner and collect are you doing mr. Rogan I'm here to pick up 75 cents and they give you like a dollar 50 that was your tip right and you got like 22 cents a week for delivering the paper did you collect from everybody I collected from everybody I was this efficient what years with these this has to be 73 74 75 yes I guess when I started doing it is when I started driving which had been like 83 I probably started 83 I probably started when I was 17 no that was 85 85 probably then I was when I probably started doing it you're too old to be collected I wouldn't be either well wasn't even that it was just annoying like what you wanted to do was go to the depot pick up the papers chuck them into the people's driveways and that's it and then there was a few people that wanted it inside the door so you'd have to get out of your car open up their screen door put it in there and then leave and the idea was that those people everybody would say those people tape you better those two Delta P Bennett Miller okay and so we would only have like a few of those and I think after the first couple of years they stopped doing those kind of collections or I definitely stopped doing them but it was an awesome job when you're like a young comic or you know even before I was a comic when I was fighting it was just I didn't have to do anything where someone was telling me what to do I could get my car I could listen to whatever I wanted to I listen to Charles Lockwood era he had the the morning the big mattress on I think it was bcn I'm pretty sure his BW bcn in Boston this is awesome radio show I listened to that Chuck newspapers out windows I do that for like three hours every day you know it was the best job ever because then I would make enough money or I could pay my bills but I still had all the time in the world you stand up all the time the world trained all the time in the world do anything but it definitely me up because you're not supposed to be getting up that early every day like they can't be good for you you know if you listen to people that know things about sleep like getting up at 4:30 in the morning or 5:00 in the morning every day and not being responsible that was the beginning to me that was the beginning of the new Joe Rogan Tamara podcast that was the first podcast I listened to the I agreed with a lot but I also had a couple mitigating factors because I believe that everybody's bodies a lot different I know I could rock and roll I could throw down on seven straight but it's got to be seven straight no no no get up to P two times because once you're 50 it could be up and down see once you turn 50 48 everything changes Poppa so if you see it at night and I'm thinking can future with water it has to come out throughout the night and you will be up all night on the hour every hour there's no REM sleep yeah there's no REM sleep so you have to come tutorial once you get old you have to come power control your thyroid dog I've been a specialist on sleep since day one that was one of the most interesting podcasts you had on I bought the book and everything and he made some great points in there I didn't I wasn't raised on a nap once we came from Cuba my dad died there was no nap I went where she went right so Mike the date consisted of 8:00 to 3:00 in the morning she had a manager's room in the back of the bar with a cot and if I got tired and want to go back there and take a nap but I gotta stay here till 3:00 mom I gotta work Wow so my sleep was always horrific dan when I was only five is six and school that I went to Nall most people went to Catholic Grammar School normal sleep everything was normal but my mom had a bad thing that she did my mom had an issue so a lot of parents don't do when they work nights it was she did it from the heart because I have a friend who does it wake me up at 3:00 in the morning Georgia Georgia get up I brought you black ink and pasta which when Gigli from Umberto's and I brought you a newspaper are you kidding me could you imagine if I woke you up and real attitude when you're 20 sushi is all Joe mmm at 3:30 in the morning and you know I'm doing it from my heart and seven out of ten times you're gonna get up and eat the school jelly or the or the marinara sandwich I brought you from Leo's because they worked in the city so if you remember if you bartending New York City on the way home over here to stop no you stop and get two slices of the best pizza there isn't Manhattan so my mom would wake me up every night at 3:30 in the morning with a Cuban sandwich that killed me over the years that MIT would make me get up every night at 3:00 they're still nights that I'll be sleeping I'll get a good night's sleep I'll look at the clock and it's 3 a.m. on the dot because it's in my butt like last night I slept good I  up my sleep was bad after I read the book for a while that's how deep he got into my head so when I went back to Weight Watchers I realized I couldn't eat any more animals because they wouldn't they would make me hungry at night I would go off the charts with points so I stopped these animals and joram my sleep pattern changed bad like my body didn't know how to fall asleep by itself I went through a month or - I was asleep Jesus doing a bunch of and then three more hours did you try anything did you try like melatonin or anything like that I did cocaine for 30 years melatonin that I could eat 20 times they can all suck my dick gaba gaba gooble goo boo i drink them all together the tea the vine leave me alone please leave me the alone all right go yourself I got something that's gaba gaba the tea and the tryptophan put together and they still don't find i buy it on amazon not bad so what I learned to do was rotate it so now I'm back on the animals I found it about an expired bag of Chiba juice like from the Dave Chappelle tour when I went out with Dave Jesus I found the bag with about 24 oh my god I slice them in half you take one of those woof we wake up at 6:00 in the morning peas brown they're expired you understand me what happens if you eat expired edibles same thing when you eat expired vicodin listen to this listen this ain't around though this works to Joe this is you gonna fight Joe Schilling eat two of these and call me back on Monday it works hey Joe ain't nobody knocking you out to eat one of these time things

was embarrassed hmm damn but Saturday night I pay the animal John Rogan I hate two of these expired ones I ate one that I said let me take a chance it's Saturday night ain't another one and I noticed your movie was coming on and it is what a phenomenal movie Midnight Express when they catch the kid coming back from Turkey with hash on his body to Rogen that is one of the most hardest movies you'll ever watch and you goddamn the first 30 minutes of that like I thought I was gonna die and like once they let him go through and they played him as soon as he hit the plane they turn them around ripped his shirt and they drop to the hands and knees and they gave him the seven years and they started raping him Jesus but I watched up to the part where he became friends with this dude they had attack and the dude name was likey likey likey was the guy's name and lecky killed the cat and they let this American know you know that point where even Michael Douglas and what was that movie where he's on the 405 and he just snaps fighting back Michael Douglas's then they try to rob him the three Mexicans try to rob from the suitcase what was falling down and falling back he have like his daily that was it that was the last day to live that this dude finds out they killed that poor Americans cat and he throws a  beat on his Lepke dude Joe Rogan is one of the most disturbing beatings there's two disturbing beatings in film history that's number two because he closes it out because the guy was a rat so after he throws a beatin on look yeah yeah yeah yeah right there he's spitting up and guy's tongue in the air and they showed it I gotta give a shout-out to Turner Classic Movies you been throwing Heat the last six plays they had on something else last night they had the gambler on the other night that followed this this is the 40th anniversary Joe Rogan he throws a beatin on him opens his mouth I'm thinking the guy's being a nice guy he's gonna mop them up and saved the guy's life no you see him more pulls up like this Joe they slow it up only a knockoff real director dad on the waterfront last night Jesus yeah they around and they curse once I was watching like what is the commercials and they said one time I might as well play this hand now they're gonna show the tongue Joe Rogan he takes it out so you could see the rage from the 8 years and that Turkish jail getting in the ass eat that hummus drinking that watered-down tea from Leki and he just spits his tongue in the air look at his beating the best beating of all time there's only one better beaten our boy - Mexican well he beat up Taha the pilot the end this is Lepke Jesus did I forgot about this movie this is a classic this is a classic 70s movie this is crazy dude look at him he's just this is eight years of getting beat up every day I'm gonna kill you you  dude this is an intense scene what year is this movie 78 I was a kid I still remember gonna see this in the movies I'm leaving they're like dog I ain't ever gonna Turkey Jesus Christ the scene for the people that are just listening he's he's tearing apart this bathroom to get at this guy I don't remember who the guy is he's the guy that sells watered-down hash and he rats you out and he's just a creepy dude and then to finally push him over the tap he hangs his a cat he wakes up to his cat being hung and right here people this is the strength of the 70s balls to the wall Oh smashes honest yeah no this is real deal real right oh are you nuts good morning it's the fourth of July you're with an American even in Turkey we lose our minds that guy must have been half our meaning in there you go dude this was an if this guy in the diner aged in real life this is a strong strong next time you have got ours a real life guy in general this guy that the actor who was he was me forget what his name Brett Brett Brad Davis Jesus then the second-best beating is our man Anthony Quinn at the end when he was 80 he beat the out of the good-looking dude for his walk girlfriend Muriel Stowe Madeleine Stowe in a movie called revenge that is all yeah remember revenge Kevin Costner VIN Costner and then he slices her face and he puts her in a whorehouse right in the ass every hour  this is it it's a fourth of July dog get your together you saying if alex is Jones is correct we're going to have a civil war today so what the month you talked to Alex you gotta calm him down Alex you gotta calm down talking about a civil war he had me doing an extra Qi but you the other day I was polishing the the musket Alex thinks I'm defending the New World Order cuz I didn't think that George Soros was a Nazi it's also painful nothing everything's great man me too I feel good Howard Jones I love you buddy for real but you say some silly that's where this all comes from doesn't mean I don't love you you're a great guy but there's some that's just silly it's waste of time you know that's one of those things it's just a waste of time does that make sense I'm with you I think there's real conspiracies you know but I think there's some that you know people just get caught up and looking for conspiracies in everything and after a while it's exhausting let's get the bull off the table I love the guy loved the podcast with Harvey last week yesterday Tina Turner's son he's get Alex Jones gonna hear this so I'm just like I'll finish okay no it's okay it's just I love the guy I really do I just don't support a lot of the that he said like the Sandy Hook stuff I don't know if he's since disavowed I don't know if he changed his opinion on it I don't know what it is but at a certain point I'm like Jesus man are you are you sure like you got to be really sure before you say something crazy like that right don't use I mean don't you think look I think he's a great guy and as a person I'm not attacking it I just when he goes crazy and gets mad at me I love I want to hug him I love Lee told me the story about trotters pulling up in front of your house and they could see through your walls they probably can't do that they do that in different neighborhoods you know probably can do something like that but then after five of those and this is my experience I'll tell you something that you got to sit there and go what the am i doing sitting here but that's cool that's Alex and we accept them for what the he is I just thought there was a civil war started of it I really unprecedented saying war the Democrats are going at it today so somebody's shooting somebody so just to calm Alex down nobody's telling me what to say no one's telling me what to do not involved in New World Order who's in the world just because me about the I'm not sure I'm not involved though I just want Alex to know not involved what else people who's the dinner people the people you say you eat with smart oh these are all podcasters and former professors and all these different people that are doing different things together what it's like walking CBS Radford I think I think Inspira seas are fun and that's part of the problem with conspiracies they're fun they're fun to chase down they really are they're interesting I'll tell you what's fun to chase down to read about one and to absorb it by yourself once I get into a minute room with three men and we're on a conspiracy for 48 minutes that's when I get back well that's what I don't want the water talks about that's what this that kills me I don't have the time to discuss with a little moon landing of that we all have an idea what we think happened guess what I really don't want to talk about it not on the 4th of July ya know the problem with them is and this is a tendency is that when people get really into conspiracy theories they're into everything being a conspiracy it's not like they're into conspiracy theories and also into the history of Cuba then give you a detailed history of some really crazy that went down like how many people that are really any conspiracy theories could give you a rundown on how Castro took over Cuba which is like a real thing that happened in you know our parents lifetimes right think about that how many people that re into like you know whether or not there's bases on the moon know about you know all these different things that have happened through human history the Mongols the Roman Empire the Greek Empire it was crazy that definitely really happened all the stuff that happened during the Vietnam War all the stuff that happened during the Nixon administration all that stuff's real that's fascinating fascinating to look into but then you get to dumb ones like oh god we've really discussed and whether or not the earth is flat is this a real conversation like people really doing that satellites aren't real going social you'll find a bunch of people to do it'll agree with you too gotta be so careful about not listening to scientists on Saturday on Sunday night Sunday night I'm the 50 years or 60 minutes they was showing how they interview different people and how the one guy went to Assam Kasane Osama I saw Saddam Hussein so that was saying he said to a little ask him to tell him that this guy said he's crazy hmm Interpol looked at mrs. you think sorry I ain't and that and there was but there was one particular interview and he was just talking about the interview he was one of the best interviews he ever did was when he pushed the guy the guy that was standing behind Kennedy in the car the agent that should have taken the bullet for Kennedy they interviewed that guy that's a great you got out of that one of that that he was one step behind I mean he breaks down into tears he's a real American like this is a guy that's a real American took that job and then like it wasn't your fault and he's like you don't understand I was a second behind if I would have been there just one second earlier I would have cornered him in my back and the president would have been a lot I mean it's crazy Jesus he imagined being dedicated to protect a guy with your own life and to really drink the serum and to believe it like like a soldier those are very special human beings that can do that it's not a lot of human beings that have that kind of resolve well throw their life in front of a bullet to protect someone else's that's intense that is intense and you have to hear where the bullet is coming from what your response time has to be to be this is when you're a real high-level bodyguard this is you are the highest of the highest your hearing is impeccable this means when you're walking down the street with this guy inside you have to learn by yourself how to shut off nature and noises and listen to footsteps weapons clicking holsters opening think of how interesting just that alone is that's why sometimes when you see him there holding one ear because there's zero within them anything particular a cars tires screeching differently think of that job because I took Java's to react to that so if this if Joe Rogan has eight guys when they trained I don't even know I've never trained in Quantico but I just know that I guarantee the first two guys the first four guys are lead guys they have a mission one guy gets to the door if there's a shooting the other guy duck two guys duck for the president there's got to be plans like they fight formations and football jeez what if the linebacker goes this way you run around me this doesn't take a genius to tell there has to be formations to protect the president whoever it is you're protecting in that level when I'm protecting Kevin Hart how many people gonna try to assassinate Kevin Hart when I'm protecting a president how many people that'll really try to shoot that president with weapons I mean let's go to the Ronald Reagan attempt let's go to these attempts how fast kisses you have to be so high elite Vietnam another war and then you got to do a tour of something else where you were just like a spook you tiptoed in mind killed people with toothpicks in show business this is mine this is what I think you're training you I don't think you're just born to be Rambo I think they have to take you the government and they start with a hundred Rambo's they just keep training training training you lose some along the way and after every hundred you get eight  savages that never had a chance to get married the government never gave them a chance to get married they're that good well all these guys that I know that have been Navy SEALs all of them are any special forces guys just you those are different humans you know to just different people well what's jackal Navy SEAL okay favorite in that yeah and um it's just a level that you have to be you have to have more can trol of your mind more control over your will more control over your discipline you're in the most elite branch of the military I mean this is the elite of the elite mean you make it insanely difficult to get in so you just get the cream of the crops the people who are the just a mental fortitude is just unlike an average person if you meet a bunch of people like that man you realize like wow people come into all kinds of different levels there's people that just only surround themselves with other excellence and those dudes like those Jocko type dudes or Tim Kennedy type dudes those that's a day that got different kind of human like they don't make a lot of those you just want to have only those boy you got a there's a lot that has to happen before you can become a person like that you have to you have to travel through many valleys of the mind and the body to get to be a person like that a person of the insane resolve in the time of war it's a very very intense human being it's it's time a war Lou these twelve Filipino kids in the back caves down there look who want to get them the  seals the seals the SEAL team went down there because that would happen well there's different various agencies but there's also a SEAL team there makes sense you know the SEAL team that's as elite as elite so do you I don't even know that's how you probably become a bodyguard to the president you'd have to  start like as an attache somewhere for a year or two with a suit on just to adjust a human life and life without Aeryn bombs go off every 20 minutes and yeah and then move up in that system until you get level the secret service there's no way you're gonna be a Sikh they put you through a Secret Service training school and you're there in 60 layers let me tell you something I go and my daughter goes to science camp you know whatever the until pre-k starts I'm one of the kids she goes with his dad's an FBI agent you know my job is every day to sneak up on him every day I sneak up on him and put a gun to his side but I know what's going around I beep at him in the back and he giggles and I dumped my wife every day he's the worst FBI agent I've ever seen in my life cuz I'm too late even tiptoeing up told me they don't even hear me and bushes or nothing like that that's how good I am do you know why dawg because they have my um rad I'm gonna caddy me today Joe Rogan right out of college that's why we have so many shootings that's why we have so many accidents out there with police officers they don't hire neighborhood kids anymore they hire college graduates that have never had what we had see when you were growing up if all else failed you've never been arrested in your life you really could have been a cop you're a nice guy but you really could have been Joel the cop you could have been Joe the cop and Quincy mass that drives around and like that sure anybody could be anybody could be us but Joe the cop would have been different if Joe were the cop with a came in here and seen me and Jamie argue Joe the cop wouldn't arrest me and Jamie Joe the cop would say I want to meet you tomorrow at 3:00 and he would give us both boxing gloves and we would box it out when we were 12 and both go home and get ice cream the next day Joe the cop wouldn't throw us both in jail Joe the cop wouldn't throw us against the wall and if we turned around he'd shoot one of us in the  leg he was part of the community Joe the cop and Joe on the cop knew what it was like living in that community as a child do you understand me so and I didn't know this I've been thinking about a lot about this and I ran into some me and I asked him an ex-cop why are we having the situation's we're having in this country the one last week in East Pittsburgh is just mind-blowing  just now there's a lot of different angles for that they had just finished doing a shootout but the kid took off this cop watched him said okay got down drop down military-style blast him three times oh shoot me in the leg bitch shoot me in the leg for running away that's what Joe the cop would do yeah but even shooting someone no way but yeah it's got to be something that they did that's really  up well I believe in the leg then take your life I hear you I'd rather shoot you in the leg then take your life if it's an iffy call but just show you so you know it's not safe to shoot someone on the leg people die from getting shot by shot you the ankle no okay but I'm taking the risk I don't want to give the impression how many movies did we grow up but the guy got shot in the shoulder he just went you know I'm saying you live show me shaver it is they get pistol-whipped and then when they wake up it's like nothing happened they just start duking it out all thank everybody was pistol whipping people remember that they would just Club him in the head with the pistol that was so crazy that was like a thing and then people wake up why what happened I didn't get pistol-whipped with the but I got pistol-whipped with the gun to the head nothing bled thank God but it hurt I don't know what the type of gun it was like an automatic like like I mind knowing me the time it wasn't like a revolver I never got hit with the bud or what a weird feature of the human body if that you hit it in the right spots it goes out we have like a plug we have like a losing like some people's plugs a little looser than others some people's plugs like Mark Hunt it takes forever to knock it loose some people could just take it some people can it's  weird so weird characteristic you hit people and they go unconscious it's very strange so it's a very strange feature that we exploit you know but in movies it was making like it's no deal it's a big deal it's a big deal you should avoid having it done to you it's a big deal to get knocked unconscious you know it's so weird we first started hanging out what I have to do you took me to see that boxing coach at the time he had four Academy Award guys he was training was that Terry Claiborne to reclaim monitor Terry's amazing he's a great guy we walked in there we went upstairs and I think at the time when we walked them Nicholas cave is up there at the time was law hairpiece on his acting like Johnny Gold Bond stuff and then Terry came over and gave you a hug and we went downstairs and Terry grabbed Steve Simone later on cuz Steve worked there at the time this is 97-98 as a gym oh yeah and he goes boy that guy's the wrong profession there's a comic he should have been a foxy it's like a meal you know I never forgot that I'm saying that and all the stuff you talk about brain damage and whatever it took a lot field at that age to realize that this was for real this was this was dangerous there was no money in it there's no temptation this head that this head is not this is real it was real but there was also I didn't have any temptation before this what happened before this like what happened to the guys that I saw plain black football and black and white wood leather helmets well you know leather helmets are safer believe it or not cuz you don't feel as confident when they had those leather helmets they didn't crash into each other the same way there's not there's a pinion I don't know if I agree with it cuz I don't know much about the sport but there's an opinion that no pads no helmets football would be safer because you wouldn't be able to do the same things that they're doing now you can't just run into people head to head you just you just destroy you and you could only do it a few times your body would just are breaking but if you you're putting helmets on and pads it accentuates your ability to run into someone with all your force that's unnatural and it creates an unnatural jarring of the body in the brain the the rugby guys don't get rugby guys don't have all those paths so when they're clashing into each other they're learning how to roll with things and not just colliding into each other they're not there's a different game when you've got padding so if you take away the padding people have to be more careful and how they're engaged they can't just charge in and smash into each other they won't last how I was CTE in the game it's a contact sport for sure right banged up it's a contact sport is a wild contact sport am ii don't know i don't know interesting to find that I haven't being a kid dog I know it's a real good question Jersey right yeah we know football I didn't even know if Santa bang Manuel isn't jaiz made through his massages a couple Spanish people played the dark side of the court they played soccer on Sundays they wouldn't even let nobody watch a couple Spanish guys but besides that soccer was not big in my area but when I moved to Aspen I would go to the hospital on Saturday just to walk around get a bigger the sandwich and I'd see rugby I had never saw that though I didn't know what the it was right and I was like in good shape and after about three times I went one of the guys said to me won't you show up on a Saturday and I looked at them like what are you crazy I don't know what the you guys are doing they have a big rug rug fest and Aspen every year pretty much every year that's why I first saw rugby was in Colorado I don't think I've ever seen it live I've only seen on TV ya know I've seen it live it's you know I saw three I saw two things that blew me away live and in Colorado I saw rugby and I saw when they did like the Tour de France start of a type race but they did it's lunch Snowmass Village hmm and I knew exactly what it was the road up and how it would have to be a circle to go man you didn't have to go back down to route 80 to Brian he would just do circles around snow mask and I still remember being on a hill listening to them going up to hell hmm but it just blew my mind the way the tire was hitting the speeds like the how fast they were going uphill and then 20 years later you realize they're doing PPOs and hanging out with Sheryl Crow's old husband shooting all that can you imagine when they were shooting in the eighties when I saw them Jesus was stronger back then I can only imagine what's the drug that they shoot that their legs won't stop moving at night so they gotta get on a bicycle Oh EPO it's not the delay that he Lud gets thick apparently I'm probably saying it wrong but uh the they have this feeling like they have to exercise one of our buddies was a biker and you know he was professional tour guide just like you know not like a super famous super successful one but he was a you know professional bike rider what would you call one of those cyclist professional cyclist and he would tell us about it how guys you'd hear them he knew that they were on EPO and then you would hear them when they were on a tour bus they'd get up in the middle of the night and go ride their bike like they felt like they had to exercise so I guess if you're on a lot of it I don't know I've never done it it seems like it would be awesome though if you should take some drug that like super juiced up your endurance that sounds awesome but apparently it's just not very safe and they were saying that a lot of executives take it now like there's there's people that are executives that are just entering endurance races and they're taking EPO and and entering into these endurance races that like regular people with regular jobs just decided to take it there was some article about that see if you could find it it was like CEOs entering into endurance races taking EPO but it's a few fighters have been caught with it and it apparently just really juices endurance you go 16 rounds  yeah yeah I had a friend they used to shoot these steroids and never do a push-up Jesus Christ he was whacked that's crazy I go dumb what are you gonna go to gym next week hmm that's insane I'll never forget seeing him eat like half a bowel win Evy the pink footballs like the pink ones in the eighties he would just put them in his hand like tic tacs with a beer oh my god Jim tomorrow I did some push-ups today just my biceps that's all I need a few biceps so much Italians crazy group of humans that came up I always want you to do the impersonation from you when Italian people in Jersey found out that Marlon Brando was gay I can't believe it 20 years he was the Godfather and no no no he couldn't blow a regular dude no god forbid he blows a black dude to really stab me right here in the  heart I couldn't even take him no more I had to throw the DVD collection away and I would love to hear one of those guys what they said when they found out that that week didn't they say that he everybody men and women oh yeah he banged everybody everybody and then it came out he was banging the guy with the big dick and cube that's right Superman so poor Italian people is that what Godfather fans they were lighting those DVDs on fire Marlon Brando poor poor homophobes I like him more now I like Marlon Brando yeah listen me Richard Pryor thinking about Richard Pryor getting so coked up that he let Marlon Brando was one of the things I was like unless he luck that's prejudice with me I should just assume he enjoyed it and assume he enjoyed having sex with Marlon Brando why should I give a remember one thing cuz you're gonna die when I tell you this uh-oh Marlon Brando taught at the studio and to give them like a hundred grand to read super minute but you know when people call you up Joe hi Jill this is Cynthia from your engines right we're sending you a script over fee to approve to read under grant give me a hundred grand I'll reduce it but he went to the island he went deep and he believed his ego you gotta remember that was an all-time record for a long time well he got four Superman he banged him out he took him to the cleanest time shoot him he him up in the ass bad my big money find out what they pay them in 1970 whatever for Superman member he them big time I think it's mutiny on the bounty I'm one of those movies they kept saying that no we have a beautiful spot for you right here and the marina though right if we do this we got to do this on this island I found he had gone down in from love he made the studio shoot down and then went down there who wants to go to  whatever Island they shot that at so that's where he lived right so he went down there he got down and he's like Jamie what's your job PA no more you the director rugged your this and everybody was shooting and they were shooting his feet they were shooting like him running and like them ashore and meanwhile he's just banging Hawaiian women eight at a time or do you Bagon kids all those kids that shot themselves all those kids he had no my gun all those poor kids that God rest their souls and all those problems yet he was down there I just Matador whoever paramount whether the network was showed up down an so let's see the dailies and I said what the is this you're done they brought somebody else in Marlon ended up saying  I body out of it he bought the island didn't he like this is just crazy  I heard over the years and they just lived on the island and then if they wanted they had to call the island and they had like levels all you want me to read the script that's what shady all you want me to come to the studio that's 300,000 he had levels of  and they would give it to him they would and then they didn't want him for the Godfather they were like nah there's no way we want that God Wow and then finally he put the tape in his mouth and all that and they approved them and he did have bro that movies like a porn the one he did that last tango in Paris is it that's like a light porn and then the chick came out years later said that stone-cold raped me yeah he was the king of me too he invented me through that  dog Wow yeah she came out years later and said something about he she didn't know what would mom would brand no one in there and choked her out like McQueen and and the get away she thought she was just getting pushed yeah the McQueen and who was it with Wow Emma girl you gras that was hard to watch dude cuz you could tell that was real there's no way that wasn't real like he was really hitting her yeah no no he was a method actor it's harsh he's crazy not crazy that scene was so real because of it I mean it's awful to watch but but it's real right it's an awful scene it's real man that you imagine being her and all sudden the dude just start smacking you in the head for real you don't know what to do and you don't want to bail out of the scene you're getting  up though he's you up and she didn't stop she just kept saying the lines and he's working with it  dude Jesus Christ what do you say to somebody after that like a man I'm sorry but that's what the scene call for you can't seat people for it sounds  up to say but I think even just that recent a time people did not understand that if you're smacking people in the head like that you're giving them brain damage like you smack someone in the head like that like you could seriously them up like something could be wrong with them for a long time even if they don't go unconscious your mother was making that no no my mom was a hater really no she wasn't it was mighty in there very few people an uncle know very few people okay it won't be my grandmother crack me once but it was you know just like Kate you together not like trying to hurt me you know so little smack I didn't get beat as a kid but I saw a lot of violence I saw the scene violence when you're a kid there's something about like seeing someone you're close to who's an adult being beating up like a 10 or 11 year old you ever see that before when you see when you see something you've seen a grown adult beaten the out of 10 or 11 year old when you're a little kid yes that to me was that was like a defining moment when I was a little as a parent or I only saw parents beat their children yeah I saw someone beat somebody else's kid it was  up to watch man when I lived on 205 West 88th Street we can't walk ham from Cuba we live the Jersey for my dad died we moved to 89th Street then something happen at the building and we end up moving May the 8th Street and I had a kid I had a beef with every day and one day I finally got my together in karate like one day I'm my sidekick started working and that  right cross started working I learned how to use my up block and I finally had this kid his name was Rudy the Haitian he was the only Haitian kid in the neighborhood Street I them up this day this father came down and held my arms and he made Rudy punch me and I'll never forget that my lip was bleeding and he took me upstairs and he knocked on my mother's door and my mother opened up the door and a half a hangover but she was what's the problem she got shot with Coco you know and he goes next time your son hits my son I'm gonna hit him then I'm not come ahead and hit you Wow my mom turned around and got a butcher knife and chased Rudy's follow up the stairs the cops came and delayed things Dora said she didn't see a knife but at that point we were done in the building geez that was one of the worst there when I moved to North Bergen I saw parents that you don't like job you ever hear a comedian go even why kids you will the house how they talk to their parents I could never talk about you know right that's the first thing I noticed when I went to Jersey there was there were certain kids that would take their dish and go I don't want tuna fish sandwich if I ever did that my house joe rogan are you kidding me my mom would take the dish throw it against the wall and say now you're not eatin go to bed like that type of but I also saw a pirate long hallway one day that was standing the way you all with his arms crossed talking to the teacher the way I'm talking to you and the kid standing right here with glasses on and I'm walking towards him like you know I went through the bathroom man like a hall pass and I'm talking talking talking and in the middle of it the father just going BAM and hitting him with a backhand kick goes down Oh glass is broken Bloods coming out of the nose oh oh you told him to get the up before I kill you you dumb  oh you said that to him you dumb I have seen that oh that kid was the devil though I knew that kid well the reason why that kid kid was the devil probably because his dad beat him then there was another kid when I went to Catholic school we don't father Ginn's own a whole  thing bro he would come there the nicest guy in the world but the son was crazy and everytime he get there the nun would tell him about what he did and dog he would punch him the way own guy always drawn punches and god steep a dice whistling buzzes Griff right as he was crawling into the car like ground pound 12 Jesus so know are you looking at me saying Joey did they deserve it or whatever everybody every parent had a different you know I watched a couple weeks ago I was stoned to the gills and I was laughing about how people put people down on his and I was laughing about when Julius Erving first when the ABA shut down when the ABA first shut down if they were I don't know Joe but if there was eight categories Julius Larry Irving's lead seven them right and the ABA shut down and the Sixers picked up Julius Erving they gave him six million dollars which can you imagine that would would they give that guy yet but they give LeBron mr. Lorant in about 30 or 40 but yet yeah he got six million dollars over two years or something was Julius and he was the biggest play in the world that now this guy's getting 150 for for three ISM Jesus so dr. J switched his number from 32 to 6 and now the NBA all-star game came so all the critics were like Shh he came home from the ABA he's gonna get his ass kicked from the NBA all-star game what oh look at those statistics he went off he went off because of a white dude named Pistol Pete Maravich that is thought he went to how has she would led the country in scoring a white dude and then I'm becoming a boos about that dude knew how to handle the ball because his father would beat him his father would make him sleep in the garage in the winter and beat him until you learn how to play basketball because there was no losing in this  house do you understand me John Rogan there's no losers house sleep in the garage no dinner but Pistol Pete what a dribble jacket what pistol pete would take your deep Pistol Pete can I eat anybody could cover by the best black dude in the league and cover Pistol Pete but if you watch that NBA all-star game Pistol Pete is stopping chomping people and give him behind the back passes to Julius Erving he even looks at a dude on one path he's looking at Bob McAdoo I'm coming I don't they just push the ball between his legs and he gives it to Julius Erving just why because that kid's father stayed on there's a different thoughts of some people can handle that some people like some some guys have broken but I mean it's like how much pressure is too much pressure to create like a superstar like that I didn't Tiger Woods didn't his dad put a lot of pressure on him as well let's talk about the the guy that died last week but that's a different thing like I well the Tiger Woods Oh Jackson who what the is different about that he created three  kids to change the one kid to change the world right he be let me them in the air suppose I don't know he did sexual wanna got to be really careful with the same things I'm sorry listen it's to me to think things come out what are you gonna do everybody's getting the blame for something I'm saying but this is something you really heard I have heard sexual abuse allegations from his father but but I listen to what listen to what would he create what do they do what did Joe Jackson do by making them not let them and let me tell you something the one kid could have gone to a college to play basketball the kids had talent as it was Gary Indiana Carrie in there no it's like hell Delaware and then Gary Indiana but you know say like Gary's like crazy he made these kids rehearse he pulled them out of gas to come up the berry gordy you know you think about this some of them probably hate him for what he did you look back at those lessons that you got your rope and how many people did you look at one day and go you  but then two years later you look back and you look at the lesson you learned from the whole experience and you actually have to go back and hug that person and go hey man thank you for that time and made me better for that because what you did made me a better person we're not gonna agree with everything that happens along the way all right hmm but it's made us who the  we are today that's an interesting thing because we grew up in a time where kids were just allowed to run around outside everybody ran around outside that was just normal right when you were a little kid you ran around outside nobody just runs around outside I remember the first time I saw a grown lady hit she hit my cousin we were both around the same age I was probably six and she was five and this lady slipped on ice in front of her apartment building and she got up and my cousin just unfortunately happened to be standing right in front of her when she fell and she got up and she said don't you laugh at me and she smacked her in the face she wasn't laughing at or either just she smashed her in the face man like it was she smacked her hard and I was like oh my god was that I mean we were both little little kids and watching some grown adults smash our cousin in the face really like realize that hey you can't you you know you got to be polite there's some people that was smacking you in the face and she didn't even do anything wrong there's some evil  out there that will hit little kids that's a dark man smacking little kids in the face I swear to God I ran into probably when I first moved from Cuba to a DA Street there was a dude on the block that would smack little kids and I'm telling you right now to my little daughter there was words on the street that he would take you to his house and the ass oh my goodness this is that early 70s this is the early seventies which I turned into a joke later on because it would be like bro have you seen Joe Rogan lately and I haven't seen him in a week sticky Charlie go HR was his name mr. martini mr. Martinez de martini God when you first moved to 88th Street that's the first thing the kid to tell you I got was he fighting this guy don't follow me mr. martini oh Jesus he's a monster his nearby detainee wore black suit with a white shirt and black shoes and wife would die and he owned the building of 88th Street in the middle and he was angry and he would sweep and you know like when you were kid and you stopped in front of somebody's house he would always come on go get the out of here little douchebags get the fun I was Cuban I didn't understand the language I didn't really understand what he was saying I understood the anger but other than this day the language and he would come out with a broom get the out of here one day I realize I'm like this wants to rock so while my other friends didn't wanna alone I'm like we're gonna with this  so all Cubans have been like walking in front of their house and there's something that your mother throws change and every day yeah it's like a good luck statue and I would steal the change and bring it downstairs and I would look at the poor kids and I go come in for saying you want a corner and they would go yeah we'll get a corner I would take a quarter to throw it when mr. martini lived mm-hmm he lived like in a basement area he ran the whole bit he'd be right there and he chase us we go mr. Marteen he sucked my weenie in the chases and he looked right huggy chases caught yet he would hit you like 50 times but we him up we would  him up dog I saw some the first day like New Jersey to me was it completely that was like Mars to most people I think most people listen to me and go you grew up someplace that doesn't exist I'll bring eight people to fill these chairs to tell you about the parents and the people and the situations but the first day I went out in my hometown of Bergen I saw me and Joe Rogan fight and even though I had Joe Rogan on his back I saw Joe Rogan's father come down the stairs pull me off Joe Rogan smacked me punch me kick me throw me on the floor and make his kids go in that was my first experience ever in North Bergen New Jersey and so a million mr. Robson come downstairs he took Anthony off his son threw him off smacked him in the face Joe Rogan at 2:00 when he half the noon in 90-degree heat punched him in the stomach and told him to go home you little Guinea go home you little guinea say that now they'll throw you in jail for two years he don't go home you little Guinea Anthony look at him crying a little bit he picked up his shirt he went like this like he took the thing off I think was I'm calling my  father you dead oh you  Guinea greaseball father died a he's probably a greaseball just like you and I'm sitting there going I want to see how this plays out and next thing you know two cop cars pull up and there's one cop car that's unmarked that's another one that's marked and it's a big a time with him detective like you know the short stuff be Italian and he comes out of his car I put his jacket on it barely fits but till this Dara member the mortadella's he had on his hand I think goes what the fuck's going on here kids little Italian kids miss just mr. Robson came back and he smack me in the face these are my witnesses talent then he  hit me and I'm sitting this is gonna get good this the next you know the the cop the detective tells the cop go look around see if there's tickets go spread tickets and he goes where's this guy live and he goes and he goes he grabbed all the other kids he goes tell me what happened and he goes Anthony and him were fighting and he came back and he pulled them and that this time they know that could the cops are there I'm mister Robson I kind of opened this door to be kind of tough like he's not coming up he's on or I'll knock him out - and the cop goes ok ok ok you've grabbed the kid because you're okay right yeah because he just hit me in the face and he walked up the stairs bro took him five minutes got to the top then they open the door Joe Rogan this guy will put his hand there put him against the thing on the second floor with everybody out and just started punching him Oh punching him punching him like John Jones this one he's got you down he's hitting with those shots to the head until the guy killed though they started kicking him with the thing Bam Bam Bam don't you ever hit my son again let's get out of here well that was how I became friends with the family because soon as he came down he goes who's this kid because he's the spicket he's the only one that jumped in because you want to come home for dinner and that was the beginning of my life when I got in that police car whatever I did whatever the I want look at this till today this is crazy and you know me and you don't around what do you got over there this is still that's what happened in 1970 three and what's that today that's a a gold card what does this card do it it does what it will need it to do it does whatever I needed to do you know I'm saying you're a family member did why because of that  day cuz I'm the only guy that jumped in I like how cops have things like that a family member card you can get one of your buddies who's a cop show get pulled over put this on your license plate I got this little sneaky little thing so now what type I'm eating at the house I'm eating pasta we have refreshments in the middle oh I could open up the front door whenever I want I call the mama she makes cream puffs oh wow I'm tight with them I'm the only Cuban in 1974 that's even walking in there ah so now we're in the sixth grade and we're playing kickball McKinley had no fun remember two months ago Ellen DeGeneres donated 50 thousand to a grandma school was my grandma school in North Bergen New Jersey but months ago yeah I went to generous donated fifty thousand now when I would tie grammar school those didn't have a Jim Joe Road you shovel snow they gotta be shoveled snow and shovel snow well it's no doubt you shovel snow that was part of your physical education yeah and you did push-ups and sit-ups and  that's like Russian chair bro I'm sorry in the kitchen we didn't pull ours no no they were brutal finally they built the gym in the 8th grade yeah but before that we played kickball outside in the fall when they will begin playing kickball and fitness the guys name was mr. tortora that was the teacher's name was he a good guy he was a good for Jim PJ and we're out there we're playing kickball and again that little Italian kid the one that invited me to his house father beat up the fans dude we're playing kickball he's throwing the ball and every time I swing and I miss he's calling me go go got a local that means I'm a boogie face and Spanish because it rhymes a coke all right and the teacher keeps going Anthony I told you thousand thugs none of that spic shit's allowed this is the sixth grade North Bergen New Jersey a teacher school teacher mr. Tatar is like a let's pick a Russian over here right this is America really well bro that was at that time that wasn't a big issue because a couple weeks before that a guy named clitoral was a baseball coach and he threw a kid off for speaking Spanish on the bus he told me there's no Spanish on the bus and the king goes you and he spoke Spanish and he threw him off like 20 miles in the house became a big problem in my hometown they were gonna kill the  do it but I remember going home my mom going he's talking the truth and now she speaks Spanish this is America outside you speak America so my mom cut me off right there like I went home like ready to be like a protester and she was like that don't happen here were Americans he wants to expand it over the house I think there's a real benefit to being able to speak more than one language definitely is yeah completely different mindset I'm happy I do it I speak to my daughter in Spanish if I tell my ask him mercy something I react or in Spanish sighs I read tolerance press nice yeah they say that things like that they're learning new languages in particular opens up parts of your brain that if you're just a dummy like me that only speaks English you can access different just different ways of looking at things you know what's very analytical let's say you wanted to be a lawyer one of your pre whatever would be a language right you'd also have a heavy mass to be a lawyer you have to have a very heavy math prereq ulam yeah a lot of history you probably ended up being a history major but there'd be a lot of math while he cannot a lot on analytics because it forces your mind to solve equations so when if you look at the prerequisites if you get whatever the  it is what's the clue requisite prerequisites to be an attorney there's a lot of math involved interesting there's got to be language involved there's got to be politics involved but yeah American political systems American history systems all that but it's got to be heavy math once you get the law school it's heavy reading and but before that it's a lot of problem solving yeah that's the that's how you become a problem solver by whatever yeah I agree with you whatever you just said well before I got locked up I was gonna be an attorney so I was a real history major yeah that's that that was the  planet thank God history podcasts I love them they're the best I was thinking going back into school there's no reason just listening and refreshing then go on and read about it well back on tape to that you listen to their great but hardcore history and our cores great ever listened to my boy Dania Yeley bolelli I'm a heart Daniela Vallely history on fire his is fantastic he was telling me about this road to Rome I've never forgot this image where there was I think something like a hundred and fifty miles of bodies that were put on stakes he sent it to me he just handed me a couple of days ago hundred and fifty miles of human bodies that they stuck on these big poles and shoved him into the ground so much for my like every 30 yards they put a new person's body here it is 125 miles with one body crucified every 30 yards or so for a total of about 6,000 people crucified on the road between Kapua and Rome what the what was the purpose I would have to go back and listen to it again I forgot that's a shadow over here whoo that's

you considered something like that really man I'm not I don't I'm not into doing something that I know is hard to do and is definitely not good for your body I just think you get beat up doing that  don't let's just take your friend I mean as good a different kind of human well he needs that and someone they take him to recover from something like that well that's an interesting thing just a good good time for that question because he just ran a race today he ran like a six mile race and he was saying that his legs are not fully recovered who say in the post that you know his cardio was really good but you got a figure you run for 24 hours I mean he ran for 24 hours just a month ago right was it a month ago not even a month ago three weeks ago something like that that takes time and he's 50 you know when you're 50 years old it's not as the recovery is is very tough yeah he's an animal but he lives to push himself like that no um more inclined to try to preserve my body I like pushing myself but I'm just a chicken I don't want to be I don't want to be breaking hips and knees and my brother just had shoulder surgery Haiti Bravo he just got the stitches out this is his second surgery that he's had just this year you know he had he had knee surgery real recently like a few months ago right didn't he have his meniscus done if you want to go this generation of jiu-jitsu guys is learning a lot and they're learning what they're gonna pass on to the next generation is that it's great to roll and the leg locks are great and all that is great but there's another aspect to this this is called yoga and keeping your muscles strong and yeah and the conditioning has to be good and you're you know they're intense yeah they just take care of yourself these did these guys didn't know you didn't know no learn but yeah the reality of jiu-jitsu is it's a thing that as you get older you have to be much more careful who you train with and how you train you can't just go balls to the wall like you could when you were 27 you have to keep your together and you know injuries are real you can't just work through them like that was a big fallacy people would get hurt and they would try to roll light nobody ever rolls light then we say they're gonna roll light and then the guy almost gets you and then you're trying to get him next thing you know you're defending and it's serious heated up roll session which is great but then you're like like your necks all up and you know all right next guy I'm just gonna lay on my back and work my half guard as soon as it starts getting hot and heavy almost got caught in an armbar then you try to pop up within try to pass his guard then you get into it you know it's uh it's a thing that's too exciting you know and jiu-jitsu and when I say like rolling hard I mean like yeah not even breaking my level no no no listen me passing your guard and laying on you that's not a fun that's a tough morning yeah even though I'm giving you love on top Joe can you breathe yeah yeah I'm good Joe I'm letting ya it's not like I'll give tons of love would I love it you know addicted to it it's chance who I am you know I had a attack it from a different foundation I was attacking it from looking at Jamie and going I gotta do what Jamie does and not realizing I got Jamie by 25 years and I can't do what Jamie does so my game has to be completely different Jamie's Mondays when I come into class it's more about the the drilling mm less about the role and how do on how a conditioning class with bread we do everything we do the ball

together you serious yeah I was thinking maybe give me a kick boxing lessons sure and you know what else we could do we could do like a circuit a circuit wrap because I have that echo air bike that echo bike I've never done that it's phenomenal so we could do rows the echo bike and I got a verse a climber and I like to do them in I do those Tabata sequences so it's like you you go hard for 20 seconds and then you rest for 10 seconds then you go hard for 20 seconds and you rest for 10 and you do like 8 rounds of those it's  intense and then you jump on over to the row machine the row machines there's another one a similar number it's like 30 huh 30 hard 30 off something like that and then you go to the verse of climber and you plug into turn 50 yeah yeah yeah you know I'm almost 50 wannabe $51.00 longus but it's it's really interesting what I've learned and when I read about 50 I saw a picture Carroll O'Connor about a year ago and he was 46 years old he was doing oh jeez fully said whoa go to that and make sure Archie but I was like this is when he stopped or when he started no it was a picture of him in 46 and I was like there has to be a better way I saw holy you know this is what America that is crazy why don't you look like at 46 and 47 and you were like look at that dude he looked like well maybe that was like in the later years there's a funny thing right the lovable racist it was like the last of like he represented a real guide that might have had racist views that were kind of funny and he was in some way endearing because he was like such a good actor and it was such a good character and it's so well written and his relationship with his wife and his kids and with meathead I mean the whole thing was it was a brilliant show well it's such a well-crafted show that was Sammy Davis kissed him on the lips guy comes over there talking and he looks at his wife from falling for the ring he goes analyst and she goes I don't know what he likes and he goes I don't know what Porto Ricans drink and he looks out of the guys smile and I'm like and he looks something like everything's drinking I don't know how about some pineapple juice thrown off the air today yeah but it was that it was a hateful racism it was Queens racism well first of all pineapple juice is delicious and why is it racist that the dude from an island would want some pineapple juice I would think that would you'd be like culturally sensitive to like introduce that possibility if I see something that you're it's you have a tradition of drinking pot until a society if I said to you listen I'm leaving here I'm going to Chinatown think of fireworks if somebody heard me said to you right now tomorrow we'd get yeah we would have a problem I would have a problem yeah well everybody knows that 20 years ago right now I'd be heading to Chinatown in New York City getting  the mana fireworks a hundred and forty four bottle rockets a couple Roman candles you know what's the most stupid man is that the food is somehow racist like there's there's food that's racist food like if you talked about black people and also talked about delicious fried chicken or delicious orange soda or grape soda we'd be grape soda right not orange soda or so does white people yeah orange sodas are white people thing right white trash orange soda no is that not that I'm anti orange soda but I'm saying like those foods like watermelon in particular if you talk about a black person and talking about watermelon that's a racist term even though watermelon is delicious it's  weird like what is what the hell could be wrong about watermelon if you don't like the taste of watermelon if it's a hot summer day and somebody busts open a cooler and gives you a slice of watermelon how pumped are you how could watermelon ever be negative that don't make any sense to me it makes zero sense and the only way it makes sense that Fried Chicken could be negative to you is if you're a vegan or a vegetarian you don't want to eat a chicken that's the only way it makes sense that that would be a negative because otherwise like fried chicken it's delicious who doesn't like fried chicken if you eat meat fried chicken is something you smell it and you Oh someone's really good at making it and they got a nice flaky layer on the outside you slide into that juicy perfectly cooked chicken leaves fried chicken in Tennessee Jesus Milan Tennessee a little leaves fried chicken Jesus Christ yes places that know how to do some fried cheese my god how could that be bad how could that ever be racist that doesn't make any sense we got to let that go I'm gonna tell you racist stuff but not really like Saturday when I talk of my daughter I'm sitting there and I saw her sitting Jew on Sunday with the beanie and his wife with glasses I was just Sherman Oaks and he had a $10 bill sticking out of his pocket and I work my pickpocketing skills I want to see my pickpocketing  I even have my daughter bumping into his leg you can't pickpocket a Jew dog you can't do it you know when I was a kid that was my first  dream to pickpocket you watched a movie with our boy in it and Michael Cyrus said look the first pickpocket movie is called Harry in your pocket with our boy in your Flint in like Flynn James Coburn James Coburn was in a pickpocket Oh nobody knows about it America's greatest secret and they would work airports this like that Harry your body pocket so I hunted down my mom I used to hear them talk about this cuban pickpocket guy and cuban the 15m warnings oh you're here tremendous what did you do with him you did something with him right oh yeah I did two things with him I did American gun with him and I did a Arliss with him all this is up you can find ours it's online somebody just posted in the wall like I forgot about our list that's one of those shows that I forgot about but I watched him when I asked this guy how do you become a pickpocket I bumped into him at a Cuban joint there was a rumor going around that he was a good cube pickpocketing Cuban he goes you gotta get a dummy and put bells on the pockets dummy and I put bells on and me as I tried to be a pickpocket but I have big hands yeah you gotta have those slender finger gonna have slender fingers lender you can tell player Finkle little towels on pockets and you bump into him is not very light-footed that I am I was a good burglar because I could tiptoe and I'm saying like that's from my e is a tip toll on the dummy to try to take the wallet from the dummy it's great that you're doing so many different things though it's really cool to hear you're rolling you're doing some muy Thai and the rolling has really improved because at first you can't roll I dropped the weight because I figured ferry five pounds that'd be a little bit more cardio plus I got the bas Rutten mouthpiece I spoke to him yesterday again you like that thing huh I really believe in while you're working out or tell you uses what I walk you're walking when I walk I take a walk in the morning twenty thirty minutes explain to people what it is the bas Rutten mouthpieces on Amazon that says his webpage I saw it because he was on Joe talking about it I was having such a struggle with my breathing I was having such a struggle but it was just common sense number one I smoked cigarettes for twenty years number two I smoked reefer for forty years but all those are just excuses the number one thing was the weight every  find insane is some smart guy side handsome bastard yeah he said say that's a and some of these are great - he's one of the best people I know some guys late to me the great guy a great brown belt told me that whenever he rolls he could feel the difference when he's ten pounds of it oh yeah how Joey what if I go to my mother's and I come back that first week it's Breuer like really and I know sofa if I'm walking around at 3:09 trying to be  Eddie it's not gonna work so I just started chopping on the way that I went back to Weight Watchers I walked in there at 3:10 now I have a bunch of different rules now like what you can eat what you candy I'm gonna tell you something you need as many eggs as you look you in the face and some face look in the face and tell you see cause you know you and I always have this conversation if you're heavy and you don't go to Weight Watchers cuz you're a  loser whoa that's a it's that it's that easy it's that easy there's no idiot I'm gonna enjoy it I'm a idiot yeah Papa here Papa come on that's my guide okay that's my guy so you put everything you eat into this app into the app oh okay come let me show you what I was I just dinner snack - total and then you you counted out by points is that what they do is they do it themselves not any points you get in a day 39 now let's say Joey would you eat that give me a can of coffee right there give me that one you don't like pink okay we don't know so you scan that and then it'll tell you how many I don't think that has many calories does coffee plain coffee have calories not really maybe a couple but now really some when you get the milkshake coffees for breakfast and teehee and the flat white even a flat white don't care all right this isn't in there it's not even let you go like this boom and then you got this Joe Rogan you ready you press this over here and you press this here and you press this here and they give you points for whatever you do walk circuit training then you have custom so I press Brazilian Jujitsu let's play you go to an hour class how much do you really and roll 15 minutes people in our class you don't technique he teaches you how to do the drill and he tells you a joke so you press in 15 done and then you press the intensity will you breathe like an atom I just bet seven points hmm you leave this in your phone in your pocket you put this in your pocket and  guess what happens it counts two steps well now with the Disneyland let that burn 31 points so it's all the exactly for breakfast so for breakfast I go to John's and I gotta I see the roll even if I give myself four points for the row five points for the roll six points for a row I put two eggs in that which is 14 grams of protein hmm and I put a thin slice of thumanns boys have American cheese and some Frank's hot sauce on that so you essentially could eat anything you want as long as you know what the points are against fish I can out fish you four days so I'll leave here and go to  sushi Dan and I'll get the crunchy albacore which is I can't wait for Rogan to visit me it's sliced albacore covered with jalapeno onion and garlic is it possible let me ask you this is it possible that you could eat just all eggs all day and have zero points zero points really eggs all day all day that sounds crazy fish all day sea bass all giggle eats salmon and sea bass all day chicken breast no skin no small  day all day chicken breast not chicken cutlets like mom made with Italian breadcrumbs no no that's fried grilled chicken on the breast with red crushed peppers and a baked potato five points for the baked potato ooh so you want to tell me again how and hey listen you know it's not a J it's not a race see before it's only healthy to lose like a pound a pound and a half a week is that what it is that's what they said anything after that you're going into that loser show where they lost all that weight at one shot and then that's why all these diets and stuff that you have to do or something that you're gonna do forever I've always liked this I lost 100 pounds with this yeah and then I gained 40 and now I another 30 that's awesome I there hasn't been killing me like I don't miss nothing you know when I learned I didn't know this I would go get an outside eye ball American thinks an acai ball was great let me explain some to you eating a banana and putting a banana in a blender is two different things I did not know that one day I was making one of those because I switch I have Hollett protein which I used a vanilla or the chocolate Mexican chocolate mm-hmm and then I have this other one that's a polio type protein it's coconut milk and I put use that one and one day I said let me put a banana in this  just to see it I'm like damn this is delicious I'm on to something I gained weight that week I didn't know what it was from the banana when you blend a banana it's eight points but when you eat a banana it's who God's what it's because when you eat fruit and when you drink through there's two different things that's why all these fat people when you see them going I don't eat breakfast I drink a smoothie you're killing yourself you were killing yourself every time you puree fruit because when you eat fruit the sativa there's a time that saliva saliva sativa god forbid the saliva in your mouth breaks the fruit down and the digested the sugar a different way mmm when you bypass that enzyme in your mouth that's when you get 300 pounds like uncle Joey right so when you drink fruit I don't care if they tell you oh it's frozen fruit you lose some of the sugar that's once you blend that fruit you dead because it goes right into your system gotta sit down all the fiber yeah you're not supposed you learn that any other way other than the way that comes when you eat it you could go to that little Mexican stand with that umbrellas you ever see those guys the cartel delivery yeah that's what the cartel drops off that money shake him down I got 300,000 under that guy's over that cut the fruit with a machete go ahead I dare you to go up there when you see a cartel umbrella that that's a cartel money that they got tons of money in those things they just confuse people they even got him across street from one of them whoa that's Starbucks do you think they just poor people are trying to make some money not really yeah yeah because you gotta sell the pay rent this days and times nobody stands up there look at those Mexicans don't even use SPF they're out there raw with no umbrella out there yeah they look darker than dark they get dark we think you know but you gotta pay me to stand out they're all named this weather a lot they got like 200 a day 300 a day not because they're cutting apples up because a guy comes playing poncho and tastes what's underneath them and takes it straight to Mexico on Thursdays nobody sees nothing that every time you eat that fruit it sprinkle with cocaine eat some of that fruit one now what's the energy you get like that box or or can't they just be poor farmers because that's how nice people like you think when we have a criminal I see people for what it is I see things for others I'll try this at elite or rehab because are you I got a friend that's got a rehab you go down and Lee why try and sell leak so send Lee to him because he can make money there's a rehab there's a bunch of rehabs in Florida you go to and they get your insurance and they bang your insurance for 60 and then they give you a cut back in 30 I totally let me send you down into my buddies give me 10% I get 3 grand you go down to get acupuncture to give you a few massages do you give a  imagine hooli SIA would be in terms of his marijuana consumption imagine where he would be if it wasn't for you like there is that guy when you first started having him on your show when you guys first started doing it I smoke pot maybe three times in college a couple months in he's done superhero doses of edibles couple months in I mean like little by little little by little but when you would sneak him in on them and you would take away a 250 and point in a 500 what I would wrap it I guess this the Joey Diaz co-star in the Church of what's happening now is completely asleep at the wheel he's on the show and his eyes are almost totally closed he's a barely a slick he's just dazed who's the guest who is that it's rainin Basia a kid that I told on this podcast he can't take it though boy so high what is the name of this video Jamie Lee about espresso lee-sia in outer space look at him go he's God I would get these okay I would go in the afternoons and I would get a 180 and I would rip the cover off to 180 No and I would take a sixty seven sixty milligram woman I need that one it was like 2:00 in the air for them one of them do nothing to me I'll eat like a 60 and I take the 180 and put in the 60 wrapper oh no and then I bring it to him put it on the table and in front of my go here and then open it up from and he wouldn't see it it was half open there right Oh give him the sixty but it wasn't like last night I gave him an expired one I had a little bit of mold on it he he's gonna be a good comic Oh probably it's gonna be a good look at Eleanor I won't want to sat there for 15 years shut her mouth and watched there's a really special gift to that yeah what do you think I almost funny on that whether you agree with her or that I give her the balls a lot of people don't like just sitting there watching there's a lot of people that do though you know there's a lot of people that work in and around comedy clubs that probably want to do it they just don't know how to get started you know they just don't have it in them to get the ball rolling it's hard it's hard to it's hard to try something new you keep thinking about when is the right time to do it is it now maybe shot wait a week you know you know what I'm gonna lose 10 pounds and then I'm gonna try it and you get all these things in your head I want to take you seriously honest honest honest Asian well my birthday was August 11th and when I turned twenty-one was August 11th of 2019 88 rather so I got on stage August 27th so from my birthday to when I got on stage was just a few days terrified okay fine I was trying to check it out I'm Jonathan Katz was the emcee and I was maybe going to get up it was one of those things where I signed up for the list you know you get I think it was five minutes and there's a bunch of people that are gonna do five minutes and Jonathan Katz who was already an established stand-up comedian he'd really funny guy and he was the host and he's like he came up to me he said I'm let me check in a half an hour in to see if I can get young sometimes people wouldn't show up and so a half an hour in I'm thinking I'm just gonna chicken out I'm just gonna bail I'm just gonna tell him forget about it and when I'm thinking this in my head I walked up to him he's I got you and Joe so while you'll be going up right here and you'll have five minutes good luck and I said the hard thing thanks man okay so I was ready to out dude I was totally ready to push you out and I was so nervous the first time I went onstage I was terrified I couldn't believe was the name of the place stitches stitches comedy club August 27 1988 I was terrified dude terrified I couldn't believe I was scared I didn't it didn't make any sense to me I didn't think I was gonna be scared I thought maybe I'd be like a little nervous like I'd never performed before so this idea of doing it I was like well you know I've taught Taekwondo classes in front of people before I can talk in front of people and then I thought about the idea of like doing stand-up in front of people what dog oh hey this go down it took me it's crazy it took me a year to think about it and then it snowed I couldn't go to work because we can't roof Colorado right so I read to the punch line Tom Hanks Sally Fields angel Salazar Damon Wayans yeah a bunch of people in that movie and watched punchline and that pissed me the off like that was it I went on the yellow pages I found comedy clubs I called them and Comedy Works offered a Tuesday night open mic how do I get on you have to call in and they'll give you three minutes okay so for two months I called in nothing and then one night there like Joe Diaz and I call them back that night nah I got them sick I got the flu Wow and then I was roofing a roof and I'm roof and I'm roof I'm estimating jobs I'm goal in different jobs and dropping off material I'd say 2 crews working and I went to one crew and they go hey man was stuck here this job can you get us the morning break like a hangover then I went over to this little diner right off the dirty whatever that I 70 mm-hmm my 7 my 25 which one born in Denver he was like Howard industrial area trucks everywhere I don't remember will the number that rotors we were doing a road there but there was a place around the corner Jamie I had the best green chili you ever had in your life oh man you pulled him over scrambled eggs you dick would get heartily  well two tortillas are you kidding me that you don't those two huevos rancheros I walk over there I sit down and you know there's always a paper I can funny you ever go to a diner or something there's always a paper somebody read right and I sit down I get the waitress T order I'm sitting then I look over I won't like this just on a you know you just go like that to the middle they wanna help but it said do you want to be a stand-up comic whoa and it was an article Baca Rosanna became a stand-up comic and now because of Denver she had just blown up like Roseanne had just blown up it was maybe March of 91 Roselle had just blown up Denver was a hotbed Jack everybody was drinking the water Herbie was one of the CEO Roseanne was doing so I had a big thing about Roseanne and then had all these open mic spots and it had the classes that you could take and there was a class in Boulder for $33 three Sundays in a row at the University of Colorado part of a continuing education the guy that taught his name was Jeff harms and I went the first Sunday that okay went the second Sunday that okay and the third Sunday I performed and I'm the way out he took me inside because I was not serious you are about this but you're after something if you want to do it let me know and I left there going I want to sell coke call the crack jokes all the way that be a big pop you know magician and come up with birds and I swear to god oh my god you crazy only so come follow me a comedian later I saw in the paper for doorman for comedy clubs I called it up and they said come up on the way there I call Jeff he gave me his number going onstage just call me I'll put you up somebody I think oh there's a job for a doorman at wit's end do you think I can get it and he goes I'll call the guy right now you got it just drive Dan fill out the app and tell me friends of me and they made me a doorman slash sound guy oh and the bar back quit so I was the door guy sound guy in the bar back and after about six months I can't two jobs I hated going home I had a marriage that was just  just like the ones that we all talk about when you cannot go home it's not your home anymore right I would basically leave at six come home at five take a shower eat whatever crap she cooked give it a baby a kiss and I get in my truck and go back Westminster it was a club away from the comedy works it was in Westminster but it wasn't it didn't get the best people in the world and I'm saying you have toothless people in there people shall poach bands and like that so I started out there and then in the middle of all that it took me two months to get a spot from Wendy and then I went down there at nickel saw me one of the original holders in the Comedy Store Wendy with the comedy how many work how many works in Denver it was one of the original holders when they had nickels for me told me to keep selling back but I knew when I walked off that stage that life as I knew it has attended how so whatever I thought life was at that point had gone out the window like act look sadly was up for me because sadly I was supposed to be somewhere this week but I couldn't no I had to go to my friend's mother's 80th birthday party and while I was important it was in Philly it was away from Philly she's in an old folks home because they're the second family that took me and my mom died but they took me in a crucial spot gel like you're throwing me out I'm 17 and I got nowhere to go I couldn't go to my stepfather so I had an aunt in New York and I can live with and I had a godmother in Harlem nothing wrong we were both money Joe like I was the man I just mentioned to a friend one day we're out snorting coke and drinking and I told him I know where I'm staying they gonna throw me out of a data and he wasn't even good friends with me and about a week later I saw him at school and he goes hey man I talked to my father you can move in with us that was her birthday it was on Saturday you know so when I got off the phone with her I was thinking about how important they were to me but i sterling being 17 and sitting out on that hill on 86th and county Boulevard thinking about how I had nowhere to go like this was my only shot like I had nowhere to go like nowhere that wasn't like a homeless Channel I didn't know where the to go I probably had $10 in my pocket and then the younger brother ran up to her little dog they're waiting for you to come to eat the dinner I'm over there I never met the parents how lucky am i Joe Rogan I never met the parents that's pretty lucky and I walked in and they had like six kids and it wasn't like what I was used to living they had no air conditioner the parents were blue collar and they took me in there made me a part of that home never asked me for rent wasn't the best house in the block but till this day I'm tight with all the four brothers and sisters like whoa it's like we're all one big family but think how lucky my god I'm not even talking about being thankful for the comedy bridge just a personal bridge though like I was a killer in for in them at that point I had lost all faith in humanity like I was done like I wasn't the Catholic no more I was just waiting to kill somebody that's it that's all I was wait a minute it's such a weird like I'm not even worried about the cloudy bridge no more was the personal bridge where I grew the most you know I don't even know how we got in this conversation this weed is killing me it's good weed they're gonna kill the good weed now right is that what's happening how's this work I still got some guys yeah I'm sure you do absolutely but legally for it'll still be available for medicinal people that have so we got to get a card yeah recreational it's gonna be new that car that Sun I gave that card I don't want any weed I don't want to eat your watered-down weed what are they gonna do they got to water it down how much 18% something like that but never fear but here's the thing isn't that strong good Joey's here look never fear we got a DEA one too oh wow who you think you're dealing with here Joey bananas we got state-federal we got them coming from all over you lose I am damn da yeah just in case you came just in case within the stomach and Tom Cruise of the American made the medicinal rules in Ohio recently you can't grow your own there if you have a card yeah they're sneaky with that right yeah hopefully people eventually vote that but you had to get it in there first it's the only way it would have passed they have everything wired up but it's a it's a victory because it's very gonna be very difficult to make it illegal now that it's legal it's gonna be very difficult to go backwards so then you have to figure out like why do these companies have a monopoly on making it if it's legal why can't you make it yourself aren't Tomatoes legal I can grow tomatoes can I you can even probably grows like you need a tax stamp or something to grow tobacco how does that work hmm like if you wanted to grow your own tobacco would you be able to do that like if you said I want to make my own pipes and uh you know fill them with my own tobacco I want to make my own cigars could you do that it's not possible for personal use that's crazy so if you could do that federally and then they're saying you can't in Ohio you can't grow your own weed that's so stupid that's so dumb I wouldn't do it but you should be able to if it's legal of course you should be able to grow it that's it's a plant might not grow it where can you not grow in Ohio if you have a card here's the worry the worry is that you wouldn't charge taxes you would keep the money you wouldn't be accurate you just do with cash you do cash transactions that's the worry but that would be a tax worry more that right so is that the same tobacco - yeah you can grow as much as you want you just can't sell it okay but you did not even allowed to grow their own for personal use when it comes to marijuana so it's more restrictive than tobacco which is HIGHlarious silly that's so dumb does that make any sense to you we have some wacky laws that we let sneak through like why would you let other people decide that different people in this group can't grow a plant that's legal now get the  out of here that's dumb that's a dumb rule they can't something edibles over a hundred no weed that's loose anymore so if I come into your store and I go what do you got you can't open up the container and show me the button let me smell it they all have to be sealed and stuff there's just a lot of silly rules I don't know which ones they don't I'm very hot happy I found this bag of expired Shiba choose 2015 listen you know me I make it work are they diminished in any way no no couple have a little bit of mold on them you just take the mold off I put a little brown nail polish on it nobody knows nothing like it think nothing who gives a a little mold never killed nobody molds help people yeah that song came from some mold in it something like that it's so crazy how you see it with your kids you see your kids I took my kid to science camp and when I came from Cuba had a lot of problems medically here when I came to this country and one of them was the allergies the allergies were completely different than when I was used in a different country they mind-boggling so my challenge if you ever hear me make that noise do that that's cuz I don't I can't scratch the back of my throat like normal people people do so you all sealed up up there yeah the first week of camp I saw my daughter do I felt so bad for her she would try to scratch her nose and I would see her get the frustrated Jo Road it's just scratching and scratching and scratching and now it's gonna three recent this on the cam she'll scratched how come cuz you build up your immune system oh it's so weird how you see it in front of you now you see it I see I saw in front of me like I went right to my wife and I go let me taste I'm you better think it'll doctor and get a tonsils are because that's the that started with me at that age when I came from Cuba right away I was in the hospital on a weekly level dog weekly between the tonsils and the allergies and asthma from the asthma but my mother didn't pay attention to the asthma that's why I don't have it today but I might have bits and pieces have him Mercy's got it my daughter's got it they got to do the inhaler in the whole thing as most  ruffed it's rough that's rough I've seen people have asthma attacks and you can hear the wheezing and you have no idea so I have to work it from a different angle well what can they do look if someone doesn't have it inhaler and they have an asthma attack is there a strategy or a technique my friend's mother died at a  party oh no oh my gosh having a party right there Oh a great time hasn't it and then hailer opens up your your lungs chilling scenario works my wife has the machine leave the machine the machine that blows some powder in it was a thing and then there's a regular

and then another hour at the  yogurt place jumping up and down to music and Michael Jackson Beckett really is crazy being a dad especially cuz they don't know I kidnap some male she's she has no idea she has no idea I'm a savage so she thinks I'm on the up and up like when we go to church it's like daddy look at Jesus yeah well nothing turns people more on the up-and-up than being a father it really does yeah changes who you are you're responsible for these people now and you just do you have to think of things differently you have to make sure that you provide you have to make sure that they're taken care of you got to give them love it's like whoo it's an intense world and you feel more vulnerable and it's just the whole the world around you opens up and you you also have more empathy I have way more empathy for people because I'm becoming you know as you're raising children you're seeing how they develop and then you're considering how other people have been mistreated and how things have gone terribly wrong they've been abused and beaten and up and then left in terrible situations and you realize that so much of what happens with people with even terrible behavior comes from other terrible behavior like they didn't get a chance to stop the cycle and there's a lot of people that we consider like really bad people violent people people that do terrible things they we don't even realize that so many of them are product of violence like they're a product of someone doing it to them like they've they've almost they're trying to get back at the world for all the horrible that's been done to them and there was no one there to put a stop to it there's no one there to save them there's no one there to protect them and this is what we're seeing when we see  up people we always just think of it as up people but that up person is the product of some terrible things that have happened to them almost universally almost every angry up person has come from a place where something is gone really wrong against them you know you're not angry and up if everything's awesome if every day just getting ice cream getting your dick sucked and driving a Ferrari and watching awesome movies like you know it's you there's it there's an anger that some people have violent criminals in particular that comes from someone doing that to them I had the anger job I know you've I had that anger from 1979 you had that when I met you I had that annual but no I met you I've seen it I've seen it with people although wanted to attack people was very uh alright first of all under control I was always a happy kid and but not really because I was always confused about the death of my father hmm so I always had a little certain happiness you know but I always had the Catholic faith I was really raised Catholic I always believed he wasn't happened and he was in that box when my mom did the things so he's the pain a little bit than my mother's death was just horrifying and that broke the central nervous system belief system that broke your belief in the world how can there be a God that takes a mother away from a child when you're 16 and you wrapped it around your head there's not a good result it's not gonna be a result so how I lashed out was by robbing him that was the only weapon I had in the world was to rob you Joe Rogan to me this studio would get robbed and lit on  fire and Joe knew with me and with the fuzzy gonna do I'm with carmine the you gonna do they called the cops it's Karma's gonna answer the phone next time don't with me you'll know next time not to with me when I tell you to give me that gram of coke and I'll pay on Friday you'll give it to me alright cuz that's what it was it was simple like that right hey Joe give me a hundred bucks right broke Joey but okay then I robbed your house she gave me a hundred bucks you know I was lashing out at the world right number two the other issue I had is I lost a child I lost a child I was not ready for that child at all I loved that little girl with all my heart but I was not ready for her at all my intentions are good but the result was not gonna be well I was not ready and because I lost that child and I'm in no contact with that child it makes me the better father than I am today this is never gonna happen to me again do you understand me yeah I see I see there we see daughters of comics we've seen daughters of comics and sons of comics and they're lost you know I don't want my daughter to be  lost and that's stupid Ian in that world you know you have to be there we have to be there yeah you know you have to be that I'm trying to be there as much as I can you have to feel engaged you know you have to be engaged well your parents engaged as much as you're engaged not mine but I didn't want a different world yes is a different world but my parents were very open-minded what my parents gave to me that was really important was they they're like the most non-judgmental non racist non homophobic people ever they don't judge about anything they were hippies you know when when my mom met my stepdad he had crazy long hair and he had it like all - I was like almost in high school was when he cut I was so happy when he caught it I was like people are like back then dudes grew their hair long they were hippies like legit hippies but because of that I was raised around like no racism no homophobic we had no homophobic thoughts in our house we net that never came up we lived in San Francisco from the time I was seven til I was 11 we lived all in a series Gate the one thing that did disturb me though once I was walking with my stepdad some dude whistled at him some dude was like whip you I knew that dudes were gay but there's a thing about when a dude is hitting on your straight stepdad you're like oh my goodness this is ridiculous like guys are gross it makes you realize it doesn't even really make you realize what it would like to be a chick in that same exact I grew up completely different not in my home not in my home but the surrounding you know when I would walk down the corner misto Tina would go speaker rule where you going to us you know guys there was a kid that I still talk to him on Facebook his name was Louie him and this he's Dominican Joe he's Dominican he's Dominican they didn't give a they called him Louie the nigga constantly Louie the nigga either the guys he's Dominican if they gave a they didn't give a didn't give a  so funny you know they didn't give a people were just different then it's a different world we're talking about right however there was a kid that is today gay I still talk to him he's my brother as a matter of fact he's one of my brothers I gotta be honest with you he lives in Miami he's got HIV I mean listen you didn't know he was gay when he was 12 there's something wrong mr. Latino used to call him he was light in the slippers you know Jimmy's like the slips you know and you had to sit there and take it it was whatever it should be okay for a little Jimmy light in the slippers everybody should just let him be I don't he had a dog named Tramp that wouldn't bury his dog ever like he lived outside tramps skin like when you pet the  thing was that hardest it was like like with those brushes you scrub the cameto brush mm-hmm like he lived outside tramp he followed him everywhere he was beautiful of Tramp dogs no you're very lucky cuz I do the best you know the best pets you know I grew up an environment standing with you and my man here wanna corner we see a trans gent the person crossed the street you like with a bishop for this guy as simple as that is that's a judgment that's a judgement but it was more of a sense of humor you know before we're looking at a picture of Archie Bunker America understood it because he they knew where he was coming from he wasn't saying nothing malicious it was a world where he came from right and the idea was that he was reluctantly open to occasionally take in new information America today every guys sitting at home looking at a window peeking waiting for the to get me dude there's a thousand men at home waiting right now to get me food every day a new guy gets called out for something like that what's this gonna be like in five years nobody's gonna be able to even ask for a piece [Music] will stab let me give you a little buckle ooh I think there's gonna come a time and I don't think it's gonna be very long within 10 years where we're gonna be able to read each other's minds I think we're gonna be able to communicate in a different way and I think it's just gonna be step one into some sort of a technological world where we all read each other's minds we can connect together and some almost like telepathic web way the way you use this is obviously just an idea but I think that if technology continues to give us closer and closer access to people we're gonna lose all boundaries between what a person is and you're gonna know everything about everyone's past and everyone's gonna know everything about yours and it's going to be like some unlimited library of the mind you can you can travel through anyone's mind and read anyone's thoughts and as a hundred years goes by and the technology gets better and a thousand years go by we're gonna integrate we're gonna figure out a way whether it's in our grandchildren's lifetimes or their grandchildren's lifetimes and I think that cultural shifts and things that are happening in the news and people waking up to things that they think are horrible and people trying to correct the misdeeds of the past all of that is us waking up in the middle of our culture and trying to figure out what's right figure out what's that the healthy way to move forward figure balance this thing out slow down what are we doing we're waking up as grown adults trying to figure out our system and there's some in justices those in justices have to be corrected or at least recognized we have to understand what's the difference between normal male-female interaction and what's sexual harassment what when is it when someone doesn't want you to do it when does it become a crime you know when you don't want your daughter to ever experience that and I don't want anybody that's a woman to experience real sexual harassment it's the worst thing that could probably ever happen to you cuz you can't do anything physically about it other than rape or being beaten up or murdered it's a creepy place to be in I've had guys hit on me before yeah wrote a guy hit on you before were you like wait where is this girl I was like thirteen was my fault forget in the  car I also acknowledged it and never happened again and I was go to gay penis when I was a kid like we thought it was a joke to go to a porn theater on a Sunday you're a little porno on a Sunday like we'd see your stupid friends and go to the bathroom and there's always a guy that gets next to you in the store when you go pee he looks at you dick and he smiles come on guys yeah I bumped into a lot of cream you've been out here first of all I tell you what bothers me about the current situation how I went off that this  place here has always been a  haven for sexual harassment this  neighborhood down the corner here Hollywood is with sexual harassment got invest and invented did you ever see all the stuff about Fatty Arbuckle I heard pieces about father your book but I don't need to know about Fatih I know about a chick named Marilyn Monroe then they passed around so they killed I know but a guy named Liberace we used to suck your dick and clean you out and then send you on a cold and worse he would you know the plastic surgery so you look like you look like him look don't is one of the most intense things a person's ever made a person do and let me tell you something let me tell you something else too let's walk the elephants in the room the will we hangout was known for commie hell of den of sucking dick tools and lava years the commies door while the dick sucker went down the  commie store I don't know how long Harvey Weinstein's been around but there's a song by the Eagles and 1988 was released on the long run then last out it's called the king of Hollywood on the way home put it on listen to him the car you're gonna crash your car called the king of Hollywood and hey you're getting a hold of were they talking about have to I'm gonna hit just brace it down it would be a shame just to see all that talent go to waste you know what are you willing to sacrifice wouldn't you really be just nice oh you got look at this come sit down here beside me honey let's have a little heart-to-heart that's the lyrics to this song Wow king of Hollywood 1980 nobody knew now look at me and tell me darlin how badly do you want this part yeah what's listen you put men in positions of power and hiring women like that and that that crazy position of what you're trying to cast something and you got a hundred people that want it so bad and you're you know you're some creepy dude some people actually think that this would change their life if I came to you but I want to do and when you do that thing at the end like dice yeah thanks would you do it how much think think how much do I get in how long do I have to suck them for this is like it's gonna be over pretty quick this is about the career changer if I aren't able may dude just do that right that's it oh the king of Hollywood this was Clark Gable a boozy gay man it was based off of a book apparently all this stuff that was in there but he was he alleged to be a gay man was this know this but there was also a book released in Hollywood in 1997 or a cold you'll never work in this town again so those lyrics were about Clark Gable yo I'm sorry I thought yes yeah yeah yeah but then there was a book released in the nineteen ninety seven or eight in this Hollywood called you'll never work in this town again and it was about a chick who described all her sexual relationships and a bunch of people in town and she had described  Don Henley the drummer from the Eagles to guy that sings and he would get hookers to come up to the house wouldn't even talk to me well why them up don't even make understand me bend over so he would sit on the couch bend over where'd you hear this this is his book why he'll never work in this town again Jesus Christ said he would  you never eat lunch in this town again oh he never eat lunch and he would take the thing do a line of coke get up and walk up to one of them putting their ass a little bit  pump it twice and then going I'll be back in five minutes he would go sit down put his feet up through another line if he would do that for eight hours just get up one for five minutes and sit back down before he'd come so he would never crack a nut and he would just keep snorting to keep my heart on alive fish so who the knows listen you know it's like they all threw the party under the bus but these animals have been doing this says Jesus loves Chicago says Jesus bless Chicago listen when I read that article about the Cuban Superman that they Brando was sleeping with what they blatantly talked about in that article was exactly what was seen today only behind closed doors that Cuba had become a haven for sex will you go see a go get I mean didn't they pass a rule this week in Mexico then a girl could get if she's 12 years old hmm you really need that room really that's the rule you need this everyone just got past something that you could be to the 812 years old is they active and this is mascot the Mexicans your age you're something 12 years old years old we just can say why is a woman 12 years old that's insane that's insane it's scary it is real don't you believe that oh my God look at this the federal law established at the age of 12 as the minimum age of consent while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is a teen sex with someone 12 to 18 is not illegal per se but can still be open to prosecution under certain circumstances what does that mean so it's it's age 12 is the age of minimum age of consent but the age in which there are no restrictions for consensual sex is 18 so the idea is that sex between someone who's 12 and 18 it's not illegal but they might be able to lock you up if you do something super creepy but that is nuts man you imagine if there was like some person that just only went after 12 or not what is that that's the United States of Mexico its Mexico so that's why people would fly that isn't actually I typed in Mexico but this is an article on Wikipedia about age you can sit North America what's this federal law so wait a minute that what I just read was about North America how is that real I just saw North America too and that's why I asked other states right I'm sorry not in North America United States of America right North America is Canada - that is that is the that is a not possible thing how is it is that really possible the 12 to be the age of consent anywhere what are you talking about that's crazy it is 18 right just a federal law of Mexico Mexico yeah you scared the out of me Jaime no it don't looking here in America it's no yes yes that's what article is about North America age of consent in North America and there is states here where it's lower than a watch yeah like there's a couple I believe it's fourteen dude is that real I might have changed it okay so well by the 117 the 12 are the ones that were in white which is that's in Mexico right okay there are spots and all the way up to coast right yeah that side but that that whole thing is 12 years olds the age of consent a blue is all 16 whoo that's a lot of states 16 that's kind of crazy a lot of US states how could 16 that's crazy fourteen eight excuse me what is this a Central America oh it's for 14 to 18 and Central America interesting that's uh that age of consent thing is bananas go back to that little map again please that is weird to look at I would have thought there'd be way less of those 16 look how many 16s there are and what are the darker ones can you scroll all the way down so we can see the whole scale so 17 is that and then Wow cactuses Green is 18 so there's only like Florida 12 there's less greens and there are blues more stage of cadet consent is 16 is this current is that possible this is not current it seems nuts Alaska 16 - hmm I assumed it was all 18 Florida was like 8 you know Florida could be like seven six and a half you never know that I'm that crazy place is a crazy place that's where white people go to boogie like I just found out about there was a time you go down and just buy pills over the counter or something go pain doctors pain medication yeah like I just read this recently that that all got abolished um that's why so many people left Florida there were people moving to Florida in droves just for those pain doctors and droves I don't know about this yeah well there's a great documentary that we've talked about many times called the oxycontin Express and they sort of documented that whole route from Ohio and Kentucky and all the way down through Georgia all the people that would go into Florida just to get pain pills all you had to do is just get into Florida and you get a doctor and say you hurt your back and they would have a pharmacy right next to the doctor's office and all the pharmacy had his pain pills so you go there you tell the doctor you're hurt the doctors is great here here's some serious hardcore drugs that can kill you don't take more of these he'll die they're super powerful opiates but since I wrote wrote it on this piece of paper you can go buy it so you go next door and you're buying you're buying the hardest of hardcore you're buying hillbilly heroin you're buying oxycontin and you're going deep now I've never done that I did morphine when I got my knee operated on they gave me the little pump thing and you press it and press it and press it and you want to get more morphine I don't I have no idea what oxycontin feels like but that morphine felt wonderful Felix I kinda did not feel good was it feel like I ate it one time and that was good enough for me so he's almost like it you're I mean everybody likes different you know I like blow but I do like meth well would it would it oxy do for you like why is it not good I took a little tiny piece like I'm always a fan of some that might put me to sleep I feel like this could put you to sleep you know what I'll give it a shot I like sleeping you try to go to sleep on oxycontin yeah I didn't know I go what he goes you you might pass out so he gave me a 16th it was there was nothing there right there was nothing that I popped it and I just felt like my blood pressure drops like I couldn't even do anything so I went to sleep I just know never to take that again this certain I've taken that I just knew that I was never gonna that just wasn't gonna work for me damn you know heroin has that effect to for a little while like it takes you somewhere and if you don't put the brakes on this and your gun on that thing don't even know how to describe it but I don't like that feeling you know the cocaine feeling you like in the beginning then word goes you don't like it then it gets worse and worse and worse but by that time you're a dick to it in the same math I never understood that wanted to be up for four days that that just seems and you will be up with two days thinking you tired let me go lay down I won't say anything I can't sleep I'm sweating off my other dose of sweat so pills I've always had I like a little  sleeping pill or something but because this album apnea yeah they're too dangerous right I could take the anxiety medication that'll help me sometimes I'll pop a few of those what if I get stuck there like acid Pam but they're like 1.5 do nothin nobody 0.5 they don't like find the weed lets you go to sleep we at night don't do dick you ever see me at night smoking weed really because the initial effect was in the daytime that's what you like I like that morning high because that's the one that gets the hole that's the one that lets me email text we'd think think dot dot dot dot dot all by nine o'clock hmm all by nine o'clock get it out of the way yeah so if I'm up at Corliss six put the coffee on open up the computer feed the cats I don't Pablo it see there's people who Pablo it that's no bueno Escobar it yeah what's a Pablo it open your eyes and bed roll over and take a joint and smoking that's no bueno y'all let your body wake up that's no bueno that's the quickest way was that thing yet let me take a hit of that I love that little blunt that Gino from speed we'd Jamie pick this one up this is we don't want this is a what's it called Hollywood's yeah waking up and pull them apart yeah it's medicine man okay but you wake up and give you a body some chance to like I remember smoke of cigarettes in the morning you don't know what what damage is to your body until you wake up in the morning take six steps sit down and pull a cigarette out the light there is no worse damage a human being can do that body forget heroin forget even a few avocados forgetting the Burger King whopper her get up at 6:00 in the morning give yourself three minutes and light a cigarette your body does not recover from that you don't know how bad this do you stop doing it that's damaged so I look at it the same day way with reefer I let my body wake up a little bit better the hair drink water let the body's heat drink a glass of water with ice let my body's heat wake up get the stomach going drink a little coffee and then bang out some reefer oh lordy mm-hmm it's a different day and you like to work out in the morning - right I'm 55 I can't come to your house late o'clock in it but I can't I'm not gonna roll we're 6:00 in the morning most heart attacks happen before 1:00 do that yeah how come I don't

good at 9:00 to kickbox 10:00 to kickbox 11:00 12:00 to jujitsu eyes yeah you gotta wake everything up that's the whole deal heart attacks are more common in the morning says Fox News 5 to 6 times more likely to occur in the morning hours between 1 and 5:00 a.m. and studies have shown that morning heart attacks tend to be more severe than those that happen later in the day too long or too short of an interval can result in abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias as a matter of fact other stuff giving mother stabbing in the mornings do worried about hard taxes yeah cuz that was my more I love more than the wake them up well when you kick mama with that leg in the water you never saying give me a little wife a tap in the morning she pops her head up and then they they already know they get up they pee they dry the monkey good they come back naked you eat that  monkey and then you start giving them a stab him like a soldier and that stabbing dog I would have to get up and start breathing heavy and I thought about that that gangster was gonna testify that time in court and he bent over to Pattaya shoes and they had a heart attack and think I ended up doing her in jail and we got to talk about that too in a second but we will cover the heart attack I take a baby aspirin before I go I drink something from GNC to get me going a little bit in the mornings I still take my tonic protein powder I live by but I do take a supplement before I go to the gym and I do drink something while I'm at the gym to calm me down a little bit would you drink something from GNC hmm you don't know performance levels hmm I always pop a shroom tech again I don't pop - shroom text I pop one and I started with a half a capsule because I was finding my heart was beating too much wants to take that yeah you gotta watch the ticker that's interesting you know listen the God gives you a certain amount of text to the heart I did coke that that up the whole clock that that up the speedometer you got sand in your dial yeah I got sand in the Dow's I got up the speed ominous and I got a strengthened a little bit and that's what strengthens it but there's a lot of you could do without thinking like a marathon or something yeah I watch my fingers no numbness I go I get a finger up my ass as much as I could from the doctor I use I over use insurance dollars like I'm going Friday for a blood test why because I'm in the mood you gotta switch out the blood every couple months I'm saying yeah I'll switch it out my Keith Richards he's still alive cuz he switched to that looking women don't die of heart attacks why cuz they bleed every month were the only assholes that don't take the boy what's the matter what you tell you're like a bullet I'm just just so anybody okay relax no I'm enjoying your conversation you just smoking so much way to get in paranoid take five minutes off that thing you just been just sucking it down and getting deeper and deeper into the

going down there tonight yeah I got spot tonight yeah nice I wanted to fall in love again with it I wanted to uh it's good to take time off things it's really weird how you live and you learn and you still fall for dumb you know the only person I should listen to when it comes to comedy is you and I don't see you enough and I don't talk to you enough about that I got to get out more planes with you because when I tried I watched a John Mulaney special and I fell in love with his joke writing and stuff he's a very funny guy really nice guy really nice guy that's great  special you know but every once in a while I'm sorry I'm saying this word I always think I get the white moment and I'm not a white comic the reason why you like me and the people like me is because you don't know what's gonna come out of my mouth when I become a writer that's when I'm not a comedian normal oh my go home and start writing stupid jokes and you laugh at them I'm not Joey Diaz no more that's not what Joey Diaz as opposed to saying no that's not supposed to do yeah but this that's happened now scares the  out of me so now I gotta go up there you paid 25 bucks to see me I got it one thing and leave my soul up there I take that seriously now but I'm starting to get a little bit too seriously this you see now for in what way the people coming to the shows people coming to the shows to see you they mean they want to do you to see you do well so I go up there with this plan material that I work on hard that I believe in that because I'm a lot friendlier when I go up down I just  yell and scream and go off the cuff and go crazy and my eyeballs turn red but no I want to be John Mulaney cuz he makes me laugh he's what in your mind to chew comic it yeah everybody's get their own way of doing it no and that's what I realize I'm going back to being a lunatic I'm going back to midnight spots next week I'm going back to midnight spots mmm I'm going back to Cali Cali Cali going back to Cali yo I'm going back to those Paul Mooney spots I know they're late but they're the only ones that keep you if you're gonna play it if you listen for me to be in uniform there's the only way I could do it

again three nights a week because I can handle it that means I get home at 1:00 I'll stay up to 132 you're gonna do the late spots yeah you know why the reason why I do this early is because I'm trying to be normal I read that book your podcast like I said okay now I like this hold on a second so you're gonna close out the store and do like an hour-long set no no fifteen twelve to twelve fifteen Oh so you're not gonna do like the dombarris situation the least for the most I'm just saying you go but you can if you're closing out the show right you could go long I don't want to close out the show one of the more I don't to be I'm scared to go out at night so it's not I thought you were saying you want to do the Kinison spot that's the Midnight's right a midnight spot when he would do that oh that spot oh I thought he was always the last guy ah I didn't I thought was thought I mean that's what they always say about Brody wait does the Kinison spot and no I don't know I thought

much it's up to they don't they don't no one jumps on does an hour and a half like the old days I miss I missed that 12 o'clock thought of mind the dog process at 12 for me in the old days was I swear to god Joe they've already heard everything yeah if they if I think they really want to hear these dumb three jokes but bargain I have another think of it and it taught me how to write really good what do you what has changed recently like then one of the things a lot of people have been saying with especially the me to movements that people are more cautious about saying controversial jokes now do you feel that you feel like energy in the air being different do you feel like it's more sensitive I know you won't get mad at me I feel the energy is different but guess what G what it don't

way eyes the way you do it from your profit you know when I watch the Richard Pryor thing and I know he want to throw the Hollywood ball and they were doing the things for gays and he went up there when against the gays I got it is it something I would do I don't know I don't know but it's who was supposed to be in a way as a comedian was supposed to be the social column of society in a way in some way so now you want to take that away from me you want to take the way I can't say I grew up on the word retarded I grew up on the word I grew up on the word I grew up on a lot of words that people don't accept today and I'm very sorry that you don't accept them but it's too late for me to change my game right now yeah I'll try my hardest I tried my hardest I'm still gonna say tranny from time to time I know it offends but when you're a comic listen man the first seven minutes of to any news is about what's going on in the world the next 10 minutes is bad I never talk about politics mom to top it off I'm a felon so I need to talk about farm pond I'm saying my vote there's just things I'm not gonna talk about kicking an abortion child number for a long time every comic was you know I'm kicking a board and freida here that's not my style I'm updated talking about you know for the board yeah yeah you go to comedy shows and there's always a drunken ology shock that wants to be shocking I'm not here to be shocked I mean I'm here to tell you how I see it you want to get how I see it this is how I see it if I offend you I offend you before in the beginning of the show I said some very offensive in today's time but in my reality was real you want firecrackers you buying from a Chinese dude charlie why is that racist because that's racist but it's ready how's it real factual Chinese people out of fireworks right move there's there's weird ones that we all let fly like black dudes at big dicks no one's complaining about that right you ever hear that you assume black dude as a big dick does anybody complains probably they look into now that might be like maybe I'm the first one to get called out on it that's racist to think that black dudes have big dicks is it is if it's positive is it pop is like a positive attribute racist like if you said Asian people are better at math people would say that's racist how is it racist if they're really good at something like if they have more talent or skill or more accomplishments how's it racist but this isn't that racial if it's good right like Jews accept it if you tell Ari that more European Jews won Nobel science prizes is like of course we're smarter of course is it is it racist to talk about how many Jews are so smart like why is that why they say goddamn smart if you thinking about how many German and European Jews we're like serious geniuses it's a it's a crazy trend like what happened over there Callen was trying to explain it to me once but their values their education and experiences and what led to just google the numbers of European Jews that have won Nobel science prizes it's kind of like it's eye-opening you know how many guineas from New Jersey zero zero guineas from New Jersey when in science right none of my relatives win in science project looking us up a couple weeks ago it was hard to look oh is it when European Jews that of won the Nobel science prize try that I don't know I don't even know what these numbers I'm talking about in my ass I know that it's I've definitely heard it discussed that there was a giant number what are you doing over there Joey dinners doesn't text me and let me know what party I need to be at Oh fourth of July baby this is our our country's birthday is a time that we should cherish I think we should play the national anthem maybe later we got okay we gotta play the national anthem real quick they have all this more than by my house I loved it I love it so how was your experience doing your Netflix special everything was great Netflix I'd take my hats awesome everything was great it was my fuckup it was my fuckup I let it get into my head too much I listened to too many people when I forgot the number one thing just be funny that's it be yourself doesn't matter lame people how many each shows did you film to first of all I think was a disaster the second one I redeemed myself a little bit we'll put something together we'll save something so now I'm working really hard like now and now I'm going back to my home I stand up again it's hard when you know even only have two shows even only two shows it's time for yeah more no more listen this has nothing to do with me I was stand-up comic that's why I signed up before hmm well I got 55 maybe I gotta stop now you're gonna shut me down now no what we get started is what we get started we got - we got daughters when do you think about do you think about ever stop and doing stand-up cuz I do occasionally I think about it and then I take a flight back with dice from New York and I look at dice for him before I approach him I sit down and look at him from 10 feet away for 10 minutes and I think to myself is this what I want to be doing at that age and I think about what what would we be doing but we'd be doing you really want to be around your wife and yet daughters every weekend every week you're already used to leave it in one week at least a lot you're already used to it there's gonna be a casino somebody's gonna pay you once a month to leave the house for two but if you would you be happy with your act if you're only going out once a month like if you weren't going up and practicing going out once a month could be awful but don't say this I'm saying you're still hosting the pizza place on Wednesday nights what and you still let's pretend you move to  Columbus Ohio okay okay moved to Columbus Ohio miss Ohio and you worked the funny bone once a year right and you do your little pizza open-mike somewhere down the come on in a couple of nights a week they looked he was the older guy they all came up looking the calmly watching it you know they listened to you you know when I started in economy I started the guys name was George McKelvey and choice McKelvey was a really special guy Jojo because he had blue it's a night show with whatever as a comic as a stand-up and that's the epitome for one of us whether he became Richard Pryor or not he was on what's his name come on knowing but Tonight Show Johnny Carson any closer they did stand-up and Johnny put him on the couch you know that the real I mean George McKelvey was the real deal when George was 70 I'll never forget he called me one man he's like hey what are you don't kid I know I'm sitting he goes drive to Colorado Springs and get on stage open up for me I go I can't get on that stage because the famous manager that was that that's that that Club at the time mm-hmm wouldn't let you get on stage unless you took that comedy class for 35 bucks oh that was a scam a lot of guys do those  up I'll waive it so he threw me on stage and this old guy like me that old guy had no career basically he did the local places he owned two clubs and he worked a couple clubs and hired him still he died on the road or whatever my point being that he helped me a lot as an old guy like I looked on and at first my first opinion of him was I was of this old loser no it wasn't a no loser he had been doing it for dirty is he committed to this and no matter what has turned out was or whatever he was still a comic he died a comic I talked to him maybe twe isn't until he died I lost contact with well George Carlin died on the road you know one greatest of all time I don't want to die on the road I know you don't know but I can't for years I thought I wouldn't be doing this at 50 guess what I'm 55 I'm sorry you're not just doing it this is what's important you're still letting it swing you're still having fun and doing a lot of crazy that gets you in a lot of trouble today this is what I brought up with we're talking about the you know in air quotes me too era people are going after people today for good or for bad and to still have a wild controversial act in this politically what do you hold on one second well this is what are we going after me two people for for me taking in the back grabbing your titties grabbing your or for you sucking my dick for a movie role or for something like that all those things really don't exist in my life right I have a wife and I have a child they don't exist them right if you want to come at me for sucking my dick at night in 2002 we were both doing blow good be my guest be my guest but I want to see footage I can't be I'm see I'm sorry and take it and just eat him saying yeah there's a lot of people out there they're gonna get me to look at this other guy for years he was known as a heroin addict never got occlusive of sexual misconduct and some chick said she molested her when he was 11 years old and I think you need that you need that and the chicks on drugs she's doing the press conference while she's on drugs what's his name brother the one the guy that was in heat that DeNiro put him in the rehab himself and then he married Heidi Fleiss for a while who was with Heidi Fleiss from Tom yeah that guy's been a junkie for 2,000 years all of a sudden why can't I remember his awesome sighs more sighs Oliver sighs some girl comes up when she had 26 question yeah he molested me on the movie set when I was 11 that's great and dandy dog but you can't ruin some of these life now but do you what do you think is happening this is my question like why are why are people accepting these these situations like the Chris Hardwick situation or why is everybody instantly thinking that the guy's guilty no one giving him a check for the doubt no court no Justice Court there's no nothing and in some some cases like the worst case was Garrison Keillor Garrison Keillor's the host of the lake will be gone chronicles like this radio show on PBS I think it is is that what it is he apparently hugged a woman and his hand went down her back this is this is the the depiction and he apologized to her and he sent her an email she said don't worry about it it's no big deal it was nothing and then they continued I believe to correspond and we're friends again and then this all this stuff started happening with Al Franken and then he had this complaint brought up by this woman she reintroduced it and said that a long time ago he put his hand on my back and they canceled his show they took his name off of it and they did it like really quickly and it's one of those things where he just go okay really like the guy in one moment in time touches someone's back I don't know if it was creepy or not let's assume it was a terrible error and it was creepy I don't think it was I don't know I'm not saying I know but that's it just touching someone's back and you that is a hysterical reaction that is hysteria that's almost a definition of hysteria you're not talking about an evil person I'm talking about a person who touch someone's back like we gotta be real careful with what you destroy a person's whole life with so on the one side you have the worst case scenario which is like a Bill Cosby who's drugging people and raping people it's the worst case scenario for these powerful elite type people that are getting these women into their web and probably warns them right he's another one which they were all in on it and everybody knew about it written into his contract it was sexual harassment clauses were in his contract right wasn't that it was known for years sure election night we read Harvey's under that bothers me about Harvey I mean Harvey what we gotta invite everybody there's a lot of people that have to be indicted and this is my feeling my feeling right now this would be this should be a RICO Act this is a RICO Act agents manages Oprah Eddie because everybody knew everybody Weston how much do you know everybody's knew in 2005 right everybody know Joe Diaz was a coke fiend that's a different thing though it's the same let's pretend the same thing okay but look Joe Diaz is a coke fiend it's 2007 Joe Diaz comes to a party your house there's two cell phones missing okay let me let me say this though do you think that it's possible that his behavior was shielded from some of the people that he interacted with like Hillary Clinton or Oprah or Bill Clinton or whoever that was that they some high-profile people that he interacted with is it possible they didn't know is it possible they just thought he was a hound no or do you think they own they knew he was a  hound and they heard a little chitter chatter but it's okay it's a chance it would just let him that's number one that's crazy number two Jamie you ready for this oh Jesus okay I see Joe whatever not now 25 years ago I see Joe and the first thing I had to go was Joe before you leave don't forget how to start what was that story about about that's in hand this is joke about a joke that somebody said the store loan and buy the place I went to and some chick took me in the back I've stuck my dick under the car and then she stuck a finger of my ass that's what we talked about so if that's what we talked about you're gonna look me in the his face like a man that you are in the men that you've been around and tell me Harvey Weinstein never turned the bread or his other bodies and lesseps remind me to tell you story about that dirty  animal for sure okay that for sure especially that that been admitted I think they've had conversations oh my god if you don't get the wig Ben Affleck and the other guy I'm not offended no but I'm just talking boys good boys yes what you won't say to Jamie you'll say them maybe you want you watch blind date no I'm there was a movie blind this movie there's a movie named blind date with Bruce Willis oh I remember that movie Kim Basinger hilarious Kim Basinger steals the show when she walks in the Japanese lady she's like you know you're entitled to 50% of your husband's assets in California and the Chinese woman kept saying me now speak English I mean uh speak English you know you're in town 50% and she opens up the door fifty percent fifty percent that movie's a great more but this is seen in the opening of that movie both of those actors are around where the guy comes up to me goes you're not gonna believe what happened last night and Bruce Willis goes here we go one of these sex stories again and then goes so I'm at Spago's I have for dinner I walk out and some lady pulls up on the limo and I say she goes we'll get in we're riding down sunset hard times in the summer and next thing you know she's sucking my dick she's got leotards on I'm eating her ass and he's telling the story and Bruce Willis listen he goes no no why does this always happen to you this is some other incident and he goes this party starts whipping how Polaroid's I've always known one of those guys in my life of course we've all known one guy my life difference between that guy and what Harvey why does not believe stuff yeah I know that but I also believed that Harvey Weinstein was telling people he probably was because they listened for everybody telling him was he telling them that he was holding people down was he telling if he's raping pieces a piece of ass no not at all do you think that he did well yeah he's a piece ass she's a piece of ass he's got to see her suck a dick right she'll do anything she's an animal well that's what we do his meant with braggadocio so do you think there was like a community of that were actors and actresses I think he had four or five guys that knew what he was doing I want you to remember being 27 and having four you boys that would come back every Monday with a different story to karate school yeah I hate her ass I her on fire whatever the is that you do he told somebody somebody know about all these stories some agents knew somebody because for the hundreds of them that said no and whatever there had to be 25 he was playing the percentages Joe well definitely a lot of a people said yes they blamed that one girl they had a man that one girl that did rounders they accused her yeah heard that that played Matt Damon's girlfriend she was she went from being an extra and Donnie Brasco to being a guest starred opposite  yeah if you watch Donnie Brasco she's what's his name Sonny Black's girlfriend you know me in line she has in that movie zero zero smart move and then a year later she's a guest yeah opposite so I said yes do you but you fault the girl for doing that though if a girl decides to go he wants to go on her own free will when we come here with a dream and there's two ways to enhance that dream does either I always knew that I wasn't good looking at always low as fat I always knew I was already hard to listen to but I always know that I was funny so I always worked on being funny I didn't think somebody was I don't let me suck their dick or eat their to be a star so that was all never in my mind but think about people who how many people have you met that would sell their soul on this town how many people have come and gone and front of you the reason why our friendship is still intact is because you know more you know how he's a hard worker you respect hard work how many times if he pulled me aside and said look at this  clown and you're not trying to be judgmental you just know that he's pulling the wool over somebody's eyes we know who's talking to talking we know walking the walk we see it on stage we air about it you don't need Twitter or Facebook here about it we get to that Club the club or the hotel you Joe Joey was here two weeks ago you just fall asleep onstage you know he is right so it's the same thing yeah no I think so I think I think what's one of the things that stand-ups good for is that it's it's an exercise you're doing while you're living your life and the better your standup gets it's usually a better indication that you're thinking better like you're your life's more in order you're more tuned in you know you're doing stuff that's hitting harder because you've got better points you know how to edit it better and usually that that you can use that I think it's like never see remember that moving mo better blues Denzel Washington I love that movie it's one of things I loved about that movie I got inspired to work on my act after them will be I was like thinking about how much musicians practice he was just always practicing and these girls these hot girls want to and you're like no no right now I got a practice I got a practice I was like damn the discipline crazy discipline that that man has to play that trumpet and practice it over and over again and it made me really think like as a comic we don't work like that we don't have to rehearse all day you know we don't really rehearse at all but musicians like a really good musician I mean they're always working they're always trying and training and working on their craft and we do it on stage in front of people probably more than a lot of musicians do unless they're you know constantly regularly touring but it's we don't we don't have that kind of a work ethic attached to what we do if you want to play a phenomenal trumpet those guys their breath control and the way that can blow those horns man they practice all the time they put in hours and hours working on that and I was thinking about it like that's a different kind of craft it's a different kind of craft the ability to play a musical musical instrument if about stand-up that becomes a problem sometimes is that it's kind of you can kind of pull it off like you could do it really well or you can kind of pull it off and to kind of pull it off you don't need a whole lot of effort you've seen a few good subjects and a few good ways of expressing it but to get that where you can kind of pull it off and turn it into a bit that just smashes a bit that you put it in you can't wait to get to that punchline because you know it's gonna be a nuclear bomb that's where the real work comes in and I think for a lot of us it's the difference between how much energy you put towards anything whether it's your stand-up comedy or painting or whatever the you do how much energy you put towards your writing how much energy you put towards thinking about it the more you can do the better it's gonna be and that's a fundamental thing that nobody ever tells you people tell you should write but it's not just that you should write you should also listen to your you should also perform but the whole key to it all is just applying different kinds of focus towards your act and if you look at like a movie like mo better blues like he's doing Isaac he's playing that trumpet and you realized like this guy it's like lost in the act of practicing this beautiful musical instrument and this is his craft and he takes pride and being excellent at his craft he could just hang around all day and still probably blow an awesome tune at night but no he practices and I remember thinking about that going tam that's probably something that's missing from the lives of most stand-ups and I should probably try to think about that more with my own life I love I love the writing and I love the performing I hate the listening yeah that's a hard part listen this is a very rough for me and I listen I forced myself in before the special I forced myself to listen a lot and it made me too over critical hmm you know got me to over critical a week before I taped I also went to places that I didn't put my name on the gazebo just to see how my jokes are doing front of regular people and that up my head a little bit I made a lot of couple of little mistakes in training camp but that's what training hands for fool don't worry yes no I agree listen I've been doing this for 27 years I love doing it I get better every  year by breathing I get something better going up on stage or confidence levels and talk it's 27  years you're gonna be doing a 30 this year yep next month is gonna be 30  years did you ever see yourself doing this for 30 years I still remember walking into the main room admits he was in her booth and Paul was on stage slicing that room apart and she called me old as she goes - what happens when you benzoin come he says 20 years like that that was like damn I mean don't call me for 11 I still got another 9 and now I'm at 27 crazy and it's like you watch people like jaja right who will you up you'll be in you'll get that hell you think you got them in the  guillotine yeah next thing you know you're on your back looking up your arms or and that's what kind of we're doing right now I feel myself when I see a guy with a choral belt on I'm like that's the level now that we're at I can control a lot of Joe one of your secrets was following me was putting yourself in bad positions yeah which in jujitsu is like getting the biggest guy in the room away you busy right now do not tell me although I was taking you on the road with me they'd be like what the is wrong get on top of me and just choke me you taking me on the road is like somebody going hey come in for a second what do you wait 300 I weigh 140 get on top of me an amount and put one hand there and we'll start there yeah let's start right there yeah start right  there but only if you think about it that way see this is what's what was important about and there's one one things is important about traveling with all really funny people it only becomes negative when you think at it as a negative when someone's funny you should be laughing and enjoying it and it makes your time more enjoyable when you go on stage yes it does I needed to learn that and the way I learned that one of the ways was going on the road with you I knew that you were gonna crush and so I knew that everybody else would like to take you know we were both relatively young in our comedy careers back then right so it was like we're talking about I've been doing comedy maybe nine years or eight years but you were a lot wiser about the game like you introduced me to I had never even liked I read a few books and watched a few tapes but you had the practical knowledge that I needed like you were the Vote tech school well what I did is I thought about it the same way I thought about martial arts that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go on the road with you all the time I was like you don't get better or sparring people that suck you get better when you spar with wizards you got to be real careful when you're sparring with wizards and so it's like what I would need to do is have someone who goes on stage in front of me and just crushes we had some I had some tough sets going on after you I remember one time in Rascals Rascals in West Orange right was in West Orange East Orange West West Orange New Jersey  great club but you went up and you got into it with some people in the audience about something and you were just on fire just on fire you crushed and I had a real hard time going on after you and I remember thinking oh okay this is a very important lesson like this is important like there's something that I'm not doing right that he is doing right like what am i how come I'm not oh I'm nervous I'm nervous going on after him so I'm not having fun up there so he's having fun and I'm being tense going oh Jesus it's better not suck so I'm putting in my head this better not suck it's the total wrong way to a prayer like if you approached a fight like that man you're gonna get smashed most likely you want to approach a fight thinking about the things you're gonna do not the things that you want to like worry about what's gonna happen if you get hit you don't think like that you just think about doing your thing and then adjusting along the way and I had the wrong mindset and I needed to see someone kill a bunch of times in front of me and then bomb go after them to realize something's wrong here the wrong thing is that I'm going onstage tense because someone was funny that's ridiculous like I should be the opposite I should be happy that someone was funny because I love comedy and this is what I like to do I mean I like to watch it if I'm not doing it so why am I so tense it's just a bad way of approaching a problem and I think this is one of the things that people up in life you approach a problem the same way every time and you never stop and just completely look at the whole thing from the top down just look at the whole thing go what what am I trying to do here I'm trying to get tighter and funnier and better what do I gotta do do a lot of sets I got a right and I got to work with murderers that was the key it's like working with guys like you and all of us working together and also people knew if they came to see us like hey this isn't just gonna be Joe goes up and he's the hero of the show no you're gonna get re who's gonna go on and murder you're gonna go on and murder and then I'm gonna go up I mean it's a  Rock'em Sock'em robots show we had we went on the road dude we did college I mean clubs rather across the country we did I mean who knows how many  cities you and I and our retort on crazy numbers just over and over again bonding together hundreds of shows together figuring out how to  get everything perfect figure out the right amount of weed to smoke before you go on stage the right amount of getting Joey Diaz riled up you would come in yelling about something or here I want you to see something I'd go into the bathroom they'd be a it looks like a crocodile trying to crawl out of the toilet bowl all that stopped up that's some rock and roll comedy man you know it helped both of us it helped both of us a lot and it also like set a tone that I think for a lot of us like you should be with funny people should all everybody should try hard should not like think that anybody doing good is bad for you it's great it's great for you it's great for everybody that everybody's like doing good together is better for everybody when I go on the road now I go onto the road of those Joe Rogan principals like that's my whole Road thing the only thing I added to the only G kundo I add it to it is my travel I'm gonna now fast I don't around the car I don't want to see nobody I mean yeah there's no radio necessary I play just like yeah they'll try yeah because they have relationships with local radio stations you know Casey WI wants to get you in there but if they're cool I go in because you want to talk to the people yeah on the way up the same people push your way down there's a lot of people that were there for me when I wasn't sorry yeah the station the problem is that waking up in the morning and you got to get in there a day earlier cuz if you want to do Friday morning you got to get in there Thursday now you can't just show up Friday 3:00 p.m. I can't do it I fly out Thursday at 6:00 a.m. that's the best you got out of me right because I got the family and I got a lot of it's not like it used to be mad itself but the thing that I love about like this time is that even though people are super sensitive like we were talking about people are real sensitive about getting in trouble for stuff there's still Rock'em Sock'em robots comedy going on it's still wild out there like dudes are still doing crazy  jokes it's it's fun people are taking real chances they're doing real stand-up you know and it's there's a lot of them it's bill burr there's you me and go down list re always doing real stand-up you know there's a bunch of real killers now Santino he's doing some dangerous sand up you know that's it like the reason the point of that story I told you being on top of that hill at 17 and being homeless mm-hmm is because I had a lot of chances to ice myself show a lot I have chances to ice myself think you kept not a prison and think I'm getting out on bail well I got a bail I had a lot of doubts my friend think I'm bailing knowing you're gonna look at the 48 years and you're a loser as it is think of all those opportunities I used to break into a friend's house to sleep in this house I slept in a rocket ship for a month outside of the park you park you see those rocket ships and your kids play on them I still go up to the third floor the rocket ship finishing off my coke and jerking off on the third floor at 5:00 in the morning outside in a park with leaves around me and there was a lot of times I had it's amazing you have no idea I would go up to the third floor with a bottle of Smirnoff silver vodka a bag a hooded sweatshirt gloves with a missing finger so I could touch the rock and look at my nose and you know that's all that's all funny on the way up the stairs is but when you're when you come down and you're in that rocket ship that's 5:00 in the morning it's 20  two below zero oh and you just take him to yourself  God took away my mother God did this this is all God's fault because it's the same God that I was raised to believe that was gonna help me he's doing all this but a lot of times I wanted to him do a swan dive but I didn't you know it's so weird I was in those positions for a long time yeah now I gotta look at you and go Jesus Christ look at like Irish no no Tina Turner's son killed himself yesterday it was a nice son though I thought it was Ike son with it you know this trend the people icing themselves that scares me that concerns me is this something were eating this it's something that we're getting weak on you know there was no drugs in bourdain system so we can't blame  prescription drugs he was on one medication some sort of medication and it was something that was prescribed for him someone told me that it was malaria medication I don't know probably I don't know if they've released that but I'm sure he had to take some of that stuff sometimes but you know you don't know what it was that did him in I mean what does into some people he really wasn't doing well you know I don't know I need to I mean it's almost unnecessary to get from mediate the full story I miss the guy he's gone that's it you know I don't need to I think whenever whenever someone does something like that whatever it is if there's one thing that people could point to and say hey there's a chemical that's responsible for this or there's a gene problems responsible for this or they're like how could someone who's loved so much want to step out I mean that must be a terrible moment of pain right and it just keeps playing songs you know control I think I I started with letting skin at a simple man right I kept going on one let's get a trip and I when I came back and at one point blow up the outside world oh and I'm sitting there and he says that one about going out of something Joe Rogan my lip started shaking like I'm like I don't even know this guy I miss him know this guy you want me to look you people tell you I know I'm a queer I met Chris I don't know I don't know I never I saw him one time at the Comedy Store six feet away from me Chris Cornell that's it and I started crying like how could something like this go in a room and just ice themselves is this what I'm gonna do because I'm in this entertainment field because what what happens and then I think about all these times one time I broke into my friend's house and I broken the window and it was freezing so I couldn't even sleep in that room at asleep in the hallway and there was a mattress on the wall that had like piss stains from all the kids and I pulled it down I slept on it when I woke up he had a dog and it was it was too cold he just let the dog downstairs and there was like 20 pieces of little rolled up that had been like when the juice goes out of them they just roll up what's those things that uses it I'm organ out of those accordions accordions it was like a piece of shrinks like an accordion when the moisture goes out of it it really does so if you take a that's this big right and you put it in a box come back a week later it's like this big how do I know that cuz I did it to a guy in prison I took a in the welfare box oh Jesus the boxes of cheese where the cheese comes in American cheese yes this dude had a long hair and we'll always try to play me like he was with the biker dudes a box farm but he played he where he lived in the kyboot worked in the kitchen he forgot I ran the kitchen and it was all me and black dudes so one day I got one of the well fat cheese boxes and I took like a 22 24 inch it was like a lizard it just it was just long like you know then at the end like one of those things that hang like a snail that's like a long brown snail and I fit it perfectly into this cheese box oh and I took a flag on the American flag like the cheese and I put luck and I put it this draw Oh every night I Drive and he had the first bunk on the way out so everybody had a walk and all the black guys were open they're doing go god damn he smells like in this  and he kept saying I know it does I don't know why it smells like  in here and after like a month when they won my draw better become saying man he smells like man he went in his drawer opened it up and he found this box he opened it up and I never forget him knocking on my bunk going I'm gonna find out who did this to me like what'd they do to you and he goes look at this like what is it I know we're  shrunken down from the 24 inches till like six little inches it just shrunk down with all the moisture goes out it just shrunk down like a man I don't even know why I'm telling you that story it's a hilarious

all this that I'm talking about is that we're just getting closer and closer to each other on some weird ways this is gonna be nothing compared to the next wave whatever the next wave is but they
