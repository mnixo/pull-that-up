thin nose anymore it behooved me yeah have you ever looked like a bogota's ears yeah they were big here's in the nose crow they keep growing yeah age is a very annoying thing well that's a weird one it's almost like to let someone know like hey look at these guys proportions are all fucked up he's got bad juice yeah you know I mean yeah so how do I reduce I wanted to get an ear reduction and a no sharpen I'm sure people have done that I could only imagine Bruce just kidding well girl that's a different hair in his ears Abe hey he's not 12 shaved those ears yeah I've got here growing out of my ears I have to I have to put a trimmer I'm vain I pluck my yeah if I see hair that doesn't belong somewhere I'll take it out he'll wax it my father like lets his nose hair grow his eyebrows my bro would it kill you no can you I'm looking into your nose itself it's a nest I saw your father bro yeah sometimes I get so mad at him cuz the way he eats sometimes like we're in Mexico and he he would just show up you got a breakfast he has this belly and he's got like he's got for french toast and a waffle and a banana and I and I'm just sitting there and I get so mad and then I started texting him I text my Michael listen man you got to start changing the way you eat and I go and I'm angry as I'm texting this I'm getting more angry more angry so stop the bullshit and start eating no I I was so angry I had to tell me I'm getting my heart was beating I was furious I couldn't have text faster I go get it together get it together and stop eating bullshit and would it kill you to fucking move a little bit bang I just sent that oh yeah strong I don't want to die does he exercise at all fuck no and I'll tell you why when he was young he was poor and he had to do manual labor he had to work construction he had to do everything with his hands so now that he has money it reminds him of one if he you ask him to do shit if you ask him to help you with a table it reminds him of when he was or and how awful it was I was reading a book once on powerlifting and one of the things they suggested is getting a manual labour job that's when you have to move furniture yeah okay when you got to carry couches upstairs yeah yeah I never saw that I never saw anybody actually recommend that someone do that in order to get stronger well when you um my friend who wrestled and played football on a high level they used to work the farm and they would there was a thing where you would take hay and you would you'd run after the truck and trucks off you take the hay and you throw it off and I guess you'd we're just doing that oh yeah I mean you know you can crazy straw I work construction one summer in uh in Washington DC in the 95 degree heat and I had to dig a foundation for a building for a house just dig into the ground all day and then we had that we had to demolish a house and take that debris put it into a truck and then drive it to a landfill called Lawton I think and then we would unwi take it off the truck so that movement of digging and then like demolition and digging and piling it in a truck and then piling it off a truck you're too exhausted do it to do a goddamn thing you're not working out after that yeah if you do work out and you get used to it though I think that's the idea is it your body becomes way more resilient that's what he was saying if you could get a job like as a Mason or some sort of manual labor on a construction site we carrying lumber yeah you just be lifting things up carrying around all the time your body would just naturally get stronger the strongest guy I've ever felt in my life in jujitsu was a Mexican guy who was amazing oh yeah I couldn't move Rick's I couldn't believe how his nothing worked on him just imagine like picking up bricks all day long carrying bricks everything would just get stronger yeah yeah I worked with a guy named boo Jack in DC boo Jack well giant black guy who was a Mason this is that two words or one word just call himself boo Jack I called him boo boo Jack that was probably as one name right yeah last name for his first name I think was his whole name boo Jack great name so a superhero or something he should be a just a giant very very friendly jolly black man with the biggest strongest hands I've ever seen he was a Mason speaking of big jolly black men with one name I met Sinbad the other day I've never met Sinbad or guy right met him in a parking lot our cars were right next to each other fully random mmm just fully random obviously we're close he wearing a dangly earring I didn't check I was he was he dressed in a colorful manner or no he was very understated and seemed completely normal lucky Maya I don't remember what he was wearing he might be wearing what you're wearing right now he always struck me as a nice very very nice guy yeah very nice guy what's he doing now doing stand-up still Turin yeah you know still got an audience oh yeah he's a funny dude man apparently he was really funny on kill Tony they did a kill Tony episode and Sinbad sat in as one of the guest judges yeah you know they have a new guest job every week and they said he was killer yeah dudes have been doing it for that long they've got some tricks up their sleeve he's a real comic it's been around forever been communicating with an audience yeah a long time it was just nice to meet him and and see that he's a nice guy you know that was nice you ever met anybody who was not so nice if I did that's the wrong way maybe five years ago I would have told you yeah but now I'm like why why bring heat on someone from some weird moment that I probably could have done myself if I was cetera yeah if you've run into someone you're in the wrong headspace maybe he just got done somebody yelled at ya maybe you have a business deal that went bad maybe you got cut off on the highway you never know when you're running into people it's just we vary so much look we would like to encourage each other to be on a good track all the time yeah but I think we need a little bit more forgiveness when someone does something stupid I'm gonna call my next special I think bipolar ape because that is what we are we are man I mean and and if you stop and you freeze frame on somebody when they're having a moment you can catch them in any it like that whole spectrum the human spectrum Center in st. and anything in between yeah you can catch them in a terrible moment or a great moment but you can't decide that that's what they are all the time and that's what we're doing now let's take 92 that we quantify certain things that are just dumb the certain things you just never you're just not gonna bounce back from the Rachel Dolezal thing when she pretended she was black but real isn't black too much I'm saying but there's like those things where it becomes a nationwide thing and I bet she's a lovely lady I don't know I have no I have no idea that might be empathy gone wild or that might be sort of this this I think a lot of times everybody wants to be an individual they want that that's always been a problem with the human condition right you want you want to be you want to be unique right yeah even though we all believe in equality we all want to be not equal we want to be a little better than the next guy or at least unique yeah and that's maybe where competition comes from and stuff but I think sometimes people negotiate that issue in that problem with with a very clumsy apparatus with a really weird way of doing it I'm gonna be transracial or I'm gonna I'm gonna wear dishes in my ears and and and literally cover my whole face with tattoos that's fine it's super common there might yeah there might be a better way to negotiate that that problem you're having because it's a it's still pretty surface you have a look at the hashtag face tattoo on Instagram no holy shit there's a lot of people getting their face tattooed yeah like it's like what slow down yeah slow down it goes back to wanting to be seen well I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense in terms of like people wanting to belong to a group that seems cool and like black people seem like overall a cool group right like you have good music behind it they have a funny way of talking they have all these amazing pro athletes they have a totally different kind of culture and you identify with that culture but you can't get in because you're a white girl you like shit it's all to do it's all thing I think also there's a romance to show you're on the outside looking in its struggle oh yeah and being having been oppressed and all those things and yet you yet you triumph yet you find a way to be funny yet you find a way to be colorful yet you find a way to be artistic I mean rap came from from from the South Bronx while it was literally on fire yeah and rap is just one aspect of it right I mean think about some of the very best end of comedians some of the very best musicians do yeah and you think of the percentage of the population that's black 12 the percentage that become elite professional athletes I mean what is the percentage of NBA players that are black it's it's something crazy a lot of it's also just what is it you think I don't know but it's pretty high I mean they're 69 fortunately probably something why I said that number Jamie it might be just also that there are two there are two avenues open to you in a lot of black communities at least it's changing but you know it was sports and music yeah for sure that's that probably plays a part in it no doubt about it but it's also there's a sort extraordinary number of professional athletes like elite athletes yeah that just happened to be black and what is that though is it genetic is it is it the environment they're coming from I mean it's it's a fascinating thing to be explored because for all this talk of racism if you just want to be really honest there's a lot of african-americans and have some pretty phenomenal genetic traits like fit like Carl like think of like who's like Jamie who's like the biggest freak all-time athlete basketball player would it be probably the Bron James Ron James probably right yeah and then you have like Michael Jordan is another free athlete right yeah I mean how many of those is card how many white guys like that are you like Larry Bird but Larry was a phenomenal shooter but he wasn't the kind of freak athlete LeBron is dr. Jordan would used to literally fly through the air yeah there are a couple guys that can do things like that but they don't have the overalls yeah well so so if you look at there's a book called the sports gene that talks about this yeah if you look at Africa it's it's it's probably the most genetically is the most genetically diverse part of the world right I mean the Africans from the Biafra Coast are totally different the Africans from from say the highlands of Kenya Ethiopia the Africans from the Sudan the Dinkas nua tend to be almost seven six sometimes certainly seven feet is not that uncommon and many people don't realize Egypt's a part of Africa very much so I mean the Tunisia oh that's more Arabic right but then you've got I mean it's fascinating this is what really was fasten let's go to Ethiopia Ethiopia they grow to an average height beautiful people there was a lot of trade in that side of the world Eritrea they're dead they've been renowned for their beauty if you just step over the border just just go right to just one one south or one north you are going into Sudan or the South Sudan tallest people in the world tallest people in the world 90 some of them can be like a fist off at 8 feet that's where like Manute Bol and those people came from ok if you go just another country just one more country east now you're in the Congo and that's home to the pygmy so you got the shortest people in the world in one country and then just cross the boarding of the tallest in the world in that country so Africa is insanely diverse but if you look at the athletes with the most explosive power and if you like that that includes the fast people in the world who are in Jamaica and who are you know in the United States genetically you can trace them back to a very primary you can trace them back very small part of Africa according to this book the sports gene which is the Biafra coast and so that is where that's where you'll see the fastest most explosive people however having said that you can hear two young santa sanders talking watching this white running back 215 pounds he ran a 4-3 540 and he was like I can't say this on TV but he can run run he can run run and it was true it's like you haven't seen a white guy run a four three five in forever yeah it's pretty rare there's gotta be some Viking genes floating around sure but there's there's no I don't think there's any black quarterbacks in the NFL can you see why it's just fascinating when you stop and think about just the sheer number of people involved in professional athletics the sheer number of people that make a living playing a game with their body yeah but I don't know if that kind of athleticism helps you become a champion in tennis you know there are different depends on the sports sports specific right well I mean first of all black people historically have not been into tennis yeah Arthur Ashe was obviously but Arthur Ashe was like way before their time right so he was like the ground breaker but I mean how I mean now I'm sure a lot of kids are growing up in nice communities they have tennis clubs stuff like that african-american kids but it's less a thing of that culture right there things like like there's not a lot of italian-american tennis players either you know saying like my people don't play tennis they don't get into tennis it's not an economic thing it's just a couple the same way yeah so when you see all these like world-class tennis players it just happen to be of the you know rich upper leaves coach you need a lot of stuff with tennis you know it's a lot going on at tennis Plus nobody gives a shit until you're really good you know like if you're kind of like if you have a chance how it plays a you know semi-pro ball for if you'll get into the big leagues you know but it you don't if you like I'm a semi pro tennis player get a fucking job bitch what are you doing you're playing tennis it takes a long time I used to know this dude who was a professional racquetball player and that was the grind east of all grinds because when I was 19 I recognized like oh no this dude done painted himself into a corner he's like a world champion it's something nobody gives a fuck nobody cares dude nobody cared and people would like treat him like oh poor guy like that was part of it it was like he's awesome but poor guy well I feel that way when I watch the biathlon oh yeah vixen shit or curling her yeah well curling is don't talk shit about curling in Newfoundland if you go up there in Canada they get fucking angry at you I don't give a fuck take it man also I don't care that you replayed the curling move in slow motion I I didn't miss it in regular motion you know and there's certain sports I don't I think their skills are not sports like what how to race is how to racists deal with the fact that there's so many elite black athletes what is a race because just looking and fuck how do you see white superiority in that many you know I've heard I've heard guys in New York white guys would always say this about about I'd hear white dudes in there talk about black and white athletes like this they'd be like well he's a brother so obviously he's gonna be faster and stronger but this kid over here has got heart and he's got smarts and so like guys apparently got heart getting brain where is the black guy only has muscle a clear indication you're just it was such a racist kind of way of delineating you know what's also delusional because people want to assume that because someone has physical attributes they don't have mental attributes they always want to say that and sometimes it's true because sometimes when you have physical attributes life is easier for you and you get soft you don't have to work as hard like one of the more impressive guys in the UFC for me has always been Frankie Edgar because that guy is just a product of hard work he's never been a knockout puncher he's not the biggest guys always in small for whatever division he's in Eddy view small 55 and he's pretty small at 45 in comparison to some guys like you know like Ortega we fought this weekend right you know Brian's much bigger than I'm taller longer he's just all heart and will and toughness and and I love that and I and I think that's an admirable thing and I think you can get a lot out of Washington guy like that but it doesn't mean that a guy can't have that mindset and also have some fucking Ray Lewis body well my cousin was the example of that yeah nobody in Kobe Bryant saying yeah nobody works harder why there and they love to win in an almost psychotic way yeah extreme winners are that way yeah that that whole thing that extreme winners is why we're here folks it's why it's so compelling I mean you you had to have some ungodly resolve to get through the Mongol era and the fucking caveman era and think about all the different shit that's happened in between us just think about the people that colonized this country we were so far removed from people who lived here and rode wagons across the country just two hundred years ago there's nothing that just happened they did this study Camille Paglia was talking about this why were most of the people that revolutionized the human condition male like so in other words the printing press and Einstein and Copernicus and Galileo and Kepler and you know all these people that kind of like you know and and why why so few women and so a lot of academic circles will they're the only single variable answer is that women were kept down by the patriarchy or whatever it might be very condescending though if you think about it because that would suggest that women didn't find their way through the cracks some of them but for the most part and there's some truth to that but for the most part there's another really interesting theory that men have men and women tend to have two different kinds of brains we've evolved to have two different brains because women had to watch out for children and pay attention to the minutiae and keep them away from death whereas men have the kind of brain that can obsess over just one thing even if it doesn't really bear any relation to the material world so thinking thing about whether time bends or whether the relationship between time and matter and and space you know and they'll just delta0 in on that problem and obsess over that problem you have those extreme winners that literally to the exclusion of everything else including their family including you know other people focus on just one thing but in a lot of ways thank God we had that aberration because that is what revolutionizes that is what changes a lot about how their little explosions that make this thing move quicker yeah they're the combustion inside the engine that is human civilization every now and then you get someone that just is an outlier some Elon Musk character that's drilling holes under Los Angeles and building fucking power stations from solar power from people's houses yeah make it fucking cars everybody gonna work it's never gonna work it's never gonna work he's like shut up yeah he's just so much smarter we let him drill under the city look go ahead you know what you're doing everybody just lets him do it yeah he imagine if like a regular person wanted a drill underneath the cities and and make tubes and put that's the dumbest idea ever we're gonna drop down a car is gonna go on a train the trains gonna go really fast with the car underground shut the fuck up you should have this guy Andrew keen on your podcast I interviewed him he wrote a book called how to fix the future and I also called the Internet's not the answer and in another book called the cult of the amateur and kind of likens in the cult of the amateur he likens you know the infinite monkey metaphor you ever heard that yes yeah it's great so if you had an infinite number of monkeys just banging away at a typewriter eventually one of them would would type out a masterpiece like a Shakespearean play or something just randomly just randomly yeah and as if that was real yeah it would and mathematically you can prove it I get it mathematically but I still call bullshit right it doesn't make any sense yeah like what are the odds that just ran this monkey on just accident put the periods in the right place and the spaces in the first place and the commas in the right place no yeah no it's impossible it is part of that the chance I think that law of chance can suck a fat dick I don't buy it I don't buy it I've heard it before by people far smarter than me and I'm like no no the zero chance but you know yes raises an amazing question right it what's what's amazing is it's like human beings can actually reach beyond that which they can measure human beings so it's not just what you can see and measure it's actually what you can imagine and what you can imagine actually is real it's a part of reality so infinities and all that shit yeah yeah but he said that these infinite infinite monkeys that's basically what YouTube and what the Internet has ushered in right but the long story short when you're talking about Elon Musk he was talking about how in his book had a fixed future the nine tech billionaires of the nine tech billionaires they own more wealth than 1.8 billion people on this planet we've actually never seen this kind of concentration of wealth luckily guys like Jeff Bezos who he knows really well and you know these other guys like Mark Zuckerberg are kind of aware they have some historical perspective of where they stand and for the most part they're doing their best to try to figure out a way to be responsible with this wealth there's also the fact that they're coming from a tech background which is historically been really fucking smart people mm-hmm right those are the innovators so because of that they're more left-leaning yeah which is what it's just the whole tech community is more left-leaning yeah I mean that's why any anything that deviates from that is kind of punished well the problem though is that now you have the four writers of the apocalypse Google Facebook Amazon and Apple mm-hmm there's so much they I mean yeah I'm out of comm their access to all your data right and to the maps so it does kind of go you kind of go okay you're left-leaning but there has never been this kind of concentration of power well yeah but they're not doing anything with the power that we know of what would they you have is tremendous wealth like yeah off the charts tremendous wealth at Apple at Google I mean they just have tremendous amount of influence and I think when you have that kind of money like idealistic hippie left-wing dreamers are way better off like throwing that money around then like really gangster globalists yeah that are you know pro-war really enthusiastic about right-wing politics like that would be waste carrier if all that money the billions of dollars was in a Christian occult the thought that the Second Coming was gonna happen in Jerusalem so it was very important to protect Israel which is real yeah there's a lot of people in this country that want to protect Israel because they think that's where Jesus is that's his pit stop when he comes back yeah yeah yeah I do worry about yeah you should worry about very religious people so that with a messianic yeah and that's that's a real thing today so I think like secular 10° and based techno freaks who I might disagree with them on some of the most ridiculous asks the the ridiculous aspects of progressivism like they just go so far off the charts and it's so common now everyone is getting so hysterical little things you know Christina Hoff Sommers is love her she's great she's clever she's got literally shouted down offstage they interrupted her speech they put up signs they wouldn't let her talk they were calling her a fascist boy they sound really confident in their point of view huh it's just so cheesy but they don't don't engage somebody in ideas shout them down because you're terrified well what they're doing also is they're getting on YouTube so there's all these videos of them you know being woke hashtag woke expressing their woke Ness I haven't heard that expression ya know you have just talking about yeah it's a gross word I think it comes down to what I'm amazed what I'm amazed it has is I've talked to some of these far-left ideologues you know and and especially the people that would shout down Christine summers who's such a reasoned voice in such an sweet woman too it's smart and you've got a letter talk and then if you disagree with her have a conversation with their they typically do a QA at the end of these speeches that's just rude trying to beat her with your ideas and she's a feminist her fucking podcast is called progress actual feminist that's what her thing is her video series that she does now she's an important nice person yeah man she's not an anti woman in any way shape or form she's not I've listened to her and she's sure what that booked the war on boys mm-hmm she's excellent she's excellent but I think a lot of this is like one of the things I noticed is that a lot of the left-wing ideologue side ed first of all are fairly young a lot of times they don't have a whole lot of experience in the world or you know they are people who are like if you just take the average journalist and I've met a lot of them now and talk to a lot of them the average journalist even the average academic in colleges or in the people that are kind of controlling this conversation in certain aspects they have just not really ever met anybody or worked with anybody that worked with their hands that spends a lot of time that had to be in the military that they tend to be pretty close dirt you know I mean even even sam harris by his own admission said that in his rolodex of 1,100 people he only had one friend who smoked and that was christopher hitchens that's significant it's significant when you are exposed to one element of society and one of the advantages that i think a comic has when you travel so much is that you're around real people people that work with their hands people to do other things that are in the military people that are cops people that are that are essentially a huge part of the fabric of this society who are on the right and uncertainly on the left and what you start to realize is that you're the world is way more complicated as always with the way it is right it is just way more complicated people are way less easy to pigeonhole they're just because you supported Trump doesn't necessarily mean your are right winner across the board doesn't mean you're you know about the patriarchy and stuff and I find that a lot of young people and I find a lot of people on who are trying to be woke and stuff and we do this as Americans it's not just the left it's also the right we do this as Americans we want to find a bad guy and we want to put a label on that bad guy we want a single variable answer we want a single variable solution right so in other words you are a racist you are a sexist you are so you got to be sanctioned and we got to get rid of you and if we can get rid of racism as if racism has a new with it actually it's about tribalism because people don't need a difference in skin color to hate each other have you heard of the Middle East or Africa or even this country it's not about the melanin in your skin it's just what tribal but but we tend to want to find that one label you're a racist you're almost certainly racist of course that right yeah of course there are you don't think racism is the problem that we're facing you think it's more of a tribal I think that if everybody was the same color we'd have no problem joining groups and hating each other no problem again with that Middle East that's for sure look in you about her racism is just a symptom of that fucking if you go her always great book sapiens everybody should read it read it thank you on your recommendation the Dinka the dick and the newer in the Sudan let's just take them they look exactly the same just go exact just racist right they like like saying all black people look exactly the same well they look they do look babe they are basically they are they the only way to tell them the difference is the tribal markings but for the most part there they look exactly the same very similar cultures are hurting culture Dinka and the dica language means people Noah in the newer language means original people whoa and their sworn enemies they fucking hate each other talk to Justin Ren about yeah Todd dad talk to Justin Ren about how the pygmies are treated in the country right next door they're brutally discriminated they can't even go to hospitals or schools cuz they're short and their magic apparently so go fuck yourself it ain't about color we don't need color to hate each other we don't we would find something it would be neighborhoods or lines in the dirt or sports teams fuck yes we mean we hate each other from neighboring high schools in the same time yes we compete with each other maybe it's a good good nature competition there's nothing wrong with that either it's no there's a natural need that we have to compete against each other and conquer each other and that's because we used to do that exclusively right that's how people move that's what this like Viking show is all about people coming into people's villages fucking them up and taking all their gold and just that's what people did forever fuck yes and but here's the other thing it's really taboo this is so fucking taboo even say this now what are you gonna risk something so so the narrative is those people aren't doing well let's just take any group of people right they're not doing well right because they've been there's only one answer to that they've been put down they've been oppressed they've been suppressed yes sometimes that's true right nobody can tell me you don't understand the history of this country unless you study the black experience at least a little bit because that is that is such a huge part of the history of this country sure gonna be a black person in this country isn't something I have no idea about but it hasn't been easy granted let's just take any ethnic group if you were to ever like Thomas Sol who's a black scholar if you were ever to bring up the idea that maybe part of the problem in certain groups okay that aren't doing well could be internal could be of their own making could be that there are certain aspects of that person's culture whether they're Inuit whether they're Mexican whether they're black or whether they're a hillbilly white guy if you start talking about the fact that their culture and the way they their beliefs their their their practices could have something to do with why they're not getting ahead you better be goddamn careful because now you're blaming the victim be it is true that well you're not really necessarily blaming the victim right because the victim in this case is a person who's a part of a culture and we're all influenced by our environment yeah and if you're involved in a culture that has very specific ways of behaving and you're supposed to engage in these and whether it's a you know female genital mutilation that they do to children on a regular basis in some parts the world like why do they do that well they've just been doing that that's what they've been doing that's they just keep doing that like there's a lot of weird things if he would just get sucked into and then you didn't realize what you're doing right you're 18 you live in that life then it becomes a part of your pattern and behavior and then on your 35 and everyone around you is behaving the same way and world's filled with violence and no one can see hit the pause button and go hey why we machete other Hutus in the Tutsis like what are we doing no one's like stop settle the fuck down it's like you get locked up in the momentum of your past of the past of your family your ancestors your community your environment very few people have complete autonomy so the idea that we're supposed to ask somebody just figure it out or get their shit together pull those helps up by their bootstraps it's pretty preposterous fuck yeah and it's usually coming from people that got a nice juicy hand like life gave you a couple of aces and you got a seven over there and a two and you try to figure out if you can get a flush yeah like you got a good hand you got lucky say you made it with a good hand like oh yeah congratulations you won the potty you got dealt three aces you can't exact you got lucky exactly I'll be the first to admit that you should be the first I I mean that you know some people are born with more advantage than others just a better face well you just stop for a moment and I don't want to get to this R I'm already to social justice warrior II in this podcast but this is one of the things that pisses me off said I agree with so many of those twats on so many important issues and then they get so crazy that they wanted to interrupt people like Christina Hoff Sommers and yell it she's a fascist and we just we just we there's just too much conflict that doesn't make any sense today yeah they're not reasonable yeah but that they're not civil or reasonable so I don't know where else to go like what what if you're not gonna be reasonable and you're going to decide that you're that right yeah that you are that your side is rooted in truth and love and that and my sides rooted in falsehood and evil and so all these progressive issues are all it's known no one has ever like super into women's rights but racist like they're all like yeah if there's a pattern of behavior that you're supposed to follow yeah well you said ISM it's like really it's a really interesting predetermined pattern that everybody locks into because of that support gay marriage it's like all these things well you can yeah it's like it's like if you're if you're in favor if you believe that global warming is caused by human beings you've got to be in the right you know your unless you're unless you know where you stand on gay marriage on every like that's unfortunate you can't be sort of responsive to evidence right so instead of being affiliate with a party or a candidate BBB affiliated with the problem what's the problem we all agree we don't like spree shooters right that sucks yes so there's got to be a way if we could put our ideas together create a little idea sex there's got to be a way right there's got to be a way to deal with this problem so how well can we talk about the fact that we all agree that the problem sucks now you're saying we need more guns and this other side saying we need less guns is there is there something is there something we can come we at least start talking instead because you know Brendon on the podcast said can we agree there's a gun problem the fucking number of hate emails we got did you not want to give up those guns and and yeah and and Jim Jeffries was so funny because he goes in his pot did you hear that that that stand-up it he goes here's the argument cuz I like him so fuck off and it's like that's that's good enough yeah the Constitution says that guns you we have a right to bear arms so we can protect ourselves against tyrannical government right yes that's what the Second Amendment well you know he's like the government has drones right they got tanks they got cruise missiles your ar-15 ain't doing she's another problem this is people didn't need to understand this the government is us okay everybody that you just described is someone who works in the military everyone you just described someone who's a soldier those soldiers are civilians they're the same people they're people they're us we're not talking about some global elites it's gonna take over they're not taking over with us we are not gonna take over ourselves yeah we're not this is not a stupid fucking country like the idea that somehow rather the military will start taking them what we have to be careful is people that have extreme power and shit judgment like that cop that shot that kid in the hallway in Arizona and that that horrible video white guy shooting a white guy to by the way I don't even know if that has anything to do with racism with a lot of what cops are doing I think some of it most certainly does but I think a lot of it has to do with people to just incompetent and their police officers and they shouldn't be police officers and on top of that I think the stress of the job just breaks people's brains and I think sometimes people are just so out of their fucking mind with worrying about being shot and dealing with trauma and dealing with violence and dealing with domestic abuse and fucking murdered kids and all that fucked up things they say see every day their brains are frazzled man and they're stepping out into the street and then they confront somebody and they just want to fuckin shoot they just want to shoot before they get shot they're on a hair trigger man that's a couple seconds to write sometimes and sometimes it doesn't sometimes they plant a gun on the guy I mean sometimes it's absolutely a dirty cop right you know sometimes the guys reach him for his wall and they shoot him in the car with his baby in the backseat there's been a bunch of these things man and I think it boils down to more than anything people that are fuckin completely incompetent at being a police officer what's amazing is the number of interactions will you never hear shit about what's amazing is how many people get pulled over every day how many people deal with a cop how many people get questioned by a cop how many people are in a situation where a cop has to talk to them about something that happened and nothing happens and nobody gets shot it's overwhelming yeah the numbers of actual interactions where everything goes okay far outweigh the dirty cop that shoots the kid in the hallway of course and the in the cop that plants the Taser and the guy after he shoots and all these different things where there's a dirty guy there's that's just people the number of honorable police officers is actually pretty fucking stunningly positive solutely if you have to save lives or stop clients from happy and protect people that you human beings have this crazy brain right with this negativity bias where something like violence and stuff has such an effect on our brain yeah we're really good at seeing problems but really bad it at coming up with the solutions like we tend to jump to so if you if there's a problem if it's a very if it's a very like think about terrorism right it's if people die and it's a very scary situation far more people die of diabetes yeah far more people die of heart disease you know people die if the way you're eating far more I mean I die from all the various pharmaceutical opiates that's exactly right I mean I can't how many people die of a lass Pirin some crazy number think it's ten thousands crazy yeah but but emojis are not a sexy but we we tend to react to the values that really scare us right yeah well yeah violence is what gets us not disease like dude I know two people who have lost loved ones to the flu this year yeah yep one of them was a 14 year old girl oh my god yeah the flu killed her Jesus yeah dude this flu is no fucking push out for two weeks dude if you get a joke I got it was going down for a couple days because I caught it really early on I knew it was happening and I did nothing I stayed home and I ate real good and I just slept all day I left later I worked out you can't ask those the working out ones are the worst killed me I've had that happen before I was thinking I was a little bit sick and then I worked out and it just gripped me got me yeah I've never been sick like that hadn't sick that since college I was real proud of myself that I recognized it I was like something's going on here like I I'm pretty in tune with what I'm feeling like a pussy well I'm just lazy and when like my body just feels off and I'm like my body feels off and then I was like oh my god no sweating yeah I'd be sitting there was chilly and then I'd be sweating and I was like okay I'm just gonna get under the covers and Netflix the fuck out of these couple of days because I did that two days ago where everybody a my family was sick everybody's getting colds everybody was getting cold and I I it was eight hours I've been sleeping eight hours I couldn't get out of bed and I was like I'm tired I slept dude fuckin slept for 11 hours felt tip-top my body fought it I was like I'm not moving until it's the movie gets the move and you gotta have a healthy body folks this is the the one thing that I got from this year and it wasn't like I said I was really only fucked up for like two days but one thing that God is how wonderful it is to be healthy I mean we take this fucking thing for granted this vitality you take just feeling good like right now right now right now I feel great yeah I feel great yeah me too ate breakfast it worked out yeah I'm healthy hanging out with my friend yeah there are two things odd cast there are two things they talked about like when you do aid to a country number one is this this fucking behavioral scientist named he wrote a book called scarcity and his name is LR Shaffir and I did a podcast with him and he'd studies like how humans behave when they have they don't food in their stomach but most economists wrote their treatises from a full stomach Adam Smith the father of capitalism was also living with his mother when he wrote the Moral Sentiments man and the wealth of nations okay so so he was what what you don't hear us as this is funny yeah so he was like how's internet marketing gurus and I was like Ferraris that he rented yeah well you know this woman I was talking about the free market and I'm a free market guy and you know I'm a capitalist and she said that's great and I've been inundated in the sort of the extreme Milton Friedman FA Hyack kind of School of Economics but she was like she wrote a thing called donut economics and she's out of Oxford and I can't fuck Kate Rayburn and she she said well you know what they don't tell you is that when Adam Smith was writing The Wealth of Nations the fucking handbook for all capitalists and free-market guys like yourself is that his mother was like Adam dinner's almost ready and I I I folded your laundry you know what's that worth you know I mean say you got to take those things into account it's so fun my perspective on on capitalism ending has always come from a full belly never been hungry I was a wrestler guys I did have to suck a lot of weight the point is never been hungry never had to worry about where my next meal was coming from certainly never had to worry about a roof over my head hmm that's a that's a big difference between even a guy like me and you like this is it you got it your your perspective is gonna be different it's gonna be dull has to be there's a level of compassion I think that as a civilization we haven't hit we haven't hit the right number we're in this number where we don't give a fuck about each other enough and I think that one of the ways that that could be solved is I've been thinking a lot about Universal basis basic income that if that was a possibility where you could give everybody just a small amount of money like twelve thousand dollars a year which is like $1,000 a month it's basically enough to get by but you wouldn't have to think about that then you wouldn't have to think about that aspect like you would always have food if we could make sure that everybody always had food and everybody always had a place to sleep what would that cost what would it cost to eradicate homelessness to a point where if you were homeless it was a total voluntary situation you you're just a nomad who likes camping or you're mentally ill and you just need to sleep in a box because you think that's the only way the aliens can't get you there's those people like Skid Row it's crazy yeah that's what would how much I'm like what percentage of our cities have homeless people in them like is it 3% of the city's homeless 1% of the cities the warmer climates it's higher right how would how much of an impact would it be if you could just bring that down to zero I mean wouldn't that be just great for the way people feel about other people well there are societies that do that right Singapore certain Scandinavians very hippy this podcast this is strong weed well no I mean but you're right you're asking a really good question because they they have done these experiments 20 billion that's it you asked you to End Homelessness arts re with money used to buy Christmas decorations it would cost about 20 billion for the government to effectively eliminate homelessness in the United States a Housing and Urban Development official told the New York Times Monday December 11 2012 so for what we spend it's kind of the wrong question because like you have a man a fish or feed a man teach a man to fish yeah all right it's a really tricky students they have to be careful it's a weird question but it's also one that no one's addressing it's uh like I you look at people who are homeless you go oh you fucking bum get your shit together all you lazy fuck or all you crazy person oh he must be a junkie you know yeah but so so can I tell you some my friend works what does this worse with the homeless youth and I'm pretty extensively hasn't done it for 20 years and actually the what he'll tell you and he's a very compassionate person but he'll tell you that the system in this city of Los Angeles there are a lot of resources for people on the street from places to get a computer places to sleep places to take a shower there and and what happens is there are a lot of people that get this Network they figure out where to go and one of the things that they are talking about in this community and trying to get kids and homeless people off the street it's it's one one thing there are a lot it's a complicated issue but what has been said and it was shocking to me was they were like problem is the system is so easy to game it's so easy to you can live on the street and live you can you can and when you're a youth you can actually if you understand how to how to work the system there are so many resources that a lot of times it doesn't lend itself to really needing to get out of a situation right now but how many of these kids are planning this out like this with a game in the system a lot of really because you're a human being so you figure out where you can get your breakfast where you need a shower where you can get your computer at we you can get your hangout we can get all these things somehow that's pretty look I'm not saying look I'm not saying we shouldn't have these resource right I thought it was fascinating that a lot of the people that are really in the front lines and if all this are saying that the the ironic and frustrating things sometimes can be that it does create not complacency but certainly there are way more resources than you think there are people that have worked very hard to address this problem and people do it when they know where to go they do know where to get food they do know where to get a shower they do know where to arrive so they can live on the street there's there's many levels to this right first of all one of the big levels the inescapable is mental illness those people there's a lot of people that are wandering around the street that really should probably be in some sort of an institution yes getting health care and medicated yes but how do you force someone to do that and is it that is that the issue or is it a funding issue you know that was an issue apparently when we go again yeah when Reagan was in office they lowered the standard of what's cuckoo for cocoa puffs and they just let a bunch of dudes just wander through the street that actually wasn't it was a little bit more complicated natural it was at the show state doesn't have a right to keep you against your will if you don't want to be right so so there had to be very specific criteria for that so you know this whole thing with gun control like we need it to help mental health issue well there's if you talk to the psychiatrist they'll be like look dude the criteria for getting defer saying saying and getting somebody essentially classified as a danger to society and like a real threat is steep it's hard to do yeah you can't do that because somebody talks to themselves you can't do it because they're hearing voices well yeah just want to visit that kid yeah two years ago right the kid has shot up to school in Florida and they decided he wasn't a threat but he might not have been a threat two years ago people saying oh you know they visited him two years ago they're incompetent no he might be a different person now you have to realize that like people get way worse like we've all known people that we knew at one point in time in life then you don't see him for six years and then you see me like whoa well that's cuz people evolve and sometimes they evolve and sometimes they don't sometimes they recede sometimes it gets ugly so James didn't you go crazy weren't you talking about how because 20% of boys in this fucking country are dead or are diagnosed with ADHD 20% diagnosed of course because you ever spend ten minutes with you who's not an expert on ADHD could be a thousand other things I just be a boy it was on Rhonda Patrick posted up to study yeah and I'm worth drugging ADHD was something that was not the one that was created see if Google this - sorry ADHD was the one that was created by the advertising agency what a surprise there's been several conditions that were literally invented by advertising agencies in order to promote a cure so its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder yeah look I don't know how much of that is a real disease maybe maybe some of it is maybe I'm not obviously not an expert maybe some of it is a kid whose brain works different all right let me tell you something man my dog might have ADHD or whatever the fuck it is I go to see him and he goes crazy he's out of his fucking Minds he thinks we're going running he's running around in circles he's hopping up and down he bolts back and forth into the backyard he's like a maniac right I can't control him you know what the solution for that is I take him running right I don't lock him in a room and then drugged him you know what you're dealing with little kid no I was really focused you know I wasn't focused algebra you know I was really focused if somebody started talking about fighting and how to throw a right hand just think about what I'm saying with my dog I mean there's really something to that like that dog wanted to go run and if I just forced him to sit into a room he would go crazy bark and he wouldn't want to do that mhm that's how kids are exactly it's the same goddamn thing there it is yeah the drugging of the American boy but what was the tweet Jamie is this an Esquire article what did it the would've the tweets a one in five boys will be diagnosed with ADHD by the time to make it to high school to date only one significant study has looked at ADHD misdiagnosis and found twenty to twenty five percent of boys were misdiagnosed and this was before ADHD was a cot as common as it is now so they're saying it's a real issue I know quite a few people that are drugging their kids this is a real my next-door neighbor they put their fucking kid on ritalin there was nothing wrong with this kid I talk to that kid all the times that's thanks too much energy the kid just had too much energy and they didn't want to deal with it and they weren't paying attention to him they worked all day and then the kids bouncing off the walls and no one wants to take care of the kid and so they put him on Ritalin awful dude it's happening everywhere it's a bad side effect some of these drugs look at this 6.4 million children between the ages of 4 and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD by high school nearly 20% of all boys will have been diagnosed with ADHD a 37 percent 37 percent increase since 2000 and my son my son is a classic example of a kid who doesn't like to sit still and roughhousers Google is a borrachón of ADHD see if schools have no time for course they have no time for boy energy no you're in here you're condemned because you're it's aggressive and you're my son so I did not be a boy he's being told that his hands are hot lava and he can't use his hands that's healthy oh my god what kind of liberal school you taking fo public school public school that's what happens that's awful this is what yeah 1980 HD was first mentioned in 1902 British pediatric pediatrician so it must be a wrong one a different one described an abnormal defect of moral control and children he found that some affected children could not control behavior the way a typical child would but they were still intelligent maybe it was a restless leg syndrome was that didn't you tell me it I feel like that one might have been but I don't know who was the sorcerer who was the guest do you remember the guest was a woman who was telling us all about this some medical expert was it Kelly Brogan it might have been might have been Kelly Brogan dr. Kelly but what didn't you say we aren't there studies about school shooters and a lot of them were on SSRIs and stuff yes mass shooters not just school shooters but like oh yeah even this Vegas guy the Vegas guy was on anti-anxiety medication Wow yeah that stuff and that's also Chris Cornell's on anti-anxiety medication there's a lot of people who are on psych drugs who lose their fucking Minds because psych drugs are not universal right like there's no thing like here's a perfect example say if you have there's a solution that makes alcohol 91 octane right and you add something to that you can add some additives and I'll spike it up and you could try to find the right mixture but that's just fucking gasoline right you're throwing things in there try to mix it up you don't know exactly what the right thing is that's how they're doing your brain correct when the 50 these things that's why they say try this one there's not like okay not exactly we have one cup of flour you need 2 eggs and 1 tablespoon of sugar no no no no there's no specific recipe and what the fuck does feel good mean the other thing that they're not taking into account is it you know you might be depressed for a good reason yeah in other words if you made me do a job I hated yeah and and I wasn't allowed to work out or I didn't know how to eat or a thousand things that make me feel good because I had to self-regulate yes I'm 51 and I gotta I gotta I still have to self-regulate because otherwise I'm you know I'll go crazy if I don't have if I didn't know how to do those things I would probably be depressed now now you're gonna give me drugs well that's not gonna help me well here's what I'm doing my behavior is what it is for sure but here's what I think you got to recognize that that kid your son who has that energy that's a gift and what you're doing is you're making him squander that gift by sitting them down in a fucking charity wants to go crazy that kid is supposed to be like my dog running around all day okay my dog is a year old that's seven he's a 7 year old dog basically you know and gears and he's like a seven-year-old kid he's running around he's going fucking crazy you know but that's cuz he wants to run exactly but once he runs he's dying dog is the best yes and your kid will be too if you if your kid was involved in something where they emphasized physical movement and then taught things in between workouts taught things in between class you know they play a game outside play a little dodgeball play a little soccer play a little basketball then after you wear yourself out a little come sit down we got to teach about math teach them about math and then you know you're gonna show them this is leverage we're all gonna pick things up do you think I pick it up like or like let them now pick it up with leverage oh you see you understand you could teach kids in a very physical way instead of forcing them to sit down who the fuck wants to sit that hard-ass chair we feel other people's gone on the top of your leg you know it sucks yeah it sucks you're sitting there waiting for the fucking class to be over so don't get it their Energy's out let them go move around did I ever tell you that my acting teacher who looked at times the greatest and he goes uh I don't see any ghosts you know we got it with you got a little self-esteem problem you think of yourself as a second banana and I was like what yes yeah you got to start believing in yourself more thank you you guys you guys don't think of yourself as a first banana did he say this when he was in his underwear he did he was I was wearing I was wearing I was wearing black play so he was put these black lace undies on thank God I'm gonna pierce her nipples know what's that why why do you strike alone leopard seal this is weird so he says that to me and I'm a young actor and I'm fucked up over and I'm like I got to get better I gotta get higher self-esteem so I say to my buddies kind of group of guys one of my buddies older and wiser and I said said man I was told I have low self-esteem you know and I heard a voice in the back okay guys thank god you really think you'd be this funny if you fucking like yourself bro and you think you'd be a fucking actor if you liked yourself go fuck yourself that guy's an asshole keep hating yourself it's the best part of you and that's how they got tanks mark I know I was like you're right I liked it whole point the whole thing that drives me is the fact that I've never been satisfied with myself and I'm never gonna lose that I if I if you make me really happy with myself I'm not so sure it's a good thing you know what you got to figure out how to do I think not you but I think humans too somehow or another disconnect you from the result if you could figure out a way to disconnect you from the result you could look at it more objectively you're gonna feel a sting of failure it's a fact but you have to recognize what that is and intellectualize it you got to put it in this little box okay this is good because now I'm gonna be fucking pumped up to improve I'm gonna recognize the urgency and failure because it's so extremely uncomfortable but that's not me what me is is the person who's doing this and I'm eventually going to be a finished product I'm going to figure this out that's where right now that little thing that happened that sucks like okay don't freak out you you everybody fucks up maybe you fucked up this way but you didn't run into someone's car maybe you did run into someone's car but you didn't do this everybody's got their own little family is a huge part of science part of being a human you got to understand the consequences of doing something incorrectly and especially the humiliation feeling of being like put in your place like you might think you're good at something and then you fail out you go oh my god I got this elevated sense of how good I was at this thing now I have to look at it more objectively and I have to get to that place where I thought I was yeah just people don't want to wear any kalpen great very smart guy brilliant guy I said what's best for recovery and he goes why do you want to recover well why don't you but let your body adapt and figure it out just eat some food see how it feels but maybe maybe suffer a little bit and see what that does cuz your body might have to compensate and get stronger as a result sure I'm an interesting way of looking at how I think there's definitely something to that I mean I think that's why people push right that's what pushing is it's forcing adaptation your body's gonna oh my god this asshole wants to deadlift now okay I've got I've got to adapt now that's also what the sauna is you got it your body trying to adapt ok this asshole wants to live in 170 degrees I have to figure out how to keep everything we're from shutting down let's mass-produce these heat shock proteins and try to figure out you know it's also norepinephrine it's also what like being honest with somebody is right so like it's also kind of like sitting and hearing things you don't want to hear about yourself maybe shortcomings right when somebody says some somebody something to you like you're not taking yourself you're not working hard enough or you're not working correctly or you did this wrong or your ideas are a bit bankrupt let me tell you why yeah that shit is not fun at all here but it's exactly like working out if you could just sit and listen and take it in not argue it listen take it in feel bad for a while I promise you I promise you that that's probably the best way to change listening and hearing it because it'll bother you let it bother you and then let that spurn you to action but if you if you if you want to get if you want a shout out Cristina Summers down or you want to get in your safe space and not hear those things because they hurt you this is why they're yeah but only part of the problem the real problem is a control power problem the control and power problems cuz these are eighteen year old kids and they've just gotten away from home for the first time and they want to exercise their power you want to change the world and their fucking babies they have half-baked brains and they want to yell shit out and they think that they're doing the right thing they really do and they were yelling outside you can't have we won't have fascists in our school you see Jordan Peterson was doing a speech and they were literally at the windows they climbed the walls and got to the windows we're banging on the windows from the outside while the speech went on Wow dude it's disturbing and everyone inside is super calm and there's people that keep an eye on the window cuz you hear it cracking it's like they're smashing this fucking window just banging up against it the entire time he's talking you just hear bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and they're yelling shit outside about fascism or it's like they don't even know what the fuck that means I think they literally are just saying it for anybody who disagrees with them yeah when a real fascist comes along they're gonna be so duped knowing that they'll be they'll be shot okay like it's a wall and shot that's well that's what fascists do real fast but they seem to think that disagreeing with people were out of their fucking mind they don't have any Kuwait's fascism today they have no confidence right so so if we're not well could if you have an argument with and you end up hitting them because they're saying things you don't like it means you don't have the ideas to compete with their ideas you know I don't think it's that dude I think they're just young and they don't understand what the fuck they're doing they're enjoying this ability to scream out it's like I said Tantra Singh yeah they've got way too much power they're children yeah they're essentially children yeah yeah they could go to war some of them in yeah but that's not right anyway they probably shouldn't be able to probably be like 21 before you make that decision the whole thing's fucking crazy it's crazy that they don't have enough security to keep the fucking kids from banging on the windows right like what kind of nonsense facility do you run you just didn't see that coming you guys but over the Internet you guys have the Internet it's kind of new though American culture is always it's been a few years no I'm always given Mike you know their kids isn't it recently to Jonathan I talked about this like helicopter parenting and the idea that your kid has zone autonomy and it's very important i-i've seen all the new science on this I mean for sure your kids your castex is allowed to exercise their point of view and have a tantrum and then you have to show them that that content that there are consequences for that you you know that's a new way of looking at you know a lot of cultures are like hey if you fucking talk to me like that again I'm gonna hit you in the fuck and I'm gonna take this riding crop and whack your fucking legs or whatever it might be so I don't know well it's we've got it real soft right now it's a real easy time to be alive and I think ultimately the ships gonna balance out I really do and I think ultimately a lot of these kids that are super radical now will probably stabilize as they get older and more experienced and be more embarrassed with some of the things they've done to especially to disrupt free speech they should really be embarrassed by that because it's so foolish like you all you have to do is formulate a really good argument to what that idea is and then you play those ideas out in the court of public opinion you do it in some sort of a way where you have one person representing one side one person representing the other side and you beat that idea with better ideas and that's what you're supposed to do that's the whole exercise and these people that oppose your ideas you should use that to challenge you to improve to make your improve your ideas undeniable so that when you present that argument you've looked at it from both sides there's far too many people including these people that are interrupting people that are only looking at an argument from the point of view that they would like to be correct and they're only looking at it like she's a fascist sees it she's a Nazi they're not looking at oh hey maybe that's a just a lady and maybe she's a nice lady and maybe she's got some points maybe I agree with her and maybe I don't but you got to let her talk like 'hey this is all nonsense holding signs up and trying to get attention this is not the time for that it doesn't persuade anybody over to your side I'll tell you that much they're not even trying to do that they're just trying to recruit the troops and then also they're trying to send out a flag that they care and they're out here doing the right goddamn thing yeah using my voice yeah I'm out here using my voice like it's like no you're being a little kid that's interrupting their being tribal they're in their tribe and it's way easier to be against something then to define what they're for if you ever ask them what they're for like I had this conversation quality bro it was that equality what everything they don't know what that including comedians you want an equal number yeah you see what that was Bert yeah medians men and women said dumbest shit I've ever heard of my life are you funny enough to be on the stage okay then I don't give a fuck what you look like yeah if you're nobody wants to hear that yeah remember well no Jerry Seinfeld got in trouble because they were likewise comedian cars having coffee all white guys well I don't know but you know there are a lot of funny white guys so fuck off 20 black guys - well that's what Jerry Seinfeld said he said essentially I don't care what color they are I speak the language of comedy it's actually funny exactly and they're like that sounds racist I don't know sorry but that sounds racist and you're dumb and you're fucking dumb what would you say if you were there and that lady said that because there was a woman two guys are sitting a guy a girl sitting there talking and they played the Jerry Seinfeld clip and then the woman who was african-american was like I'm sorry but that's racist and I was sitting at home watching his comic in the world and most of his audiences that most of his ticket pairs are white he's undeniable they're the most the people that go to his movies are white and he and he earned it cuz he's fucking hilarious but that doesn't have anything to do with what she's with cheese is that he's racist because he's not having black people on his show I don't have but he and he's saying no I don't even care I just care are they funny I don't care like diversity doesn't mean anything to me I don't care and she's like that's so racist but I feel like when you say something's racist today you don't have to back it up any more people just back off especially if you're saying a white person's racism if you say a white person's racist everybody pulls out the microphone though magnifying glass wait a minute what do we got here sir Konya know it you don't you don't even know it like you're you're the white supremacy is everywhere and will they teach that at schools no no they teach that also at some jobs you have to go to bias how is training yeah bias training and that conscious bias training what do they call it I think it's unconscious yeah subconscious bias training like you might even realize you're racist and you are racist mm-hmm how many black guys gotten laid because of all this though hopefully a lot a lot of hippie white chicks just want to show they're not racist what and crying it's just weird man it's just I never I've never seen us so divided and a part of it has to do with Trump for sure there's like this reaction like that they feel like really obligated to act people feel obligated to act and try to make things change which I think is ultimately good all this thing that all of what's going on right now does not concern me nearly as much as it does a lot of other people because I feel like people are already reacting to it and already going what in the fuck you know and and that this ship is already starting to write itself well the Oscars was the lowest rated I think in the history of the Oscar I've heard that but it's also 26 million people watched that's a lot of fucking people that's a lot don't shit on someone who got 26 million no but I think we're afraid it'd be people get very kind of like whoa we're getting political here when they looked at the numbers the numbers were they were comparing it to like 2013 yeah they're down five million from 2013 I think it was guess what wasn't around 2013 Netflix true it's a lot more shit to watch true what sit down from last year there's definitely people that are bored with Hollywood though lucky enough well they do Hollywood's overreach I think Hollywood tends to be what bothers me about Hollywood is their virtuous virtue signaling like they're gonna set an example you fucking guys like you want to be liked okay and you're as fickle as it gets they were the same people that were standing up and clapping for Roman Polanski yeah I'm sorry man well some of them were some of them were really saying some ridiculous shit I'm like guys it's a long time ago and he's drugged and sodomized a 13 year old I think was like more than one two yeah yeah so so guess what you know I can't have that guy you're not getting they wanted to sign a petition to bring him back in the country I can't forgive that no stay in France well they want to bring it back to the country to arrest him and they're really trying hard to do that and there's people that resist that I think he's an amazing artist and you know artists are just be consistent though you know en system that's where I draw the line you can't drug kids fuck with me I mean Asia Argento was one of the one of the people that came out against Harvey Weinstein she had been raped by him apparently and then she had a sexual relation for 10 years afterwards which by the way people like that I actually forgive that because people go back to the trauma right they want to relive it on their own terms but she signed the petition to for Roman Polanski to you know to be freed when he was put under arrest and I believe it was Switzerland now that's not consistent I'm sorry man I'm sorry but if that guy's just as bad as yeah you can see the petition on them what was her perspective she was somebody who thought Roman Polanski should not be prosecuted for something that happened a long time ago she signed that petition I would never sign that petition so there's a lot of disconnect so I have a big problem with that sort of disconnect that's a problem I don't know this woman I don't know her III believe her I believe what she says about Harvey Weinstein and again you know people well she went back to the scene of the crime that's very common but don't sign the petition and then now be this leading voice in this whole you know anti harassment so III think it's very inconsistent I think you have to pay you have to at least answer to that did she comment on why she saw I think she there was a Mia culpa there but it's very inconsistent in it and and there's a lot of that out there there's a lot of that we should make sure that she definitely did that just say it just see if you can goo that young Jamie you know say it feels like something that you know I lift it up I actually looked it up I wanted to see who had signed that petition I came across her name and I was like whoa hmm that doesn't make any sense to me you know it just doesn't make any sense man I don't get it I don't know enough about what happened I know that he drugged and sodomized some young girl she was 13 when her mom dropped her off I believe it was why was she there you know is the 70s man people just friendly she looked every bit of 20 all that shit the year man but I believe he knew she was 13 and then he knew he was gonna go ahead jail and he left the country Jesus Christ yeah and say and then apparently there's another woman that he had done that to yeah imagine being on the scene back then how weird that must have been like there'd been I think about Roman Polanski making movies in like what the 1970s right yeah I mean God trying to tell it don't we yeah amazing they'd only been making movies for like a few decades it was a real new thing she signed the petition but I found out tweet she just put she put out a couple months ago where she said she regretted doing it regretted to signing that petition years ago she said Roman Polanski's a filmmaker whose work I admire greatly but if I ever see him I'll spit in his face if he's lucky yeah but you sign the petition I already regretted signing the petition years ago already felt it was a mistake no excuses it was stupid but this indicates a pattern of behavior that if true and I believe it to be true is beyond unforgivable well I think I think you got a good point though about you you she made a mistake and there is something that happens to people that have been violated sometimes they blame themselves that's what I said sometimes forgive that and there could be a little of that in her decision-making process - I can't forget could be a little bit of wanting to be in with Hollywood you know it's not that's not ethically or morally consistent no and she fucked up and she realized she fucked up but you're also coming after people now mm-hmm you know if we're gonna if we're gonna end and a lot of these people you know deserve to be come after but you know we have to be consistent here right but isn't she beacons being consistent by just saying that she fucked up and realize that she fucked up well there are a lot of dealers saying shit once they get caught well that petition that petition doesn't mean jack shit they ain't letting them it doesn't matter you signed it and it was a favor yes I don't know anybody that would sign that like I would never sign that petition that's all I said be consistent if if the guy came to America and got arrested and went through the trial and then got convicted how much time would you do I don't know it's interesting it's like would it be better karmically to go to jail for what he did come back go to jail and then no one everyone would always know when you got out that you were convicted and you were punished for child molestation like you did it and they got you everyone would know whereas now he's living in France and he has to deal with it floating over his head everyone who meets me knows that i drugged and raped a kid everywhere I go everyone knows I drugged and raped a kid and it just keeps playing out in his head all day look shaming is powerful shit well then I mean that's the highest level yes this is drugging and raping a kid I'm a forgiving guy you have to give that one I can't like I'm a forgiving dude man I can't stay mad and I think it's good to be forgiving about things there are certain things that to me when you and he's a great filmmaker and a great artist for me that kind of stuff it's very difficult man I'm just it's very difficult I had an argument with a bunch of older actors about this and they were all saying was a long time ago she looked I was like if it was your daughter and she was 13 how would you feel you just got to keep going back to that and well especially if you actually have a daughter you actually have a daughter that's not you're not conceptualizing that you're yeah I've got it actually locked in your brain you're actually thinking about your daughter and it becomes a different completely different thing I remember thinking when I was young you know yeah if someone did that to my daughter but that was like before I had a kid it was like just a weird concept it didn't seem real but now you think about this thirteen-year-old girl and you're like whoa but what a court would do and what a trial would do is you might hear something like I don't know but you might hear I don't know she said she said she was 20 when we talk about drugging hold on she smoked a little weed that that guy gave her over there let's be careful right then yeah then you start hearing all the extenuating services and maybe you would go you got to do the time but at least I get how that happened because you thought it was something different right what was your intention what did you see but we don't know that so what happens is we start and we're doing this too and I'm doing it I don't know I don't know all the details of the case so and I'm all I'm saying is that he drugged and sodomized a thirteen-year-old you know that everyone was drugged him included well there's this what I'm saying so we all have to be we all have to be careful and I have to choose I'm kind of breaking my own rule here I'm I'm drawing these very strong hard and fast like there's no context and what I'm saying right now there's no nuance and what I'm saying if there's no context right and you got to be careful because everything is nuanced in context in a way otherwise otherwise otherwise you're taking me at just the words I'm saying so what I'm seeing from this this that's is like she's upset and you're upset like she's upset she signed it and you're upset she signed it yeah but that doesn't mean nearly as much to me like people making a mistake like her making that mistake doesn't mean much to me it's just a mistake forgive it I'm not gonna there's no consequences no one got hurt because that mistake you know I'm saying like it was a mistake she fucked up but it didn't ultimately hurt anyone like it doesn't I don't like the fact that someone would at least temporarily have that thought in their mind like that guy should be free like like leave him alone what's bygones be bygones I said my saying different what're you talking about so I'm talking about Dollywood tends to do I was just using her as an okay how it would tends to do that which is popular that which is going to make them liked rather than something that's morally or ethically consistent that's what I mean right we've talked about this before that it all comes down to the whole process of being chosen to do things yeah what's being chosen to direct or chosen to act or chose everybody's constantly working to be chosen you're all trying to audition for things or trying to angle to get a certain role it's a constant process of like me like me like me and these are people that go into this job with his yearning desire to be loved yeah and then on top of that they're playing this weird political game I mean acting is all political I mean it doesn't make any sense that every other occupation except maybe tech tax probably like mostly mostly liberal but Hollywood's almost exclusively liberal and if you step out of those lines nobody wants a work of Union well Hollywood on the surface is liberal but actually nobody who's conservative or whatever it will speak out right like Tim Allen lost his show because he's because he's conservative yeah he's an old white guy we expect yeah Oh white guys yeah that's a golf probably a very real thing nowadays you know with Dennis Miller same thing you went fuck is James votes James Woods oh yeah James Woods is arguing people on Twitter like James you're seven years old how many days you got left how many how many moments in your life do you really have left you have a thousand like what are you gonna do you're gonna waste 400 of them on Twitter yeah that's not wise that's not a wisely said he was blackballed for his conservative use mmm was he really I don't know yeah I don't know I don't know man again I don't want to be I don't know if I'm being helpful right well so you know you call out certain people or you talk about the inconsistencies most people are doing the best they can and trying to make the world a better place right yes are they I think most people just like rolling downhill in a hamster wheel thinks I'm trying to figure out how to stop this fucking thing yeah most people are just on full-on most people are definitely not thinking about how to be make the world a better place occasionally people think of that what they try to think is how do I get by number one yeah then how do I get better how do I get ahead number two those are the things they think of and occasionally what's going on over there yeah fucking Trump and then they go back to work yeah you know that's all you can't do sometimes yeah most people that's most people it's like James Woods it's like Jesus James I get it but you're not changing hearts and minds on Twitter well this is funny shit though sometimes I was gonna say like funny guy the biggest thing is like you know are you it's really hard to persuade anybody it's fucking baby like I was think about what the times I've changed my mind Harden's changed my mind I never changed it in an argument yeah right I changed it in a conversation I don't mind change in my mind I think that's important too yeah you know and I've changed my mind before and people got mad at me bro you fucking trees your mind like yeah I changed my mind I learned some new stuff and then went oh okay I can't defend this old idea and I'm not an idea stupid the first what's the what's the first rule and being a scientist doubt ignorant and you don't know anything and then you you make sure that you're responsive to the evidence and then if you even if you build up a whole reputation on your conclusion you have to be willing to change your conclusion based upon new evidence you of the finished product yeah exactly your finished product oh it's amazing you're a verb yeah well I'm definitely smarter than it was three months ago different person - how about the difference in you and you were 28 and now it's a different person yeah totally different human yeah but that raises an interesting question - so okay you're a very different person what if you did something awful then let's maybe murder and that one should they let you go right and now at 51 I'm so different than when I was 21 so I don't remember that I was such a moron I was a moron at 30 I remember feeling that awkward lack of control I had for myself like a feeling how awkward it was and wishing I had more composure I remember like actively feeling that at 21 that it was so impulsive and so crazy and I wished I was more composed and I would see people that had their shit together and I really admire him I look at that guy all composed and shit yeah dress nice knows what to say when not to say it meanwhile blurt things out that I should never say how about the way you look like though I was thinking about the way I looked at certain things like women and their capabilities when I was a young man I you know it changed me and in looking at women and in a different light the UFC and having children with a woman and watching how good she was raising kids and all the things that that takes that's a certain type of strength and then watching women like Paige Vanzant fight three rounds with a broken arm you know that that was all something that I didn't think belong that was an arena ID it was not aware of that kind of feminine strength or fortitude or whatever you want to call it it causes me to look at that gender differently than I did before so in other ways I'm a different person and as you get older that's what happens you see the world differently as you are exposed to more data and exposed to more and different paradigms and examples and I think that's a good thing it is a good thing it's also that's ridiculous the the the female male debate back and forth is ridiculous because people vary so much inside those groups that for someone to say all women do this women are all thinking this woman oh no that doesn't make any sense that's just as stupid as saying men do men all do this all men do those no no that's not that doesn't make any sense where did fucking human beings there's a great number of men that do this stupid thing and a great number of women that say this annoying thing this is a great number of people that are just looking to skate by in this life men and women yeah there's a great number of dummies there's a great number of really inspirational fantastic people that also have vaginas yeah there's a lot of them what a surprise I could really smart ones that'll blow your mind in a conversation and they just happen to be female and there's a lot of them that are had this happen to be male and they did that that male who happens to be fucking brilliant inarticulate and mind-blowing has almost no fucking relation to some idiot shithead ditch digger asshole yeah which is nothing wrong with digging ditches folks just don't dig dish so clear that's correct trying to be know but it's also like if one of things I notice is you have a lot of from different backgrounds you got at Nigeria in this corner you got Pakistan in that corner you got China in that corner you got fucking America you got a white guy from when they all have to get food out to a group of people in a restaurant or they got to figure out a way to run a business together all that shit that nobody has time for that shit everybody's kind of working toward a common goal nobody has time if you actually have something important to deal with you don't have something important to do we start looking at like weird shit like I fucking hate gingers you know gingers are all the devil you know you start looking at things on different you know you start looking at that the difference is and getting annoyed with stupid shit yeah I think all human beings just like your son have a physical requirement there's a bond requirement that we all have with each other there's a love requirement that we all have with each other we have to get a certain amount of love you gotta have a certain amount of bonding and camaraderie with the people around you and these needs should be just like they give you like a vitamin C chart you know USDA recommended daily allowance of vitamin C is this recommended daily allowance of uh you know iron is that like all that stuff is important for your body I think you have an equally important requirement for your your mind yes and for just your physical being like not necessarily your body in terms of like nutrition but just love and warmth like the human touch you know the babies will die if you don't touch them right yeah it's called failure to thrive so in hospitals when they have babies that don't have parents they have people that come around and hold the babies she's not held you can feed the baby and everything if the baby's not held the baby will die I have to be touched by another human being a baby has to yeah it's like water or food it's there's a fuckin requirement yeah and I think that this this is being violated in schools when you teach in little kids with tons of energy and the way they cope with that violation is give those kids medication that makes them conform and we just accept that and then people get on anti-anxiety medication and people get on all this medication that medication how many of these medications are clearly described because your life sucks or prescribed rather because your life sucks how many of them is it half right is it 30% like what number of people actually have something wrong with their brain and what people have something wrong with their brain because their life sucks right god damn it I hate going over the same subject over and over again because it's just so well it's hard to come up with fucking answers because it all depends it's true like I was talking to Andy Galpin about that I was like well is this vitamin good for you or is this for supplement good for you or is this how we show them selves take and he goes it depends it just depends on your body it depends on what your what are you doing with your body what what is what is your routine like on a daily on a weekly basis what kind of stresses are you putting your body on some things work some things don't there's no clear-cut single variable answer it's just so fascinating that all of our bodies of different requirements because we literally developed in different parts of the world right now and scoot it over here in a boat yeah I start fucking each other ya know look at you allergic to cats stuck with us I do better with goat dairy and me too and I do with Iranian then I do with Holstein cow dairy dude my daughter when she was little she would throw up if she drank cow's milk but she would drink goat's milk and she have no problem with it at all yeah it's weird man like human dairy well do you fuck with raw milk at all yeah I used to but not anymore I start with raw goat milk I can't do raw milk okay I would rather get raw goat milk because first of all do they treat goats the way they treat cows I figure if you're running goats you probably like a little bit more animal friendly let's go milking the world from this Amish from the Amish it's creamy and delicious would you imagine let's go on a limb here and guess would you imagine there's factory farming of goats like milking commercial no larger I'm sure there is like I get there certain ultra-pasteurized goat milk called Myers that I get sometimes it's really good but it's ultra pasteurized but I'm sure that's that the problem is when you talk about factory farming here's the problem right so we want consistency in our food so you want to buy eggs and you when you go to buy a carton of eggs you know they're gonna cost a dollar fifty or two dollars and fifty or three dollars and fifty whatever you know they're gonna cost a certain amount you don't go to the egg store and one day there are 350 and the next day there dollars and the reason for that is this that we've figured out a way to create enough eggs so that there is enough of a glut so that we can keep the price at a certain level the problem with if you had all these family farms okay which I've always been a fan is I always talk about family farms versus factory farms awesome Brian never done a day of farming in my fucking life don't know anything about it but I done my reading so here's Brian again with his point of view because he's read some stuff and he likes eating at erawan and Whole Foods okay because I can afford it so I like family I like family idea factory farming is bad apply it the problem is that if you look at the way farming it works is that some family farms aren't as good as other family farms for a thousand reasons that is not as that productive not as proficient so what would happen is that family would say hey bro I know you're a chicken farmer too but you're not doing it right let me buy your farm I'll buy your farm for fifteen times what it's worth right now you need the money but I'm you know secretly I know I'm gonna make my money back cuz I know how to I know how to do it better than that guy and then I do that now I get a I go and buy a machine that's actually faster and I go to the next farm and I say hey bro you're not gonna compete with me on the market anyway and you're not as good sell me your farm and what happens is guys can go fuck you Nazis nothing Joe because my farm cuz you're not a city slicker he's a farmer and say you're talking too seriously I don't like your attitude hey bro call me my fucking fine I could give you a deal come over here I could I not to make eggs no you're saying what would people the real problem with factory farm is the lack of moral standards like when they shove these chickens to these little tiny boxes and the other thing is we've adapted to the eco system that we operate under and the eco system that we operate under we get free food basically yeah I'm not free food but a lot of people throwing yeah but it's everywhere the food is just coming in and the eggs are everywhere yeah so you someone's got to be able to make all those eggs so we've sort of enveloped these areas and stacked them up with people based on the idea that it's easy to get food here it was really hard to get food here in the 1800's would be 1500 people here right yeah it would be like the Sahara Desert but a desert people live there some people that this little ranch here ranch there why cuz there's no fucking food man or water yeah it's not a lot there yeah it's a desert right so because of the fact that we figured out how to be able to feed all these millions and millions millions billions yeah yeah well in this one little spot like LA in particular where no one's growing shit everything shoved in there in terms of humans and they're just pumping eggs in there left and right yeah they've sort of populated that place based on this ridiculous idea of the access to me and that's not it's not a ridiculous idea it's actually a reality right right but then people come along and they see a PETA video and then they go hey but you still want to live here so well you're gonna have to go vegan then well guess what if you do that they're gonna have to chop down a lot of fucking trees and start growing food everywhere you're gonna have to put it everywhere all these people gonna be vegan all 2 million in this town and 6 million in the neighborhood town and then 20 million in LA that's a lot of pollution you're gonna have a lot of fucking shit going to the ground you're gonna have a lot of combines chewing up rabbits and rats it's ground nesting birds everything's in our fan everything's gonna get buzzed up when you gathering up all that grain you're gonna need to feed all those 2 million people that don't have access to animal protein anymore that's not good either right we're fucked is what I'm saying you're giving up that easy I give up dude I I think technology is allowing us to grow more food on less land so that's true I think I'm very hopeful for that um artificial meat that meat that they're growing yeah very hopeful for that because if we could figure out a way to make it healthy to get that kind of meat you would still have population control problems and I think I would never stop hunting because of that but it's meat without a central nervous system meat without a central nervous system and you we could probably if it's done and it really works I mean there's a lot of ifs there but we could probably eliminate most of the factory farming the real problem would be like what would you do with all those cows what do you do with the cows now they would die off and then you wouldn't have a you don't want them to go extinct you know I have some cows because there'd be people who it'd be a whole marketplace of eating meat with the central nerve system just watch oh they were definitely I mean is like we said yeah we go back to the there's always gonna be a marketplace for eating food as it quote-unquote occurred naturally which of course Holstein cows are not not that's the other thing I was gonna get to the problem with letting them go if we ever let them go they morph sort of like the same way pigs morph they become this thing called scrub bulls you ever heard of scrub bull huh it's a really it's really popular in especially in Australia they're wild cattle cattle broken through fences and lived many many generations in the wild men the males are super aggressive very dangerous let me see Jamie yeah they're dangerous as fuck enormous enormous bull they're not afraid of lions afraid of water buffaloes they say climb a tree when you see a water buffalos well my friend Adam Greentree who shot that Buffalo above the flag yeah and in the horrible lands that's a scrub bull so you see how weird that thing looks it looks weird because it's probably lived in the wild for many many many generations they're huge look at the size of the sack on him dude look at his sack and look at his hog holy shit thing's no joke huh that thing is laying pipe all day just just banging all the cows awesome there are enormous wild cows and they're very aggressive the males in particular will fuck you up because they're not steers right there Bulls when we're getting steak you're getting steak most of time from a steer a steers and animal they cut the balls off of it when it's young these are full ass bowls look at the size of that that thing's huge Jesus yeah these are big fucking wild bulls you know what is that way eighteen hundred pounds or some shit oh man fuck so that would happen in America you got to recognize that if people stopped having domestic cattle and they just let those cattle roam through you would have a devastating impact on the ecosystem just like you have with wild pigs it would be similar you'd have one I think those cows would all be euthanized so they'd be eaten maybe it's it's it's grinding the cows but you'd have to have a certain population of them that we keep alive what like native for milk you know your milk um you know if they come up with artificial milk you're not really supposed to drink milk though right I mean not really all cheese is good shit is it though I drink I eat cheese and I drink wine it doesn't make me feel good and I'm never stopping how about that why does not make me feel good until it goes in my mouth yeah the problem is if I if I like I was in that makeup chair and you drinking wine I was doing no I was I was puffy in the morning and I looked at the makeup woman and I said I think and I said why why am I so coffee in the morning and she goes are you drinking at night I go every night she goes well don't do that if you have to shoot the next day you might not want to drink three glasses of fucking wine it's swollen just drink it yeah but I want to know it on the golf DS you want look good dairy reinvented sustainable kind delicious there you go animal milk I feel that thing gives you can rocket farts like farts that if you were at a chair with wheels on it you could fart and it would scoot you across a carpet I mean how could your body want to digest that what's that stuff made outta give me some ingredients on jamming weird people are weird milk yeah almond milk that's my favorite it's uneven yeah there's no almond titties that's not almond milk someone have a joke like that that's someone's joke though just bite someone's joke thanks I'm gonna hold the whole almond milk thing is so weird you're just soaking nuts and then getting the dirty water you know it's like it's like when you and Eve eat Coco Pops cuckoo for cocoa puffs don't they pay to have that chocolate and there would it be the chocolate now about oppress them goddamnit what are you talking about they stay they take the almonds they soak them they sprout them right but and then they press them right but that dirty water is just water the almonds were soaking around in no because they don't do it that way I don't think I think the way they do it is they crush the almonds after they've been after they the almonds have been soaked they take the skin off and then they they crush them and then they they mix it they crush them and then they press them and it creates like a milky it's dirty water fuckin Factory you're talking about bro it's dirty almond water what is actually genetically engineered yeast what is this what oh my god the term genetically Wow the team used genetically engineered yeast to produce six key proteins oh you goddamn motherfucker six key proteins that provide the texture and plants to harvest eight fatty acids that contribute to the flavor finally they add sugars minerals and water easy peasy it's sugar with this straightforward recipe the composition can be modified to lead potentially harmful components such as cholesterol and hormones out of the equation lactose cholesterol by the way the building blocks of all cells yeah sure cool that liked it yeah they're putting sugar in there man but they said they put sugars in it because otherwise it would taste like donkey piss yeah it's East by the way yeast is a life form where do you draw the line like if you're a vegan and you're eating yeast you are eating a living thing you're even eating a life form that if you didn't eat it it would replicate it's not a plant it's a life form mm-hmm like if you're if you're eating probiotics like say if you're a vegan you're eating probiotics you're eating a little tiny life-forms right that's what you're eating when you have fermented that yeah you're letting animals grow on your food and then you're eating your food and the animals so like that's where I get my protein like you're eating animals you're eating a little tiny tiny little animals I think one in ten nine out of ten of your cells are not human they're bacteria every cell of your body is made from it and all of your steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol including all of the sex and adrenal hormones well you definitely don't want that in your body then do you why would you want something that's responsible for every fucking cell in your body like this idea that that diet is better for you is so goddamn cockamamie they're telling you that they're putting in sugar so that it makes it palatable and taking you you don't have to worried about that naughty cholesterol that's responsible for every fuckin cell in your body and your hormones we don't want that have it they're not even like paying attention to science but it's a belief system it's like here's what it is though here's where it gets weird the this is a also believed in many ways a left-right thing that the left believes in climate change science wholeheartedly 100% but does not believe in gender science no that's all bullshit if you if you if you talk about the difference between male and female just XY chromosomes they'll shut you down yeah did you see Brett Weinstein's his wife I heard they're hiring Marroquin no his wife Heather highing she was doing a speech with James d'amour they were talking about gender diversity and she's just talking about the difference between males and went females from a scientist point of view she's uh she's a real biologist right people get up and screaming the shutting her down they're walking out they knocked over the sound system they called her a fascist they said he's a Nazi awesome you're against science it's amazing it's amazing so dumb but it's this thing this left-right thing - it's right it's like the left wants you to 100% buy into whatever science they accept but also they don't buy into a lot of shit that just doesn't fit with whatever their ideology the left is in the cultural purity the far right sin to racial purity yeah but it was the denial of science is a new thing yes denial of science was just not a part of the left with the left was always Pro signs that posted supposed to be pro science the the idea was that they were more educated but as I looked into it I felt those like that's not really true yeah but you would think that it would be more educated again is it left and right or is it just is it is it are we talking about just people who are I feel like when we talk about these people that are knocking over sound systems and walking on and shouting that Christine summers I don't know that they're right or left I think that these are young young confused people shitheads sheds yeah yeah I I think that I really do I think they're proud first of all I don't think they're very smart I don't think that they're that's absolutely true I think a lot of them might have some psychological problems I think a lot of them one a belong I think a lot of them just want to be heard and people do clumsy shit when people want to feel significant they'll do even crazier shit like put a gun in their hand and shoot somebody so sure you know and it usually it belongs it's the realm of young people who don't know what to do with their energy there's all that and again like we talked about before with Christina Hoff Sommers there's just a bunch of people that are free from their parents for the first time that's right you know they've only been free for like 24 months yeah and they're they're stretching their dyed their hair green you can't stop me fascist I just yeah I just want to stop everything and they want attention but ultimately I think that this is giving us an opportunity to really fully examine ideas and even though these people are shouting people down all this noise is going on like there'll be a result there'll be some sort of an ebb and flow to all this then I feel very hopeful about like when I look at the ebb and flow of things like I like it I like what's going on I like that there's a lot of fucking chaos and definitely some people are taking some undone necessarily bullets and there's definitely some ideas that are getting shut down that shouldn't be there's definitely some overuse of the word Nazi and fascist and all this different stuff but it seems like overwhelmingly all this crazy energy is being pushed and to at least the idea that we're approving the world yeah you know I'm saying yeah like they want to improve the world I had a bunch of women on my podcast were talking about like sexism and Hollywood and of course I was like I don't see it that much I was like I don't see it and these were all intelligent and I said you know I gotta be honest man as a white man now I just feel like I it's just it's hard you know I gotta watch what I say now I gotta watch like how I talk and and one of the women goes Katie goes wow I can't imagine what that's like Bryan what's it like to have to watch it watch what you say and watch you know watch what your impact is like I have no idea I mean while she's been dealing with that though everyone I know has been dealing with that for fucking ever and I guess I didn't take it I didn't look at their perspective it's hard to look at other people's perspective get is it's hard like I was talking Shaab in the last podcast we were talking about Joey Diaz had some crazy shit about some chick's ass and and we were all laughing about it he was like it's Joey's fucking Diaz he's cleaning I go I totally understand and I'm with you but now imagine if you were a regular-sized guy and you were dealing with like some 7-foot tall ogre who was going online talking about how good your asshole smelled hmm and you're like oh Jesus and you knew that that guy wanted to fuck you and then you knew that if he was alone with you he could probably like hold you down and fuck yeah like that would be Terry right yeah that'd be terrifying yeah in this case you're talking about a female fighter probably would fuck Joey's ass probably beat Joey's ass right she's badass you know Joey's yeah not in the best shape in Mike you might call the clock over the punch time she starts circling his jabs but either way he's being funny that's all it is but I was saying imagine now though that you're a girl who hears someone talk about your asshole like that and we've all done it we've all done it yeah you'd be like oh no like that's got to be a terrible feeling yeah I'd love to be a woman for one day to see what that's would you like to get fucked if you're a woman for one day we just dick no wouldn't you like that's where I draw the line I got in there I just want to see what it's like what does it feel like like we're stuck it in your ass look I could have found that I was a guy well first of all what's it like to be attracted to a man like I look at you and and I know women find you attractive I don't find you attractive beautiful right area right but to have this book on I'm a good son this man that's good you got a strong job smolder strong jaw smolder God you do smaller dude smaller and bro do smaller it's hard it's hard for you too I get lost in your eyes you have a strong jaw and soft eyes well imagine wanting someone to stick something in you and shoot shoot sperm into you yeah can't wait get some in me yeah imagine that yeah Jamie just threw up yeah yeah like my wife was watching Sopranos and she found Tony Soprano attractive well I said why she goes because he's powerful and he's just bad he's and and you know he's and I said well you want to be married him she cuz I don't want to be married to him I want to be his mistress like what the fuck I'd leave the room I know I got a I got a gained weight I would make tea has to think about my life I got to stop being so shredded I gotta get in crime and gain some weight instead of being so good yeah just eat some pasta so legit and shred pick up yeah he died young that was a bummer he was one of those guys that when he died I was like oh Kali 55 or 52 or some shit he was in that neighborhood looked every bit of 60 yeah he had it all in his system too baby yeah he did right yeah he had the full ride he liked to do well I know guys who worked with him I know guys well who worked with him and he just he could fucking tear it out man was the movie kinda played a hit man what was that movie true romance no no it was that one but there was a more recent one god damn it was it with Brad Pitt was there movie with him and Brad Pitt killing me softly yes was he a hitman - they were both hitman well he's also in the drop I don't know if you're thinking much no I'm thinking of killing me softly that's the one right he was great in true romance man fuck he's great in everything he was amazing I mean that Tony Soprano's character literally literally changed what we think of as like a hero in a TV show because all sudden the hero was a murderer like the hero like when he killed Christopher like when they had the car accident he just fucking smothered him he's like this is a good excuse to kill this guy they just killed him right there I was like whoa holy shit holy shit when he closed his nose yeah man that was fucked as how there's nose that was fucked up yeah and that's that's what I was like that's willing to do whatever it took yeah but it was also the star the moon the star of the show and you liked him oh yeah that's what was so good genius did there's never been a show like that is so bad look he was so bad and there's there hasn't been a show like that since then I mean who else is like that much a little villain and a hero wrapped up into one who else what other what other the only person that you can maybe breaking bad but you could see why I was doing it wasn't a bad guy yeah Tony's friends was a bad cheater not his wife constantly murdering people yeah but it was they what was fascinating about him is that it was the dichotomy it was the guy who loved his family told his son to do his homework and not to swear at the table and also would order a hit in the same breath that insane contradiction was what you can't take your eyes off because we're bipolar Apes because you can be a very bad guy and also a really good guy and that's what's that's what's fucking crazy and true about human beings well that's just what's brilliant though about that writing is that they figured out how to encapsulate that in fiction where it's playing out every week and you're not you're not sick of the guy like you wanna you want to see if he's gonna make it is he gonna get busted is he going to jail yeah are they gonna crack down on them who's gonna rat him out yeah you know but that that show is an interesting like kind of metaphor for life like I guess what I really worry about with our social situation today is the destruction of people and how they're never allowed to come back into the fold that's what I worry yeah like I like public shaming or whatever it might be like there are very few people that deserve eternal damnation and they are out there but for the most part Roman Polanski it's a tough you know again a great artist and a great filmmaker I'm reacting to the fact that you I can't I can't justify having you come back to the country and be pardoned after that if the if what you did is true if what I've been what I've read and told was true I don't know how I'm supposed to forgive that so now that's mainly concession to help right and so that falls into line of unacceptable things for me but then there's people that have been shamed like Al Franken we like that was ridiculous that was ridiculous what did he do what I get that the the photo was very inappropriate that he took the annotations you can't just write him without new Weinstein that cheapens no you can't he shouldn't have done it but he was trying to be funny and sometimes people trying to funny especially people around each other all the time they get stupid and they they cross lines and you know or you just don't read the signals you cross a line right in that you're trying to pick somebody up or you're putting pressure on them don't you think it's like mentally what this is gonna do though is people are gonna have to learn to be nicer to each other don't you think that or they're gonna be really careful and afraid and I worry that if you have for example first of all where do people most people meet their wives and and their their girlfriends a lot of times it's at work a lot of times okay their husbands nowise and i think that you're don't be surprised if corporations start to have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of romance in the office space it'll be like the military nobody's loved at anybody if you do get fired right away no questions asked and now think about the fact you're eight hours a day in this place which is most of your waking something to make anybody happy second make anybody happy also please add the fact that we're also going to have all of the meetings between men and women in rooms videotaped and in fact D and in fact men and women aren't allowed to be in the same room without a chaperone yes you're gonna see all the shitty chaperones a role because you're talking about major money you're talking about major fucking he had to be a robot with a camera a robot it says I think you're speaking inappropriately exactly so you have all these issues so is that gonna make all of us happier no we're gonna have to quit is it gonna be necessary officers we're gonna be safer I'm hoping that it makes people quit officers so what happens is there will be no sexual harassment at the workplace because there's no workplace and we're working together no what we're gonna gather know that's gonna slide show up and work together well by the way men and women working together is a pretty new thing in history yeah many wars yeah men and women have never worked together yeah so this is all kind of like and you know you know listen when men and women get together people are starting to fuck whoa they're just gonna fuck Whitney Cummings as a funny joke about that by working in the writing room working on a set of a show like she doesn't usually work like at a place yeah and she's like oh this is what people are doing here yeah I don't want to give away her joke it's very funny but yeah that's you know there's something that's happening when men and women get around each other they're jockeying for sexual position yes and they're attracted to each other and they work together and they end up liking each other yeah and then they get to know each other at work and yeah and then what happens okay so you can say you can't so there's no session and there's no romance and there's no humor humor is dangerous humor could be a problem what if you say something racist and you trying to be funny you get in trouble mmm don't do it you're not racist but you were just trying to be funny right okay but you could say racist things I'll give you a free pass to say racist things about white people well that's fine I'll give you a free pass do many racist white things do you could say at work today Tommy yeah can they be hillbillies yes or rednecks dirty red next dirty hillbillies yeah that's fine shit all over those people that were forced their whole family worked at a coal mine yeah yeah how you dummies will you fucking your kids ha ha yeah be racist all day for white people you can and there's some white people that do not have a fucking good deal they don't have a good deal no they got 400 dollars in the bank if that there's some incredible amount of money or incredible amount of people rather in this country that have less than that in their bank there yeah there was something something at 50% yeah some study they did people that have $200 or less in their bank account and it's some insane number like into the millions and millions of life this is what I always say the people that voted for Trump you know a lot of them have been demonized by you know the left as being racist or homophobic or masazi stuff like that yeah or or they're good people who have former dollars in the bank or unless can't send their kids to baseball etc and along comes Hillary Clinton who's Obama light talking about the same shit and they're like I'll try anything but her look at this there you go that's real read that that's real man six and ten Americans don't have five hundred dollars in savings there you go holy shit no more than I thought it was when you don't have when okay now we're never back to that that story about scarcity isn't that like a hundred and fifty million people or something like that yeah it's more than yeah so so how does that mean what is the real number of people in America is a 300 million or a morning's 3:30 at 3:30 so it's more than that yes it's like 170 170 million people so when you got five hundred dollars back are you thinking about gender-neutral bathrooms always are you thinking about yes misogynist bro it's disgusting yeah to be a man and see other men's I'm just a shame of my gender I'm ashamed oh you're fucking anybody's getting more money so you can send your kids to fucking you anything the Brett Weinstein said that was really interesting about this is it bread or Eric Brett and Eric there's some brothers the brothers they both put on my podcast Eric is a mathematician works for Peter teal yeah I like that guy is the professor from Evergreen college that got the day of absence where they made him quit because there was they were saying white people need to stay home everybody's like that's so racist he's also a Jew like the Jews super super super progressive it doesn't matter the Jews didn't exactly have it easy what he was saying that's interesting you saying that this is not just about that it's also about subordination and that you're seeing this subordination play that's planning that's taking place and then a lot of these men like the way they're behaving they're behaving to be subordinate they're they're being obedient strained yeah you know and they're giving into it to show that you shouldn't punish me because I'm on your side because they're they're terrified of the women that are wielding this power now but I got a fielding it wildly got a theory men historically when you create a bunch of quiet resentment it turns into loud violence men are really good at you got to be careful about make emasculating men a whole sale because I always worry that it's very easy to whip them up when you got the right circumstances in the right leader and men like to organize and they like to fight and they like to fight back and that's what makes them feel significant when they've been a mask and I don't think it's you know that's the expression punishment doesn't change behavior it just suppresses it well do you know that in the turn of the century not this one but the last there was a giant bachelor culture in America where men just didn't they had just gotten through like a lot of it was like in the 20s to like after the depression it was like the burden of having a family was just too much it wasn't attractive to them and there was a bunch of men that gravitated towards pool halls and in nineteen the early 1900s in New York City there was more than 900 pool halls in New York City damn just stop and think of that damn more than 900 pool walls and there's all these men that would just go there and they would hang out and they were like fuck that life and they just didn't want to have a part of it because it was too brutal it was too hard they're all this country would need for this thing to flip on its fuckin ass all they would need is legalized prostitution and guys would be like wait hold up wait hold on I definitely love you I definitely love you but wait a minute wait a moment what am i signing what is this if people found out that they could just get sex anytime they wanted if they had a hundred dollars like if you have a hundred dollars you can get sex you get sex with a pretty girl and it's clean and you have to worry about it people would be outraged like well how am I going to have power over this man if I can't control his sex I could only I only have him locked otherwise we're just friends see if we're just friends I can't have half his money I can't tell him what to do I can't tell him when to be home but we have to live together yeah and I have to control his sex if we live together and then I control his sex then I have all this power but if they were in a situation where legalized prostitution was just like grocery stores or was just everywhere what what would the first of all the amount of hoes would probably be the same it's like this be a lot richer now they're just doing it like under the table it's hardly a way that they can get raided sneakiness as all this you know they have two gold diggers instead of hoes some girls will just go straight into Hoenn yeah but here's my question meeting men are more interested in sex or admiration there's both they want to be against admiration from the hoes yeah but this is all do it's fake though like I think men want to be admired more than anything they do yeah they do they want their dick to be the biggest even if it's a mushroom cap just make all the noise please and let me know I'm King Kong and that's why and you stick to the woman a lot of times you'll stick to that one woman who you know has got your back no matter what she's sure but you're talking about a guy who finds that there's a lot of people that don't find that for them legalized prostitution right next to bolero hop on in genera bread goes sandwich a dicksuck get a grilled cheese and tomato soup get your dick sucked like it would change like what people like why why are you dating are you dating specifically for sex are you dating because you want companionship like are you too consumed with work and are you busy all day and you just like to hang out with your friends but you get horny yeah because we have a solution for you yeah and if that that was the case I'm not saying that relationships wouldn't be the same what I'm saying is there's a lot of relationships it wouldn't be the same dude I think you're onto something like my buddy you know Stevie blue eyes she was like he would have stayed in jail if he had access to women because he was hanging out with all his friends it was a fucking best because all we do is fuck around laugh all day lift weights and you know it's just the food kind of sucks but you're all laughing and you're all in a shitty situations everybody gets along because if I had girls women I would not have left this is in Fort Dix to like you know the biggest federal penitentiary in the world I'm obviously torn on prostitution because I don't want anybody that I knows kids or my kids to go into prostitution but I also don't think anybody should tell people that's something that's completely legal to do for free yeah is illegal to charge money for yeah like there is some gay male escort that came out today there was I put it on my Twitter about like just let these fucking people have sex like some gay male escort was talking about the priests at the Vatican and he's like naming names I fucked damn I fucked and he wants us on my day damn and you know they was talking about them being hypocritical like yeah there are definitely hypocritical let these fucking people have sex this is crazy like your system doesn't work yeah if they just let them have sex and let them have male escorts just leave them alone saying that's fine just as long as you believe in Jesus still yeah it's like dick I believe in Jesus but a lot of dick okay well Jesus must have put that love for dick in you Jesus put that love for that is the truth sure right must have yeah and the truth is it's a complicated thing right because then where do you so so like we had these urges and a lot of them are not very productive uh-huh right so you want to have sex with all you want to have sex with everybody you can or whatever it might be but you know that's not viable because there are just certain trade-offs to that well you know the the viable alternative is ex machina you have these AI robot fuck dolls that live in your house but the problem is they probably get too smart and they kill your real wife you know hugger rhythm yeah and they figure out a way to convert your sperm into babies they just they've figured out a way to create an actual digital woman could idea from movie dude well it's ex machina that that movie did you see that now oh my god it's one of my all-time fair really yeah when I top top twenty all-time favorite movies I'm obsessed with black mirror it's it's basically an hour and 45 minute black mirror ex-market is amazing yeah I do love black bear it's awesome but X marking is actually even more intense it's a really well-done movie about AI and it's it has very few cut the shed scenes like when you're when you're watching it you're like whoa like all of this could be possible percent yeah yeah it's really good I want to tell you anymore it's really go watch it yeah it's it's the shit and it's also yeah that would be the movie what do you think about dolls I mean scary verified it's getting eat us I think what I think how about this Boston dynamic makes those fucking robots that you can't kick over do you know you know those things yeah and they are they're funded by DARPA and DARPA makes a robot called the eater robot dat our robot and the eater robot literally eats biological material I'll spell that out for you it's fucking people it eats dead people on the battlefield to fuel itself it is an actual working concept of a fucking robot that eats dead people for fuel yes EA T oh we can eat hey and maybe sticks and rabbits maybe it'll eat a rabbit it's gonna eat people you fuck wait tactical robot eater project it's from a DARPA it's yeah what's DARPA you highlight in there what's dark idea oh it's a video look at the cursor doing that I'm like why are you highlighting DARPA what story yeah DARPA is I forget the something research it's all military shit DARPA is a robot yes yeah that's a real thing yeah it's a real thing that the same people that are making those Boston dynamic robots you know you see the one recently that it bounces it pulls up to the side of a wall and then bounces over the wall like 13 feet in the air no lands on top of a building they could land on the roof of a building come on from the bottom and hop all the way up to second storey building two storey building it leaps literally from the ground all the way to the top writes itself it's all on wheels so it writes itself perfectly every time that's so fucking dude it's so bananas and all this stuff is happening like while people are paying attention to Kim Kardashian's ass even Jamie Jamie's like oh Kim Kardashian called out the easy mafia today did you like your you like your Kardashian he is he loves celebrity guys did an episode of How I Met Your Mother and she was there and we were we were like her dresser I was right next to mine then she was on set and she didn't look like what I thought she was she didn't have any makeup she's pretty and all but it was just like I didn't even know that I was her I was like I think that's Kim Kardashian I'm not sure it's she's a person she's we've made a bizarre choice to spend a tremendous pend a tremendous amount of time tremendous tremendous amount of time thinking about a person that really doesn't do a thing like they just live like that's what's weird it's like she they've tapped into this extreme desire for gossip and some weird crazy way where they do all these wacky things real life where you can't take your eyes off of him and they always have something new going on but they don't do anything now so now she got wise though and married a guy who does a thing yeah she married Kanye West Yeah right he's a giant cultural thing yeah so then now it becomes like more legit now the whole empire is like really solidified like they've added some fucking sand it's ambition ambition it's just like this strange it's definitely that there's ambition but there's also this they've figured out how to joke the system they figured out a shuck and jive and make their way in with no singing no dancing no I think I have money you know but but what you doing different than you did like besides not worry so much about what a car's gonna cost but what do you do that's luxurious I don't really do much man I dress Lazar dress I know I dressed normal I work I work out I go running what do you deserve any advice you liking you like well honey it's not advice though that's where I get my money this is what I mean it's like I just and I don't spend right I have my standup I like the box I like to you know the things I do don't take that much money they take a lot of time the energy I think if you wanted to travel and you wanted to go on some big-time adventures which I have decided I'm really interested doing some adventure some year especially hunting adventures I like to go to New Zealand I did you guys we should go to his farm I would love to I'd love to go to I want to bow hunt in Alaska in the Yukon he kills wild coats on his property they're wild huh yeah kind of goes I don't know but they're wild he's got you know zeal insane New Zealand is really like an experimentation in invasive species because everything is invasive they have Red Stag that are Europe and they have all these actions actually I don't know if they have access to he's got huge red stag on his property they shoots their parents you know they have some immense animals there and they don't have any predators so they have these crazy seasons we could just shoot things all the time oh there's a wild go look at a cool horns on that thing man yeah that's fucked that's amazing look at that thing I know it's like the ripples of a jellyfish when it's in the water you want to go we can go look at that fucking hands on that thing that's a New Zealand wild goat huh wow those those horns are beautiful look at the coat on that thing - what an amazing animal I know they're smart I was watching a thing online about these guys that were hunting for bighorn sheep you know and they were in the Rocky Mountains hunting for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep with a bow and arrow yeah and I was looking at these things I'm like what a crazy animal remember we saw them when we're in Montana and Rinella was pointing out the size of their balls yes because they have like church bell balls doodad that they're so athletic they keep each other in the balls they do they kick each other in the balls when they learn they're like like jockeying for attention they headbutt each other which is why they have those antlers in the first place and then they walk up behind each other and lift their their feet up and kick each other in the balls yeah I didn't see that constantly they crash into each other though it's incredible dude and they're so athletic I was up in this big whiskey mountain in Wyoming me up my buddy hiking and he discus he just points me and they were just seven of them I roll over them and they are fucking huge they're three times yeah giant animals yeah look at these fuckers look at this what a cool animal to like when you look at the things got some balls the horns and their head boom whoa look at this ugly the sack once they collide look at his sack on the right just swinging how come they don't have any head product Rama well they're probably dumb as fuck I mean seriously what do they have to do I smell mountain lion they're not they're not doing algorithms yeah I mean their food is right in front of their fucking stupid face all the time here it goes mmm and they snap into it - it's not like they're running out of that down there they're putting all this extra emphasis in they're trying to make it uncomfortable for the other dude the crazy thing is when you see two bucks and their horns get tied up together that's crazy but what's crazy about this is that they pause afterwards so they must get their bell rung but look they just stand there and they back up like no one is like bitch I hate you again and now hits you it again you're right right watch what they do they get days does it find a book it must be watches boom and then they but they're both like what is happening here oh Jesus they turn to sideways almost like the one ignore the fact that the guys there Wow look at the sky did it they I wonder if they see cool shit like a butterfly fairies see the fairies his hey you see them came up off the ground dude they hit each other so hard but they they just stop look they hit each other and then they just chill now where do you think they're getting off on it it's like they're getting some kind of a high I wonder if anybody's ever observed like a wonder if there'd be a way to measure like certain neurotransmitters on them like in action like let them collide with each other and then figure out like what happens to the brain I guess there's some burst of happiness that come when they talk about this in concussion where the where they don't suffer from brain trauma or CTE actually they don't get you think that they would but male the male Rams don't have signs yeah the brain is designed different than our same as a woodpecker woodpecker is brain they're fucking they were in my yard I know they're the physiology of their skull most both but the way their brain is attached to the inside of the skulls different yeah our brains like barely attached our brains like someone who's like not worried about anything bad going wrong it's like our spinal cord goes up no brain and it's all one big sort of gelatinous mass right yes well we're just not sturdy no you know we're just so weak in comparison to other animals like you you know it's like like you remember when you shot your deer in Montana and we were we were cleaning it and dressing it and we're pulling on the skin yeah you're grabbing that the wood shake which a lot of people turn into jackets and pants and shit that's the Native Americans just make clothes out them and you're grabbing that hide and you're thinking oh this is so thick like this shit is strong yeah you're pulling on it and then grab your bitch ass yeah we have toilet paper skin I know nothing can make it and it's a process he's gonna put a bandaid on while we were cleaning that while we're when you were doing the ravine comer I remember I sliced my finger up and just touched my finger yeah the blade and my finger squirting all over the place meanwhile I got a really dig in to get this meat I got a really cut through all this skin it's so hard yeah and then you get an infection but if you get a blister on your foot here in the wilderness you know who your fuck yeah fucked a lot of guys I because they wear new boots they go go through boots I'm going hiking this is awesome and then your feet just get fucked what bitches we're on the call - we can't handle the cold oh yeah I got a some negative messages I remember on Twitter when the episode of meat eater came out when you and I were in Montana and I was like don't plan on being comfortable it's the cold oh you fucking pussy this is poor woodsmanship like hey poor woodsmanship listen I'm not a good woodsman I'm a pussy it's 9 degrees outside yeah you don't want you just want me to suck it up oh is that make you feel better if I just suck it up how about if I say it sucks and then I suck it up hunting I remember just hearing you going camping pose here you shaking I hate you shivering in the morning here home of yourself camping blah but do you know what doesn't blow when the camping is over at the best like you have the best showers ever we have the great we have the greatest time - though it's so much fun there laugh so hard I think we're nella want to go to Mexico with us I want to go okay was like you guys don't invite me anymore I want to I told them I told them the next one out cuz we did one where we struck out we win bow hunting for deer in Arizona last night Arizona excuse me Nevada last I think it was August nothing struck out what the cold it was it's very hot very hot 100 degrees really yeah yeah so hot that if you shot an animal there's a real concern about getting the meat back to camp as quickly as possible what's yeah yeah because it's fucking hot TJ Dillashaw something he was up in the mountains of Nevada and Nevada and it was super cold oh yeah that was like yeah yeah he was probably in a different season and maybe for elk you know yeah well there's a there's always a bunch of seasons to write this like early archery which is what we were doing which is where the animals are in velvet so there's they've just finished growing their horns and they're starting to scrape the velvet which is the outer skin off of the bone I didn't even know until really recently that antlers are literally bone and an Elk's antler like those antlers right there that's the fastest growing bone in the Wild Kingdom the fastest growing thing in nature those antlers fall off every year they yep every year they weigh 30 pounds yeah I got 15 pounds each side those groan and it grows in a couple of months what yep goes quick yeah I'd like see if we could find a video do you see any the growth of elk antlers when you were in Nevada like in that 100 degree heat did you see any other animals yeah someone saw an elk we saw we saw some a lot of like Jackrabbits and stuff like that they have a lot of rabbits you have to be really careful with the rabbits to like you if you kill one in skinned one they have little mites and shit that will give you infections that you can die from like legitimately see antlers while antlers are growing they're covered in fuzzy skin called velvet yeah that's what they look like in there in velvet that would you look how quick this masks human growth hormone I mean yes yes the velvet from the antlers a lot of football players were taking it because it actually lets you grow growth hormone so look you can see at April 8th then in April 15th and then April 22nd look how quick that shit's growing that's crazy fucking that's crazy seven days later it's longer look at that May sixth it's fucking gigantic now that's nuts look at that May 13th May 20th a week ladies like a mushroom a week later rose as fast as a fucking mushroom that is crazy a week later after that it's all that's not nuts that is nuts July 1st look at that just a couple of months July 8th July 15th look at the size of that thing okay this must be a commercial elk farm that we're looking at because these elk are so big like their antlers are so big that that seems like it seems like like they're feeding in something be hard to get that many pictures have the same one - yeah anytime yeah there must be a few let me suppose it's obviously pause right there yeah it is if you saw that elk in the wild you would shit your fucking pants that would be the bull of all bowls look at the size of the antlers on that thing that thing has like one two three four five six seven eight nine points on one side and one two three four five six seven eight nine point eight it's a nine by nine please does not have antlers no they don't have antlers but every now and then a deer female has antlers yeah some freak bitch just likes to fight fucking some bull dyke sort of die-cast Aikido just grow some antlers yeah some guy shot one recently Thank You doe they were all confused it was white or was a it was a female brother and had antlers no like what is this yeah but that shit grows every year people who shit on to Mexico I don't know maybe deer there's a lot of deer in Mexico Senora Senora has a lot of mule deer and dangerous though aren't there a bunch I'll be scared home they're not gonna fuck with you what you got to worry about is I mean if you would go to their towns and cause problems you just say no to drugs they're busy making drug money they don't have time to go looking for some asshole shooting a deer yeah and there's ranches that you go to out there where there they normally they're hunting ranches like that's why people go there in the first place and that would probably be like where you park your stuff and you drive in from Arizona I want to count kernan one of the cashiers there and wealth guy and I said what about the cartels he goes they own a lot of these resorts dude your money for them they don't worry about the cartels then I talked to a guy at this amazing restaurant and I said what about the cartels and he said they come here that's where he is does show up in a bunch of SUVs they come they tip they say thanks I go they don't like extra money no the only time that happens is if you're selling drugs out of your restaurant if you're selling drugs out of your restaurant they want a piece otherwise you're fine it's all ingrained it's all like a whole its its business we say yeah it's a business yeah I was in Punta Mita and we took these golf carts they let us take these golf carts to town we're staying at this resort and you could you leave the resort and when you leave the resort there is a stark contrast yes sir from safety and beautifully manicured lawns and landscaped grounds too we get out we are maybe a hundred two hundred yards from the outside and we see a military base it's a very small military base with two guys with bulletproof vests and helmets on holding I don't know what kind of fucking high-powered rifle are behind a metal plate that's attached to the top of a Jeep so they're literally Aryan like riot wore tight wrap vehicles fully armed ready to go so if anything went wrong right over there they drive in so they're protecting this resort and I realize it's active resort that's what it's for they're there to protect all these wealthy people from you know Europe and America and wherever they fly in to stay at this resort and I was like wow this is crazy because it makes sense yeah I mean why else would that be there it's it's there and they're like waiting outside the gate there's a there's a great deal to be said about having institutions you can trust like courts that can enforce contracts that are not corruptable so in this country if you buy a house that piece of paper actually means something most countries that's so much it's your private property but somebody with a bigger gun come and take it from you and as we can decide you did something wrong and they have taken yeah and that is the fundamental difference between our country still and a lot of the countries including Mexico in some places well that's what happened to that McAfee guy and where was it that he was at was it Costa Rica where was he know somewhere else that remember that guy the McAfee guy that came up with that virus software and then he went bananas and moved to some other country some tropical country what happened Dominican well they accused him of murder was it the LEAs they accused him of murder and he had to flee the country and they took his land yeah and he was like hey they're railroading me I gotta get the fuck out here we actually talked to him on the podcast when he was on the lam he called me up on the phone and I did an interview with him on the lam that's what happens yeah he was a I mean guess he's lived in America now but he's a like a bonafide wild man like they were he denied these reports that but there's a forum where someone was taking photos of meth they were making and explaining how their reengineering meth and making it better and they were saying that it was him that he was the one who's doing that he's so he's in Belize got some fucking lab in his backyard he denied the whole thing so I don't know if it's true or not true I think he said he was trolling no your guy may be right remember that Jamie it was something connected to like bath salts like he figured out how to re-engineer bath salts make it better you know what's gonna happen if you take nobody took nobody had a lot of problems then took some meth and they got better here's my question though how many people are doing meth right and we just don't hear about it yeah meth labs and dead dogs so the founder of McAfee Antivirus went on the run in Belize yeah meth meth labs yeah it was about dogs wouldn't say with scroll back and dead dogs okay dead dogs I don't know the story he says he was trolling about the meth labs but it's entirely possible that do it was just part in his ass often Belize somebody wind up accusing somebody of murder and I think they wanted to question him and he's like fuck you yeah I think I'm gonna move back to America I tried this out it's not fun guys happening yeah I'll just blog about you for a couple of years what's he do he started McAfee Antivirus I'm sure he's got millions of dollars they took a lot of his cash though that's a huge problem that that's the problem with Russia and a lot of countries when when like the ruling elite has the power to do whatever they want including kill you you guys take your house this this double agent in England today London he and his daughter are gravely ill been poisoned yeah they were they were a secret agent against Russia right yeah Agence I guess don't do that well you're gonna you're gonna die yeah that seems like a bad job secret agent against Russia that's a risky fucking job did you see Icarus have you seen that yes I have boy won a Oscar for that doesn't it and well deserved well dessert we know where that Russian scientist I love that guy that guy is under protection he is right now under protective custody somewhere he's got it when they're worried about him being assassinated they took not only did they take all of his money they took away his wife's house they should try to turn his family homeless I think they're trying to pressure him and going back to Russia and giving himself up by making his family essentially homeless yes they're putting tremendous pressure on him so you can't get his wife out her Gregory what does this lastname Kagero he doesn't well but I would come apparently she didn't want to listen she didn't want to come he was already out of the country and he did she didn't want to listen to him and she didn't understand it he had then they were listening to his phone calls and his emails and she didn't have a way he didn't have a way of expressing to her Oh like hey you've got to get the fuck out now like if he did that they would've just come and scooped her up go no due process rod Chen off Gregor even watching off the head of the Russian anti-doping laboratory it's an amazing documentary folks if you haven't seen it it's on Netflix man but it just shows you like what it could be like in other countries like they don't play by the rules there's no rules he who has the power makes the rules that's right you're dealing with mafia basically organized badasses yeah there's a lot of people that love it to be left out here oh they would love it I know what history's about here's the thing if you want to use theirs if you if you you know if you want to be if you don't want to believe in things like due process all right integrity of courts and all those things if you don't want to if you don't want to believe that you should have a right to criticize your government I know it works for you right now because the person in power is on your side but you're next you're next as soon as the tables flip and the tables always flip hmm so you are historically ignorant there is a reason that the founding fathers thought through these things they came from tyranny and the genius of the founding fathers was this check those checks and balances and representative government and it's such a radical idea that our leaders basically are they serve at our whim now that's all changing Lawrence Lessig you need to have in the podcast who wrote Republic lost I talk about him all the time Lawrence Lessig will tell you right now he's uh he say he's at Harvard University as a law professor and he said your government does not represent you of the gerrymandered districts well they're all these districts are gerrymandered you know what that means so the congressional districts are essentially they're redrawn so that they favor one party or another do you understand mm-hmm demographics sure so a million Republicans in Massachusetts may as well not vote they're never gonna win they're just not represented because the districts are so gerrymandered that it's always going to be typically a Democrat that's one example okay of the 435 seats in Congress the ones that aren't chair amended the ones that are actually where your vote actually counts they're about 35 of those seats about 35 of the 435 I think that's the number just keep this in mind to every fucking congressman that you know spends 30 to 70% of his or her time calling for money raising funds $0.32 thirty to seventy percent of the time that's insane and they do it and this has been well-documented in Republic lost and so damn much money there are some very good books that I've read on this I've had Lessig on my podcast why's you gotta have him on because he's a fucking import I'd be happy to he's so important to listen to and he heard suppose named Lawrence and then Lessig s le SS IG and he does an amazing job he's got a great TED talk you can listen to her for 20 minutes it's that's all it is and just listen to him talk about how democracy doesn't work the way it does with money in politics now and he talks about campaign we used to when you didn't say campaign finance reform everybody zones out that those words are exhausting oh my god Jesus but he opens the book with this fucking amazing thorough quote and he talks about if you want to talk about the problems in this country in our democracy and this Thoreau quote is I see men everywhere hacking at the branches of evil while none are striking at the root it's a great fucking quote write him Thoreau had some good ones yes he had some good ones because those some of those that and my other favorite Mark Twain quote loyalty to my country always to my government only when it deserves it really cool quotes but you know he does a really good job of saying that thirty five seats really matter and those the only matter the ones that matter what those are my districts worth voting you know where it makes sense to vote where if you're if you're a Republican or a Democrat where that were that's a contested seat but then those those congressional you know candidates or those ones were in color or in the in the seats already they have to raise money to stay in power so they're talking to their donors and their fundraisers are the ones that are telling them what kind of issues they better hit on if they want the big donors that's so crazy yeah man Sophie system it's a crazy system you know what's interesting though this system has affected the place where we came from like what if the United States didn't take off from Europe what if we didn't bail and start this thing up over here what would it be like over there yeah cuz what it was like over there was a bunch of kings and queens and shit that's right and had been like that forever that's right and now now it's kind of they have a queen but it's bullshit you know is the one prince who's getting married that you know people who seem to give a fuck about I don't get it you know George George Washington said right when they wanted to make him King he said I didn't fight this Revolutionary War to become George the second and George George King George I was the king over there and when King George found out that George Washington refused the kingship and said no I'm a president and I will serve a term and you know I'll go back to Monticello or wherever he's from it was at Jefferson or whatever either way he said I remember and he said George came to I said if he said that he's the great man to ever live the rejected power but yeah that's what George Washington said I fought I fought against what's amazing is that it's affected their like to go this works better like it does but but how did it set in over there that's what's fascinating like how did it eventually like they gave up power to sort of emulate the West well the the British the British always had a tradition of this so way before the Revolutionary War way before the American experiment there was always in fact they think it started with Henry the eighth there was always contentious debate about how much power the king should have versus Parliament how much power of the king should have versus the landed gentry versus the IRC it was always that issue but it's kind of hilarious that the king doesn't have to show any merit like that they didn't rise through the ranks by hacking their way through a river of enemy they didn't that didn't just figure out a way to bring prosperity to the land and voted them as king well actually saying that this small islands the small island of pale people basically controlled almost the entire world and one of the things that's given credit is that the British had this sort of religious all idea almost of it was called the great chain of being and the great chain of being was you have God at the top king is second place then you have the aristocracy then you have the nobility the landed gentry and then the serfs and and if you and for you to aspire out of your place your your god-given place for you to say I may be an heiress to grant or a noble or a landed gentry but sometime gonna be the king that would be considered fuckin heresy that would be the equivalent of you saying I think white people are better than black people today I mean it would do that and use it as a quote exactly you're gonna get in trouble I know I know they're gonna isolate even say that well you have to pause in between each one say other words ya gotta speak in code you're right I worry about that son but you you would not do that but that created an incredible order and it created a very very good system to get shit done when people all were in their place doing their duty is very easy to organize right but not to innovate not to take great changes like America has done no but the Brits were great inventors because they they did fine but what I'm saying is they don't have the freedom that they had over here if you don't have a caste system you have the ability to rise from the bottom to the top now we're here that's right like that that is what is most attractive about America yes potential potential that's why we haven't had revolution that's why we don't have the poor confidence getting the wealth of the rich because a lot more m2 believe they're gonna be rich yeah that's a huge that's a huge issue I have a lot of friends that have come over from England man and they just talk about that like how you could actually do something here and people are supportive yeah they don't shoot you down like he said there's a thing that happens over there where they they don't want to see anybody succeed they try to put you in your place and they try to downplay the possibility of your success right right to your face it's very gauche to try to aspire and yeah the scanner maybe it has the same issue it's it's Old Europe thinking right it's it's it's it's gotta be exhausting it's why when along a France start talking about taxing the rich 75% of their income it maybe was met with a great deal of support because it wasn't workable but it was you know there's always been a real suspicion Europe of people with too much money because they become aristocracy and they become oppressive well that's the echoed but what you're hearing today about the elite the one-percenters yeah I know yeah the the the the problem with wealth inequality in this country it's called Marxism wealth inequality man it's called it's called a march toward we're dealing with cultural Marxism and and you know that's always gonna be there it's always gonna be it's a very easy good guy bad guy thing well people don't realize that wealth is always changing so you you don't you don't start wealthy a lot of people started poor then they got wealthy then they lost their money they got wealthy again there is however a concentration of a great deal of wealth and in very few hands you know if you look at Google Amazon and an apple and and Facebook I think they only employ about 500,000 people total and they have so much wealth so you know the question is what do we do about universal income yeah it's crazy and I think this is all going to come to a head with a I I really do I think thing's gonna be automated in the way so nobody has a job yeah I think it's gonna eliminate all driving jobs I think that's within 20 years of our life we're gonna be looking back at driving your own car the way we look back at drum brakes I know so now what what do we do a team to question very good question with an outdated piece of machinery very good question like is it manufacturing you know that we need robots for and maybe there's other things other than driving manufacturing and driving maybe there's other t2b yes yes yeah you're right put your tray in a you know burger-flipping robot flippy starts shift at Callie burger there you go we got a burger flipping robot so he's gonna get a perfect burger you're not gonna have some kid talking about pussy forgetting about your burger you get an overcooked burger yeah right there you go so if that's the case then it seems to me that we are we have to figure out what to do with all this leisure time but we have to pay people it could be real weird man a kid I think it's one of those things that's creeping up on us so too like the internet creeped up on us like the Internet came and out of nowhere all of a sudden everyone had access to any answer to any question you ever wanted you could watch videos on anything you'd learn how to do anything online I mean there's a YouTube video where you can learn basically how to crochet you could learn how to tan your own leather you could learn how to build a bomb you can fucking do anything you could just constantly be taking information that's just the beginning I think one day within the next 10 20 years they're gonna have everything automated and before it's artificial intelligence it's just going to be an a super efficient robot that can do whatever task you program it to do it's gonna be way better rather than people be pointless to have a person do that thing and then we've got to decide what to do with all these people and there's gonna be could be a lot of us there's gonna be a lot of job pocalypse yeah so what do we do is that what they're calling it yeah I mean because 47% of cover of magazine what is it humility is the new smart there's this book about this 47% of all jobs that we know of now at least in this country are going to be obsolete in the next 20 years do you think we adapt yes human beings are yeah well adapted oh I hope we just get more creative I hope people start doing things more with their hands are they are yeah I mean there's there's more access to expressing yourself the problem is it becomes like the cult of the amateur where you just got a lot of bullshit out there but I do think that we will be in a place well like like you know if you look at where philosophy so so what was it the rise of of European Western civilization what the fuck was it Oh anyway if you look at like how the Greeks were able to export timber wine and olive oil it gave their economy some money and they had leisure time they didn't have to live on subsistence they could trade for things that they needed as opposed to making them themselves so the Greece injuries was fairly wealthy in comparison and it gave a large sector of their population at least the richer population time to do things like not be in the fields all day but rather time to sit around eat and think and talk right right which sure which which is probably where a lot of like Socrates and Plato and Aristotle benefited from right sure so you wonder like as we get to a point where we don't have to do so much it becomes very easy to keep our bodies in homeostasis right keep our bodies with at the right temperature and we just need a certain amount of food and shelter and and then you've entertainment is I mean look at Netflix I mean it's 10 bucks a month you can watch anything you want all day forever sure so then like what do we do men what do we do with our time well we we didn't have to think about what we were going to do from 1820 to 2020 we didn't have to think about it it just sort of happened yeah and I think that's gonna happen as well but I think we're gonna have to adjust obviously the advice we give to children as far as what's necessary with not necessary I don't know what to tell your kids either that's the thing they're gonna have to figure it out as they go along but they got to be flexible you know and god I also think and this is why I've been thinking this a lot lately I think we have to move I think California is over fucking populated and I think it's going to get to a point in our lifetime where it's not a smart place to be really yeah this way too many people I mean you know you go to the airport all the time yeah you know that drive I had to do it the other day at 8 o'clock in the morning I was like this is hilarious org you'll get to a point we don't have to fly you won't have to fly you'll get to a point where that's true but the sheer number of people if anything goes wrong yeah on this one spot it's just not wise it doesn't feel good yeah I know I always feel unsafe doesn't feel good it feels like people aren't that valuable they're everywhere then we're infested was the futurist you said you got to learn how to learn unlearn and relearn and that's you know we're gonna survive in the fucking 21st century I'm not really worried about people to survive and I think we're we're gonna be ok in that regard long as we don't get hit by anything like we don't get Putin or we don't get hit by an asteroid or we don't get hit by a supervolcano which are all all those things are actually really possible I mean no one wants to think that we could get attacked by Russia but fucking for sure we can all sorts of weird scenarios can present themselves in this wacky life with a bunch of things falling into place in the wrong way all of a sudden you got world war 2 it's happened I mean that's just the nature of humans and if we deny the past yeah that was then we're different now if we don't look at this rationally we can realize like how precarious we are now that is just one thing that we can kind of control hopefully human beings can control their impulses to fucking hit the button yeah well there's that think that and now being too said and what's his name Nassim Taleb yeah who talks about the Black Swan so know that there's always a Black Swan know that the aberration know that history is full of things you never saw coming Hitler Hitler the financial crisis yeah yeah it goes on and on and history is full of that most wars start as a weekend skirmish and people kind of leave for the weekend leave all this stuff and it's gonna be over and before you know it it's it's a thirty-year civil war that's happened in Lebanon that's where it tell it's from so that you've got to at least know that you may be able to predict the future but know that they're the unpredictable always be present and will always take what you took to be reality and flip it on its fucking head and I think robotics and I think AI are certainly you know that tidal wave do you worry at all about super power struggles between like the United States and China United States and Russia way less only because I think that there's less there's less profit in violent warfare it just doesn't profit anybody there's way more profit and trade and dealing with you know you're gonna have issues like this tariff issue but for the most part it's so-so so the biggest advantage is that there isn't a whole lot of advantage for a country to take over territory because that's not what makes you wealthier so if Russia came in and took over Silicon Valley there's nothing to talk about doing that I think that was typically was dropping a bomb somewhere what they're saying is essentially that they're not talking about invading the United States that's ridiculous yeah they would never do that the real question is would unless they nuked us but why would they drop a bomb well there might be some reason why they feel backed into a corner interest in the United States sure yeah it's not likely unless they feel like there was some way where they would benefit extremely well from having us debilitated like it's not likely because we would attack back and it's mutually assured destruction right yeah but the fact that a person could make the decision whether or not to do that or whether or not that's logical and you're relying on a person who's essentially a murderous dictator running this fucking crazy half-assed government over there I mean what is he doing over there I mean just from what you know about Russia state-sponsored doping program with that guy Ted went up to Putin everybody knew what the fuck they were you know when they were doing it on purpose was like I mean there's a crazy country ban okay it's crazy and it's 2018 it's still crazy it's well it's run by they did one idea which is might makes right that the male with the biggest club is the male that that you know calls all the shots my my that's a big concern with me but my real big concern are natural things yeah pandemic virus killer accidents nuclear accidents and earthquakes earthquakes the big one from a supervolcano that is an inevitable reality that we're gonna have to face one day whether it's a hundred years from now or that's ten years from now Yellowstone is gonna blow they don't know when but it could be any time and it could take out the entire the whole continent yeah if the Yellowstone blows they say every six to eight hundred thousand years it's a continent killer it just blows and everybody's fucked and it last time it happened was 600 thousand years ago so it might be two hundred thousand years before it happens again and who knows we might figure out how to drill a hole in there and pop it like dr. pimple popper you ever see that the Instagram page sure I have just chose a hole in there like a pimple squirts out and maybe it's okay maybe it'll keep it from blowing up but if it blows dude they're thousands earthquakes are a year thousands thousands just constantly moving in rumblin there's just loose crust and underneath is gigantic reservoir of melt and rock melted rock melted rock that shoots into the fucking sky giant a very blood of the earth oh it's so big they didn't even know it was a volcano until like I think it was 20 maybe 20 years ago I started doing overhead satellite photos and they're like oh Jesus and they thought it was just like a hotbed of you know geo solar activity or what it would be none geo solar geothermal geothermal activity you only had Old Faithful would spray water up in the sky and they realized oh this is something going on underneath the surface and then they get these satellite photos and they realized holy shit this is all this is a crater this thing is a crater that used to be a mountain that exploded and I want to say it's something like how wide is the called I don't want to mess this up if you want to say it's like 600 kilometers wide yeah it's for the earth that we know is molten lava there's a bunch of shit down then it's not good is it okay okay no it's 35 miles 50 mile long don't thing is weird that you can that there are so many different kinds of reality so the reality that that if you go up into the stars it's a different reality and you go away in the microscopic level it's a totally different reality then you can go to the subatomic level look at this the region's most recent caldera-forming eruption was six hundred and forty thousand years ago creating the 35 mile wide 50 mile long Yellowstone Caldera okay I fucked up the distance but still that's pretty goddamn big so a 50 mile long 35 mile wide volcano that just blows up to the point where the tops not there anymore and just shoots off shit a mile into the sky and then you get nuclear winter all over the globe and anything anything remotely near it gets cooked instantly is that right oh yeah your fuck so we're all dead oh we're dead is fuck we're dead as fuck if y'all just don't blows we don't have a chance if you won't talk to the mics if you want to talk to that like kind of like like they'll lose a leg of this brush to a shark or something earth and they and they end up dying like you know they they pass out they all said that it was super peaceful like they just got this overwhelming sense of peace and they were like oh I'm gonna die now oh yeah yeah that's the brain the brain is pumping out that dopamine and dimethyltryptamine and all these different things try to transition you yeah but like existence is a weird thing what do you think happens I don't know man oh well when you go my feeling is that talking this quantum physicist this badass dude I feel like there must be this idea that existence is a question of he was talking about existence is a question of the question what question you're asking a where are you standing so there there are different forms of existence right so there are different forms of reality like there's the subatomic reality there's the Newtonian reality that you can measure and see we're here if I was looking at Los Angeles from a plane that's a different perspective it might be a different kind of reality and he he kind of like said most physicists he was trying to explain what existence is right and how it's meaningless and I was like what the fuck he talked not any much he was talking about mathematics he said he said well this is a reality to us because of where we are standing and the space-time continuum that we are occupying right now so we are here and all that you are experiencing may not may very well not even be a reality right over in this direction yes what the flats would need say when they sit around with legal papers all day was write a bunch of shit nobody fucks so well that's well that's what I mean and I said what's up I go what the fuck are you talking about and he said he's gonna win a Nobel Prize and he said um okay I guess the best way to put it is think of you having virtual reality goggles on and you know people are splashing water on you as you're in there in water and you're getting rocked back and forth I guess that's the best way to describe what you what you consider to be your reality I was like alright alright maybe I don't know maybe maybe but they seemed to be able to prove a lot of this and like what's fascinating to me is I didn't how to get into this but like he was talking about how electrons can communicate with each other like how to sheet of metal and they don't they don't see each other like in terms of the X runs are light years away but they completely all work together and and he was talking about they would yeah there's a mathematical way of proving halls theorem is there's a mathematical sort of algorithm that proves that they are the answer to that is that there's an invisible conductor like something a higher intelligence and emergent intelligence is dictating that communications intelligence or order and order right but not in intelligence that's Owen tells us the wrong way it said he said that to me too because I said it tells him and he said order and you're right so there's an order right so there's a there's an order to the chaos right so the way schools of fish but you know she's voice a bird guess what else behaves that way inert matter yeah electrons well that's one of the things that they think is going on with birds it's one of the reasons why birds have some sort of internal compass and that they literally mentality they react to the poles of the earth like they know one my reading birds they know which way to go yeah like they really do somehow or another but they also know not to fly into each other like when you see them all flying together and they move in tandem yes say it's gorgeous aim it's gorgeous but you know your brains are the same waste of neurons yeah there's no reason it makes no sense that the neurons so each neuron is just essentially an on/off switch or you know it's a whatever it is but for whatever reason all of those neurons have self-organized who organize them they self-organized okay that's what's fascinating and the way your brain has self-organized so has this sheet of metal and he kind of proved he sat around and I think he's 38 or 39 and he and he solved this this theorem called halls theorem took them three years to make sure he was right don't you think that happens when there's like like a big mass event like like mob mentality don't you think that's part of what is going on with mob mentality and that things happen and things can get chaotic and people just go with it they go with it in mob and I think I think the origin of that is probably survival instinct in war that in war you have to accept unbelievably barbaric reality and so you have to be able to slide into that whatever we're killing everybody with axes let's go and then everybody else is doing it I guess I'm in and then you start hacking people up where you would never do it by yourself if it was just totally up to you but you find yourself getting caught up in the way in the hive where the human hive is moving but all these people are moving towards violence or moving towards chaos like people get wrapped up in these mob mentality moments in a very very well you can also go you can actually you can step back from that and actually you can explain that actually when you look at bacteria certain bacteria and certain insect colonies and let me explain so somebody like Antonio Damasio who is a behavioral scientist who wrote a fucking great book but very dense called the strange order of things and he talks about how human beings behave in a certain way like their feelings are directly related to their biology because their feelings are essentially the voices or the mechanism by which you know whether or not to bring your body back in homeostasis when it's out of homeostasis when it's out of this homeo dynamic actually state right so in other words that mob is probably going in there with axes because they spur sive the feelings are they perceive a threat from that other group because that other group is going to take something from them okay it's going to either take their resources their children whatever it might be and take over their territory so so watch bacteria actually behave the exact same way and you can put bacteria into certain like and there's a scientist does this a lot you can put them into certain conditions where the bacteria will behave like that they'll do some fascinating things not only will they fucking take over the other bacteria and go out into an all-out war and kill mercilessly the other bacteria but sometimes when they find they can't kill that bacteria they'll actually cooperate with that bacteria now how about this within the ranks of their own bacteria the bacteria that are not pulling their weight that tend to be lazier than the other bacteria even of the same they're the same species those bacteria will be fucking shunned they'll be pushed out they will not like people they're there they're the weak link insects if you look at insect colonies they behave very much like human cultures do you got an ant that's protecting the queen ant or the bee that's protecting the Queen B you have soldiers that do the fighting you have workers that do the working and they self organize in this incredible way and nobody's really know it's not like it's somebody it's not a top-down thing it's sort of a genetically programmed thing but their behavior is very similar their behavior so even with bacteria when they can't beat this bacteria they'll join forces with that bacteria to defeat the other bacteria that's weaker and it's fascinating so even on the unicellular level you see striking similarities between humans and even bacteria now add to that the fact that one only one in ten of your cells as a human being is actually human and the rest is bacteria back time done yeah in fact you as a human might be the patina you're just the patina on a background of bacteria so maybe bacteria is dictating how the fuck you behave will the bacteria here outside its skin inside and outside skin floor is incredibly important yes that's why we recommend people eat probiotics it's one of the things that helps you with diseases and then natural oil soaps and not non antibacterial soaps that's very important so so that's right so keeping your your biodome yeah in order which is the new science might also be dictating your very behavior I think it does I think when I eat healthier and I eat a lot of probiotics I feel like more at ease I feel more comfortable I heard you have to be careful with that probiotics because you can throw off your we've got level two and what are you eating though I'm eating it in food my I've decided a long time ago that I mean you can take some probiotic pills and stuff like that and I definitely take someone I'm on the road yeah I bring that on a total gut health because I'm on the road I don't know what the fuck I mean right I want to make sure I'm getting good food but a mom at home I eat a lot of fermented vegetables I've been I've been there's a lot of that i kimchi like almost every day well because you're an extremist I know yeah but it's it is good if you feel good drink a lot of that shit that kombucha is fucking phenomenal at gt's kombucha I heard some Oh somebody in my family got endometrial cancer and the doctor said the surgeon who deals with this exclusively said do me a favor just don't drink these for a while whoa and she goes why and he said I can't prove this yet but I see a direct link between this type of cancer and women who drink a lot of probiotic drinks like this no sure yes CVS find anything on that women drink probiotic drinks cause cancer and this is a sense thanks martinis blowjobs put that all together hey man come on - that's too much just kidding that would be terrifying that if that was the case well I would think maybe there's a certain level like if you are a nutty person who drank like really powerful kombucha all day like all you drank is kombucha yeah like your body might be overwhelmed extremists emanating right I mean you gotta have balance the question is this - what's the metric for how many vitamins you need right and then on top of that if you have enough what is adding more to that do does it help you or doesn't do nothing that's do harm why is it you know is it the same for you as it is for Brendon is it the same for me like how is there a USDA once everybody's body so radically different size you know like what how come a thousand milligrams is good for this guy and it's not good for him I think that there's a lot of people - that are probably just not getting the right fucking combinations of food - you know like you just need to experiment figure out what's the right combinations of things for you like that was what the whole Gracie diet was based on the Gracie diet was based on you shouldn't eat certain foods in combination because the enzymes that are to break down fruit are not good to mix with the enzymes that break down meat and you should eat them separate from each other and like they had a bunch of whole like what are you hearing about that stuff what's your what do you what do you think if you if there are certain truths about diet after all this time like certain truths rice giant variations between human requirements that's what I found truth I've stopped saying for a long time ago that you should do this one thing you should definitely do is eat healthy right so what's eating healthy I don't think there's anything wrong unless you have some sort of a disease only there's anything wrong with eating a bunch of green leafy vegetables I think that shit's very important for you I do it I feel better when I do it my body feels like when I eat like a big ass salad like a spinach salad my body always feels like this like yeah you know like you got it in there that's what I was looking for I was looking for them some of that green leafy stuff all those phytonutrients that out that to me that just it feels like my body jives with that yeah elk wild game meat tastes better feels different we've evolved it's different it's just different I know everybody's been saying it forever and then when I eat it I go oh oh like it gives you that salad thing times five it's like whoo like when I eat a nice steak it feels good I like a nice steak but it's a lazy nice it's a lazy meat if I cut into nice American corn-fed steak tastes delicious but it's a lazy meat I cut into a piece of Elgar like he just rumbles somewhere deep in your DNA you eat a deer there's some about eating a deer your body's like this motherfucker was sprinting all day no there's something in there that's different you're eating an animal that has this vitality to it a wild vibe I'm Charles Poliquin yeah a strength coach talks about you guys for me I have to eat my favorite meat is the long horn antelope in the north of Canada they spend a lot of time running away from wolves so you know that the glycogen in the meat is always there always have a question it's like a meat fudge and of course you have to kill them from helicopter you can't you're not allowed to kill them anywhere else so you should the helicopter and there's only one meat stew on Toronto that I go to I'm like all right dude take it easy - it does sound delicious antelope sure it's not caribou no it's a type of antelope I think Wow yeah and they're and they maybe it's caribou but I think it's handleable maybe I don't know but either way they run away from wolves all day and the kalaiy kitchen is really high well we're going axis deer hunting maybe that's gonna kawaii it's probably not but axis deer they evolved in India running away from Tigers there they're an Asian deer and they're natural enemies Tigers you have never seen an animal I shot at a deer that was 40 yards away it looked at me I let the arrow go by the time the arrow got to it it was nowhere near where it was once my arrow goes 280 feet per second the arrow once it left the string was headed towards that thing at 280 feet per second that deer was nowhere near it Wow who is six seven six seven feet away like gone the arrow went right into the bushes and he was over there yeah see ya you ain't seen nothing like it they're like from the matrix let me see an access deer big it's about a hundred and thirty two hundred and five d pounds for a big one not quite as big as a whitetail like a like a northern whitetail like we hunted in that looks that looks a lot bigger than it really is there's see if you can find the picture the one that I shot its online on Cameron Haines Instagram page I try to keep them off all the dead animals off my Instagram page I send them to my hunter friends they post them they get so mad people get mad meanwhile they have a burger on their page people are just goofy there is that's my access deer that I shot that's amazing yep that's in Hawaii it was quite a lot of bugs no no little tiny ones a little bit but know what it really is is a giant that's a pronghorn antelope that's a different animal it's not an antelope in Canada okay they because I know they're in like Montana shit okay oh they're on a coin well we're headed down the south no I don't think so I don't think I've been no nope just Texas I'm Texas is not the south though so if we can organize something for Mexico you're in I'm down I think it will use rifles so to be easily at me now yeah you brought me that bow I've yet to show you no but you can't go bow hunting without especially oh yeah after deer like I said with that thing and you're one of you yeah well it's just it's just something if you want to really do it you got to get obsessed with it yeah and it's something the first time you do it it should be in a controlled environment like one of the first wait would really be the good way would be wild pigs over bait because there's a lot of places where they try to eradicate these wild pigs so they have feeders and the feeders will go off and the wild pigs are almost like conditioned to go near the feeder and then when they go near the feeder you know exactly the distance because they're right underneath the feet or the feeders 20 yards away from you and you have a controlled shot and it's easy and it's an animal that they must kill so there's not like a number of them that you can hunt can't believe how many there are there's so many if you're in Texas they shoot them out of helicopters they fly around in helicopters and gun them and stay still say you can't shoot your way out of the problem well they're doing their best to at least do something about it they're not going to shoot their way out of the problem to the point of extinction they move so quick there's so many of them they're smart toughest shit and they have litters three or four times a year yeah they just constantly what are the ones that I saw there's one eating out of a garbage can in the Asia those gotta be and those are not wild pigs those are wild boars wellbore just means a male of females assess some of those ones you see they have got a Razorback they're just like those you know they look like they're not as big as pigs but they're just fierce looking well it's just because of supply of food if they had as much pigs as much yep oh yeah that's a real wild boar man that's a big-ass pig that doesn't look like a real pig honestly that almost looks like a warthog yeah that's so big but here's the thing about wild pigs man this is something I learned from our pal Steve Rinella they are literally all the same animal wild pigs and domestic pigs they're the same animal it's called sue scrofa they're all part of one gigantic species size of that thing that looks like a powerlifter yeah it looks like it's like 400 pounds got that long as snout is there's tiny little bitch-ass feet yeah that's a tiny feet that doesn't even seem real that seems like an animal and like like a Beatles cartoon like the nowhere man you know his proportions were all I think about John Jones and how skinny his legs are and what a fucking beast he is like you got some pencil legs strong shit - oh he's strong as shit legs yeah she'll son said he he cradled him said it was he did didn't he cradle Ryan Bader yeah the east smoked Ryan Bader he smoked he choked out Ryan Bader he smokes everybody he's ridiculously strong he's ridiculously strong too when it comes to like deadlifting and shit - does a lot of powerlifting now so strong with him I don't know I want to see him fight Steve Bay I want to see him fight Barack that's what I'm saying that's what Brendan now we're just saying this is the fist of the card steep a DC John Jones Brock Floyd Mayweather CM Punk ha failed Dosanjh Tyron Woodley there's your pay-per-view there's your parents view you're welcome it's kind of crazy you will want to see the khabib time first and I'm very excited won't you come to Brooklyn what are you doing April 7th if I'm not plug some dates come

infection I had a wound up getting a root canal it'd be like you could hear it like pop through and then just this fucking shit breath they spread my father's found he was sleeping the wife said you have to go to the dentist so why does your breath is so out of control so apparently he had an abscess a sack of bacteria in the back of his mouth well when they took the filling out and they popped by accident the sack the nurse through it was a double vomit fest what'd she get it shouldn't be bad I never have the balls to tell someone their breaths to tell me your breath stinks I'm gonna tell
