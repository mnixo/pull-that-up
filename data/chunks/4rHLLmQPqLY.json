Tommy Chong ladies and gentlemen how are you sir I'm fine man great to see you again man you too Joe I tell everybody that one of my first ever experiences with comedy recordings was listening to big bamboo when I was a kid my parents had it and they'd let us listen to it we opened it up like a big old packet of rolling papers and pull out the album's back then the actual record you know and so I've been a fan for a long time I can tell how are you the lover of the weed and I don't find it couldn't be better I'll be 81 right wow that's amazing it is that sounds crazy to say cuz I'm 51 that sounds crazy to say when I say I don't like Jesus it's not true fuck I'm thirty years older than you wow wow that's something but I feel good man you know all the systems are go again you know and that that makes a big difference in their life you know yeah that's what I found out the Fountain of Youth is the pussy that's it yeah that's all it is drinker to the Fountain of Youth and you'll live forever really yep okay yeah what about if you're gay well I guess on pause yeah I had to think about that well I guess might be dick for that I guess it no I don't know it has to be the fountain it has to be the phone so even for gay folks it's got to be pussy - well how long what's the longest living gay guy you know that's a good question huh like Bob Hope man was he gay no no that's my phone they use yeah you know because there's more romance well what happens is your body when it reaches a certain stage it it starts disintegrating because it's getting ready for the recall mm-hmm and the reboot yeah and you get a new body and the way you go again but if you keep this body healthy it feels that there's no need to to leave because he and you obviously still got more shit to do yeah you're still enjoying it yeah you're still producing you know are you exercising and everything oh yeah yeah what do you do I got a trainer now yeah but my main exercise is tango tango tango really I will turn you on to tango tango is old folk sex you the whole thing about tango is it's so intricate it was a the original tango was a mating dance from Africa really and what they would do they did the tribes and young kids will get together and dance and flirt with their feet and so when the slaves got taken you know from Africa and put on the boats in that they ended up crossing the the foot dance with the Adagio French dance the dance of the brothels and so the so then they ended up with the music or a dance called tango which was a combination tango itself is a word that means small drum it's an african drum just like mambo it's an African word that means storytelling really yeah dude story time with Tommy Chong yeah oh yeah man and I wrote a whole paper untangle so anyway tango like I go to Argentina with my wife a lot and it's very tough dance to dance with your wife you have to dance with a stranger and she has to dance with a stranger why is that I think it's you're too intimate too personal you know each other too well mm-hmm if you're a stranger then all you can respond to is the dance signals mmm like the man has to lead but he has to lead in such a way that that you can't see him you know he can't pull her around he suggests okay like if and so he'll suggest a certain move and then the girl the his partner will understand that move and she can do a couple of and that certain way hmm like one is called the fuck I can't remember the the term ojos ojos which means back and forth and and and out of those combinations once the guy gets the girl going into a chose for instance then he can move on to no he'll stop her with his foot and then you move on to another series of moves and they're all designed and but the stranger you know the woman has to really listen to the moves if she's danced with a stranger or a teacher hmm and and that's how and then it has to be a close embrace and the woman has to be that cuddled up against the guy not always but for the most part so you're not looking at your feet at all and it's all about feel and so you have to feel the other person's body and it can get so intimate man yeah that you really felt after good dance with a good tango teacher you really feel like that happened to cigarette really relaxing for a bit did you study this did you like take classes I got turned on to it in Paris I was cheating now we're finishing up the Corsican brothers and I was we got offered to do the Cisco Kid and they sent me the script and in the script said tango dancers and so there were we my wife and I girlfriend at the time but the wife now we used to drive by this place that said tango and neon lights and so we stopped and and took our first tango lesson from this George and Rosie a couple there George was too old to get out of bed he was the butt is in his 90s or something he was in bed Rosie came in met us and we and she showed us the first little bit of tango well my wife shall be who was an excellent dancer she's been studying dance you know ever since I can remember you know and so she she started doing salsa first and then I found out about that nice had to learn salsa but then we started learning tangled together and then she went on to really learn how to dance how to dance with the pros mm-hmm me I'm still struggling to be a pro and it's very hard like MMA fighting you know like she's a pro I'm an amateur hmm and so when I when we go down to Bourne azari's like we went down for her birthday I was a video operator cuz I didn't know how to dance mm-hmm you know that well I take lessons almost 20 years now but I still don't have the skills to to be a professional like that but yeah so I went down and videotaped her and then I came back and I made a vow Isis this is embarrassing you know because people know me from years ago and I still can't dance it's so so it's it's about time that I learned so I I gave up everything to learn tango and not really but what you give up golf more than anything really yeah there's a lot of guys right now that are going crazy why would you give up golf for tango well actually it worked out really well I played a tournament golf last week and I did the best I've ever done if you lay off something you forget all your bad habits well that's true too and you probably been really enthusiastic about it loved it you know I wasn't mature you know for me I'm you know I got about a 36 handicap something like that but so but I gave up golf because it's too much energy it was taking too much energy sure you gotta walk around all the time yeah I would also imagine that the tango dancing all the movement in the footwork would actually probably make you more steady and stable balance better so it'd probably be your golf game better oh it did I noticed that with yoga yoga makes pool better yeah some weird way like it makes it stand stronger yeah yeah so yeah there's also a pause in comedy has someone asked me about the secret of Communists applause and in the tango supposed to mmm timing timing waiting yeah waiting and using that that that silence you know before you say something to give people the time to formulate their own thoughts about what you're doing order to concentrate on what you're going to say next and then that's same same thing with tango is this you yeah oh yeah that's me with PD will you end an Seng with the Stars yeah oh shit yeah how hard was that to do oh it's incredible okay nor every what the hell is going on here good lord he's saying to her there we did it we did it we did it Wow yeah Randy coat in looks like Randy was crying what's his name Kevin Hart Kevin Hart was the judge yeah he gave me a ten oh that's the only thing I got look at look she had to carry me off there Wow oh yeah that tore my butt up man I imagine literally serious fucking the training for that King ref I came off that was rectal cancer whoa I got I found out on that show Wow how'd you don't think he got it from Dancing I think I got it from no smokin and in the stress from no smoking weed no smoking weed I quit smoking weed during the show why did you do that I thought it would help me with my coordination ourselves well with me beyond aeration listening you know yeah because it's hard to learn things when you're spelling something sir I'm saying it yeah like in jujitsu most people agree that it's not a good idea to smoke pot when you're learning skills but it's a good idea to smoke pot when you have the skills yeah yeah it was coming you down yeah when you roll and you already know what to do it's like instinctive then you can smoke some pot yeah but like learning like if someone shows me a new move and I'm high I can't even figure out where the body still I'm like where's your arm how am I doing this you get too high you know what am i doing you get baffled yeah yeah well that's the same as tango well so you really think that that happened to you because of that you see I had prostate cancer and and it was a kind of process it was so slow acting lazy ass doctor said well we won't do we'll just leave it alone and you probably died of something else before that happens and so he says attitude that was there at it Jesus Christ yeah it happens all the time you know because you know prostate can be very slow and I had a slow one and but I had a biopsy when I had known to find out because I was going to do the growth hormone and that's why I checked out my blood to make sure you know I didn't have cancer found out I had prostate cancer and but they did a biopsy and I think that could have done it you know to biopsy they can take a piece of yours so you think that taking a biopsy could have caused damage which would have led the cancer could have could have caused the cancer cell to to hit the director the way it did oh and so I got a bag now I got a cross me bag you know and so but now I'm totally healed now and I'm good to go you know the only thing the and so I don't know if it was the lack of weed in in the stress in end the fact that I had prostate you know so when they fixed direct oh and I got the best one of the best doctor Kazanjian what they have to do they had to operate they had to take out change the plumbing from from the front from the back to the front that's the class me bathe so he so III have no more rectum Wow so a virgin again I'm kidding and then you put the background to the front and that's all they did there and then I had then they but to but they did they swept the prostate clean with the radiation they said we're down there anyway so we might as well do their prostate too so they fixed a prostate and thank God I never had it taken out because now I can I got the sleeping giant is awoke again giant yeah yeah I woke the sleeping giant up I think it was a weed that did it too and plus my gorgeous weight but yeah I started getting these urges and I thought oh oh what's happening here and I'm doing testosterone that's probably what did it yeah the tossin testosterone and then and then I'm going in for a shot tomorrow that's it's a it's a new procedure that they use apparently to help induce labor because it's all about blood flow down there mm-hmm and so it's going to do so I tried pills I tried viagra you know it doesn't doesn't work enough mm-hmm and so I'm going in tomorrow for an injection of some some help the blood so they help the giant get a little more awake now when you went to jail you had a sudden you your your case was horrible I mean it was it was so depressing to hear that you were going to jail for making bongs yeah I mean it just the whole thing was so sick and that they were threatening to put your family in jail and then that's how they sent you to jail you couldn't smoke pot for a while after that right years how long probably three years you're on probation probation pre probation before you went to jail pre-agreed trial because if you get caught in you end up getting tortured what the whole time I was there nine months I was there I couldn't smoke they tested me all the time they try to catch me mm-hmm there's nothing to catch and then a year after that I was on probation and I never smoked I can quit you know I got willpower you know I can quit I quit smoke and I quit drinking I quit eating bad food whatever but you had the record but one thing that happened that was great who was that you became even more of a hero to the cannabis community because people knew you truly were a martyr and it was outrageous and it was so it was so wrong that even people that didn't smoke pot really kind of fuck you arrested Tommy Chong they come on like all the terrorists in the world the criminals are rapists and murderers no you gonna put Tommy John in jail yeah like what are we protecting or serving what are we doing here which one which one is that yeah they were just showing off showing off but once I once I get in I was in there with a lot of people that were unjustly incarcerated I was in there with the orthopedic surgeon for the Rams and he he had been in attacks that it wasn't it was legal at the time he did it which was that he had a big car collection and he and he rode off the car collection somehow and then the IRS changed people and and next thing you know they they came to him and said you all this money and if you don't pay it you got to go to jail and he couldn't pay it so he went to jail oh this is the earth of Pedic surgeon and he's like super straight the street is one of the straightest guys ever met and there was another guy that that figured out the OJ tax scheme you know how OJ can keep his is money from the chances in Florida yeah well it's a it's a law that a loophole that allowed you know OJ to keep his taxes I mean tax free money and so so this accountant figured out how to do it and he started getting rich people so they didn't have to pay taxes and so rather than to change the law or do anything like that they just put his ass in jail because they could and they put him in there for a year and he wasn't doing anything illegal nothing illegal except and then they told him or you you're going to get out in a year but you're not going to do that tax thing anymore Wow no no no the government the IRS is kre-o do not want to owe them money especially if your Trump oh well they're coming after him right now right what are they coming after him for now they'd like New York State is allowing Congress to subpoenas tax returns oh yeah yeah Deutsche Bank they got his accountant is the count nothing to do with the federal government I tell everybody why would you want to be President like why would you want to do that to yourself unless you're super clean and let if you're super clean they're gonna make shit up about you know the only reason Trump did it is because you Luton so much money do you think so oh for sure very sure how did this lose their billionaire get get financed over and over and over again and guess who's the laundering money like crazy from Russia the guy that needs the money no the whole Trump family's going to go down you think so oh for sure taxes man Al Capone - Donald Trump you can't evade taxes so do you think that he owes taxes that he owes Putin he owes Putin so much money that he's scared to death how do you know this common sense okay so it's a guess oh no they figured out okay let's go down the history Komi is a FBI right more FBI trunk was attacking Obama was the birther Obama's a President Obama's got control of the FBI CIA everybody so Obama says okay find out about this trunk guy so they found out about him but the thing is they can't really do anything on this he becomes president other than that he just walked away free no one gives you anything unless he becomes president yeah are you mean the FBI there's no breaking the law there's no law that says that you can't deal with Russia right only law says you can't deal with Russia and be the President of the United States right time right the only time he would break any laws is that if if he became president right and he has to become president and he became president thanks to call me because Hillary was gonna win no matter what they say Hillary was gonna win until Comey said oh and they knew they knew back in Obama time that there was nothing really wrong that Hillary did nothing nothing well they told her to release emails she deleted 30,000 of them so but she wasn't supposed to do that that's illegal and she was using her own personal email server instead of the government's which were it was kinda out of laziness and convenience more than than anything illegal you know she wasn't looking to get finance to her hotel by the Russians you know she wasn't looking for money mmm her and Bill had money they got money yeah yeah I think it's a little bit fishy a little little stinky stuff around there yeah but it's normal it's it's not politics so so my theory is is that Comey and the FBI said let's get this guy so you think they let him become president so they can't get him I think bars part of the part of the the the the Comey gang this you know it's gonna be hilarious about this this video when people watch this thing I know how high is Tommy Chong Tommy Chong jeweler made Trump presidents so they could prosecute them yeah yeah that's an interesting theory yes but think about how think anybody's controlling the strings that well but puppeteers so that good listen if look at everybody that was around Trump that became chief of staff and everything else well all military right why because chunk Trump's got his finger on the button he's got a bill ADEA to get on the button mm-hmm and so in order to keep him in line they got people around him that can keep him in right yeah yeah and the FBI they can infiltrate anything they infiltrated the mob for years they infiltrated the Hells Angel do you think they couldn't infiltrate Donald Trump's gang but do you think they were trying to absolutely will be just because him going after Obama with the birther stuff it's a start yeah you messed with the president look at that and other people weren't saying he was from Kenya right there's some ridiculous Photoshop analysis of his birth certificate anything anything to keep a black guy from being a president yeah and that's what they found out easy and and and and the FBI in the federal lives you know against racism and that's pretty pretty pretty strict it's pretty heavy you know until Trump Guardian and so so anyway this my theory that that that's something she's got a theory right there yeah like like I I really feel that Giuliani as is part of the scheme to keep Trump you know why was hope well you could some hope you know hey they can't look at your taxes you're the president for Christ's sake you know yeah you're the supreme leader you know well he does have there's some things they won't do when you're in office absolutely won't indict you for certain things absolutely and so they plan it well look at mother said he says I'm gonna hand this off to the Congress mm-hmm you can impeach him here's all the evidence you need to impeach him and no the Democrats they've got to figure out are we going to impeach him goes through that or are we just going to go to the election and beat assassin election and then then arrest him after the election who do you think is gonna beat him in the election anybody anybody you think Joe tiny them oh yeah really oh yeah you are high huh no strong weaned what are you getting there well look at look at the trunk the trunk backers for instance right can you find one thinker in that backing group well I mean who are we were talking about the same thing you know the Kin Kin Kin think racism blind you right but what racism racism is ignorance it's its appearance I've got to do it I had it in my family you know so I know exactly I've been I've been you know just in close to racist and I know that mentality and so here egg nuts yeah ignorant doesn't stop with one thing it carries on to a lot of a lot of other things Wow like work and like all sorts of things and so when you look at the people that are opposing Trump you know the women the the kids the intellectuals the the liberals progressives all those people they want a good future for our country you know the other ones they just want to keep everybody else out or perceived enemies its perceived enemies that anyone late anybody with a gun that's the whole thing you know if you have a gun not very intelligent was that because you're paranoid you win them if you have a gun you're not intelligent because you're paranoid having a gun means that you're afraid that someone's going to come and attack you mm-hmm you know right and and so that having a gun is like late they want to arm teachers for instance do not seem katana crazy yeah that is so stupid it is so dumb right you know it's just like the ones that knew no about guns like the cops that didn't go into the school the guy's got a a K yeah they're not gonna go into that school with their little pistols and so they didn't go into the school and the ones that rush to God they ended up dying so what I'm saying is that if you if you have a gun and you if you think you need a gun for your house for whatever if you think you have something that's worth someone else's life then you are ignorant well I don't necessarily think that's what they think they don't think that the gun is worth someone else's life they think they don't want to get their life taken by a home invasion yeah which does happen did you see that video of the guy that had a raccoon on his boat no he had a raccoon on his bow he was easy sir any any any no I was a wild raccoon and he filmed it and he's 20 miles out in the sea and he sees this raccoon and so he filmed himself kicking the raccoon off the boat into the ocean into the ocean oh he filmed it and they knew when he posted it because he had no idea how ignorant that was he had no idea was the raccoon dangerous was it trying to will fuck you up well fuck you sure sure but like the what would the wild the wild guys the wildlife guys said just get a blanket throw it over put him in the in the in the bathroom yeah until you close to shore I might kick him off yeah you know but this guy right away he freaked it out music this is my parrot off my boat terrible well see that's that's the form of ignorance that that I'm talking about it's also just fear it's furious that's what that's what fear is fear is ignorance right but if someone has a gun in their house to protect themselves from home invasions home invasions do happen and people have saved their family with guns that that's a real thing you don't read about that much oh you read about it plenty if you go looking for it really yeah there's some stories if you look at the the overall there's they have like a pie chart of gun violence in this country and an unfortunately large number is suicides when I started talking about how many people have died unfortunately large numbers suicide by gun and I feel like if people are gonna kill themselves with a gun they'd probably kill them so the pills or anything else or they had that as well right and then there's justifiable homicides by the police there's there's people that are protecting their house there's a bunch of different there's gang violence there's a bunch of different things to get lumped in when we talk about gun violence but a certain percentage of them are people that are protecting their house or their help their their family from someone who's trying to hurt them yeah I got it happening case I'm in business with it with an ex-pilot from Vietnam and I'm quite sure he has a sidearm in his his house mm-hmm but it would be useless because it's so locked away and so hidden by the time anything happened by the time he got to that gun and got it loaded and found a maintainer of the odds yeah maybe or maybe he could keep it right by his bed no in this in this one instance and then what what if it's your daughter something coming in and late at night and and you mistake her for her while you open your mouth and say something I suppose she into the dark or what if you have a homicidal tendencies and you've been one he sees one thing I learned about guns because I grew up with guns too i groomed in the in the country and we're up in Calgary Alberta Canada oh really oh that's right you're Canadian yeah great so guns guns were about moving back up there oh no I lived up there oh no oh no no la is where you want to be but I grew up with with what guns were yeah well you actually needed a gun well you know like especially when the when the Hawks are coming down to get your chickens or you know you know some stuff like that but I seen the gun culture in in in cow and it turned me off mm-hmm because I sing kids they would take a stray dog entirely him bring him up to the field time to a tree or something or post and then shoot him oh Jesus shoot him yeah that a sport you know and and they couldn't because here's the thing about guns oh I went duck huntin with my brother one time and in the field and I got bored waiting for the Ducks to come and so here comes what he call it's not your phone yeah okay so there's your wrist ringing he turned it off no we went duck honey and we're waiting there for hours where did the Ducks to come over and my brother he got bored and there's a muskrat swimming across the thing so he shot it with his shotgun and he walks out into the middle of the the Slough picks up the muskrat as the Ducks flew over top of us just stupidity man that's definitely stupid but there's responsible gun owners don't you think well see are like I was an army cadets and when we we had practice I'm a sharpshooter by the way yeah yeah I got some some what he called patches you know sharpshooter 300 yards so so I know how to handle a rifle anyway but when we go shooting we would have to first of all we never got the weapon and until we march down into firing position then we're handed the weapon and one bullet and then we put the bullet in hit the target and another bullet shoot the target you know when we were finished we had to pick up all our casings and give them back enough so anything was missing no one left until they found that missing bullet and that's gun safety yeah then the gun was taken from us and put it in an armory it's only used when you're going to use it you know just like walk around the skill saw you know you can have a license to carry a skills but you don't have a skill saw strapped to your side and you can take out and you know try your skill saw anytime you learn is that the open carry thing is very strange when they see people walking around with guns strapped to their hips in Arizona you're like okay they're targets why don't you do that you're in target anyway yeah it's like the bikers like bikers you know the Hells Angels and the Mongols and that they're the only crime in sin again I know that appetize on their back look at me yeah look at me I'm gonna suck I'm a you know I start I I do all sorts out beat up people I kill people here and I write on a big hog you know it's crazy but people do that for recognition yeah see that's like mass shooters that's what they do it for get their name in the paper yeah look what I did look at useless old me another side so you solution it what's the craziest thing about mass shooters is this not a thing I mean guns have been around for a long time but this is not a thing that's been around for a long time this is a fairly recent thing that keeps erupting over and over and over again I don't know you were too young to remember but when I was a kid the crime comics were banned you're banned they were banned because you were bad they showed violence displayed by comic books Wow and they were people up in arms about comic books and now you got video games are you gonna be a mass killer well how about movies you know I mean so many movies movies John wick movies is everybody's getting shot everybody yeah I love it one of my favorites - peppermint with peppermint what's up Jennifer Gardner oh she's a superhero Oh peppermint the the the name of the movie is peppermint here this Sammy yeah Malick must eight-months it's great but I watched it about three times now and in the lats yeah well have you watched it so many times I think Jennifer Gardner is kind of hot oh okay and and this year I see her to see her with the guns in her and the third time I realized a lot of it stunt stunt people how can you tell just I seen it so many times it wasn't okay so you're looking for everything for the little thing but again that's the kind of violence said that we we get known and people get a mutant yes especially especially people they get stupid you know like when I was a kid I I saw my brother died recently and there's a whole picture photo thing of him and I when we were kids and they used to get put under the Christmas tree six guns and we're when we're little guys we we were three or four years old I had six guns strapped to my myself you know because cowboy Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and that was a big deal you know you had your six gun shooters but you never shot anybody you just shot the gun under their hand yeah that was the old days you know right the good guys always shot people in the hand they shot the gun away from him different world ya know going from the old days to big bamboo to where we're at today where you're actually in the weed business now oh you know what Jon this choice which is crazy right it's like whoever arrested for just selling glass how many years ago is that 15:03 Oh through 16 years ago oh three so 16 years ago you're arrested for just selling glass 2019 yourself full-on weed really in four or five countries that's crazy Germany Spain you can you were so ahead of the curve yeah but you also you were one of the real oh geez that paid a price yeah yeah and you know now it's gotta be nice to see that your influence had something to do with all this I did it did it feels really well did all your movies me you guys made weed look fun yeah yeah it was fun yeah but everybody made it out like you know you go from if you think about propaganda positive and negative you go from reefer madness which is the most negative to the qin qiong movies yeah which is probably the most positive most buzz up until like baked that was the most positive that we'd stuff we ever saw right it was so super positive was all just silly they're fun crazy this is silly humor ghetto humor yeah you know a lot of ghetto humor and and and I wanted to be the rich guy you know the kid of the rich guy cuz that's what the 60s happened you know all the you know in order to get laid you had to be hippy and so all the rich kids growing their hair long and you know yeah you know living on the streets all that stuff yeah yeah you guys popular as vans too and we you know yeah you know we we used to say when we'd be on the radio I some of the radio shows and I and I was really popular on the right-wing radio shows because no I I would I'd inflame the whole class they'd get all pissed off at me as I would out people you know like like I have added Danny Sullivan you know the racecar driver uh-huh I saw yeah Danny smokes pot you know I people got mad at you for that they went nuts I think that's why I got busted real because I was in st. Louis on a radio show that Ashcroft listened to and I think ashcoff heard me and the hit went out people forgot how crazy that guy is yeah do you mean still alive that's a good question but do you remember when he was singing he had a song that he sang that he wrote about let the eagle soar this is where yes when he was Attorney General and it was so creepy and crazy that this person would say he had a whole album of gospel music like he was a psycho it was I would love to climb inside that guy's head and find out what kind of gears are spinning around in there I think I did I think I ended up in jail my rock yeah he had a whole song that he sang on television he said I think he's sang it was either in front of Congress or something along those lines were you know he was giving a speech somewhere and then along with the speech he wanted to sing this song let the eagle soar like she's never sword before it's so my here it seemed you fight it Jamie it's it's so bad they got ten seconds from my daily show moment of Zen that they did with it well this have it the video I know it's that video look shitty this is the clearest we got good fucker quick it's just ten seconds of it okay here's the here's the video look at this check this out look up they're from rocky coast stop that's all you need to say like stop you can nothing forever bro that's when you kind of say yeah maybe guns are okay yeah maybe everything's fine maybe missiles but seeing a guy like that thinking that that psychopath had any control whatsoever over any laws or anyone getting arrested that guy is fucking insane do you think I was wanting to cover the breasts yes yeah hey Dead which brought attention to him yeah no one noticed the tits before he put a veil over exactly then now they're looking at all you see his titties he was a spooky guy he was y'all well yeah I found that uh Bush administration had some spooky fucking people then they really did it's really interesting then history whitewash is these weird old guys yeah like Ronald Reagan after he died Ronald Reagan became like this painter insane of conservative thinking when I was in high school Ronald Reagan was president and everybody fucking hated that yeah they hated them yeah it was like he was a creep he thought about him like this guy's a fraud he's a phonies lying about selling arms to Iran the whole thing was it was so crazy to watch that guy become this loved figure I used to work out with his daughter patty really yeah and her and I were pretty good friends until when they came to the gym and I saw part of a movie called Caligula and she said oh how did you like it I said I was too faggy for me and apparently Ron her brother brother is very gay and she Lewin sheep all up at me how how can you say that how dare you I don't you know my brother and yeah so nothing to do with the movie I'm not into that that's okay I just don't like watching it it doesn't mean I don't want you to do it yeah Ronde was like super hardcore Democrat right his son it was that was an interesting little thing yeah that his son was gay well Ronnie was wasn't that right-wing and until until he found it better a path for him like Trump yeah he was Ronnie was a Democrat like Trump yeah yeah yeah he was what he was younger yeah see when they get older you know then that's that always happens I'll sell your paranoid paranoid just don't want to tighten up the borders and lock and load let the eagle she's never imagined like sitting down writing that out and then and then singing it with all that emotion and passion if that makes any fucking sense to anyone well obviously he know there is no stopping him you know he's a fucking moron and the songs about a bird that's a evil rep like a raptor like an eagle was a fucking monstrous animal will eat babies they'll eat anything they can get their hands on they swoop down snatch fish right out of fucking River their fuck I mean there are amazing creatures that don't hang giggles but the idea that that's America America is a fucking vicious flying dinosaur it's kind of hilarious it really is kind of hilarious if that's our animal funny no III pissed off a lot of people in you know yeah not meaning to I used to say you know we used to say when they would attack us you know what if we're right mmm what if everything we're doing is right and you're wrong and next thing you know it's true we were right yeah well you've been you were right the whole time yeah and you know I remember when I first started smoking weed I was well I had smoked it a couple of times up until I was thirty and then when I was thirty my friend Eddie Eddie Bravo got hi for the first time I remember I couldn't believe that this was what pot was I was like this is it I thought it made you stupid I can't stop thinking about things like yes some of the thoughts are little unorganized and kind of chaotic but it wasn't making me lazy it wasn't doing any of these things that people were claiming it did make me stupid it made me curious yeah maybe you want to watch science documentaries yeah and eat yeah no it just it is one of the biggest puzzles of modern times is that even in 2019 with all these states that have legalized it there's still a bunch of people that think that pot is bad for you and then it makes you lazy and I always say that pot is like any other tool it's like a hammer you could build a house with a hammer or you can just hit yourself in the dick if you're fucking crazy it's the same thing with pot that's executive use pot and it can enhance your life and it can enhance your relationship and the hand makes you friendlier more come more camaraderie more compassion or you can just get stoned all day and do nothing you got that goddamn phone ringing on your got it does that freak you out having nothing I had one of those on my wrist for a day I was like what am i doing I don't know I don't know how to work it so it's just decoration for me because he updates my everything okay okay if it wasn't for Paris I'd still be riding a bike yeah I don't I don't I had one of those that I was using for a while for like fitness tracking stuff then I got this whoop I got this other thing that's quite a bit more accurate and does more stuff you're 51 51 yeah good shape thank you I'm scared never let it go I work out all the time because I'm terrified of it falling apart well no you're hooked on the agenda you're hooked on endorphins fridge yeah but that too it's also for mental health reasons like for me I need to go sighs well like Arnold you know when I when I first came to LA I first thing I did was join Gold's Gym because I read about it you know - getting in Vancouver and then I met Arnold all all the guys and and there there was so healthy you know if he took a sip of 7up he had spit it out really yeah and he was super super healthy but he smoked a joint he was smoking Jordan that was another thing pumping iron that documentary pump parents saw him after he won yeah smoking a joint I made pot look better like wow this guy smoke pot right how the fuck does pot make you a loser if the biggest bodybuilder on the planet the most successful yes yeah yeah I ordered him one time like I owned everybody and and Arnold was walking was Stallone at the time and as that famous picture yeah they unload this numero uno they asked Arnold you know Tommy Chong said that he smoked pot with you and and Stallone jumped in right away oh no that's a lie that's a lie never smoked in arson no no yeah we did smoke but we knew how to enjoy ourselves mate yeah shoot alone trying to cover it up well the lowest alone those Rambo movies I got some good stories on Stallone but you know remember Jordan Belfort Jordan Belfort the wolf of Wall Street yes yeah I was in jail with him ah I helped him read his book really yeah in fact where all I did was insult him and made him racist because I was reading my book and he was started he said what are you doing I'm writing because we shared a cubicle and I said I'm writing my book he says I'm gonna write a book so he wrote a couple of pages and he handed it to me like a breed this you know and I read it and it was like a copy of Tom Wolfe you know bonfires and manatees and I said yeah been written shit and handed it back to him and it's what do you mean you haven't written nothing he's but what should I write he challenged me I just write what you know I said write those stories you've been telling me every night you know there's one rule that you got to remember when you're writing or doing anything it's called the most of so you don't get you don't just get high you get higher than anybody's ever gotten in their life if you better put it on screen you know you don't just have a fight you have a fight that goes on forever you know that's that's the kind of stuff you need that people are interested and so he said you didn't talk to me for a boat but a month after that he was mad at you yeah he was just right now show this guy you know and he wrote the wolf of Wall Street real and then he give it to you in New York are you got something here no no no no no the last time the next time I saw him he pulled in front of my house with his car we were we were both on probation so we couldn't talk to each other and so he yelled from his car he goes hey I sold them sold the book to Martin Scorsese we were so you're allowed to talk to each other by yelling yeah but you couldn't be close yeah you couldn't be how close did you have to how far away do you have to stay Wow you know technically you're not supposed to talk to each other you know but but yelling there no one's gonna say anything about that's hilarious yeah no no use that you violate your probation they put your backing right because you're associating with felons that's right right that's that's so crazy that someone who you're trying to rehabilitate with yeah you can't talk to them because they all so fucked up there is a Nixon speechwriter that was in with me and he was so innocent and they wondered what the government was trying to get stuff on Imelda Marcos you know the Philippines and and this lawyer that I was in there was a speechwriter a Reagan speechwriter and and he wouldn't give up Marcos or Imelda and so they put him in jail for a year and when he got out on probation being a straight guy he was he went home and took a valium to help him sleep and he got drug test at the next day he went back in jail he say you got to be very careful when you're dealing with probation people because they got you by the balls man that's such it's gotta be a weird thing dealing with the probation officers because they have that power over you oh yeah do they fuck with you not me I was too much of a celebrity and I had a lot of nice ladies and so I've served with them you know girlfriends yeah served with everything as I'm sure like all things right there's good people doing in bad oh yeah yes it's a job yeah it's a job it's a paycheck you know the sad thing about when I was in jail and Taft it was said it's built over a toxic waste dump worthy StuH that's where they found oil in Taft in California and when they found oil back in the day they never had a way to contain it they would just dig it and hit it and they would just spill all over the the ground and so they would dig big trenches of like big pools and they would fill up with oil and then they would get the barrels and dip the barrels in and that saw they filled up the oil barrels and and so after they figure out how to do it right the ground is all toxic and so they built a federal prison overtop of it Wow and so everybody that's worked there and a lot of people that did time they're all gotten cancer and died so you think that's probably the root of your cancer could be could be could be he's sure yeah easy yeah because that's where I got it and they say that marijuana does something to cancer right inhibits cancer in certain ways I don't know technically what it does I think what it does more than anything it calms a brain mmm see you know anytime you calm the brain you lose the fear mm-hmm so you know the fear is that fight-or-flight you know that's your response your body goes into this fight-or-flight mode and when you calm that down your body just goes into relaxation mode and when you're in the fight-or-flight mode the other parts of your body can't handle your immune system but when you're in a total relaxed mode that's why when an animal gets hurt they usually just crawl off in a corner somewhere and just lay there and lick their wounds and and and they just calm everything down and then they let the body take over to heal and I think what happens with pot is it it mellows the brain to the point where you and so what you know and you you allow your body to take over but you still need that other treatments yes need the chemo and radiation you need all that stuff you know are you taking CBD oil no yeah yeah yeah how much you take I'm not sure I'm not good at that amounts you take it I take it I have a right now I'm on testosterone and in CBD yeah and then just flour you know he smoked up a couple of joints well we've got a we got a gift bag for you yes thank you yeah thank you thank you so he's gonna have it I got something for be real it scared the shit out of me I did be real smoke box oh yeah be real from Cyprus yeah I know be fuck that's probably high as ever been in my life really those guys go hard oh yeah I couldn't keep up with him no no I don't even try I'm a lightweight when I spoke with Arnold there's all the Dave Draper all these muscle heads would come around you know they got a big bomb and the thing was it put like like a an ounce in the bowl and then they'd fired up and then they'd suck on it so hard whoever exploded the the ball into the into the water made it explode then you were the hero it's a although all the muscle dad's there they're taking their hip Arnold takes a bigot you know the thing he explodes then they hand it to be able to like wasn't Chung and I with the Chong at the time so they just looked at me like yeah okay go silver there's back then you were just a guy yeah I was just burning it almost faceless what was it like being famous for being a pothead back in the 70s cuz that had to be weird as you were you were you and Cheech were famous pot heads yeah we're I don't think there was anybody else like who else was a famous pot head no level no no one maybe no one ever was named the actor okay I can think of his name he did time he did a year in jail in County for one joint Robert Mitchum oh yeah Albert Mitchum but he was like a straight-laced guy yeah the image big cowboy yeah he's a tough guy that was the image well you know what the big the big draw for pot was the sex see it was it was before when you call the Soper's or snow quaaludes you know the Kweli the quaalude was big sex things that was people would have sex on quaaludes oh yeah why yeah I've never taken a quick look what does it do for you oh just it they're called spreaders when a girl gets high on a quaalude like take me yeah do you think that's why Bill Cosby was a little girls of told me totally so that was the thing that just relaxes you into something makes you horny really oh yeah and that's what pot does for me now but no but it does for people for women yeah and love to sleep with that and they'd love to have sex yeah you know after smoking joint what was Annie Hall was in Annie Hall would woody was I and he got a little pissed off do you have to get high every time you make love with me yeah I think was an taeho and I think I think everybody in the picture in the movie company and the movie house said yeah I can dig it yeah it definitely changes the way things feel ya realizes yeah axis you hear music Ben so you're few things better you know everything feels nicer I like to do yoga on it I like to smoke weed right before I go to yoga class yeah it's amazing you feel all the muscles follow those tiny ones and all the ones connected to good spots and you don't smoke a lot or do you a couple of talks earlier before yoga class I don't like it too high I'll just be inside my head yeah I just wanted like two hits just hit just going high I'm high but I'm not blasted yeah that's me too you know I got I've been giving all sorts of toys you know because I got the Chinese choice we in the stores in the and so the I'm getting tons of pipes all the time and not make pipes to the in fact that's the not a pipe this is another pic he gave me one of those I last time was like six it whatever it was six years ago last time you were on the show yeah he gave me the not a pipe oh good I got it at home but I you know so so now they got they got a new one can't think of it I got it for you here and you oh great thank you it's called the easy piping okay easy pipe it's so cool because you open the thing and it's got a lighter and built in and there's just enough the bowl holds enough for a little nug but does nug in there and you can carry it in your pocket because as a lid and then when you don't want to hit it you just hit the lighter and you got a hit oh I've seen one of those before and that's like a little metal lid yeah slides over to your side yeah those are pretty cool oh yeah they're very nice yeah nice little contraption all contained well the old one hitters used to be Chung's choice right there Kapow yeah that's it oh that's the that's different thing that's something the genius pipe ah his bar oh that's incredible incredible what does that do well it cools the smoke hmm see from the balls to the to the mouthpiece the mouthpiece the whole thing is is dimpled inside and so the smoke goes through all this the dimples and then cools that articles it off you sort of like ice water and a bomb yeah yeah better better better oh it's it's so smooth yeah I'll cough you're just thinking about it but you do the genius pipe and it's just so cool do you get all these kids are dabbing and using wax and I watch if you ever go to Cypress Hills Instagram page I get fucking I get anxiety just watching their videos like how are you getting because they play I want to I and you watching the video and you're like oh my god I can't do this I can't even watch this though scooping that yellow wax in there they go so deep these kids today rather fucking mind are heating up glass and dropping the THC into the glass like ah how was that one one dispensary and the guy was so proud he handed me a big jar of shatter you know the dab stuff and I pretended like oh it's a gift all things in a box and I walked away the guys did it trucked yeah it's probably a lot of money faster it was like a year's worth of dad oh my god and I kept it long enough to make him nervous and then you know with in Canada we had to deal with hash a lot and it's okay but it's a little bit too harsh mmm hash is harsh yeah for the high is interesting though yeah yeah it's it's intense hi you know what do you how do you feel about edibles I love them just sleep on mm-hmm I love chocolate I got you is what my wife and I both use oh yeah we'll wake up in the middle of the night instead of you know fussing and fighting or you know thinking about it we just go and get a little little chocolate thing it's delicious chocolate - it's a defense eat chocolate and it's it's the best thing and you just sleep not only I slept last night but I had a couple of them epiphanies yeah that just blew my mind like what how art is going to save the world and art does can save the world yeah how's that well you look at history like the pyramids that was art no it's an art piece and what happens when you when you have big huge art pieces like that you create employment and it's not war so you're not fighting you're creating and so the people that that care for the animals the people that have to feed the the mass of people that have to work on getting those rocks Garvin those rocks everything else it creates employment and and it also creates tourism and so you when you have a piece of art everybody wants to come and look at it and so that's what we need in the world today you see and we not only need art but we need functional art because that's what the pyramids were they were functional and a lot of people think it was the the astronauts you know in aliens the aliens in which which could very well be yeah think so oh sure for sure for sure why do you think them well because there's nothing new in the universe you know we've had space flights we've had all that stuff forever but you have Chung's choice cooler pipe yeah that genius pipe doesn't new in the universe that's that's no it's it's probably rehashed know somewhere in the world we have someone you know so in the universe oh you talk about if you want to talk about part two Chinese Indian or all religion what makes you think that aliens built the pyramids oh well I'm saying they could have been really I I think aliens are just humans you know that because if they're wearing spacesuits if they're aliens why did they need a spacesuit unless he did come from another atmosphere I personally believe that earth is the only planet in this universe and the reason I believe that is that there are countless universes like space is endless hmm and so space is in this why wouldn't we have our own universe okay so you think that earth is the only planet in this universe yes but what about Mars well it's a dead planet okay so earth is the only live planning the undermount with life in this whole universe yeah so you think that there's multiple universes or infinite numbers of universe yes in each universe probably has unearthed or two or two but you think this whole universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies yes with hundreds of billions of solar systems could be there's only one planet could be because we have the space so the only you mean by one planet one planet with life yes but what elegantly but why wouldn't you think that there's if because it's so big why wouldn't you think there could possibly be other life other places why couldn't it be the other way why couldn't we be the only ones what could be that's what I'm saying we turn it's only could be so so there's no reason for me see see that's why I have people trouble with people that are afraid of a you know artificial intelligence yeah I think so silly because well because they're smart they're smart enough to know that they're not going to inflate anybody or torture anybody or take over anything the only dummies do that stuff yeah because when you capture something you know what you capture well their problems whatever their problems unless you extinguish them yeah for what reason well the people are just destroying the earth they're polluting the rivers they're sucking all the fish out of the sea it's not this guy's filled with carbon the artificial life's gonna be like you know what their real problems he's got damn people their dirty little litters they're choking squirrels z that's the paranoid look at it look at the positive again what's the positive well first of all you have to remember we live in a physical universe okay for every action there's a reaction so for every good there's a bad nothing explains chunk more than for every Obama there's a trump okay so there's no limit to how ignorant you can be and there's no limit to how smart you can be there's no limit and so when you go up the scale to the intelligence scale then then you realize that there is no reason for it to be paranoid about anything because if you it's all written out and know all the holy books I've written it out you know especially the Bible see the Bible has been misconstrued by so many people because what they do they take it to what's going to suit their purposes and then but but to really interpret the Bible it's written in code it's written it's a secret code yeah it's metaphysical terms it's not physical terms physical terms what do you know about the bottom one cold look with there's a writer called Emmett Fox should get into him yeah he deciphers the whole bible does he decipher the ancient hebrew version of the Bible or the Greek version the Bible Latin all the versions right but I mean it all comes from ancient Hebrew and when you translate things from ancient Hebrew yes you know ancient Hebrew the letters also double his numbers sure yeah and and see see what the people I read there's another mystic that I read a long stick wise mystic you know you know he's not he his name is Joel s goldsmith yeah I discovered him a long time ago but I discovered him in jail it's a very popular book in jail and goldsmith look him up he's all on the computers and everything let's check him out you're really really enjoying it give me a new perspective because what he maintains it's all Britain and like I say in the Bible eternity say there's no beginning and no end that explains everything to me because if there's no beginning and to no end what can well it can happen will happen you know mm-hmm and because this is again this is my theory it's in the physical world we have to learn everything that's why everything's physical like the first thing when you're born you have to learn how to breathe you have to learn how to walk you have to learn how to eat these are all skills that you have to literally learn well in mothers and everything teach you that and then when you reach a certain age you leave the planet you know at least your soul your spirit the body the body stays but it's just a vehicle and so because of eternity this goes on and on and on and on forever it never stops what we do as humans we're learning we're creatures of weird all students whether we want to be or not you know I was trying to explain this to my one son because my youngest son is a bit he's a musician you know and and I and I try to understand that he's a musician and you know musicians are that you know they're not entrepreneurial as some people would like him to be but anyway everybody's here to learn a certain task and some of us are blessed and to the point like me I'm blessed and very blessed because I've been given the ability to do what I do and to see what I see and say what I say you know it doesn't come from me it comes from you know the the source what I call the source and and that's why I could turn prison into a religious retreat because it's like a monk going you know into hiatus for for nine months you just had a thought in your head that you're gonna treat it like a religious retreat yeah and you'd learn about yourself and educate yourself read all the books take advantage of your solitude because that's very important when you get a chance to be alone and that's a very important time because that's when you connect with the the spiritual ear spiritual teacher how must it must have felt so good to be released though in a way there was a lot of sadness really yeah yeah I never looked as good as when I got released man but one of the because one of the inmates there it was a barber he spent two hours cutting my hair perfect the Chicano you know it just perfect I came out my wife Michelle we looked at me whoa that's the best haircut you've ever had was perfect we exercised it in jail oh that's how you do you walk at night there's a track and you can walk miles no I'm wrong the trying the whole prisons out there walking around walking around that's when you're socialized you talk and everything two people in that and they all group together and I learned games I learned how to play bocce ball learn i played pool and I sang I had a little area where I had my own private studio it was a entrance to the pool hall and I'd sit in there the echo was perfect you guys had a pool hall oh yeah we had tennis courts pool halls a great time it was other than not being able to leave and even then if you wanted to leave why would you want to leave I mean it was perfectly seasoned that's why people go back to jail I get released early I saw one guy who it was sad he was crying that he's sitting there crying anyway I said what's wrong he's he gets released next month and he was a junkie and he knew that as soon as he hit the street he was going to die he was going to die you know and he did he soon as he hit the street he died but he lost he was funny he was but they had a little game that when they opened the dormitory the first few people to hit the mess hall got the order eggs any way they wanted like over easy or sunny side-up whatever and so he'd be he'd get all anxious you'd be the first guy in line and he'd be kind of getting be getting ready to so the doors open man he'd do it and you couldn't run you had to walk and so he learned that this mark last it worked real fast and and he was he was a delight but when he got released he took his own life Sam yeah yeah I hung his own life with heroin or probably yeah that's probably it was it was sad just couldn't help himself once you know well see you know everybody's worried about socialism well America is a bigger socialist country in the world yeah we've got more people in jail than anywhere else in the world and what's it what do you the would it what happens in jail cradle to grave you're fed you're clothed you're told what the where you're told what the way what the - you're allowed to study certain things you're totally controlled medical you got free medical there are prisoners that would go to jail so they get their open hearts surgery because the federal law and mandate said if you have something wrong with you they have to fix it and so there were prisoners that would break the law so they can get in to get their open-heart surgery Wow yeah that's crazy they that's some next-level thinking I'm gonna go to jail so I can get open-heart surgery yeah yeah what did what did they prevent you from reading any books was there anything that was like on did you order whatever you wanted they they had a it was weird they had a thing about they would take covers off magazines and and you know the my subscription cards they would take that out because people on the outside would Dolson with the acid LSD and shipped the books in there and then next thing you know half a dorm would be tripping on acid they're eating pieces of paper and that that kind of stuff always went on but as far as now you could read whatever you wanted basically you know III read a lot of books at it you know I was minion to read you know and I helped a lot of people I would do the eating you know the HHR yeah I would do the eating you know how to do that on the Indian grounds oh yeah yeah it's real easy yeah throw the coins it's really heads tails you know well though it's supposedly it's some sort of like future reading yeah thing do you think it works oh yeah what does it tie yeah well first time I did it yeah I rolled it i did my explain to people how it works well what it is you get three coins and and you throw the three coins and you get numbers from six to nine and anything in between six seven six eight nine I think that's something like that anyway each number tells you what line you're going to read and you saw it three times and you're right down and then you get a sort of like a plan of what page you're supposed to look at and then when you get the page then it tells you you know but but you're asking it because you got to ask the eaching for what proved something you know and it'll answer it it'll answer you it's for instance I threw mine when I did it I threw it and the first line said you are in jail for a reason whoa how does it say that it just said it and it says it how is it what do you translate it you read it it's been written in that book for centuries that line has was in the in that book for centuries really 3,000 years something like that and so I read it because still they still talk about chariots and kings and wanes everything and that was the first scientific reason gels are corrective institutions that will correct your behavior that's how they eat chains telling you that's what the eating well what they did they updated the girls that wrote it they updated it to the modern time mm-hmm you know it's I think it's Armstrong is the girls that there are a couple of girls that wrote it's a big thick book but it hits hid and then went on there and another guy Mike this this Chicano he saw me so he thought it was a game so he's all set for the game what would you play in I said no I'm doing the eating I said you want me to do you and he said yeah so I did his and it's very polite not to read the readings of the other guy and let him read it first and so I I did the numbers and and and I give it to him and he read it and he just handed me the book and you went sat on his bunk and he just stared and so then I I read what I was what it said and he a month before he lost his wife in child in a car accident they were coming out to visit him and the eaching said you were suffering a great misfortune oh it was like dead-on Wow and the itching goes on italia you know what to do and you know this is next month's it's gonna be tough this one's going to be good you know and we see hope for you it's like astrology it's almost the same but I know my Terence Mckenna was really into it he's really into the eating and he thought it was some sort of a map of time he was trying to figure out what it was and how it worked and why I can predict things and if you mess with it it'll it'll tell you fuck with it like it's the G board you know sometimes if you do the Ouija board it's same thing and if you start making it a game you know let's ask it this us ask it that who's gonna win the race tomorrow on that and and right away the chain catches that and knows your real feelings and it tells you you know tell you don't don't do what do you think it is it's a Chinese I think she I think what it is it's a spiritual way of communicating us remembering ghosts were Patrick Swayze had to learn how to move a coin mm-hmm remember that you know the spirits especially spiritual people and they're around us and so you give them a chance to communicate with you because they know all they will communicate and so the e Ching gives the spirits a chance to communicate so when you throw a coin they know what what what heads or tails or whatever it is numbers that you need read to talk to you right and that's that's my theory hmm gotta try it yeah I'm curious because I do know that many people have used it to try to figure out what their life is about what they're doing with their life and the weirdest thing about it is they they seem to find some real answers in it and they keep them to them talk yeah but that the idea that I had heard that made the most sense was that the way the world were is not as simple and as easy as one plus one equals two left right left right walk down the road but that there's intention and thought that also helps formulate our universe what the eaching does is it somehow clarifies intention and thought and it clarifies like the the actually your actual the actual process is going on in your mind and it quantifies it and puts it into like a way that you can read your effect on life and life's effect on you in this and then it reads it somehow or another even though it doesn't make any sense well it meant to the nation's yeah of discovering yep what's happening yeah it's a method of communicating with the spirit world you think that's what it is oh yeah and and the thing is getting back to the AI the artificial intelligence that we already use artificial intelligence in our lives every day like Alexa she's a good exam that bitch yeah I love her she never steered me wrong yeah you know she's told me I've asked the wrong questions right but I see this is my theory is that that we are we everybody in the universe wants us and the spirits they want us to be enlightened you know because the more enlightened we are the more we can enjoy but we what we've inherited because when you're born into this world you you've inherited you're taking it for granted a kingdom amazing yeah you've inherited it especially in comparison to the rest of time all the human history this is the greatest time the greatest most it's fortunate see look at look at look oh we got now going for us no and how much effort did that take you know it was like being part of a team and and so when you're ready above me you're you're pushed out in front you're up there and so you know our our duty as as students is to learn everything we can learn and to teach whatever we can teach you know and that's why there should be no paranoia because we're not here long enough so that being rich or being poor it makes any kind of a difference you know because you know yourself I mean what do you really need in this life right you know what do you really need water food companionship love yeah France yeah yeah and something interesting that you like to do yeah because I said I've been hanging with billionaires now and what he'd have been doing with them you're just saying you know you know they they like hit me because I I get recognized everywhere I go so so it sort of it's like you know walking real status symbol famous guy you can get into restaurants and for the most part they're they're hard-working very you know like a lot of burdens being rich a lot of burdens and and you know just with me you know it's like instead of owning a boat I'd rather know a guy that owns a boat definitely don't have to deal with that's true I'd like to be free I like to be totally free yeah yeah that's the reality of I mean if you want to have a big giant crazy business you're gonna have a lot of employees gonna have a lot of problems you have to deal with and you're the last guy to get paid yeah yeah and you're the last guy that goes home yeah everybody else forgets what they're doing as soon as they walk out that door and you're all those problems are in your butt yeah yeah I I went through that I had two nightclubs at one time but I never bothered with the money part at all I just I just worried about the stage and the mic was working and there was us in Vancouver when how long it was us this was sixties in this yeah you had night clubs like comedy clubs or like well one one was an after-hours sort of like a jazz dance bottle club mm-hmm and it was given to me see there again you know hey hey Tommy you want a club and I said sure the guy buddy give you a club yeah well he bought a building mm-hmm and back and then back in the day you know there was a steak house in the basement he says where the cheers pay rent when when you can what so I went in what was this guy's deal he owned buildings most people that own buildings don't be giving them away oh yeah what'd they do rent-free rent yes all the time you can get a year's free rent just cuz they want to get someone in the only one that you get it you get it going see soon as we start being successful we're paying I said $500 a month rent so he got you going so we made a ton of money in there and that's where I got the band's you know that's where I honed my skills as a musician and singer and and all that and then I got offered another club because it was going under and it was a dine and dance club in Chinatown and I thought yeah I make a great strip club and so so we took it over the Shanghai junk turned it into a strip club Vancouver's first strip club and then you were the proprietor of Vancouver's first ever saw strip club first one and in fact we did a in fact we did a Midnight Mass at a church I think we had this stripper dancing at the church but not stripping she kept my clothes on no Qi Dan so that's appropriate yeah yeah yeah there's a legend when did you start getting in the live shows well when I got fired from Motown because I had to get a green card and not nobody at Motown knew what a green card was and so I had to miss a gig to get my green card I got the green card and I came back and I got fired and so then Berry Gordy found out about he saw you're not fired and I said that I think I'll stay fired going to be a berry gordy I don't know work for what and so then I came out to out to LA and tried to live on the beach and be a songwriter but then my clubs were calling me because they needed help so I went back and I turned the strip club into an improvisational Club so we're doing naked improv it was great all the girls there were actors they're strippers and then once I turned him into actresses they were a lot cheaper and they're a lot more beautiful lady to talk they did skits and then they would take off their clothes when they had to but within within you know the script and that's where I met Cheech because we had a straight guy and a straight guy's wife found out what he was doing and hauled him away and then chase came on board as a straight guy and then when Vancouver yeah Vancouver yeah but teaches an LA guy right yeah he was up there in case the Vietcong attacked from Alaska so he was hiding from the draft well not really he will not really he was trying to stay out of the way let's put it down move and then then he he had a sneak back in there away from killing yeah but it was easy coming in into LA from Canada he just showed someone else's ID and they said back in the day yeah world was slot slippery yeah and that's so that's what I'm saying I I'm so blessed you know because everything the universe and it was from the each change started one of the guitar players turned me on to the II Ching back then and and my reading was perfection you're going to be everything's perfect you're gonna really do well and then Jason Chong and all that stuff happened here we are and you guys are torn again yeah all right how long you been torn again when'd you

wore different clothes Wow now when you went from this to comedy yeah like how did you make that leap well nobody really knew that I could talk you know I was in a black band so everybody else you know I was a guitar player so you know I had nothing to say other than I owned the club and no one knew that no heard that I was always a backup guitar player when I got into comedy Wallace was doing what happened I had hired when I turned the strip club into a improv of improvisation Club I hired the act we already had which was a black tap dancer named taps Harris and Jeannie a black singer and they had a band and so I the first get I had tap the first get was about a pajama party that all the strippers were having at their house after and that's how they always change into their pajamas and in their little nighties and that was very sexy and then tap schemes comes by after the show you know so called and and they say a taps do that number that you did on the show and so taps first time he ever tap danced you know in front a live audience because usually was just an MC so he did his tap-dance and then and it was so good that everybody wanted to honk our that's so they made him do an encore he quit that night it really it's too hard work he was hired to just Danny and here goes low low and so at the doorman it was an English guy named Dave and so I said Dave I need an emcee you know he says well I'll do it if you do it and so I okay and so we became Dave was my first partner and so we started we had long hair we're like hippies and so we we did a lot of hippies and DNA jokes you know tits and ass domes and and then then and we had a guitar player named gate alarm he wrote the big hit you know during my eye he wrote the music and so gay was this incredible guitarist and he could do all sort of but he was a very funny funny funny guy and so we wrote a skit you know where we did would torture the audience they're all biker mostly bikers didn't come to a strip bar you know you didn't bikers do that and so the first act we had it month because when we turned it into a theater company but we attracted all the theater people all the performers you know there was a stage or boy who worked there and so we had a mime artist and so we opened the show with a mime artist and gay playing classical guitar he's playing this class of guitar now this is a strip joint and all the hardened bikers are sitting around waiting for naked girls to come home and here comes a here comes a mime artist you know so Brittany's he's picking flowers and smelling them and throwing the pants around the stage and and so the biker sat through that you know they were yelling things like hey Elvis their remarks weren't that funny and then and then Dave would come out and Dave's a very funny looking guy it looks like looks like an improv actor and he come out and he and he sings this horrible song I Dream of Jeannie with the light brown Jeannie is my favorite wired hair terrier and then just when the bikers are getting ready to revolt I opened I kicked the door open we had doors on the back you know and I kicked the door open and I'm shirtless my hair is messed up and I got a rolled-up newspaper and I walk over to Dave I go what kind of fucking song is that I beat him to death with this newspaper and the bikers just they explode the whole joint just exploded you know it laughter because we had we've created that tension hmm that long and then relieved the release was like it's a roar and then the word went out boom and that place was packed almost every night wow what a weird world that must have been back then look at this the city works yeah there we are there's this that Terkel sexy at the Shanghai which others teach in the superb right wow that's Cheech that's crazy that's cheap that's Dave and that's me Wow without uh without a goatee and that's my Martha says Ian the mime artist and it's windy Maureen and Shirley Wow what a weird world is it crazy looking at that oh yeah memories huh starting Tuesday yeah yeah Wow the police were there and when did you start doing albums with Cheech which is 71 I had that all hot to take place while we came down lay in 70 and we struggled when all the places we didn't we could work then we started being a regular at the troubadour they had hootenanny night Sunday night was I mean what's hootenanny is when folk singers would get on some tension singers sing a song hootenanny hootenanny hootenanny night and so all the singers would saying you know and so we would get up and do comedy and of course we became regulars you know in fact the troubadour would phoned us up and saying are you guys coming yeah because they had a lot of requests and how did it turn to this weed based comedy well it was the only thing that worked in this audience the weed see when we're the city works is all TNA you know right but when we got down here we had a go right for the stoners because that was what was going on you know and so we played a club in Reseda burn the hotel and what sort of scald and it was owned by a crazy a big fan he saw us work somewhere and so he hired us for two nights and the first night first night we had to do two shows but it was a dance club and so the dancers had to stop dance and sit down watch us to a show and and that was not a good combination so the first show of didn't go very well because we're doing TNA stuff and just didn't go over and so the second show teach and I got together I teach come on man you're from here there must be a character you could do and the night before that we were standing outside and this low rider pulls up and you go hey man you tell me how to get to Reseda Boulevard and she says oh you're on it oh thanks man and it was that character and cheap says yeah well yeah we can do that character and then I showed him that the car bit this an old black comedian showed me mr. pineapple you show me this old taking a girl out on a date and you just make the car up here by pretending to wash it waxed you know just do the mine and the car would appear and then Cheech got in this car and he's and then he was a red freak when a right man and then I would come out and we do our skits and and went over really well as soon as we started doing you know we then in pills and stuff that everybody related so you feel like you had that and then you just ran with it oh yeah yeah didn't we just improved improved improved proved and so when we met Lou Adler saws and we never thought about doing a record until we went to Mena in his office and he's got gold records over here all over the place and we said yeah we can do a record you know I was a big Lenny Bruce fan anyway because when I got high the first time I the guy gave me a joint and a mini Bruce record it's good so nice so I studied that record for months and so that was ingrained in my head and so then when we started doing the first bit we did was an accident Cheech got locked outside the the mixdown room that we were in La Brea you know Charlie Chapman studio and it was a little courtyard then where the Sun was beating down was like noon and it was hot and sheets as a method actor and you had a put on all the costumes you know they can get into character so he's got all these costumes on he knocks on the door and I was working the tape recorder and I and when he knocked that I looked up at the door and I didn't see if the needle moved or not and so when he not I didn't answer and then he knocked again and I saw the needle moved and so I said who isn't and I was supposed to just open the door and let him in and so there was a pause it's a meme there it's mean that mean come on man so then does that work Dave's not here came from that so I waited knocked again you know long pause the pause oh is it and he's getting there come on man it's me I think the cops saw I hope no you know they went into character then then I'll just wait wait wait ace waiting for me to open the door then he'd knocked again and then finally goes it's me gay man Dave that's a David Nicholas yeah go deeps not here he blew it kicking the doors screaming open the door you almost punched me and but I said listen listen listen we we played it back in and then Lou heard it we recorded it not as funny but we recorded it in next day it was all over America Cheech and Chong was born Wow and then how long after that destructed in movies seven years 78 we started doing the movies because I got tired to go to Australia did you guys get accused of promoting pot oh yeah like did you get like accused like you guys are a bad influence on the youth and what was that like it was nothing really there's more publicity basically you know you know it's just people you know you know what really got what really I noticed anyway it was the the comedy establishment the committee and the second city all those guys they hated us really hated us why except Bellucci Belushi was the only one that loved us because Belushi was young enough that he heard our records and it influenced him but these other guys like what's his name can't even think of his name now maybe it's better I don't even name them but the the howard hesseman he he was one of the committee members you know you know WKRP in Cincinnati sure he was a big in and I got influenced by him big-time because I saw him doing the committee in in San Francisco and they had a top-notch improv group there and they were incredible and that's where I got the inspiration to go up and turn the strip club into a improvisational Club because I love improv but why didn't those guys like you well because we were successful we took what they were doing and took it out of that that snotty theater theater you know and so I'm so evolved theatrically you know that who does records you know that kind of thing and next thing you know cheese curds were bad I thought well they ended up trying to do a record but they had they had no clue you know like see I'm a fighter man I've been in the trenches forever you know I've been playing black clubs as long as I can remember and so I seen a lot of humor a lot of stand-up comics you know Redd Foxx was a real good friend of mine did you ever do his comic Club his yeah you ever hear those Richard Pryor tapes from the Redd Foxx comedy club they would record him like doing his work outs outs fucking amazing stuff amazing oh yeah Richard rich was a big friend big fan yeah now see we had fans like that when Cheech and I did the Comedy Store after up in smoke we broke up with Lou we're broke we had a hit movie no money nothing what happened they stole your money with Lou yeah who's Lou Lou Adler okay he used to producer and director of up in smoke and although I wrote wrote it and directed most of it especially the ending I'd write it like again like again like I said before I'm not into her into the money part of it but how are you guys broke while we weren't getting any money from our life because we had to stop touring because of the movie and so we had no touring money coming in right and so and then we got paid you know a little bit of on the movie but nothing compared to what we were making on the road and it was a hugely successful movie right totally totally but that's way it is giant just to just they took all the money yeah I mean we got we get dribs and drabs and at the end of the accounting yeah the Hollywood accounting yeah at the end of the period of you know when you forget when you've gone on to something else and you get a check oh that's nice yeah but so Cheech and I went to the comedy store to get our act again and Richard Pryor helped us at the stage we had but five sold-out shows Pauly Shore was a little guy up in the light boots and watching us because he was too young to be in the in the crowd and as we walked up the stage the first night Richard Serra he held out his hand it was the greatest compliment ever Wow I must've been incredible it was no listen man you had an amazing life you really have it's uh the each Inge was correct oh yeah it's worked out incredible I gotta find a
