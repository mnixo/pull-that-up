mayhem that's a that's a mayhem quote right there so ladies and gentlemen a fucking Trainor yesterday got killed by a worker you hear about that shit out you didn't hear about that killer whale killed a trainer at SeaWorld and what's amazing to me is how they haven't been killing people up to this point could you imagine if whales killer whales are supposed to be super intelligent I mean they're like it's intelligent as humans they're cousins of dolphins and and then we put him in a fucking fish tank and make him do tricks for mackerels you know could you imagine what kind of hell that life is and this whale had killed a homeless man that snuck into the fucking tank in 1991 and he had also or it might be a she I'm not sure he or she had also I think it's a it also almost drowned a trainer would remember that video with the the killer whale was playing with the person dunking him under a they wouldn't it's a damn whale Wow same way yeah so I mean it's not like the warning fucking signs weren't there it's like you know you know you hear Mike Tyson punch somebody and you can be shocked well let's welcome a dancer like how do you died oh it's a woman that died he he grabbed her by the waist and just fucking ripped her up in the middle of a live show up beginning alive what's the youtube videos is it out that's good question I bet they confiscated everybody's cameras anxious as they were leaving yeah but you know the SD cards are so small you think you'd learn to shove it up your ass or something this guy if he was there for sure there would be a video of it one fucking thousand percent yes yes I heard we need everybody's cameras SD card up as save to you would have been uploaded to YouTube already had Bluetooth to Ustream yeah there's no fucking way I mean the could you imagine what that ones must have looked like you're there and all said the killer he grabbed her about the waist and just started sheep mashing her back and forth just ragdoll here he just had enough he just said that's it that's it motherfuckers you know it's really incredible that we think it's cool do that and then we go and watch them you know it's really like zoos bummed me the fuck out we went to a zoo in Australia while we were there and there was a cool part of it was the crocodile cage because I don't think that crocodile gives a fuck where it is I think crocodiles are so dumb I mean they seem their mind seems so dead they just lay there with their eyes closed underwater for like hours at a time where they don't have to breathe it on Capri for like an hour so they just lay underwater and just do nothing and just sit there they don't run around and play like when you pass like the monkey cage of the zoo that shit's depressing because they don't want to be there when I was in Denver there's a zoo in Denver and the monkey got in his fucking cage and was howling this horrible howl and it wasn't a big cage this monkey was screaming out like a tortured soul it was like a man in prison you know let me out of here the monkey was just ah - screaming at the top of his lungs and I was like yo this is not good like this is not cool to do them for what so people can stare at him I mean that shit might have flown in the 1930s you know back when there was no zoos or back when there's no videos but we have videos now man you don't have to put them in a zoo you know but but that's the only time we would ever be able to see most of those animals that's the only thing that makes me go well I see that reason for a zoo because I'm not going to Africa and hunting down a white tiger you know right but is it worth it for them to struggle just so you could stare at them yeah you don't know that it could also be like dude wait I don't have to hunt my food there's just a steak here every morning when I wake up I could sleep No no for like tigers that shit is orgasmic to chase down an animal chase it move it you ever see a cat like if you roll a ball off string in front of them they can't help themselves man you should know that you have cats right cats can't help it they live for a chasing shit it's just like like you know a guy with a hard dick lives to fuck right now that's really the same thing man they're its nature rewards them for being a good predator and I think you know the way same way food tastes good for us that sex feels good for us they love to kill man nature rewards them with some crazy rush of energy and endorphins when they kill something you know so you give them a cold plate of meat just push an aluminum tray under the fuckin cage that's not the same that's not fun guaranteed you know but that doesn't that the killing thing bothers me but what really bothers me is the fucking amount of room that they have to move around the kangaroo KL a zoo definite the kangaroo cage was fucked up you ready the San Diego Zoo that's a hole yeah that's why I was there I was like man I would like to be an animal in this cage oh no we went down this serious fucking delay between what we're saying or saying we got it okay um yeah San Diego is the shit the way they have it is nice they have a big giant ass place that that makes sense what that's that's fucking expensive yeah you know but that's how it should be the places like LA Zoo just shouldn't exist because that's just wrong you go to the LA Zoo that's just depressing fuck but there is like the Columbus Zoo where I'm from is one of the biggest is Jack Han is from it and it's nice they may have just acres and acres and acres of land and they you know I don't know if they maybe throw out some goats once in a while for the Tigers or something Oh today just don't talk about it no no they don't do that they don't ever do that they do that in Iraq this video in Iraq of the lettered donkey loose and this is how they do it every day and the donkey's just walking around eating and they open up the gate and these Tigers come running out of the gate and just bitch-slapped that donkey to the ground and fucking jack them it's really kind of wild to see and it's really shocking the gee I've filmed it when they were in Iraq at the zoo it's shocking to see but that's really the way they're supposed to eat like though that's how you should do it if you're gonna feed animals you're gonna have wild animals you should have them eat what they normally eat man I mean like what's with this feeding fucking snakes frozen mice give them a fucking Mouse you know I mean that's what they're supposed to do where we're trying to like enforce our own ideas of morality and predation fucking monsters you know I mean like look a snake is a monster dude you know Tigers that's a monster those are all monsters yeah they're natural monsters they there's a whole natural cycle of things and to take them out of that there's a there was a kangaroo cage that was the most depressing thing because those kangaroos are just sitting there they didn't do shit there's laid human beings that could be considered monster so like a viewer if you put somebody in prison that's a mass murderer we're doing the same thing you know we're could let that mass murder go out on his way and just murder a shitload of people you know dumbass logic is that well I mean if you're saying like it you know I got Tigers a tiger or whatever in like a snake should kill its own prey we should you know do it what well y know we're feeding them killed prey we kill it first that's what's the most ridiculous thing is that we kill what they they eat first so that it's not as brutal for us somehow or another someone else kills it you buy it killed then you hated them that's ridiculous yeah that's not a mass murderer dude mass murderers are just fucked in the head they're not they're not killing for food it's a part of a natural cycle they're just nuts yeah you know then when you get a nutty person the problem is human consciousness is so more complex supposedly than animal consciousness because we have the ability to alter our environment so you can't have someone whose consciousness is haywire because that's that's what when you have like serial killers mass murders well you have as someone whose consciousness has just gone off the tracks and into the woods and you have just chaos and if a society is aware of itself it has to realize that there's certain issues are going to come up when you have crazy people running around killing your family and your friends so you got to kill them what you're supposed to do with someone like a mass murderer if you're absolutely convinced that's the problem really the problem is the court system the court system so fucking corrupt and so many times DA's and prosecutors just trying to get they're just kind of trying to get a guilty verdict and they don't give a fuck if someone is guilty or not there's many many many instances where cops of framed guys that were innocent people have gone to jail for years it turns out their DNA evidence they were framed I mean that's happened many many men that's the real fucking problem but if we could be absolutely sure that we knew that somebody was a mass murderer or a rapist or and anyone with no remorse who hurt other people and could hurt someone that you care you got to kill him why keep on out there's too many fucking people you know I mean look it's not like they're not going to die eventually anyway it's not like if you don't tell them you know they're gonna fuckin cure cancer and live forever no they're not going to do anything they're not a mass murderer is not going to contribute to society you know they're just not theirs nothing is going to nothing good is going to come out of that they should just line them up and like oh you need a new liver BAM you're on death row there should be no like you know time period and they're going to electrocute you they should just shoot you take all the parts that they think they can use your corneas or your livers yeah but that's an interesting topic because there was a thread on the board a message board on my website where people are talking about organs having a memory and they're doing all these people who have gotten transplants from people also they knew things that couldn't apprised was realness of that day of people they don't even know that you know it's like that yeah I mean I've heard of many things like that where people all sudden had cravings for certain types of foods and they had no idea that the protein is not just one instance and see the thing is about memory like we don't know where memory is stored exactly we don't I mean they know an incredible amount more than the average person about the way the human body works or much more than people knew a hundred years ago much more than you know even a decade ago but they don't know everything there's a lot of questions Matt first of all with human body your cells regenerate every 7 to 10 D I think it's 7 years so literally every cell in your body changes and becomes a new one but you are you're a new version of you every seven to ten years there yes there's they're not the same anymore so if that's the case we're the fuck of your memories because I have memories that are way more than seven years old you know so where the memory is stored if you have a completely new cell I mean are the memories like transferred back and forth between the cells when the new one is born is it born with the same memories I mean where's the memory where is it stored we don't fucking know the other idea is that the memories are stored in the neurons well if that's the case because the neurons are the only thing that stay the neurons are not you get the neurons you get or the neurons you get forever you don't get new ones you know they don't regenerate every seven years but the heart is filled with neurons you know it's like one one of the biggest clusters of neurons in the body it's like right up there with the brain and I think you know people who have had heart transplants I don't think it's that preposterous that they would have memories I don't think that's that preposterous at all I think it is and I think that these people that say that they're having dreams stuff they probably would have had that same exact dream with or without it why would you say that Brian they're talking about things that couldn't possibly know about people have this little beard really girl gave up the exact identity and location of the woman who of the man who murdered the the girl who gave her the heart do you know that story no but it started there are facts it's not far-fetched blood doesn't mean it's something they're good there's some things that I read that when it like that that it's kind of like to me is seeing UFOs it's either somebody that wants attention that's why that's just dumb in their goal no I had my arm transplant now I can I'm think having all these dreams with people I don't know it's Dajjal okay that's possible I know I know it's also possible well it's real it's the problem emphasis I'm telling with skepticism when comes to something that we don't understand that's the problems that you know you run the possibility of excluding something because it seems irrational but the reality is we don't have enough information to decide what's rational and what's irrational just the idea that you have memories at all is fucking nuts you know the idea that you can how about the idea that you can change people's memories you know they say that especially right after something shocking if you start talking to someone and introducing new ideas to them they don't have to remember the whole situation they'll change the whole way they remember things like have you ever thought of something with some way and then you go back and watch the video you're like god damn it wasn't like that at all I had a fucking I don't trust my memory that much I trust some things there's some things that I know that are recorded in there forever for real and no doubt about it there's some things because I've made sure that have kept that memory like I've had some pretty intense experiences where I made sure like I am going to make sure that I record this one right but other ones are a fucking blur man you know there's a lot of them that are blurry you know you look back on your your high school years like Jesus Christ it's like a slide shows and I barely remember any of it do you remember it like it's getting worse and worse I I'm actually pretty good with a lot of weird memories but then I the other day I was trying to think of somebody and that I actually hung out with for three years when I was a kid and don't remember his face at all came and put like my sister's like you don't remember him we hung out all the time yeah I remember him but I don't know have any idea what he looks like yeah I've had that happen to me before for sure that's fucking weird it is weird it's so weird I wonder where where all that shit goes up in smoke why is it that someone can pull it back though like someone will say something like oh yes and then all sudden boom the memory like blossoms in your mind like what is that it's like you're given CPR to the memories it's like they're almost dead yeah it's like just like a branch of the tree was hit somewhere and nerve of that memory was hit and it woke up that that section of memory or whatever yes I'm along those lines and what is that what the fuck is that Samantha hey Ted what happened oh did you get a spider on your face look oh shit that's a daddy longlegs how the fuck did that get on your house isn't here factor oh I'm not on I'm not uh no being Anthony this week it's not this week they made a mistake I'm there March 26 not February 26 it's the Friday Friday before the UFC next month I'm in Dallas this weekend I'm not in New York this weekend so I'm gonna be at the addison improv this weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday with my man Joey Diaz and Brian will be there as well if we get Brian drunk I might have to talk when to go on stage ha Brian is actually funny comedian he's done stand-up a couple of times he did in Atlanta he did it uh well Sanjaya did a couple boys you know I was going to try to go up on stage before this weekend just in case if if I get too drunk gonna stay on stage but I really it really hurts me to go back and spend three hours of my life for like five minutes in front of two people yeah the open mic nights it is a grind you know people ask me questions all the time like hey I'm thinking about doing comedy what's the best advice Mike man you got to be willing to put your whole life aside you got to be willing to you got to be one too especially if you have a job during the day you have a job during the day man your night time you now that's your social life it's going to be stand-up comedy you're going to be going to clubs and you're going to be performing and you have to do it all the time if you don't do it all the time you're gonna forget all your material the whatever comfort you gain on stage will be eroded very quickly you know it's a goddamn long ass grind man yeah I think about younger I'm totally begin to it's really hard to be an adult and waste that much time it is it is hard you know I did it I started out doing stand-up when I was 21 that's why I did it right after my 21st birthday and I was I had shit going on back you know I mean I was doing things I had you know I had a life sort of but it wasn't like I had a family right a mortgage or you know no obligations yeah I have no internet and no obligations you know so it wasn't it's hard when you have a girlfriend and you have a life and you have a wife and you have children and you have mortgage fuck man you know what I talk to do that are like 40 and they're thinking about doing comedy I'm like you know okay that's like say enough you know getting the brain surgery when we think about brain surgery not saying that comedies as hard as brain surgery because it's first of all it's not as it sounds difficult to remember all the things you need to remember with brain surgeries but it's it is just as difficult in a way because there's no real path I mean you can suck as a comedian you can't suck as a brain surgeon you're fucking going to jail so it's obviously a lot more discipline involved in brain surgery because you have to do it correctly but both are equally difficult to actually fucking do and put anything in this life is difficult if you if you're gonna really do it you mean just think about if you started tomorrow and you wanted to be a computer programmer you don't know shit about computers you just you're starting from scratch and you want to be a computer programmer fuck imagine the fucking work that's involved in that a lot of reading now you know it's a lot of reading nowadays like I mean I could pretty much teach myself some programming like looking at video you know how to type you know write about computers you know a lot of shit about computers you know a lot said about about code you know to it to a person that has no experience whatsoever and decides I want to take on a new career I want to be a computer programmer I want to code for video games good fucking luck man how about I want to create video game engines I just I don't know where I want to be the next John Carmack you're fucked man yeah you're fucked that shit will take forever anything that's worth doing takes fucking forever to get good at you know and comedy is no different comedy music is no different you know I often like look at people playing piano or playing guitar or something like that how cool would that be to be able to fucking jam on the fish but goddamn that's a lot of fucking time I've tried to learn that though if it's a it's a coordination thing for me though for that that's something I think you're just born with then you able to understand be able to coordinate each finger a certain wave well it's it's also cultivation it's also if you do things like with your fingers like that early on in life you know becomes much easier as we get older they say that um the army now is using they're using Xbox controllers for their drones because these fucking kids are so tasty right yeah yeah and they're encouraging people to play video games and it's just a matter of time before they start record recruiting like the baddest motherfuckers in video games like yeah they probably do yeah I mean like if you could play like war games with like a keyboard and a mouse like there's these dudes that play quake like professionally those motherfuckers can move that mouse cursor and put it on an object like instantaneously you know they know exactly where that cursor is going they play so much that when they move that Mouse the mouse and a keyboard is way more accurate than that joystick thing the gorge safe thing is kind of difficult to manipulate the like the toggles and like exactly where the crosshair goes but if you have a mouse you can put a mouse if you understand like how quick you know that all depends on you know everybody likes it different some people like high sensitivity some people like low sensitivity but the bottom line is once you get used to whatever it is you move the mouse that the cursor goes in certain directions they can put it like exactly where they want to instantly so it's not like you're in a helicopter you see the insurgents you learn move the crosshairs and get in line we have them in long grammar in line no it's quite bang I mean they could do it so fucking quick I mean that would be some crazy shit if you could have drones and they're like that guy fatality you know fatality is yeah it's like the baddest a motherfucking quake player ever this dude is just ridiculously accurate with this mount and a cool guy - I'm Adam very nice guy but if you've got that guy playing for your army and you had drones with missiles in it from that fucking guy holy shit you know yeah that's the future man welcome to the new it's pretty crazy how how videogames have exploded from something that used to be like like little ping pongs now people have like amazing video games on their phones yeah it's a credible man just look at what you can do your iphone playing you know all these different racing games and shit we what we working on the new UFC fight game right fuck it's amazing man when you watch some of the graphics and shit like they dive for knee bars they get triangles they throw head kicks and punches flying knees and shitty you see all this crazy shit all these different techniques they can do just like in real fighting and it's like it's so close to being like a video that you like an actual UFC fight that you can manipulate you know that the limit is in the controller I think what eventually is going to happen is you're going to have a goddamn suit on you're going to have a fucking suit on or you're just gonna have the wire plug in on your forehead and you're just going to think that can happen but Microsoft is very close to developing the whole system where you interact with the game what's it called natal it comes out like November or it might have got pushed fella na tal and it's pretty much just like a camera or something that sits on top of your TV and in reels your motion where is your motion yeah that's that's incredible because that's gonna be fucking cool imagine having like a UFC game where you could learn how to fight without actually fighting my comprar with that whole thing is I think maybe if I was a kid I would have loved it but when I'm playing a video game like I don't want to have to be doing this shit well you say that you say I doing what we right now in a week and yes like we is back it's this little thing and you're playing ping pong and it's sort of moves or what you want it to I I did a weak hard game once I was like this is not specific at all it's not rewarding yeah but something about having to like get up like I wanted you're a lazy fuck no that's all trust oh yeah if I was a kid it might have been better but like nowadays I want to play again I just want to sit there right it's so we ate I love you but that's depending on the graphics what if the graphics were like 3d fucking super dope Virtual Reality type shit and you had a virtual gun and you're running down a hallway shooting at all cuz it's shit like you have a gun in your hand and it reads it come on man I will be the shit and the actual running that you take play like maybe that would be the shit if you had a fucking warehouse like a virtual reality warehouse like you enter into the door you put on this helmet and it's just a flat layer tag yeah but but complete 3d virtual reality you know yeah and if you get close to the walls like a little light goes on you are getting close to the wall that would be his turn right you know yeah come on I just I've just gotten to a point where I give this Nintendo Wii shit just drives me crazy nobody is a boring man the Wii is like playing pool but there's no pool cue yeah you just go alike and there's no feedback feedback man like I wanna click a button and see a gun go off you know I want to click the mouse button and see the rocket you know take off right that this whole moving at arm through the air that's fucking weak yeah that's stupid there's a I forget what it was they just said the other data in the future that they're going to use like Google Maps and like Street View Google Maps and you're gonna be playing video games of like your Street you're going around into your house that's not I mean you should be able to find out if someone is playing like fucking doom on your street revving up your house right be like yeah hey just want you to know this you're like send you an email it should be like The Sims where it's like your house is the house in the video game it said like if you try to break in your house they're trying to break in your house you're right like everyone should have their own house in the video game yeah that would be kind of cool that would be course then you would know where everybody everyone lives and I start Hilde now a video game don't have access to Zoe well for like 24 hours you can run away I'm kind of shocked at virtual reality kind of hit like a they'd the technology never really developed the way I thought it was going to like you know you heard about that shit like way back in the 80s and I thought wow if there was movies based on that I was like I thought like wow never like um well so we're dagger I don't remember that what movie remember Total Recall they fucking make you could dream right yeah that shit's coming it's a total recall what was the one with the chick with the red hair in not totally they've already been able to take images and implant them in people's minds and they've been able to read images from people's minds like read what you're thinking about like you can look at something and the computer like there's some sort of sensors that they hook up to your brain and then it sends the image to a computer and it's it can tell what you're fucking looking at like that's nuts man because eventually I mean this is in very rudimentary stages of technology where they can only to pick out shapes and shit but eventually they're gonna be able to fucking see what you're seeing yeah that's it element is everyone yeah check it the red hair in film of the Bruce well as well yeah and they had like memories like movies they lug like memories in your head I was a crook this how badass was Chris Tucker in that meeting ever he was that crazy alien never lawnmower man I was a good movie too that's another nutty movie but a retard that went crazy right great put up computer in his brain right yeah another Stephen King book Stephen King I'll know it's strange days was it strange days was another virtual reality something crazy ass I think it was strange Danny's house in constantly strange days let's go in here just so that I can't wait for strange days we come true that's what it was it was strange buzzes yeah that was Leon mom it's angela bassett right yes you forever be Tina Turner sorry yeah I love do any other movies uncle bought your Tina Turner um was gonna say oh this fucking miss Beverly Hills chair about this now another one of these beauty pageant chicks came out saying that she doesn't believe the gays should be married and she you know she quoted the vitta contestant saying that the you know the Bible says that it's some stupid quote like any man who lays down with a man as if you know the same way lays down with a woman it's an abomination should be put to death so she came on said that gays should be put to death look she's supporting the Old Testament which by the way I mean whatever you fucking want to believe about religion that's all well good you know who they who knows if God is real who knows I mean it could be that you know the Bible is completely ridiculous because God wants things confusing who knows but it gets a certain point when you read certain things and gotta go alright every people are full of shit and there was no internet back then it's not like you know there was a copy of the the the Bible on Wikipedia and people kept altering it but everybody was like nah that's not what it says and they went back and changed it you know they didn't the Old Testament they didn't even write that fuckin thing down til I got thousand years it was just stories you know and the idea that those stories you can't tell I can't tell story to him and he tells it to his girlfriend his girlfriend writes it in her blog and it's the same story it'll be fucked up for sure I can't tell you how many times like someone has gone to one of my gigs and I've said something and then a guy like will quote on Twitter like I'll do that was so funny last night when you said this about that I'm like Tim I didn't say that like you're saying something fucked up what I said was a lot nicer you know but when when you realize like that memories are so fucking there's no way there's no way you could be that accurate over a thousand years or people talking about it and then on top of it the original of the Old Testament Bible was written in ancient Hebrew and to this day they only know three out of four words in ancient Hebrew 25% of the words they don't have a clue as to what they mean not only that letters and numbers were the same thing back then there were no numbers so the letter A was also the number one so there was like numerical value in words like the word love in the word God they have the same numerical value in ancient Hebrew but as soon as they translated that to Latin and Greek that shit was all gone like shit was all lost so for this dumb bitch to sit and think that God wants people to put put the death of their Gailey this is what the the Miss Beverly Hills this is a new one new Miss California in California supposed to be so liberal it ain't miss Texas do you know who cariann pants she is or whatever name is she's from Celebrity Rehab Anish Anish she was the one that had the threesome with a guy from Grey's Anatomy anyways on this show celebrity Bree she you just want to strangle her I think it's almost with these like pageant people cuz I know a couple of these girls that do the pageants and stuff like that they're fucked up in their head you know they've been doing it all their life these little kids have grown up remember last time not last time I went to Dallas for the time before when there was that little girl pageant right going on at the hotel yes remember that yeah that was scariest that was the weirdest fucking thing ever we're hanging out the hotel and there's all these little girls I mean little like six yeah yeah six years old with high heels and makeup on with their hair done and jewelry and dresses and you're like what the fuck is going on here that shit is an abomination all right that is a fucking that is a travesty I think someone was something wrong in the elevator mm elevator with two of them and yeah I looked at her and I'm like oh my god they're resting looks like it they were they can finger themselves in front of you uh something's not right there sometimes my daughter will play with her pussy just I don't know what I don't wanna say this just true I mean you you would too if you had one but something the other day she was lying there and she had her little feet up in the air she's rocking back and forth and she's two hands it just grabs it you know and uh I don't know what to say like what do you say that you go don't do that you can't tell her not to do that that's you know you don't want to suppress or get her crazy yes I don't want her to be like like in kindergarten going hey everybody they all do it anyway dude I Got News for you they all do it don't remember doing weird shit with kids when you were little I played doctor me and my friend play doctor with all the girls in our neighborhood and I remember the only time I remember the most we had three girls lined up and we were like okay we're going to be putting pencils in your vagina's take off oh yes I took off other pants and we just went back to each one and we pulled out and smell it and goes oh absolutely fuck oh fuck but we were all like fine you can give this girl's lead poisoning I know they might be retarded now because you they're all on my facebook too so hopefully they're not watching one you should know but you should ask them all questions does anybody remember anything about pencils you remember me putting a thing so in your card but this will this saw this beauty pageant thing that we saw at the hotel it was dark I mean it was really dark there's all these weirdo fucking religious people with their kids dressed like whores it made no fucking sense I mean no sense because they were they were it was on we were there on a Sunday and they were talking about church there was all this church talk and you got your girl dressed as a fucking prostitute here's a six-year-old dressed as a prostitute and you're talking about church they had high-heeled shoes on I mean like this high which the only reason why shoes have heels like that and so that woman's legs look longer so that guys think about them when they're pushing these long legs back and fucking the shit out of you that's what that's for those that long leg thing why do you think what do you think that's there for you sacrificing how you can walk how about that just so that men want to fuck you more than we already do which is wait women arguing I had sex with a girl that has her shoes on like high heels and everybody know what is up with that though that's just porno stuff let's predict I'm sure it's somewhere in my life you know summer I was not you know taking everything off that's possible but that someone would like that but the whole I don't like them in the first place I made I think it was they're ugly and it seems to me like you're doing something stupid right you know I don't want to be with like you're you're getting tricked and you don't need to do it for me like you know like my life always want to wear these high heels when she leaves the house like okay if you want to do that that's all good but to me it seems like you can't walk right I'd rather you wear tennis shoes the women love them man they love shoes they what they love how they look they love it's like how does love cars you know you know like you see like a 69 Mustang or something like that and you go whoa and you like pull up to a dude look at that motherfucker you know I'm saying like there's something that men have like women can go wow that's a pretty car but it's not the same as how a dude looks at a car well for girls the shoe thing is just they really fucking love shoes man they like makeup and shoes it looks like opposite sides of the body because you're so ashamed of the middle they can bleed that's gross look up here my eyes are yellow my lashes your unnaturally long yeah it's probably something like eyelids just so long amazing look how long my legs are and where do they go - I don't look up there look at my naughty well the the done you know I mean that's one thing if you're a woman you know if you're a grown woman that's what you like and you know what the fuck ever who gives a shit you wanna go pierce your balls go do it who gives a shit but for little kids that's not that's not cool man to have a six-year-old dress I go home now and that's just urban it is disturbing it felt very wrong you know and you know their whole JonBenet Ramsey case man that that shit disturbed you don't know that in that case yeah they don't know we're gonna find out the mother dad still alive I believe the moms they all died maybe the dad's dead too possible anybody know Twitterverse yeah Twitter versa is not cool and I agree you know I heels are just as much an establishment as a male's tie is both are silly that's true that's true Bron shizer goddamn this Twitter shit goes too fast you think wrong either um yeah you know you're absolutely right I think ties are completely ridiculous I didn't even I haven't worn a tie in a long I did a documentary recently on DMT and I had a wear a tie because I played like a rod sterling type narrator it's a really interesting documentary on DMT it'll be out sometime this spring but I had to wear a tie I had no idea how to tie this fucking thing I had no idea the last time I wore a tie was my my first album grabbed acting off the wall okay my first album in 1999 you know just as a goof one of the things I always said that I love about being a comedian is that you don't have to wear a fucking tie and so just my first CD for whatever reason I just thought it would be funny if I wore a tie huh doesn't make any sense just look strange I'd wear tie for like ten years every day suck yeah if you want to like work in businessman it's like there's an agreement like everyone has to know that you are willing to wear something completely ridiculous because you're following by the very obvious rules of behavior it's going to be really easy to predict what you're doing that's what people like like I'm a gentleman you know like as a gentleman well I feel this I'm a gentleman you've got it's tie on hello gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen you know it's like there's this like disagreement that you're not going to get too crazy you're not gonna like my dr. Phil impression you know a lot of my shoes are shining they're very slippery I'm not chasing after anybody you know it's like there's something to that there's something to this this silly outfit that you wear that's uncomfortable like if people started doing business and they had like rash guards on like like row rash guards on like they're ready to go do jiu-jitsu shit you know you know like why why would that be bad but it is bad you know you can't have like board shorts and you know they're you know running shoes on and you look like you look ready to fucking pounce on people that nobody wants that in business you can't when you go to business you have to be dressed uncomfortable your button has to be all the way up here you know it's fucking ridiculous you know I hate doom I remember I used to work at this architect firm for my stepfather and this was when I was big into acid and stuff like that so every time I would come to work I was either hungover uh still tripping on acid then you know or something like I mean it was such a boring job that it was acceptable because all what I had to do is make copies of architect plans do you think you wrote you fucked up your brain on acid do you think you have fucked up your brain uh um no no I I think I think if when I was doing it I was there any point that like you know you ever heard Howard Stern talk about his acid trip no Howard Stern talked about it on the radio and I guess he did like a giant dose of acid like way too much and he was like all fucked up for a long time like he was hearing voices and it was just like a like a real psychotic episode and you know that's a really that's a thing about psychedelics so you got to make sure you don't fuck around do too much like Dennis McKenna had experience like that to dennis mckenna with who's terence mckenna's brother they're both famous Psychonauts firm psychedelic pioneers in the 70s they went to Brazil and he took like way too much mushrooms and he lost his mind for like two weeks like he couldn't communicate with people you know and the last time I did DMT I was fucking wacked out for like two solid weeks not totally you wouldn't guess if you were talking to me I was totally normal I did shows the shows went great I went to work I did fear fair did that went great you know nothing nothing got fucked up in my but my head was like I felt very you know you feel like your consciousness is like in a foundation your consciousness is like you know mmm it's like boom solid this is me good morning you wake up in the morning hi honey kiss your girlfriend brush your teeth this is fuckin solid when I did the DMT my consciousness was like a little tiny raft in a fucked up ocean it's like you know like nothing seemed like I kept having these ideas that cars were going to come launching themselves over the boundaries and hit my car while I was driving and I'm like I'm like why my thinking is I'm like what is this about it and then I realized that what it was was that these are this idea of worrying about possible disasters was my egos way of regaining ground and letting me know that it has to have a certain amount of real estate in reality and that if you want to do crazy crazy psychedelics and go into other dimensions communicate with entities and and reevaluate you know your whole position in the world and then humankind's position with each other that's all well and good but there's some real shit in the world that the ego has to be there for and the ego was like sending me a message um dude what if a fucking car launches itself back you better be fucking paying attention like there was a certain amount of love where it was such a mind-blowing experience that there was like a wrestling match going on in my head between my ego and between these new information and accepting all this new information from the psychedelic trip and incorporating it into the way I look at everyday life you know and like you know you think about one who's like a real like a shaman you know they're living in the jungle and they're all at peace in the world they're not calling people douche bags on the internet you know there's a certain amount of enlightenment that if you achieve it it's going to make it very hard for you to function in the regular world and I think that's one of the most important things about psychedelic trips like there's a lot of cripples in the psychedelic world and then the weed world too there's a lot of people that they're they're so into these experiences that they can't incorporate it into their everyday life and they're almost crippled in their everyday life because of it and no psychedelic experience is worth anything unless you can take what you've learned from it and enhance regular life enhance your your communication with people your relationships with people you know enhance the way you look at the world enhance your career path you know the kind of friends you hang around unless it can enhance you the reality is we live in this world for eight hours a day or 12 hours a day or however long you're awake this world this shit this concrete world is real and you have to manage your way through this and psychedelic drugs make it very difficult to do that if you want to have a regular job I think second toe it's what's the main thing with psychedelics is it opens up a door and like like in the past like I've been offered DMT but I won't do it because I like when I first did mushrooms that opened up to a door of things I never thought of or saw before and it's never going to go away it didn't damage my head but now that I know that exists I know it's there and so when acid did the same thing but there's a point where I have to go okay is this door does this door need to be open is this anything positive with this door being open and some drugs were like that for me because like salvia was the closest to the point where I was like okay that is a scary door that I opened up that just pretty much made everything seem fake like like it was like this world it's fake everything's fake I know that's not true but it opened up that door where I'm like okay that's almost too much of a door I shouldn't have opened up that door I'm never going to get back that that thought of not knowing that was there I think that's pretty more pretty much saying the same thing like it may if you can't bring it back and incorporate it into your everyday life and like sometimes you open up doors like the fuck am I gonna do with this right in your everyday life is just whacked out some people like going back to that world so much though and that's where it gets fucking well you know what I think most of those people their real world is not so hot right you know and that's one of the reasons why it becomes an escape you know and I don't think it should be an escape I don't think you should ever escape reality you're here this is this is life you know there's the life can be a magical fucking intense fantastic experience if you manage it correctly but if you just want to escape all the time I've got to think that you're probably fucking up in this life and it's that's imbalanced you know people that always want to go and it's like like the same thing with like video games like remember I told you about this dude there's this Duty used to be a manager at the Comedy Store that was addicted to EverQuest just completely addicted 8 10 12 hours a day lost everything lost his job lost his life he just was so pale you would see him he was so pale looked like he never saw sunlight like he would order in food and never leave the fucking house for days and he came down to copy storm one night and he goes it's so weird I'm so good at making money in my online life and so bad in my real life like he was starting to realize that like he's a fucking loser in this life because he's he's excited and puts all of his passion and energy into this other life but that's just really because this other life is a new and exciting thing you know a new and artificial thing and he can control it from his computer without dealing with emotions and dealing with all the you know the fears and anxieties that the real world presents but the reality is if we live life in a computer screen and we were offered the real world as a video game the real world would be so much more fantastic you know we just don't think of it as being fantastic because we're so goddamn used to it you know if we lived life in a computer and a computer monitor and that's how you were when you were born and then one day someone said you know hey we've developed this new game that allows you to go outside and you go outside you actually get laid and you can go and have a real drink and you feel it you do a real shot of Jack Daniels we go holy shit this is you'll I can't believe it you know you go get laid for real and you drive a car for real you'd be like to the real world and stuff fucking shit you would never want to play video games the reason why we want to play video games is because it's a world that we can control completely independent from all the the like the pros and cons of this this solid world completely independent of the emotions and the insecurities and all the shit that we all experience but we don't like but the reason why we experience insecurities and anxiety and angry these are all like little chemical signals to guide you through towards a proper life like what I found in life most importantly more than anything is the one the way that I'm the most happiest is if I'm putting out positive energy I'm putting out positive energy to people to friends positive energy onstage positive energy with my writing my work with with anything I'm doing it's all friendly and positive and happy and if you do that you know you can you can have a fucking fantastic life the problem is it's just difficult to do it's hard to keep your shit together it's hard not to lose your temper it's hard not to you know be obsessed with something and get sidetracked and that's what like gambling addictions and masturbation addictions and all that shit that's it that's all about it's like you're trying to distract yourselves from from all the pain of being a human you know I mean I think fucking 100s Thompson had a quote like that like man making himself a beast to get away from the pain of being a man I forget exactly what the quote was but there was something along those lines like we distract the shit of ourselves because the game of life is fucking hard to do just like a video games hard to do you know remember like back when I used to play quake like all the time I played quake like hours and hours a day and you and I played quake on line we played against each other and like you can tell the difference between someone who's playing all the time because you you get really good at it you know you know where the Rockets are gonna go and I was sticking railguns up your ass and electric I think you 120 games and I won one yeah maybe not horribly not fair and like and believe me there's dudes online that would do that to me just rape me why because they had put so much time in this fucking crazy game they would get good at it but since you hadn't put time how frustrating was it so how zero she didn't want to play right now I'm going to shut it off that's exactly the same as life if you get good at life of the game then it's fun as fuck it's awesome you know if you're Leonardo DiCaprio life must be the shit you know I'm saying he starred in movies driving a Ferrari Kang mining for models well it he's got a gigantic fucking mansion he's a movie it must be so fun for him but not everybody could be Leonardo DiCaprio so if you're a fucking garbage man who's you know came home and his wife is fucking the the newspaper guy you know that's that's not a fun life that's that's that's just like a guy who's not good at quake getting murdered in a game it's not fun man so they playing pool if you're good like I play pool I love pool up I get obsessed with it but I have a friend my friend max Everly he's a professional and he's a top professional I mean he's capable of winning when he's in stroke capable of winning any tournament in the world I mean he's really fucking good and when I play against him sometimes it's so frustrating and I played pretty good like for a regular person I played good but for like a pro not even fucking close so when I play max it's just getting my ass handed to me it's just getting fucked the only time it's fun is when we play on a really really tight table so occasionally he misses and I'm like oh I get to shoot you know so he's much better at that game just given my handicap is I'm sorry well we know we just don't play for anything it's good for me it's good for me because you get used to playing against a guy like that it's not as fun as playing against a guy who's like your speed but it's really good for your game because it makes sure that you capitalize on every mistake sometimes you play a guy who's not as good as you and you're like I don't worry about this because if I miss this guy's gonna miss and I'll have another shot but with max every time you miss you're like fuck I better no I better sit down for a while mmm anyway I believe that the Hunter s quote is actually from Samuel Johnson an English author thank you very much sir I thought it was an honour toxic um Thank You CJ McElhinney Nicolini it's about what about words names like Schwarzenegger how the fuck did that ever ever get through like what what culture ran out of sounds people that have string together something nutty like that people that like to write in cursive this is gonna be the best cursive writing I've ever seen like manuscripts they used to write it on a page linear lines in the paper they just had paper right and they would write it exactly have you ever heard the Voynich manuscript the point one is Voynich manuscript I don't know if I'm saying it right is this ancient manuscript that was found to hundreds hundreds of years old and they have no fucking idea what it says they don't know the language however know anything about it they don't know if it's just nonsense if some guy was just practicing scribble but it's like really long there's a yeah and there's consistency and how it's written but did they can't decode it they've had like top encryption experts and it's like it's very divided like some people believe it's a hoax and some people believe that it's some fucking lost language and some people think that it's gloss like glossolalia like when someone talks in tongues and that they just went into a fucking trance is some retard with a pen no because that's got really good writing it's got diagrams in it and really good really good up illustrations rather and diagrams it's like yeah it's really complicated you know and they found that up that temple and Turkey that is seven thousand years older than the pyramids very complex stone temple carved out of stone shit and now they have to like rewrite like human history because like seven thousand years before Egypt is 9,000 10,000 BC and ten thousand BC they were already like had temples and were worshipping shit like that throws a monkey wrench crank into the whole gears of of this the idea of cultural evolution you know this has been this guy John Anthony West John Anthony West looked that up on Google because this guy's fascinating he's got an awesome DVD series called magical Egypt and this guy is obsessed with Egypt he spent his entire life studying Egypt and he believes that the Egyptian culture goes back way way way before the established time lines like the established time lines for Egyptian cultures like 2500 BC that's when they think like the pyramids were built and then the culture goes back a little bit before that but not much and he thinks it goes back like 35,000 years he thinks that people have been around way way longer and that there was some big break somewhere along the line like probably some sort of a natural cataclysmic disaster like a meteor impact or something like that you know and it could be you know 10,000 15,000 years ago like they don't know when it was but they think that there was like an advanced culture and then boom it got fucked up and then culture rebuilds and society rebuilds and then what's left is like they're living in this shit that was made thousands and thousands of years ago and they tried to imitate it and recreate it and they can't and he believes that that's what it is like these these fucked up pyramids that they have in Egypt it's not that these pyramids were like the first pyramids he thinks much much more likely these pyramids were probably like people words like trying to duplicate other shit duplicate shit that was already there you know they believe that that's why don't actually that's not his theory that's someone else's theory his theory is one of the things about the Sphinx they brought in geologists and the geologists have like documented the erosion and the Sphinx and they say that's water erosion the thousands of years of rainfall have cut deep fissures in the whole enclosure with the Sphinx's and the problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was like 7,000 9,000 BC so that would mean that the the pyramids or the Sphinx rather would have to be like seven thousand years older than the established timeline and so of course none of the the Egyptologists like the guys have been teaching forever that the pyramids and the Sphinx all that was built about 2500 BC they never want they don't want to accept it they go where's the evidence for this culture like it's right there man there's like an rainfall for thousands of years of created this and geologists are universal about that they there's no one who's disputing it the geologists are all saying he's got hundred this guy Ron Jacques who's a professor at Boston University has got over a hundred professional uh professors and geologists too off on the fact that this is undoubtably water erosion which completely changes the timeline for when the the the Sphinx was built and there's a bunch of that shit going on in Egypt they believe that it's like probably you know maybe even thirty thousand years old there's a mass extinction took place on the earth somewhere around ten thousand years ago and that's when the woolly mammoths died instantaneously that's when the saber-tooth Tigers died Noah's Ark now this before them but the the like ten thousand years ago North America like half of North America was under a mile-high sheet of ice like there was an ice age going on and something killed it and ended it like instantaneously and they don't know what it was and it's very very likely that it was a fucking natural disaster it's very likely that it was a fucking meteor impact at some well what happened that guys are distracting the shit out of me son don't look at me well don't fucking have a monitor open in front of me dude surfing he's not even pay attention we do one-week podcast this dude is so addicted to the Internet he can't even talk for one week I've heard you talk before you've heard me talk about this is online dude there's 675 people that have not heard this story don't look at me shut up faggot anyway I think people been around way longer I think it's much more likely that it just ridiculous that people still don't believe in and how long this world's been around you know what I mean Oh like people have believed the Earth's 10th unusual it just drives me weary lazy well you know that's a not monster number more than 50% of America according to a Gallup poll which is not the same because here's the thing about polls you can't say like according to a recent poll 50% of Americans believe this because no no according to your recent poll 50% of Americans who are fucking retarded enough to answer your poll believe in I that that's the reality of that polls are never representative of anybody intelligent because you can't get me to answer a fucking poll you can't get you you got shit to do don't you have a hobby you hear somebody calls you may I have five minutes your time no that's for like old ladies who have no friends that's what that is look at this or I'm fucking super baked I just don't want to hang up in the person I'm like um okay five minutes okay yeah I'm trying to be nice but the reality is polls polls represent retards you know you're you're fucking you're a dollar you're answering poles goddamn it the only time I do a poll is if I think I'm going to win something if I answer twenty percent of Americans can't find the United States on a globe is that true Joe beef don't be lyin Joe be his line Joe beef could you make that shit up solar flares up in 2012 bro we're crossing the Galactic equator then you know what you know there's a guy which is it Richard Tyson is that his name as a what is that guy's name the astronomer really Neil Tyson Neil Tyson very very intelligent guy and I really like listened to him talk and one of the things he said about this whole crossing the aquatic whatever what is it what is the exact the way that's kind go lactic equator I think that's what this guy said um yeah yeah like we're crossing through the center of the galaxy like we were everything's in line on December 21st 2012 you know what he says he says that happens all the time it says he says that like that like line up with the center of the galaxy that's doesn't doesn't happen then because it happens all the time and nothing happens so who knows if he's right or if he's one of those guys it's like super skeptical but I think what's much more likely he's going to happen in 2012 is something technological something technological some crazy invention you know like having to be anything it could be that - it could be that 2012 what really happens is nothing happens and then people realize oh we have to actually manage this life we can't just rely on fucking aliens landing I was more scared about 2000 just because if that made sense with all the computers planes dropping from the sky I was scared too I didn't um I did not do a gig right mm I stayed home yeah I thought for sure there was at least gonna be something small when mm isn't it crazy that's 10 years ago no that is just fucking flying it's crazy fast it's weird it almost feels like it's quicker every year and everybody says that but what if time really is quicker what if like clocks are moving quicker too we just can't really establish it because that wouldn't make sense because what about digital clocks no no well they all exist in in this fucking dimension maybe this dimension is moving quicker units of timer you know almost I think we're forgetting more so it feels like we're forgetting more of the day because we have more information yeah maybe right thoughts on the zeitgeist movement you know what I think about zeitgeist and all that stuff there's a lot of zeitgeist that's that's poorly researched like the stuff that he said about Mithra and different different gods and stuff that they're just like Jesus law that's really poorly researched and incorrect and been proven wrong there's a website that says I think it's it's common about how debunking zeitgeist or something like that I forget what the with the website is titled but I mean the guy just breaks down all the errors that the dude who made the movie made and this is you know he's quoting references and showing very clearly that uh the zeitgeist guys have made some big problem big big fuck-ups and I think his whole the how sure he is that's September 11th was was designed and that you know the and perpetrated by the US government and that Tower 1 and Tower 2 fell because they were they were detonated like you're sure that you know look no one's sure that that's crazy you can't to freezable all this talk of freefall speed and the towers fell at freefall speed yeah they fell pretty fucking fast but that's what happens when shit falls apart it falls apart pretty fucking fast especially shit that's super heavy and gigantic and all that weight is on and it's all just collapsing who the fuck knows what happens when you build a building that way and you fly a fucking giant plane filled with jet fuel into it the only way to really know I mean you can have theories the only way to really know is to build another building and fly another jet into it exactly the same way and see what happens and if it falls down exactly like that one then the arguments pretty much over and if it doesn't then you have to go well okay well what was inside the building did it all burn the same was uh was it exactly constructed the same you know and you got to try it again I mean you have to fucking have more than two buildings to go on and everybody's like buildings have never fallen before and look the government does some nasty evil shit that is absolutely a fact but you don't know you don't know what happened there and to say that you know is just as bad as people who blindly trust in the US government the thing that question that I have a big question about when it comes to timur xi is tower seven if you watch video online there's video of tower seven falling and it falls just like a controlled demolition I mean it just go straight down wish all at once and it's it's really crazy to watch man you know because like it implodes from the basement down and every level falls apart including like Jets of energy like spraying out of windows like there's blasts I mean maybe that could be because it's collapsed and I mean that's a whole floor of air being right through the wind but the problem is it all falls the exact same time and that building wasn't even hit by a plane it was on fire and it had a hole in it from like debris and stuff and I could see it falling down but there was a hole in one corner in the hole if it's a hole there and the building's gonna collapse wouldn't it collapse towards the hole I mean does that make sense maybe it also makes that since the whole pop standing on a pop-can thing where if you stand on a pop can you knock a little bit off the side it's not you're not falling over you're going straight down to the weight you know meaning it's so heavy even if there's a hole on it it don't matter it's it's going straight down mm-hmm that's maybe maybe I I think with all that shit I'm like yeah I'm glad there's people that freaked out about and care about it cuz without them you know the government's going to get away with a bunch of shit but in my opinion you know I don't care if the government did it fuck they did it you know I'm still waking up eating this cereal yeah well you that is one thing you have to consider I mean it's like you you you mean how is this gonna help you how are you gonna help you in your life I know if you get obsessed with this yeah looks much here's the bottom line people to think the government wouldn't kill people and nobody died seven supposedly but the thank you so much people think the government would not kill people this is all you need to know for sure they start wars than don't need to be started that's a hundred percent fact for sure the Gulf of Tonkin incident that got us into the Vietnam War that was a fake fuckin attack on Americans they faked it and they faked it made this big deal about it so that everybody would get fired up and realize we have to go to Vietnam that's fact this is history you know and the fact that they wrote up a thing called Operation Northwoods the Northwoods document and the Northwoods document was they were planning attacks on Americans and they were gonna this is in 1962 and they were going this is signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff by the way and vetoed by Kennedy they were going to attack Guantanamo Bay they were going to lob grenades into mortars into Guantanamo Bay and possibly kill American soldiers they were going to blow up a jet liner and blame it on the Cubans and they were going to tell Americans we have to go to war with Cuba well people were going to fucking die in that war for sure and people are going to die in a war that Americans didn't want and so they decided to do what's called a false flag and make attacks on Americans and blame it on the Cubans and that's a fact they're willing to kill people and only 3,000 people died in September 11th for sure that's a lot of people I'm not making light of it but in comparison to how many people have died in Iraq during the fucking war they're talking about like a million civilians have died in Iraq since the invasion a million I mean that's fuckin crook as eighty yeah millions people died from that earthquake in Haiti but that we didn't have an HD video fuckin you know seeing it brought us yeah but we didn't we're not responsible for that no I mean well I know I know I know but I think the reasons that they're willing to kill people a I think the reason why we're focused on it though it's just because of that that we all watched it live where if you know if we saw these people in a racket shot live on TV would probably be just as big as 9/11 you know well I don't know about that you know I think I think well I think the idea is that was an attack on American soil I mean that's really well why was such a big deal and I mean I remember how everybody gets so patriotic after hours do you remember after September 11th everybody had fucking American in their car remember that weird feeling yeah we're strong Ohio back then right right did they have him in Ohio oh yeah his crazy bag anyway I left I went to work one day I don't think I was doing fear factor at the time I might have been but I was driving down down the street near my house and
